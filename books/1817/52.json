You’ll be there with her and for her if she starts to freak out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She hasn’t been on a boat yet and I’m a little scared about how she’s going to react when we get ready to spread Denny’s ashes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s a lot stronger now than she was when you first met her. I’ve seen an incredible change in her. Give her some credit; she’ll be just fine. And if not, you’ll know how to help her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked across the plane at my parents fussing over Brayden. “Look at them,” I said. “They are so happy to have Brayden around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Julia laughed. “Mom said she’s babysitting full-time when I go back to work. I can’t wait to see Mason and Landon again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know they’re excited to us. I talked to Mason about Jacob and he said if things work out with them moving to Cali, then he’ll be more than happy to visit with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia walked over and sat down with us. “You should see Jake and Jacob playing that game. They’re crazy good at it.” She laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my arm around her and kissed her head. “I love you, baby,” I said as worry consumed me the closer we got to California.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason and Landon had a car waiting for us at the airport. As soon as we stepped off the plane, Mason yelled, “Oh my God, give me that baby!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia handed Brayden over to him and the rest of us didn’t exist. “What about me, Uncle Mason? I was your baby, remember?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pfft, Collin. You’re a man now. I’ll shower you and the princess when I’m done with this little prince.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Landon hugged us all and I introduced him to Amelia, Diana, and Jacob. We all got into the limo and drove to the house. The housekeeper, Louise, a short woman with short black hair, took care of the house when no one was staying there. I’d known her since I was little. We usually traveled to California three to four times a year to check on the art gallery and to visit friends. It was mostly when Julia and I were on break from school. The last time I was here was right before Hailey and I broke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My babies,” Louise said as we walked up the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Louise.” I smiled as I hugged her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s this? This isn’t Hailey?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Louise. Hailey and I haven’t been together in almost a year. This is Amelia and she’s the love of my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouise held out her arms to Amelia. “If you make him happy, then welcome to the family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” Amelia smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went inside the house and I started to take our bags up to our room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahem,” Julia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I asked as I stopped on the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you two sharing a room?” She smiled. “Because I do believe that when Jake and I went to Aspen with the family for Thanksgiving, Daddy wouldn’t allow us to share a room because we weren’t married.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really, Julia? Because I remember that you were only eighteen years old. Wait a minute. I seem to remember Jake sneaking into your room every night after Mom and Dad went to bed. So you did share a room.” I winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“JULIA ROSE!” my dad said rather loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to kill you, Collin!” she yelled as she chased me up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard my mom laugh. “That’s not funny, Ellery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia tried to tackle me on the bed and then I heard Brayden crying. “Your baby is crying. Shouldn’t you go and see what’s wrong?” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll get you back, little brother. When you least expect it.” She smiled as she walked out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down on the bed, trying to catch my breath, and Amelia lay down on her back next to me. “You and Julia have such an awesome relationship. It reminds me of the relationship I had with my sister. God, do I miss her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you do, baby,” I said as I leaned over and kissed her. “Come on; let’s go downstairs and see what’s going on.” I grabbed her hand and helped her up from the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went into the kitchen with the other women and I stepped outside in the back. I looked straight ahead at the water and watched a boat go by. We were set to spread Denny’s ashes in a few days and I had an idea that would possibly help Amelia feel more comfortable on the boat. I’d put my plan in motion tomorrow. Tonight, I just wanted to spend every minute I could with my girl and my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are we going?” Amelia asked with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll see,” I said as I drove down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feared the reaction I was going to get when we arrived at our destination. I didn’t know what she’d do. I pulled into the parking lot and she looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are we here at the marina?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to show you something,” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The only thing here is boats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her and, when she looked at me, I saw the fear in her eyes. Not only did I see fear, I swore I saw a touch of hate. I parked the car and, when I opened the door to get out, Amelia said, “I’m not getting out of this car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amelia, please, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“NO!” she spat as she folded her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. Then you can sit in the car. But I’m going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out and shut the door behind me. I began walking towards the dock of the marina, hoping she’d change her mind. She didn’t. I sat down on one of the docks that was close to the parking lot. Maybe this was a mistake. Or maybe not. Even if it was her decision never to get on a boat again, decisions are made to be changed. I sat there for two hours and thought about Amelia and how maybe I was the one being unfair. What it came down to was that I needed to respect her choice. It was her choice not to get on a boat. I couldn’t force her to do something that she was so against. Even though taking her in the water worked the first time, this was different. I took in a deep breath and began to get up, when I heard a voice behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you want to show me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and stared at her before I took hold of her hand. “It’s over this way,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI led her to the sailboat that I had rented for the day and she stood on dock and stared at it. “You told me how much you once loved boats and how you felt at peace on the open water. I want to give that back to you, Amelia. I don’t want you to fear anything anymore.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-52.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
