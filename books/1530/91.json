She vanished completely when in shadows. He willed her to be safe, but also to move faster. His gaze fluttered between storm and woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha appeared from below, hurrying to join them, having lost sight of Safia from his post below. His eyes glistened, full of hope, terror, and as much as Painter didn’t want to see it, love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter swung his attention back to the cavern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia was almost to the sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C’mon…” Omaha moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an emotion shared by all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia gently walked down the stairs. She had to step with care. The passage of the iron sphere had crushed its way through. Loose glass littered the steps. Cuts pierced her heel and toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored the pain, keeping calm, breathing through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead the iron sphere appeared. Its surface glowed with an azure blue aura. She stepped up and studied the obstruction: a fallen section of wall. The ball had to be rolled two feet to the left, and it would continue its plummet. She glanced the rest of the way down. It was a clear shot to the lake. There were no other tumbles to block the sphere’s path a second time. All she had to do was shift it over. Though heavy, it was a perfect sphere. One good shove and it would roll clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved next to it, set her legs, raised her palms, took another cleansing breath, and shoved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe electrical shock from the charged iron shot into her, arcing over her body and out her toes. She spasmed, neck thrown back, bones on fire. Her momentum and convulsive jerk shoved the sphere away, rolling it free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as her body broke contact, a final crack of energy snapped her like a whip. She was flung backward, hard. Her head hit the wall behind her. The world went dark, and she fell into nothingness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafia…!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha could not breathe. He had seen the brilliant arc of energy and watched her be tossed aside like a rag doll. She landed in crumpled pile, no longer ethereal, grounded. She was not moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnconscious, electrocuted, or dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter grabbed his arm. “Where the hell do you think you’re going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to get to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers tightened on his arm. “The storm will kill you within two steps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKara joined him. “Omaha…Painter’s right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra stood by the rail, watching everything through her damned scopes. “As long as she doesn’t move, she shouldn’t attract the bolts. I’m not sure that’s a great place to be when the sphere hits the lake, though. Out in the open like that.” Omaha saw that the sphere was almost to the lake. Beyond, the titanic forces swirled. An hourglass hung in the center of the vast cavern. A tornado of charge coming down to meet a rising spout of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the ball rolled toward it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning bolts chased the sphere, stabbing at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to try!” Omaha said, and ripped away. He sprinted down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter followed at his heels. “Goddamnit, Omaha! Don’t throw your life away!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha landed. “It’s my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid to the entryway, dropping onto his rear, skidding. He yanked off his boots. His left ankle, sprained, protested the rough treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter frowned at his actions. “It’s not just your life. Safia loves you. If you truly care about her, don’t do this.” Omaha pulled off his socks. “I’m not throwing my life away.” He crawled on his knees to the entryway and scooped handfuls of sand from the path and poured them into his socks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Making sand shoes.” Omaha leaned back and shoved his feet into the socks, squeezing them inside and massaging the sand so it covered the bottoms of his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter stared at his actions. “Why didn’t you…Safia wouldn’t’ve had to…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just thought of it. Necessity is the mother of goddamn invention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No time.” Omaha pointed to Painter’s bare feet. “No socks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sprinted away, skidding and skating across the sandy path. He reached the clean glass and kept running. He wasn’t as confident of his plan as he had portrayed to Painter. Bolts dazzled around him. Panic fueled run. Sand hurt his toes. His ankle flamed with every step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he kept running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra had to give these folks some credit. They did have balls of steel. She tracked Omaha’s mad flight through the streets. Had a man ever loved her with so much heart?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noted Painter’s return but did not look his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould I have let him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra watched the sphere’s last few bounces. It now rolled toward the lake, aglow with cobalt energies. She had a job to finish here. She considered all her options, weighed the possibilities if they survived the next minute. She kept a finger pressed to the button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw Painter staring at Safia below as Omaha reached her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Painter had both lost out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff by the shore, the sphere took a final hop, bounced up, and landed in the water with a splash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandstorm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmaha reached Safia. She lay unmoving. Bolts rained fire all around him. His eyes were only on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chest rose and fell. Alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff in the direction of the lake, a huge splash sounded like a belly flop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe depth charge had been dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo time. They needed shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scooped Safia in his arms and swung around. He had to keep her from touching any surfaces. Carrying her prone form, her head resting on his shoulder, he stepped toward the opening of an intact home and ducked inside. It might not protect him from the deadly static bolts, but he had no idea what would happen when the sphere reached the lake. A roof over his head seemed like a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motion stirred Safia. She moaned. “Omaha…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here, baby…” He crouched down, cradling her on his knees, balanced on his sand shoes. “I’m here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Omaha and Safia vanished into a building, Painter watched the flume of water geyser up after the iron sphere hit the water. It was as if the ball had been dropped from the Empire State Building. It shot toward the roof, cascading outward, water droplets igniting when they brushed the dazzle of the storm, raining back down as liquid fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntimatter annihilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whirl in the lake eddied and shook. The waterspout jiggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut overhead, the vortex of static charge continued its deadly descent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter concentrated on the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready the whirlpool settled again, churning away with tidal forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire from the plume struck the lake, ignited pools, which quickly extinguished, reestablishing its equilibrium state. Nature loves balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ball must still be rolling,” Coral said, “seeking the lowest point in the lake bottom. The deeper the water, the better. The heightened pressure will help trigger the localized chain reaction and direct its force downward.” Painter turned to her. “Does your mind ever stop calculating?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “No, why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny stood at her side. “And if the sphere reaches the lowest point, then that’s also the best place to crack the glass over any Earth-generated cistern, draining the lake water away.” Painter shook his head. Those two were peas in a pod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra straightened next to Kara. The five of them were the last ones still on the balcony. Lu’lu had led the Rahim to the back rooms below. Captain al-Haffi and Barak led the handful of Shahra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something’s happening,” Cassandra said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut on the lake, a patch of black water glowed a ruddy crimson. It was not a reflection. The glow came from deep below. A fire under the lake. In just the half second it took to look, the crimson blasted out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep sonorous whump sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire lake lifted a few feet and dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRipples spread outward from the lake’s center. The growing waterspout collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get below!” Painter yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA force, neither wind nor concussion, blasted outward, flattening the lake, sweeping in all directions, pushing before it a wall of superheated air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter, half around the corner, caught a glancing shove to the shoulder. He was ripped away, tossed bodily across the room, lifted on wings of fire. Others had taken the force fully and were driven straight back. In a tangle, they hit the far wall. Painter kept his eyes squeezed shut. His lungs seared with the one breath he had taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter gained his feet. “Shelter,” he squeaked out, waving in vain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quake came next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for an earsplitting clap, deafening, as if the Earth were being cracked in half. Then the palace jumped several feet up, then down again, throwing them all flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rattling worsened. The tower shook, jolted to one side, then the other. Glass shattered. An upper story of the tower went crashing down. Pillars broke and toppled, smashing into city or lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the while, Painter kept flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud splintery pop exploded by his ear. He turned his head and saw the entire balcony beyond the archway shear and tilt away. A small limb waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Cassandra. She had not been blown through the doorway like the rest of them, but knocked against the palace’s outer wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell with the balcony. In her hand, she still held the detonator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter scrambled toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the edge, he searched below. He spotted Cassandra sprawled in the tumble of broken glass. Her fall had not been far. She lay on her back, clutching the detonator to her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I still have it!” she hollered hoarsely to him, but he didn’t know if it was in threat or reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gained her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hang on,” he said. “I’m coming down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t—” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sandstorm-sigma-force-1/page-91.html","bookId":1530,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:43:20 PM"}
