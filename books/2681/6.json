The thought of Germany defeated was dismal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps there would be some kind of peace settlement, with Germany surrendering France and Poland but keeping Austria and Czechoslovakia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed not much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found it hard to imagine everyday life back in Cologne, with his wife and family, after the excitement and sensual indulgence of Paris and Stephanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only happy ending, for Dieter and for Germany, would be for Rommel\u0027s army to push the invaders back into the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore dawn on a damp morning Hesse drove into the small medieval village of La Roche-Guyon, on the Seine river between Paris and Rouen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped at the roadblock at the edge of the village, but they were expected, and were quickly waved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went past silent, shuttered houses to another checkpoint at the gates of the ancient castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last they parked in the great cobbled courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter left Hesse with the car and went into the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe German commander in chief [West] was Field Marshal Gerd von Runstedt, a reliable senior general from the old officer class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder him, charged with the defense of the French coast, was Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe castle of La Roche-Guyon was Rommel\u0027s headquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter Franck felt an affinity with Rommel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth were the sons of teachers-Rommel\u0027s father had been a headmaster-and consequently both had felt the icy breath of German military snobbery from such men as von Runstedt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut otherwise they were very different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter was a sybarite, enjoying all the cultural and sensual pleasures France had to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRommel was an obsessive worker who did not smoke or drink and often forgot to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had married the only girlfriend he had ever had, and he wrote to her three times a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hall, Dieter met Rommel\u0027s aide-de-camp, Major Walter Goedel, a cold personality with a formidable brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter respected him but could never like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had spoken on the phone late last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter had outlined the problem he was having with the Gestapo and said he wanted to see Rommel as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be here at four a.m.,\" Goedel had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRommel was always at his desk by four o\u0027clock in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Dieter wondered if he had done the right thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRommel might say, \"How dare you bother me with trivial details?\" Dieter thought not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommanders liked to feel they were on top of the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRommel would almost certainly give Dieter the support he was asking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you could never be sure, especially when the commander was under strain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoedel nodded a curt greeting and said, \"He wants to see you right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome this way.\" As they walked along the hallway, Dieter said, \"What do you hear from Italy?\" \"Nothing but bad news,\" Goedel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re withdrawing from Arce.\" Dieter gave a resigned nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Germans were fighting fiercely, but they had been depressingly unable to halt the northward advance of the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later Dieter entered Rommels office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a grand room on the ground floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter noticed with envy a priceless seventeenth-century Gobelin tapestry on one wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was little furniture but for a few chairs and a huge antique desk that looked, to Dieter, as if it might be the same age as the tapestry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the desk stood a single lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the desk sat a small man with receding sandy hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoedel said, \"Major Franck is here, Field Marshal.\" Dieter waited nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRommel continued reading for a few seconds, then made a mark on the sheet of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might have been a bank manager reviewing the accounts of his more important customers-until he looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter had seen the face before, but it never failed to make him feel threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a boxer\u0027s face, with a flat nose and a broad chin and close-set eyes, and it was suffused with the naked aggression that had made Rommel a legendary commander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter recalled the story of Rommel\u0027s first military engagement, during the First World War.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading an advance guard of three men, Rommel had come upon a group of twenty French troops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of retreating and calling for reinforcements, Rommel had opened fire and dashed at the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been lucky to survive-but Dieter recalled Napoleon\u0027s dictum: \"Send me lucky generals.\" Since then, Rommel had always favored the sudden bold assault over the cautious planned advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that he was the polar opposite of his desert opponent, Montgomery, whose philosophy was never to attack until you were certain of victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Franck,\" said Rommel briskly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s on your mind?\" Dieter had rehearsed this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On your instructions, I\u0027ve been visiting key installations that might be vulnerable to attack by the Resistance and upgrading their security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve also been trying to assess the potential of the Resistance to inflict serious damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan they really hamper our response to an invasion?\" \"And your conclusion?\" \"The situation is worse than we imagined.\" Rommel grunted with distaste, as if an unpleasant suspicion had been confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reasons?\" Rommel was not going to bite his head off Dieter relaxed a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recounted yesterday\u0027s attack at Sainte-Cecile: the imaginative planning, the plentiful weaponry, and most of all the bravery of the fighters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only detail he left out was the beauty of the blonde girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRommel stood up and walked across to the tapestry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at it, but Dieter was sure he did not see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was afraid of this,\" Rommel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke quietly, almost to himself \"I can beat off an invasion, even with the few troops I have, if only I can remain mobile and flexible-but if my communications fail, I\u0027m lost.\" Goedel nodded agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter said, \"I believe we can turn the attack on the telephone exchange into an opportunity.\" Rommel turned to him with a wry smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By God, I wish all my officers were like you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo on, how will you do this?\" Dieter began to feel the meeting was going his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can interrogate the captured prisoners, they may lead me to other groups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith luck, we might inflict a lot of damage on the Resistance before the invasion.\" Rominel looked skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds like bragging.\" Dieter\u0027s heart sank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Rommel went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If anyone else said it, I might send him packing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I remember your work in the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou got men to tell you things they hardly realized they knew.\" Dieter was pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeizing his advantage, he said, \"Unfortunately, the Gestapo is refusing me access to the prisoners.\" \"They are such imbeciles.\" \"I need you to intervene.\" \"Of course.\" Rommel looked at Goedel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call avenue Foch.\" The Gestapo\u0027s French headquarters was at 84 avenue Foch in Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them that Major Franck will interrogate the prisoners today, or their next phone call will come from Berchtesgaden.\" He was referring to Hitler\u0027s Bavarian fortress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRommel never hesitated to use the Field Marshal\u0027s privilege of direct access to Hitler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" said Goedel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRommel walked around his seventeenth-century desk and sat down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep me informed, please, Franck,\" he said, and returned his attention to his papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter and Goedel left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoedel walked Dieter to the main door of the castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, it was still dark.
