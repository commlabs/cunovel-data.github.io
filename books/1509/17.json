From shoulder to shoulder it stretched eight meters, with a tall and slender figure. It’s shoulder plates were three affixed layers; the topmost was the largest with spikes which rose skyward, the middle layer was smooth and slightly smaller than the first, and the third layer retracted into the joint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s texture was markedly different from average mechas. It was as though it was carved from a single piece of true sapphire, a work of art. As the armor tapered towards it’s edges the color became a metallic purple. As lightning flashed in the sky above, the light from the blasts reflected magnificently off of the armor. In the instant it’s chest plate closed, it emitted a burst of intense violet light. It grew until it was as a ball of violet lightning rising in to the sky, vanishing in to the forest of arcing bolts above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That... that was...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden mecha had already steadied itself where it had been left in the air. The blond-haired, green-eyed woman in the cockpit filled with a shock that was difficult to describe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thor. That was Thor. I actually \u003cem\u003emet\u003c/em\u003e Thor. Thor… Zeus? Was that Zeus? I actually… actually told Zeus that the stronger his discipline, the more he’d bow to my mecha? The Zeus who, by virtue of his Discipline alone, bested thirteen top-grade customized mechas!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stars shimmered in her eyes, as though she’d already forgotten all about the abduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hovered stupefied for a long while, then again began to mutter to herself. “Why didn’t he take \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: center;\"\u003eζ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThor had risen with stunning speed, the upper atmosphere rolling past it like water off a duck’s back. In minutes it was floating in the vast, quiet expanse of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo radar in operation was capable of locating Thor. The special composition of it’s armor was legendary in the world of Mecha-Pilots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cabin within Thor was somewhat larger than average, but was a little cramped accommodating two people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeus withdrew the mask, revealing his long and handsome face. Only in this moment, he found it impossible to retain his traditional calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this moment he wasn’t Zeus. He was Lan Jue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hugged his arms tightly around the woman in his embrace, as though afraid she would vanish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jin Yu, we’re finally together again. Why… why didn’t you come looking for me? You’re my Hera!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so hot.” Locked in his tight embrace, abducted, this was the first thing Zhou Qianlin thought to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” Lan Jue paused, lifting a hand to press against her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin’s forehead was burning up, and her eyes had shut. Her brows were furrowed, and her body trembled slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a fever?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue’s face grew somber, noticing the red flesh of her neck. She was sick, and those people wanted her to suffer through a marriage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting his head, Lan Jue muttered, “Thor, take us home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Affirmative, returning home.” The gentle, dignified voice reverberated through the cockpit. Thor began to transform, to wings extending from it’s back. Then, like a bolt of lightning, it shot in to the darkness of the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: center;\"\u003eζ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZeus’ Jewelry Store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKe\u0027er was bored to tears, listlessly laying atop the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiuxiu sat to the side, idly sipping the cup of warm water in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jewelry shop rarely had visitors, a common reality on Skyfire Avenue. But even if there were only one or two customers, it was usually sufficient to keep the shop running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey Xiuxiu, where’d the boss go? Didn’t see him yesterday, still not here today.” Ke\u0027er cantered her head towards Xiuxiu and whined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiuxiu laughed. “The boss is a very important man. You think he’d just vanish? Don’t be such a nosy little thing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKe\u0027er giggled. “Me? Don’t tell me you aren’t curious what he’s doing. You came so early this morning, without waiting for me to come help. You even cleaned his house!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiuxiu’s face grew red, as though she’d smeared it with rouge, adding even more charm to her classical beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, the earth shook beneath Zeus’ Jewelry Store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls exchanged glances. “Speak of the devil,” Ke\u0027er exclaimed. “The boss must be back, I’ll go check.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she said this, she skipped towards the VIP lounge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she pushed to open the door, however, she was surprised to find it wouldn’t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiuxiu, Ke\u0027er, I’m a little tired. I’m going to rest for a while,” Lan Jue’s voice crackled through the speaker by the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh?” Ke\u0027er stood confused by the door, while Xiuxiu also drew near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKe\u0027er turned to look at Xiuxiu. “The boss doesn’t sound quite right. Maybe he snuck a woman in, and is afraid we’d find out…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiuxiu lifted her hand and rapped against Ke\u0027er’s head in agitation. “What are you saying. In three years, have you even \u003cem\u003eonce\u003c/em\u003e…” She trailed off, a dismal look in her eyes. “I-If he really did bring a woman back, then I’m happy for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKe\u0027er closed her mouth, and said nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: center;\"\u003eζ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue carefully laid Zhou Qianlin atop his bed. Even in her state, she was still breathtakingly beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows furrowed in thought. Not half an hour since he discovered her illness and her temperature had already risen sharply. He’d used Thor’s onboard diagnostics to run a scan, but discovered no sickness or poison. It was a drug, one that could trigger desire in the victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? Why today, as a bride, would she need this sort of drug? Judging by the progress of her reaction, it was meant to last until the wedding had concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThose wretches! Was this wedding forced by the Austins? They DARE to force this drug on my Hera. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin hand softly rested atop his own, it’s heat and soft touch drawing him from his rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin’s body had grown red, and her body began to writhe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a fierce, powerful drug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning down, he gently took her up in his arms. He felt the heat radiating from her, could smell the familiar scent of her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftly he whispered in her ear. “My Hera. In this life, you are destined to be my bride, and mine alone.
