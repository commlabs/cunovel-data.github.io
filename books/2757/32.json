Then she went to work with her makeup, touching up her mascara and reapplying her lip gloss. The bathroom was small, but she seemed very far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she said, “It’s not a habit or anything. I think I just ate too quickly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I said, and forever afterward I didn’t know if she was telling the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell Al or Elody, okay? I don’t want them freaking out over nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Obviously,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused, pressed her lips together, puckered them at the mirror. Then she turned toward me. “You guys are my family. You know that, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said it casually, as though she were complimenting my jeans, but I knew that it was one of the most sincere things she’d ever said to me. I knew that she really meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went to the party in the arboretum as planned. Elody and Ally had a great time, but I got a stomachache and had to double up on the hood of Ally’s car. I’m not sure if it was the food or what, but it felt like something was trying to claw its way out of my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay had a great night: that night she kissed Patrick for the first time. Three months later, at the tail end of the summer, they had sex. When she told us about losing her virginity to her boyfriend—the candles, the blanket on the floor, the flowers, the whole nine yards—and how great it was that her first time was so romantic, none of us even batted an eyelash. We all rushed in and congratulated her, asked her for details, told her we were jealous. We did it for Lindsay, to make her happy. She would have done it for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s the thing about best friends. That’s what they do. They keep you from spinning off the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHERE IT BEGINS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsay, Elody, and Ally must head upstairs as soon as they arrive—considering they’re packing their own vodka, it’s a safe bet—because I don’t see them again until an hour or so later. I’ve had three shots of rum and it all hits me at once: the room is a spinning, blurring world of color and sound. Courtney has just finished off the bottle of rum so I get a beer. I have to concentrate on every step, and when I get to the keg I stand there for a second, forgetting what I’ve come for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beer?” Matt Dorfman fills a cup and holds it out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beer,” I say, pleased the word comes out so clear, pleased that I remembered that this is what I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make my way upstairs. Things register in short bursts, a movie reel that’s been chopped up: the feel of the rough wood banister; Emma McElroy leaning back against a wall, her mouth open and gasping—maybe laughing?—like a fish on a hook; Christmas lights winking, blurred light. I’m not sure where I’m going or who I’m looking for, but all of a sudden there’s Lindsay across the room and I realize I’ve made it all the way to the back of the house, the cigarette room. Lindsay and I look at each other for a second and I’m hoping she’ll smile at me, but she just looks away. Ally’s standing next to her. She bends forward and whispers something to Lindsay, then makes her way over to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Sam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you have to ask permission to talk to me?” These words don’t come out so clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be a bitch.” Ally rolls her eyes. “Lindsay’s really upset about what you said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Elody mad?” Elody’s in the corner with Steve Dough, swaying against him while he talks to Liz Hummer like she’s not even there. I want to go over and hug her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlly hesitates, looks at me from under the fringe of her bangs. “She’s not mad. You know Elody.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell Ally’s lying, but I’m too drunk to pursue it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t call me today.” I hate that I’ve said it. It makes me feel like an outsider again, like someone trying to break into the group. It’s only been a day, but I miss them: my only real friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlly takes a sip of the vodka she’s holding, then winces. “Lindsay was freaking out. I told you, she was really upset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s true though, isn’t it? What I said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter if it’s true.” Ally shakes her head at me. “She’s Lindsay. She’s ours. We’re each other’s, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never really thought of Ally as smart, but this is probably the smartest thing I’ve heard in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should say you’re sorry,” Ally says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m not sorry.” I’m definitely slurring now. My tongue is thick and weighty in my mouth. I can’t make it do what I want it to. I want to tell Ally everything—about Mr. Daimler and Anna Cartullo and Ms. Winters and the Pugs—but I can’t even think of the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just say it, Sam.” Ally’s eyes have started to roam around the party. Then suddenly she takes a quick step backward. Her mouth goes slack and she brings a hand to her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” she says, staring over my shoulder. Her mouth’s curving up into a smile. “I don’t believe it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels like time freezes as I turn around. I read once that at the edge of a black hole, time stops completely, so if you ever sailed into it, you’d just be stuck there at the lip forever, forever being torn apart, forever dying. That’s what it feels like in that second. The crush of people circled around me, an endless lip, more and more people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there she is standing in the doorway. Juliet Sykes. Juliet Sykes—who yesterday blew her brains out with her parents’ handgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair is tied up in a ponytail and I can’t help it; I picture it knotted and clotted with blood, a big gaping hole directly underneath her little flip of hair. I’m terrified of her: a ghost in the door, the kind of stuff you have nightmares about when you’re a kid, the kind of thing they make horror movies about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA phrase comes back from a news show I had to watch about the convicts on death row for my ethics and issues elective: dead man walking. I thought it was awful when I first heard it, but now I really understand it. Juliet Sykes is a dead man walking. I guess I am too, in a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say, without meaning to say it out loud. I take a step backward, and Harlowe Rosen squeals and says, “That’s my foot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe it,” Ally says again, but it sounds far away. She’s already turning away from me, calling out to Lindsay over the music. “Lindsay, did you see who it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliet sways in the doorway. She looks calm, but her hands are balled into fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI throw myself forward, but everyone chooses that moment to press even closer around me. I can’t watch it again. I don’t want to see what happens next. I’m not very steady on my feet, and I keep getting knocked back and forth, rocketing between people like a pinball, trying desperately to get out of the room. I know I’m stepping on people and throwing elbows in their backs, but I don’t care. I need out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I break through the knot of people. Juliet is blocking the doorway. She’s not even looking at me. She’s standing as still as a statue, her eyes locked some distance over my shoulder. She’s looking at Lindsay. I understand then that it’s Lindsay she really wants—it’s Lindsay she hates the most—but it doesn’t make me feel any better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I’m about to push past her, a tremor runs through her body and she locks eyes with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” she says to me, and puts a hand on my wrist. It’s as cold as ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I pull away from her and keep going, stumbling forward, nearly choking on my fear. Jumbled images of Juliet keep flashing in my mind: Juliet doubled over, hands outstretched, drenched in beer and stumbling; Juliet lying on a cold floor in a pool of blood. I’m not thinking clearly, and in my head the two images merge and I see her roving around the room while everyone laughs, her hair soaked, dripping, drenched in blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so distracted I don’t see Rob in the hallway until I’ve run straight into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” Rob is drunk now. He has an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips. “Hey, you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rob…” I press myself against him. The world is spinning. “Let’s get out of here, okay? We’ll go to your house. I’m ready now, just me and you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa, cowgirl.” One half of Rob’s mouth ticks slowly upward, but the other doesn’t quite manage to join it. “After the cigarette.” He starts moving toward the back of the house. “Then we’ll go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” I nearly scream it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns back to me, swaying, and before he can react, I’ve already plucked the cigarette out of his mouth and I’m kissing him, my hands cupped on either side of his face, shoving my body into his. It takes him a second to realize what’s happening, but then he starts pawing me over my dress, rolling his tongue around in circles, groaning a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re both staggering back and forth in the hallway, almost like we’re dancing. I feel the floor buckle and roll, and Rob accidentally pushes me hard against the wall and I gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, babe.” His eyes cross, uncross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need a room.” From the back of the house I can just hear the chanting starting. Psycho, Psycho. “We need a room now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take Rob’s hand and we stumble down the hall, forcing our way against the tide of people moving in the other direction. They’re all going to see what the noise is about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In here.” Rob slams as hard as he can against the first closed door he comes to, the one with all the bumper stickers. There’s a popping sound and we both tumble inside. I kiss him again and try to lose myself in the feeling of the closeness of our bodies and his warmth, try to block out the rising howls of laughter from the back room. I pretend I’m just a body with a mind as blank and fuzzy as a TV full of snow. I try to shrink myself down, center myself in my skin, like the only feeling that exists is in Rob’s fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the door is shut it’s pitch-black. The darkness around us hasn’t let up at all—either there are no windows here or they’re curtained off. It’s so dark it’s almost heavy-looking, and I get a sudden hysterical fear that we’re stuck in a box. Rob’s lurching on his feet so much by this point, his arms locked around me, it makes me dizzy. I feel a wave of nausea, and I push him backward until we encounter something soft: a bed. He tips over and I climb on top of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” he mumbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t this what you wanted?” I whisper. Even now I can hear the sounds of laughter and the screaming—Psycho, Psycho—piping thinly over the music. I kiss Rob harder and he wrestles with the zipper of my dress. I hear fabric ripping but I don’t care. I slide the dress down to my waist, and Rob starts his attack on my bra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you shure about this?” Rob slurs in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just kiss me.” Psycho, Psycho. The voices are echoing down the hall. I slide my hands under Rob’s fleece and wrestle it over his head, then start kissing his neck and underneath the collar of his polo shirt. His skin tastes like sweat and salt and cigarettes, but I keep kissing while his hands move over my back and down toward my butt. An image of Mr. Daimler on top of me—and the speckled ceiling—rises out of the darkness, but I push it away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/before-i-fall/page-32.html","bookId":2757,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:26 PM"}
