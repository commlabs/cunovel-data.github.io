Countless pairs of eyes watched in shock as Lin Dong directly charged into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice. This kind of action was practically charging straight into one’s death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That lunatic, entering the Mysterious Black Yin crevice can only mean certain death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such a vicious fellow, not willing to return the treasure to the Ghastly Puppet Cult even if he dies!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tang Sha is likely going to explode with anger!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“......”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerous whispers and noises echoed nonstop across the sky. Lin Dong’s actions was out of everyone’s expectations. No one expected that he would actually chose this kind of death after struggling for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bastard, you dare!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching the Lin Dong who had cast himself towards the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, momentary shock clearly appeared on Teng Sha’s face. However, quickly following that, fury exploded from his eyes as a roar resounded across the skies. Teng Sha could not afford to lose his wits at this moment, the Mysterious Black Yin crevice was a place of death and even he did not dare to enter. If Lin Dong really charged in, even if he died there, the treasure would also be lost within. This was an outcome that Teng Sha was absolutely not happy to see!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Plop!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury and alarm filled Teng Sha’s heart. Just as he was about to move, his complexion suddenly turned red as he vomited a mouthful of fresh blood under the crowd’s shocked gazes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My god, Teng Sha is actually injured?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Must have been caused by Lin Dong previously, such terrifying power, such a frightening Manifestation martial art, to actually injure even an advanced Manifestation stage Teng Sha!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon hearing those countless cries of alarm, Teng Sha’s expression turned extremely dark as he wiped off the blood at the corner of his mouth. Previously, when he clashed directly against Lin Dong’s Great Desolate Imprisoning Heavenly Finger, he had indeed been slightly injured and was forcibly enduring it. However, after being so taken aback by Lin Dong’s actions such that his soul almost left his body, he grew furious, resulting in his injuries surfacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the sky, Mu Lei and Wu Zong’s expressions were solemn as they watched this scene. They exchanged a look and saw in each other\u0027s’ eyes that they were both badly shaken by this. Even with their combined might, it would likely be an uphill struggle to defeat Teng Sha. Hence, never did they imagine that Lin Dong would be able to injure Teng Sha. This kind of power was truly frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter vomiting out a mouthful of blood, Teng Sha could not be bothered any more, and there were even a few shrieks contained within his shout. Today’s matter had almost driven him mad. After gathering his entire Ghastly Puppet Cult, not only did he fail to break the seal, he also revealed the existence of his treasure. Furthermore, the thing that truly infuriated him was that his treasure was eventually snatched away by Lin Dong...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, when he saw Lin Dong heading into the Mysterious Black Yin Crevice, that insanity instantly turned into despair. Once the former dashed into the Mysterious Black Yin Crevice, then he would definitely be dead without even leaving behind his corpse. Most importantly, that treasure would also be gone and all of his hard work would have gone down the drain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he heard Teng Sha’s maniacal shout, the various elite Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners hurriedly dashed forth. However, right now, Lin Dong had recklessly rushed into the space above the Mysterious Black Yin Crevice. Finally, right in front of their eyes, he headed into the dark Mysterious Black Yin Crevice, before he disappeared inside in mere moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Teng Sha, as long as I Lin Dong don’t die this time, I will make sure that your Ghastly Puppet Cult repay this debt in blood!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, just as Lin Dong disappeared into the dark Mysterious Black Yin Crevice, Lin Dong’s somewhat beast-like deep growl suddenly faintly echoed out from within the darkness, before it ricocheted across the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bastard! All of you are useless!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw Lin Dong disappearing into that never-ending Mysterious Black Yin Crevice, Teng Sha was instantly infuriated. Then, his eyes turned blood-red, just like a gambler who had lost everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they saw Teng Sha, who was so infuriated till he nearly lost his mind, all of the elite Ghastly Puppet Cult practitioners stood timidly aside as they did not dare to speak at all. They stood at the edges of Mysterious Black Yin Crevice, while they stared at that pitch-black Mysterious Black Yin Crevice. Right now, countless streams of Earth Terminus Cold Qi was gushing out from within before they formed a turbulence powerful enough to slaughter any Manifestation practitioners. When Lin Dong dashed in previously, he was probably shredded into meat pulps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter losing his cool and rampaging for a while, that Teng Sha eventually calmed down. His face was dark as he hovered on the edges of Mysterious Black Yin Crevice, while his eyes glimmered as he stared at that Cold Qi turbulence. After hesitating for a while, he ultimately did not have the guts to dash in. With regards to the dangers of Mysterious Black Yin Crevice, he was most keenly aware of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sect Leader, right now, Lin Dong has probably died inside.” When they saw Teng Sha calm down a little, the left and right senior elders finally dared to speak cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he is alive I want to see him, if he is dead I want to see his body!” Teng Sha’s face was so grim and cold that he seemed like he wanted to swallow someone. It was exceedingly terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he heard his words, that left and right senior elders involuntarily laughed painfully inside their hearts. After jumping into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, it was impossible for one to even preserve one’s corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gather everyone and comb through the edges of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice. Even though the Earth Terminus Cold Qi in the Mysterious Black Yin crevice is extremely powerful, there is still a seal on the treasure and it should be fine. If we station ourselves on the perimeter, we will surely be able to find it!” Teng Sha obviously understood that his words were somewhat childish, as he immediately sucked in a deep breath and spoke coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they heard his words, that left and right senior elders hurriedly replied. Right now, that was all that they could do. Though Lin Dong had the guts to jump into this death-trap Mysterious Black Yin crevice, they did not have the same guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This little bastard got off easy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeng Sha started venomously into that pitch-dark Mysterious Black Yin crevice without a trace of light, as he gritted his teeth and said. Then, he waved his sleeves before he turned around begrudgingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Teng Sha left, the situation became increasingly chaotic. The eyes of the surrounding elite practitioners glimmered and they chose not to leave immediately. Instead, their figures descended before they formed groups and combed through the edges of the Mysterious Black Yin crevice. Evidently, they had the same thought as Teng Sha and they wanted to see if they were lucky enough to find the treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter an alarming earth-shattering fight, it finally concluded after Lin Dong lept into that death-trap Mysterious Black Yin crevice . However, many of them felt regretful that there were unable to discern the real identity of that mysterious treasure. Thankfully, tonight’s fierce and intense battle made them feel like this trip was still worth their time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd evidently, after tonight, Lin Dong’s name would surely completely shock the entire Great Desolate Province. Based on his own strength, he was able to fight against the entire Ghastly Puppet Cult and even managed to fight against Teng Sha, who was at advanced Manifestation stage, and even injure him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a glorious result was enough to rank Lin Dong among the elites of Great Desolate Province!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, even compared to famed top-tier practitioners in Great Desolate Province like Teng Sha, Mu Lei and Wu Zong, he would not lose out at all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight’s fight has totally caused the entire Great Desolate Province to remember his name, and to remember this young and stellar figure!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e......\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as the entire Mysterious Black Yin Mountain Range descended into chaos, Lin Dong was in dire straits as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter heading into the Mysterious Black Yin crevice, he finally understood why this area stood as the final resting spot for various elite practitioners. Streams of Earth Terminus Cold Qi swept forth from every direction, and every stream of Earth Terminus Cold Qi was just as powerful as a Manifestation practitioner’s attack. As they violently collided, the resultant turbulence was even more terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe protective Yuan Power undulated on Lin Dong’s body was only able to shield him against three streams of Earth Terminus Cold Qi before they thoroughly dissipated. Then, Earth Terminus Cold Qi slammed onto his body, just like a penetrating high-grade Soul Treasure, as it directly left blood trails on Lin Dong’s body. In mere minutes, his body was covered with fresh blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Growl!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Flame flapped its bloody wings as it desperately tried to protect Lin Dong. Even though its body was filled with blood-like scales, numerous sparks continuously sparked forth, while it\u0027s terrifying growl spread out in darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was completely dark inside the Mysterious Black Yin crevice. Lin Dong was completely unable to discern which direction he was headed and he could only barge around recklessly. However, barging around recklessly in the Mysterious Black Yin crevice would undoubtedly lead to his doom. Therefore, he did not persevere on for a long time, before one man and one beast were hit by an extremely gigantic Earth Terminus Cold Qi turbulence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant they were hit, Lin Dong directly vomited out a mouthful of blood, and it seemed like his internal organs had all been shifted. However, what caused Lin Dong’s face to change drastically was the fact that he and Little Flame had been forcefully torn apart due to that turbulence. One man and one beast quickly disappeared into the darkness before they eventually lost sight of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Flame!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw Little Flame being torn away by that turbulence, Lin Dong’s eyes were about to tear. However, before he could head over, another wave of turbulence hit him. Then, the Mysterious Earth Armor on his body was finally unable to hold on any further, as it exploded with a bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buzz buzz!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless bloody wounds were scattered across his body, as Lin Dong vomited out another mouthful of blood. Against that unstoppable Earth Terminus Cold Qi turbulence, his sense finally begun to slip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buzz buzz!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, just as Lin Dong’s consciousness was about to slip into darkness, a peculiar buzzing sound suddenly echoed out. Then, a warm milky-white glow slowly emerged from within his palm, before it transformed into a glowing cocoon and wrapped around his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough that cocoon seemed weak, even the Earth Terminus Cold Qi turbulence that Manifestation stage practitioners could not withstand, only caused the glowing cocoon to gently vibrate!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the protection of the glowing cocoon, Lin Dong’s body slowly descended before he eventually disappeared into that never-ending abyss...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-318\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-320\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-319","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:54 AM"}
