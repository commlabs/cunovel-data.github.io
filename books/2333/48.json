You know what bothered me the most?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bloody footprints.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it in one. The fucking bloody footprints. Leading right straight to the cellar stairs, just so we\u0027d know to look. You know the word that comes to mind? Cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is something else he\u0027s done before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every time he had the chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about dental records, Ira? Fire or no fire, he\u0027d still have teeth in his jaw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely, but what are you gonna match \u0027em to? The floater in the Hudson had teeth, too, but we had to know to look at Harold Fischer\u0027s dental records before they told us anything. The problem with Adam Breit is we don\u0027t know who the hell he was before he became Adam Breit. He never lived in New York under that name, not that there\u0027s a record, except for a year and a half at Broadway and Waverly and eight months on Central Park West. He never went to medical school anywhere in America under that name, never joined any professional societies. Did he just fake the whole thing as far as his credentials as a therapist are concerned? It might not be the hardest thing in the world. You\u0027re never called upon to remove an appendix, or read an x-ray. You just nod your head every once in a while and say things like \u0027Well, how did that make you feel?\u0027 There\u0027ve been impostors who posed successfully as doctors, as lawyers, and as the son of Sidney Poitier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the daughter of the Czar of all the Russias,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Posing as a shrink,\" he said, \"should be child\u0027s play in comparison, especially since you could make the case that half of them are unqualified to begin with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the pot, refilled our cups. I said, \"No fingerprints, I don\u0027t suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? There\u0027s barely fingers. And we did find some prints in the Central Park West apartment, but not a ton of them, and it\u0027s impossible to know which ones are his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because no one set predominates. I think he wiped up a lot, and I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if he tended to be careful about fingerprints. Of the prints we did find, well, it stands to reason that the people from Meserole Street left some of them. They were there all the time for individual and group sessions with their fearless leader. And we can\u0027t get their prints for comparison, because the muriatic acid that didn\u0027t go on their faces went on their hands, and anyway they got burned up in the fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a fucking mess,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got that right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank some coffee. \"How\u0027d he get there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where? Brooklyn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Subway, I suppose. Unless you can find a cabby who\u0027ll go to Brooklyn. Nobody logged the trip, incidentally, which doesn\u0027t mean nobody made it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he have a car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that anybody knows about. Nothing registered in his name at DMV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he had a car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Under another name? Could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he used one when he and Ivanko took down the Hollanders. I thought that all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possible. Doesn\u0027t mean he drove it to Meserole Street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t carrying two pillowcases full of stolen goods this time, Matt. He could ride the subway and not get a second glance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or he could have got a ride out with one of the Meserole Street people. He could have called them, told one of them to come pick him up. They stood around with their thumbs up their asses while he made the rounds and stabbed them. You don\u0027t think they\u0027d run into the city and pick him up if he snapped his fingers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they would have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he had a car,\" he said, \"he probably went out there some other way that day. And left his car in a garage, or parked at a curb somewhere. And sooner or later it\u0027ll get towed, and wind up sold at an unclaimed property auction, and we\u0027ll never know, because it\u0027s registered under some other name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were both silent for a while, and then Wentworth said, \"But if he did take his car, it should have been parked out front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it wasn\u0027t. Of course he could have left the keys in it, and then it could be anywhere by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or not left the keys in it, with the same result. That neighborhood, the kids learn to hot-wire a car before they learn how to drive it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where would he get a stooge at a moment\u0027s notice, will you tell me that? Just go out and pick one off the street?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easier said than done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. And did anybody turn up missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, neither do I,\" he said. \"No reports, but how many people go missing and never get reported? Matt, I think it\u0027s him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wallet was in his pocket, you know. It was a mess, what with fire and water damage, but there was some ID in it. A library card, one of those universal Student ID cards they make for you on Times Square. The kind of crap you have when you\u0027re using a false name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No driver\u0027s license?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No license, no registration. Which further supports the premise that he didn\u0027t have a car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or that his license and registration were in another name, and he kept them separate. And made sure not to plant them on the corpse, because he might need them later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he drove off into the sunset. He left money in the wallet, does that help convince you? I mean, who throws money away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hundred and seventy dollars,\" he said, \"which, to refresh your memory, is exactly the amount he boasted about walking out of the massage parlor with. His hundred-dollar bill plus three twenties and a ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The exact amount.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He walked around all day, and wound up having exactly that amount left in his wallet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at each other, and his eyes widened. \"You know the word that comes to mind,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Jesus,\" he said. \"Look, I\u0027m not going to make myself any nuttier with this than I already am. That\u0027s him at the foot of the stairs unless I\u0027ve got a real reason to think otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead,\" Wentworth said. \"And if by some godforsaken chance he\u0027s not dead, at least he\u0027s out of here. And if he\u0027s out of here he\u0027s somebody else\u0027s problem and not ours. What did it say on that basement wall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027I came like water, and like wind I go.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said, \"all I can say is it\u0027s an ill wind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about a week later that Elaine answered the phone and chatted enthusiastically for a few minutes, then covered the mouthpiece and said, \"For you. It\u0027s Andy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd indeed it was. He was just calling, he said, to let me know he\u0027d moved again. He\u0027d left Tucson, he said, and had knocked around a little, seeing something of the country, and now he was in Coeur d\u0027Alene, Idaho, just up the river from Spokane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a few months,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll probably wish I was in Tucson, because everybody tells me they get a whole lot of winter here. But I have to say it\u0027s pretty nice so far.\" He had a job tending bar, he said, and a decent room a five-minute walk from where he worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I get loaded,\" he said, \"I can make it home real easy. Don\u0027t even have to cross any big streets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always a plus,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of loaded,\" he said, \"I was out of line, what I said at Hershey\u0027s after the funeral. Plus I guess I was, I don\u0027t know, emotionally overwrought?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess what I\u0027m trying to say is I apologize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him he was forgiven and it was forgotten, and I wrote down his address and phone number, and we told each other we\u0027d stay in touch. To Elaine I said, \"Well, that was nice, but as conversations go it was like an iceberg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cold? It didn\u0027t feel that way to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Invisible,\" I said. \"Mostly underwater. He knows where the money came from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael told him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in so many words. I\u0027d say Michael told him without telling him, the way Andy just told me he knows, and thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in Idaho, he said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tending bar across the river from Spokane, Washington. And living close enough to the job that he can make it home on foot no matter how drunk he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you worried about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got no business worrying about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t, is it? I don\u0027t know if worried is the right word. I can\u0027t make myself believe that things are going to be different. People change, but only when they have to. Tucson\u0027s just one more thing that he got away with. The consequences would have been serious, but he didn\u0027t suffer them. He dodged the bullet, and a miss is as good as a mile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And next time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ll be a next time,\" I said, \"and maybe a time or two after that, and all I can hope is he\u0027s alive and out of prison at the end of it. I have to care because he\u0027s my son, but I\u0027m not really involved. I\u0027m not his Higher Power. I\u0027m not even his sponsor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just his father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And barely that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward I found myself thinking about a conversation I\u0027d had with Helen Watling, Jason Bierman\u0027s mother. She was deeply gratified that her son\u0027s name had been cleared, that he was now known to have been not a multiple murderer but the first in a chain of innocent victims. Yet hers was a bittersweet victory. Her son was still dead, and he\u0027d died a useless, senseless death. And the man she\u0027d credited with helping him turn his life around had in fact betrayed him, and taken his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you know,\" she said, \"I hate to say this, but I wonder if maybe he isn\u0027t better off this way. Because I don\u0027t think things were ever going to work out for Jason. But maybe I shouldn\u0027t say that, because we can\u0027t know that, can we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"We can\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d had a couple of conversations with Kristin Hollander along the way, and then she called one afternoon to tell me I\u0027d never sent her a final bill. I reminded her I didn\u0027t send bills, and that I didn\u0027t figure she owed me anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t seem right,\" she said. \"With all the time you and T J put in? And you must have had expenses, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing to speak of,\" I told her. \"I didn\u0027t accomplish a hell of a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? I\u0027m still alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your cousin\u0027s not,\" I said, \"and neither are those people in Williamsburg. You already gave me a thousand dollars, and that\u0027s plenty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to argue the point, but gave up after a while, and I figured that was the end of it. Then two days later the doorman called up to announce a delivery from Bergdorf\u0027s that had to be signed for. He sent the fellow upstairs, and while I was signing for it I told him the doorman was empowered to receive and sign for deliveries to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one, it had to be the addressee,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed it out to Elaine when she got home, and she started to unwrap it, then stopped to announce that it was for me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-48.html","bookId":2333,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM"}
