All right, get outa my tent so I can get decent.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re not in your tent, Sergeant, you’re in our latrine ditch.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked round. ‘That explains the smell.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘None of us used it yet, Sergeant, seeing as how you were here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stomach convulsed again, but there was nothing left to spit up, so he rode it out, waited, gasping, and then slowly settled back on his haunches. ‘Poliel’s prissy nipples! If I can’t keep nothing down I’ll waste away!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You already have, Widder,’ observed Throatslitter from a few paces upwind, his voice a cracking rasp. The old scars on his neck were inflamed; he’d taken a shot to his chest, hard enough to dent his sternum with matted rows from the mail’s iron links, and something from that trauma had messed up his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were away from the camp, twenty paces beyond the eastern picket. Widdershins, Throatslitter, Deadsmell and Sergeant Balm. The survivors of the 9th Squad. The regulars crouched in their holes had watched them pass with red-shot eyes, saying nothing. Was that belligerence? Pity? The squad mage didn’t know and at the moment was past caring. Wiping his mouth with the back of one forearm, he looked past Throatslitter to Balm. ‘You called us up here, Sergeant. What now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalm drew off his helm, scratched vigorously at his scalp. ‘Just thought I’d tell you, we ain’t breaking the squad up and we ain’t picking up any new bodies. It’s just us, now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiddershins grunted. ‘We took a walk for that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t be an idiot,’ said Deadsmell in a growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalm faced his soldiers. ‘Talk, all of you. You first, Throatslitter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall man seemed to flinch. ‘What’s to say? We’re chewed to pieces. But Kindly hogtying Fid like that, well, bloody genius. We got ourselves a captain, now—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There wasn’t anything wrong with Sort,’ Deadsmell interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not saying there was. Definite officer, that woman. But maybe that’s the point. Fid’s from the ground up a marine, through and through. He was a sapper. A sergeant. Now he’s captain of what’s left of us. I’m settled with that.’ He shrugged, facing Balm. ‘Nothing more to say, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And when he says it’s time to go, you gonna bleat and whine about it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter’s brows lifted. ‘Go? Go where?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalm squinted and then said, ‘Your turn, Deadsmell.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hood’s dead. Grey riders patrol the Gate. In my dreams I see faces, blurred, but still. Malazans. Bridgeburners. You can’t imagine how comforting that feels, you just can’t. They’re all there, and I think we got Dead Hedge to thank for that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How do you mean?’ Widdershins asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just a feeling. As if, in coming back, he blazed a trail. Six days ago, well, I swear they were close enough to kiss.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because we all almost died,’ Throatslitter snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, they were like wasps, and what was sweet wasn’t us dying, wasn’t the lizards neither. It was what happened at the vanguard. It was Lostara Yil.’ His eyes were bright as he looked to each soldier in turn. ‘I caught a glimpse, you know. I saw her dance. She did what Ruthan Gudd did, only she didn’t go down under blades. The lizards recoiled – they didn’t know what to do, they couldn’t get close, and those that did, gods, they were cut to pieces. I saw her, and my heart near burst.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She saved the Adjunct’s life,’ said Throatslitter. ‘Was that such a good thing?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not for you to even ask,’ said Balm. ‘Fid’s calling us together. He’s got things to say. About that, I expect. The Adjunct. And what’s to come. We’re still marines. We’re the marines, and we got heavies in our ranks, the stubbornest bulls I ever seen.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned then, since two regulars from the pickets were approaching. In their arms, two loaves of bread, a wrapped brick of cheese, and a Seven Cities clay bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s this?’ Deadsmell wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two soldiers halted a few paces away, and the one on the right spoke. ‘Guard’s changed, Sergeant. Came out with some breakfast for us. We weren’t much hungry.’ They then set the items down on a bare patch of ground. Nodded, set off back for camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hood’s pink belly,’ Deadsmell muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Save all that,’ Balm said. ‘We’re not yet done here. Widdershins.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-53.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
