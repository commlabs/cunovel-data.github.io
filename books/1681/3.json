I immediately regret the note of panic in my voice; it causes the General to grimace. Dr. Anu flashes me a placating smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We never had one of the Garde to experiment on before, so yes, untested.” He shrugs merrily, excited to test this contraption. “But the theory behind it is very strong. Of the trueborns here in Washington, you are closest in age to the girl, which should make the memory download go more smoothly. Your mind will interpret the Garde’s memories as visions rather than through her eyes. I’m sure your father wouldn’t suddenly want his only son in the body of a little girl, hmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father bristles. Dr. Anu glances over his shoulder. “Just kidding, General. You have a good, strong son here. Very brave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, I don’t feel very brave. I’d watched Number One get struck down—she was barely capable of defending herself in life; she is certainly harmless in death—yet being connected to her, it renews the feeling of unease I felt on the plane ride back from Malaysia. I almost start to volunteer Ivan to be Anu’s guinea pig but clamp my mouth shut just in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan enjoyed watching One die; it’s all he’s been able to talk about. For me, even thinking about it makes my hands start to shake again. I steady myself—stop being such a coward, Adamus—this is a great honor, something I should be proud of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try not to look at the dead girl as Anu reaches above the chair and lowers a metal cylinder down from the ceiling, covered with circuitry that wouldn’t look out of place on the inside of a rocket. The vast majority of the wires connected to Number One connect to the cylinder. Anu pauses before the cylinder is in place over my head and peers down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll feel a little shock,” he muses. “Maybe go to sleep for a few minutes. When you wake up, you’ll be able to tell us what this one knew about the other Garde.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize Anu’s free hand is on my shoulder. His grip is tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days ago my biggest worry was dumbing down essay answers enough to pass my work off as Ivan’s. Since then I’ve seen firsthand the Mogadorian warrior I’m expected to grow into, and I’m not sure I’m up for it. Now I’m being ordered to temporarily share a brain with my mortal enemy. I know it’s my father’s will, and that if the machine works it will help our cause and bring honor to my family. Still. I don’t want to admit it, but I’m scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnu lowers the cylinder over my head until it covers my face. He and my father disappear from view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear Anu shuffle across the laboratory. His fingers click across a series of buttons, and the cylinder begins to vibrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here we go,” announces Anu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of the cylinder explodes with light—searing white light that burns my eyes, all the way through to the back of my head. I shut my eyes, but somehow the light still penetrates. I feel as if I’m coming apart, the light tearing through me, breaking me into tiny particles. This is what death must feel like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, everything is darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like I’m falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBursts of color flash across my vision. There are shapes—indistinct faces, blurry scenery—but I can’t make any of it out. It’s like being stuck inside my TV while Kelly plays with the remote. Nothing makes any sense, and I start to get this panicky feeling, like sensory overload. I try to squeeze my eyes shut, but that’s useless; this is all happening inside my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when I feel like my brain is about to be fried to a crisp by the bombardment of colors, everything snaps into focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, I’m standing in a sunlit banquet hall. Light pours into the room via a skylight through which I can see trees unlike any I’ve ever seen before, red and orange flowered vines hanging off tangled branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I’ve never been there—have only looked down on it from orbit—somehow I know that this is Lorien. And then I realize that I know where I am because Number One knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of her memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center of the room is a large table covered with strange yet delicious-looking foods. Seated all around the table are Loric, all of them wearing fancy dresses and suits. I flinch when I see them—I’m outnumbered and my first instinct is to run, yet I’m pinned to this spot. I couldn’t move if I tried, stuck in this memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Loric are all smiling, singing. They don’t seem at all alarmed that a Mogadorian has just appeared at their party. That’s when I realize they can’t see me. Of course not, I’m just a tourist in Number One’s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there she is, seated at the head of the table. She’s so young, maybe five or six, her blond hair pulled into two braids that dangle down her back. When the adults finish singing, she claps her hands in excitement, and I realize this is her birthday celebration. We don’t celebrate such foolish occasions on Mogadore, although some great warriors are known to mark the anniversary of their first kill with a feast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a useless memory. The General won’t be impressed if all I come back with is intel on Loric birthday parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like that the world goes blurry again and I’m falling. Time passes in a rush and I’m swept along, feeling sickeningly out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother memory takes shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber One wanders through an open field, her hands extended so that the tall grasses tickle her outstretched palms. She’s maybe a year older than at the birthday party, still just a child, happily wandering around her undestroyed planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne bends down and picks some flowers, twining the stalks together, then wrapping the flower chain around her wrist like a bracelet. How much of this am I going to have to sift through?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe if I focus I can get some control of these memories. I need to see the other Garde, not this girly, happy Loric crap. I try to think about what I want to see—the faces of the Garde, their Cêpans—and then the memory in the field flashes away and I am somewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s nighttime, although the darkness is lit by dozens of fires raging nearby. The two Loric moons hang on opposite sides of the horizon. The ground shakes beneath my feet, an explosion nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber One and eight other children rush across a secluded airstrip, headed for a ship. Their Cêpans hurry them along, shouting orders. Some of the children are crying as their feet slap against the pavement. Number One is not; she stares over her shoulder as a Loric in a sleek bodysuit fires a cone of freezing cobalt energy into the face of a snarling piken. Number One’s eyes widen in admiration and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it. The First Great Expansion. Exactly the memory I need to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Run!” the Loric in the bodysuit shouts at the fleeing group of young Garde. His Legacies fully developed and powerful. Still, he’ll die on this night, just like all the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sweep my eyes over the children, trying to take in as many details as I can. There’s a feral-looking boy with long black hair and another blond girl, younger than Number One, being carried by her Cêpan. Number One is older than most of the other kids, a detail that I know will help my father construct profiles of the remaining Garde. I count how many of them are boys and how many are girls, and try to memorize their most distinguishing features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who the fuck are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice is clearer than the thunderous sounds of war from the memory, as if it’s being piped right into my brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my head and realize Number One is standing right next to me. Not the child Number One of the memory—no, this is Number One as I last saw her: blond hair flowing down her back, shoulders squared defiantly. A ghost. She’s looking right at me, expecting an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe can’t be here; that doesn’t make sense. I wave my hand in front of her face, figuring that this must be some kind of glitch in Anu’s machine. There’s no way she’s really seeing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber One slaps my hand away. I’m surprised that she can touch me, but then I remember that we’re both ghosts here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” she asks. “Who are you? You don’t belong here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re dead,” are the only words I can muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne looks down at herself. For a moment, the massive wound on her abdomen flickers into being. Just as quickly, it’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not in here.” She shrugs. “These are my memories. So in here I guess you’re stuck with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “It’s impossible. You can’t be talking to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne squints at me, thinking. “Your name is Adam, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smirks. “We’re sharing a brain, Mog-boy. Guess that means I know a thing or two about you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround us, the fleeing Garde have all boarded their ship, the engines now rumbling to life. I should be scanning the ship for any helpful details, but I’m too distracted by the dead girl sneering at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your scary-ass pops is going to be so disappointed when you wake up with nothing juicy to tell him.” She grabs me by the elbow, and the feeling is so real that I have to remind myself that this is basically just a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dream that Number One is suddenly in control of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want my memories?” she asks. “Come on. I’ll give you a guided tour.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the scene changes again, I start to understand what’s happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m trapped in here with my sworn enemy. And she seems to be in charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the memory shift is different. Before, I was falling through time, falling through memory. Now I feel still, and suddenly I’m standing outside a secluded ranch in Coahuila, Mexico. In this memory, One and her Cêpan are carrying boxes into the house. It’s moving day. This is the first place One and her Cêpan—Hilde, her Cêpan’s name was Hilde—settled after the Garde landed on Earth and parted ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait—how do I know all this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s strange. In addition to finding myself existing here, observing this particular moment in One’s life, I also have a general sense of her memories of the time. I know the things that she knows and remember what she remembers. The memories are so vivid, it’s like they’re my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like I’m her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost-One appears next to me, watching with me as the younger version of herself and Hilde unpack dishes in the kitchen. It’s creepy to have her here, gives me a feeling like vertigo. I try to ignore her, but she just keeps talking to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We stayed here for a while,” she says, sounding almost wistful. “Then Hilde thought she saw some of your peeps snooping around the city, so we had to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Garde move a lot, city to city, country to country, their movements unpredictable. My father will want to know this. It’s completely the opposite of the way we Mogadorians have done it, consolidating our power in bases across the globe. That’s why they’re so difficult to track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was sort of a drag sometimes,” says One, watching her Cêpan. “Probably a lot like your dickbag dad. Except, you know, not eeee-vil.” She rubs her fingers together and cackles an eeee-vil cackle in punctuation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-fallen-legacies-lorien-legacies-the-lost-files-3/page-3.html","bookId":1681,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:28 AM"}
