The window ain\u0027t high from the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Shucks! what do you want to slope for?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I ain\u0027t used to that kind of a crowd. I can\u0027t stand it. I ain\u0027t going down there, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, bother! It ain\u0027t anything. I don\u0027t mind it a bit. I\u0027ll take care of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSid appeared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom,\" said he, \"auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody\u0027s been fretting about you. Say -- ain\u0027t this grease and clay, on your clothes?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist \u0027tend to your own business. What\u0027s all this blow-out about, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one of the widow\u0027s parties that she\u0027s always having. This time it\u0027s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night. And say -- I can tell you something, if you want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people here to-night, but I overheard him tell auntie to-day about it, as a secret, but I reckon it\u0027s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows -- the widow, too, for all she tries to let on she don\u0027t. Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be here -- couldn\u0027t get along with his grand secret without Huck, you know!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Secret about what, Sid?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow\u0027s. I reckon Mr. Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop pretty flat.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sid, was it you that told?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, never mind who it was. Somebody told -- that\u0027s enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sid, there\u0027s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and that\u0027s you. If you had been in Huck\u0027s place you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can\u0027t do any but mean things, and you can\u0027t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones. There -- no thanks, as the widow says\" -- and Tom cuffed Sid\u0027s ears and helped him to the door with several kicks. \"Now go and tell auntie if you dare -- and to-morrow you\u0027ll catch it!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSome minutes later the widow\u0027s guests were at the supper-table, and a dozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room, after the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr. Jones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was another person whose modesty --\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck\u0027s share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However, the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody\u0027s gaze and everybody\u0027s laudations.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him educated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way. Tom\u0027s chance was come. He said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Huck don\u0027t need it. Huck\u0027s rich.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Huck\u0027s got money. Maybe you don\u0027t believe it, but he\u0027s got lots of it. Oh, you needn\u0027t smile -- I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed interest -- and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sid, what ails Tom?\" said Aunt Polly. \"He -- well, there ain\u0027t ever any making of that boy out. I never --\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"There -- what did I tell you? Half of it\u0027s Huck\u0027s and half of it\u0027s mine!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said he could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of interest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it don\u0027t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I\u0027m willing to allow.\"\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3286.html","bookId":586,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:39:50 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:39:50 AM"}
