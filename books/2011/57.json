If Vlad was the heartless creature he made himself out to be, he\u0027d utilize me to his best advantage by throwing me into the most perilous situations. But he didn\u0027t. Which was the real Vlad? The one whose heart was forever out of reach, or the man who seemed to prize my safety more than the quickest path to vengeance?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pondered that as the black SUV I was in came to a stop outside a set of tall iron gates. Maximus drove, Shrapnel rode shotgun, and I was alone in the backseat. Another SUV filled with six additional guards followed closely behind us. We were fifteen minutes from Oradea, Romania, but to look around, you wouldn\u0027t guess that a bustling city was nearby. This gate was tucked inside thick woods, the long gravel road leading to it nearly invisible from the turnoff-assuming you found the secluded road leading to that. The owner of this property either liked his privacy or he hated having unexpected visitors, which was exactly what the three of us were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaximus rolled down his window and pressed a button on the metal console that jutted out a few feet from the ground. I couldn\u0027t hear a camera zooming in on his rugged features, but I had no doubt that his image was being transmitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vlad Tepesh kuldottei Gabriel Tolvai-hoz jottek,\" he stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI only recognized the name. Gabriel Tolvai, an ally of Vlad\u0027s that, as per usual, he didn\u0027t suspect of being in league with Szilagyi. Still, it was one more name to cross off a list, even if Tolvai lived in a secluded area where the closest neighbors seemed to be of the animal variety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall gates slid open and we drove through them. After we traveled the length of a football field, Maximus pulled up to a stately, two-story white house with ochre-colored trim. The old world architecture looked like an aesthetic choice rather than the home\u0027s actual age, and while the house was large, it was still less than a fourth the size of Vlad\u0027s home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo bearded guards carrying automatic weapons stood by what looked like the main entrance. Since this was a vampire residence, I guessed the big guns were filled with silver bullets instead of lead. Maximus and Shrapnel didn\u0027t seem concerned. When we got out of the car, they didn\u0027t even look at the guards who held open the double doors for us, so I mimicked their aloof demeanor. Our other armed escort got out but stayed by the vehicles, their presence as threatening as it was silent. In my usual pattern, once I crossed the threshold into Tolvai\u0027s house, I began to recite the worst songs the eighties had to offer. No way would I risk running into another mind reader unprepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slender boy with russet-colored hair walked down the hall toward us. He wore jeans, sneakers, and a black jacket slung over an Ed Hardy T-shirt. He didn\u0027t even look old enough to drink in the States, so I was surprised when Maximus and Shrapnel inclined their heads at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greetings from our sire, Tolvai,\" Maximus said formally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTolvai responded with a burst of dialog that I didn\u0027t understand a word of. It wasn\u0027t Romanian-I\u0027d gotten better at recognizing certain words in that language-but my confusion was cut short when Shrapnel held up a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vlad requests that you speak English in front of his guest so she understands everything that is being said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that right?\" Tolvai replied, the words richly accented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmber eyes swept over me. Once I stared into them, I didn\u0027t know how I\u0027d ever mistaken Tolvai for someone younger than me. The weight of centuries reflected in those jewel-colored eyes, and the way his gaze raked me from facial scar to shoes said that a human was less than worthless to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Vlad wishes, I shall repeat myself,\" Tolvai said, smiling at me the way a great white shark would at a plump seal. \"What has happened that Vlad sent his most senior guards to my house without even a phone call to inform me of their coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Recently, four vampires set fire to one of Vlad\u0027s businesses in southern Suceava,\" Maximus stated. \"Three of the perpetrators were killed, but one escaped. Vlad is asking all of his allies to assist him in finding this last arsonist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barest smile touched Tolvai\u0027s lips. \"Of course I will offer my assistance. Any attack on a vampire\u0027s territory must be swiftly avenged lest his enemies take it as a sign of weakness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised by the veiled taunt. Tolvai hadn\u0027t been on Vlad\u0027s suspect list, but maybe he should reconsider. Shrapnel also didn\u0027t seem to appreciate the subtext. His glare could have burned holes into Tolvai\u0027s deceptively young-looking features, but the vampire didn\u0027t show the slightest amount of concern. In fact, when his gaze dipped dismissively to me again, either he was loyal-albeit sarcastic-or word of what I could do hadn\u0027t spread to him yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth were put to the test when Shrapnel said in a mild tone, \"Then you won\u0027t mind if Leila touches a few things in your home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTolvai\u0027s expression registered confusion, but not alarm. \"Miert? But why?\" he amended in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Vlad asks you to,\" was Maximus\u0027s reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone could discern the challenge wrapped in the large vampire\u0027s silky tone. Tolvai\u0027s lips tightened, and if it weren\u0027t for those ancient eyes, he\u0027d have resembled a teenager about to have a full-on temper tantrum. For several tense moments, I wondered if he\u0027d refuse. But then he swept out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Vlad wishes, then she may do so. But to quote the American saying, if she breaks anything, she buys it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Maximus and Shrapnel as I took off my right glove. \"I\u0027ll let you know if I find anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything like what?\" Tolvai asked sharply. \"Do you suggest that I am involved with this arsonist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\" Butter wouldn\u0027t have melted in Shrapnel\u0027s cool reply. \"But wouldn\u0027t you want to know if one of your people went behind your back and broke truce with Vlad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked farther down the hall, letting the vampires handle this power contest themselves. After a tense silence, Tolvai bit out, \"Vlad and I will have words about this.\" Then he swept past me in a blur, disappearing up the staircase. If I were a vampire, I imagined the scent of his anger at having his home searched would have clogged my nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at Maximus and Shrapnel, shrugged, and then continued on my way. They knew by now that I concentrated better if they didn\u0027t hover over me. Tolvai\u0027s entrance hall wasn\u0027t nearly as impressive as Vlad\u0027s, but I liked the pastel palette more than Vlad\u0027s tendency toward darker, gothic colors. I detoured at the first room, an elegant lounge with a white marble fireplace and ceilings three times as high as I was tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside, I ignored the fancy figurines or other objets d\u0027art. Years of training myself on what not to touch made it easy to choose the most essence-heavy objects. Despite their high traffic level, light switches and lamps were out of the question, but that left doorknobs, handles of any kind, drawers, armrests, pens, glasses, and the like. After I handled various objects that showed images of feeding, sex, and some harsh discipline of Tolvai\u0027s staff, I moved on to the next room. Then the next one. Maximus and Shrapnel stayed in the hallway, allowing me my space while the constant collision of memories versus reality made me feel like I was on a vivid acid trip. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-57.html","bookId":2011,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM"}
