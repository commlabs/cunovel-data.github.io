Oh, Lord, she had invited a vampire into her house! He could come in any time he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStricken, she looked over at Tom. \"I\u0027ll have to move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I invited him in. He can come in whenever he wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you tell him to go, he\u0027ll have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Just like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbie Sue stirred in Tom\u0027s arms. Her eyelids fluttered open and she frowned. \"What happened?\" She glanced around, a blush rising in her cheeks when she saw Vicki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fainted,\" Tom said, sitting her up in his lap. \"Are you all right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked confused a moment. \"Fainted? Oh, I remember now… \" She glanced at Tom and then at Vicki. \"It was just a bad joke, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish it were,\" Vicki said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbie Sue slid off Tom\u0027s lap. \"I think I want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlowing out a sigh, Duncan stood. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbie Sue started toward the front door, then paused. \"Vicki, don\u0027t forget to call Gus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to be all right, here by yourself, hon? Maybe I should stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, but I\u0027d really like to be alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But— \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about me, Bobbie. I\u0027m going to turn on all the lights and the TV, and I\u0027m not going to open the door for anyone, believe me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, all right,\" Bobbie Sue said dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come by and look in on you later,\" Duncan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, Vicki followed them to the door. She closed and locked it behind them, then looked at the clock. It was still early. In spite of what she\u0027d told Bobbie Sue, she should probably just go to work, but the thought of going out into the dark, alone, was just too daunting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing to the phone, she called Gus and told him she was sorry she hadn\u0027t called sooner, but she didn\u0027t feel up to working that night, which was certainly true enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hanging up the receiver, she went from room to room, checking the doors and windows to make sure they were locked, though it seemed a waste of time now. Falco might not be able to cross the threshold, but there was nothing to keep Battista out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even as the thought crossed her mind, she heard him calling her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipping her hand inside the collar of her uniform, she touched her grandmother\u0027s crucifix, taking comfort in the feel of the silver in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, then went to open the front door. Antonio stood on the porch in a pool of yellow lamplight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t come in,\" she said quickly. \"I forbid it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted one brow in wry amusement but he made no move to cross the threshold. \"You have nothing to fear from me, Victoria. I will not hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I meant you harm, you would be dead by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth of the words chilled her to the marrow of her bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you come to Pear Blossom Creek? What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was on my way to my house in Oregon when I stopped here to rest during the day. I sensed Falco\u0027s presence when I rose the next night. I decided to stay and see if he was also passing through to somewhere else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a soft sound in her throat. Maybe he was telling the truth. He had told her he had walked Sharlene and the other woman home to protect them, to warn them not to open their doors to strangers. If only they had listened! Or maybe they had. She recalled her own powerful urge to leave the safety of her house when Dimitri Falco had called to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you come back here tonight?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To tell you not to be afraid to go out after dark, that even though you do not see me, I will be watching you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was some trick you pulled tonight, disappearing like that. How did you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not disappear. I merely moved faster than your eyes could see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not live anywhere,\" he replied, and she heard the hint of self-mockery in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you stay when you aren\u0027t here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a house in Oregon, on the coast, and another in Maine, and one in Florida.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also have a villa inItaly and a castle inSpain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been a… a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought a moment, then said, \"Six hundred and twelve years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six hundred and twelve years,\" she repeated, her voice tinged with awe. \"That means… \" She did some quick mental arithmetic. \"You were alive in 1394.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was mind-boggling, the things he must have seen. So many changes in six hundred years. What had it been like, to watch the world change so drastically? She looked up at him, noting that there was no sign of the injuries he had incurred earlier. His skin was smooth and clear again. He had changed clothes. Black again, she noticed, and wondered if his entire wardrobe consisted of black shirts and trousers and long black dusters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must be hard to live so long and see everyone you know and love pass on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have loved no one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one in over six hundred years? Which are you, monk or eunuch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly, bitterly. \"Neither. I have had many women, but I have loved none of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed her arms over her breasts as the wind picked up, driving the rain before it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I did not wish to see them look at me the way you looked at me earlier. You should go and sit by the fire,\" he said. \"You are cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince she was shivering, there was no point in denying it. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Good night, Victoria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to leave. She watched him walk down the stairs and she realized she didn\u0027t want him to go. Okay, he was a vampire, but he had also saved her life, comforted her when she was afraid, thrilled her with his kisses. Did she really want him to leave? What if she never saw him again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was that thought that made her call, \"Wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePausing at the bottom of the stairs, he glanced over his shoulder, a question in the depths of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not going anywhere,\" he said quietly. \"I will be nearby if you need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you… Would you like to come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe regarded her a moment before climbing the stairs. He moved as quietly as a panther, and looked like one, too, she thought, with his black hair and dark attire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back and he crossed the threshold into the living room. She didn\u0027t know what was different about him tonight but she felt it, a faint tremor in the air around her as he entered her home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, she closed the door behind him, turned to find him watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you want me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can smell the fear on your skin, hear the rapid beat of your heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at him. \"You\u0027re making that up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shake of his head, he moved toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antonio, please don\u0027t go. I can\u0027t help being afraid.\" She sat down on the sofa, her hands clenched in her lap. \"This is all so new to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, he sat in the chair across from the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence stretched between them. She tried not to stare at him, but she couldn\u0027t help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had seen him wounded and bleeding only a short time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do all vampires heal so rapidly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be nice. I mean, just think of all the money you save on doctor bills. And you\u0027ll never need a face lift. And since you don\u0027t eat, you must save a fortune on groceries, and— \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Victoria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m just… I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We never had trouble talking before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but— \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did not know what I was before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze caressed her face, lingering on her lips. \"I am sorry you had to find out like this, my sweet one. I had hoped… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hoped what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does not matter now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In six hundred years, I have not wanted a woman the way I want you. I had never thought to find a woman I could trust. A woman I could love, until now. I knew it was wrong of me to hold you, to kiss you, when you did not know the truth, and yet I could not help myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice wrapped around her, as warm as a blazing fire on a cold winter night, but it was nothing compared to the heat smoldering in his eyes. Eyes that weren\u0027t the yellow of a killer stalking her small town, or red like those portrayed in horror movies, but a deep dark blue. Eyes filled with aching desire, and eons of loneliness that she could not begin to imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki licked her lips, remembering the power of his kisses, the way her whole body had responded to his touch. Earlier that night, the memory of kissing a vampire had seemed repulsive but now, suddenly, she wanted to be in his arms again, to feel his body against hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antonio… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please stay. I\u0027m not afraid when you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is best if we do not see each other again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I should have said it will be easier for me if we do not see each other again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a vampire.\" He held up his hand, silencing her. \"It is the curse of my kind to feel things more strongly than mortals. Love. Hate. Pain. Passion. All are intensified. I cannot go on being near you and not touch you.\" He paused, his gaze resting a moment on the pulse beating in the hollow of her throat. \"Not taste you.\" His eyes burned into hers, leaving no doubt as to his meaning. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-21.html","bookId":2298,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM"}
