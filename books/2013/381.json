Those two names-if not their pathetic ranks-were well known to all natives of Falar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But they’ve changed,’ Lookback said. ‘That gold skin, it’s not natural at all. I think we should kill them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawfirst, who possessed the unfortunate combination of large breasts and a tendency to perspire profusely, had taken advantage of the darkness to divest herself of her upper armour and was now mopping beneath her breasts with a cloth. Now she said, ‘But what’s the point of that, Look? The cult is dead. It’s been dead for years.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ain’t dead for us, though, is it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mostly,’ answered Shoaly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s you all right, Shoaly,’ Lookback said. Always seeing the dying and dead side of things.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So go ask ‘em, Look. And they’ll tell you the same. Fener cult’s finished.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s why I think we should kill them. For betraying the cult. For betraying us. And what’s with that gold skin anyway? It’s creepy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Listen,’ Shoaly said, ‘we just partnered with these squads. In case you forgot, Lookback, this is the company that crawled out from under Y’Ghatan. And then there’s Fiddler. A Hood-damned Bridgeburner and maybe the only one left. Gesler was once high-ranked and so was Stormy, but just like Whiskeyjack they got busted down and down, and down, and now here you are wanting to stick ‘em. The cult got outlawed and now Fener ain’t nowhere a god’s supposed to be but that ain’t Gesler’s fault. Not Stormy’s neither.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So what are you saying?’ Lookback retorted. ‘We should just leave ‘em and that’s that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Leave ‘em? Drawfirst, explain it to this fool.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had pushed her breasts back into their harness and was making some final adjustments. ‘It’s simple, Look. Not only are we stuck here, with Fid and the rest. We’re all gonna die with ‘em, too. Now, as for me-and probably Shoaly here-we’re gonna stand and fight, right at their sides. Gesler, Stormy, those cute heavies they got. And when we finally fall, nobody’s gonna be able to say we wasn’t worth that standing there beside ‘em. Now, maybe it’s because you’re the last heavy in Primly’s squad. Maybe if Masker was still with you, you’d not be talking the way you’re talking. So now you gotta choose, Lookback. Fight with us, fight with Reliko and Vastly Blank in Badan Gruk’s squad, or fight on your own as the sole fist in Primly’s. But every one of those choices is still fighting. Creep up behind Ges or Stormy and I’ll lop your head off myself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right all right, I was just making conversation-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds from their left drew the heavies upright, reaching for weapons. Three figures padding down the main street towards them. Strap Mull, Skim and Neller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkim called out in a low voice, ‘Soldiers on the way. Look sharp.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Letherii?’ Shoaly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ she replied, halting opposite them while the other two marines continued on into the tavern. ‘Picture in your heads the ugliest faces you ever seen, and you then kissin’ them big and wet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Finally,’ Drawfirst sighed, ‘some good news for a change.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeak and the captain made their way back to where Fist Keneb waited at the head of the column. There had been Tiste Edur ahead of them for some time, unwilling to engage, but now they were gone, at least between here and yon village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain drew close to the Fist. ‘Beak says they’re marines, Fist. Seems we found some of them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All of them,’ Beak said. ‘The ones who got far ahead of the rest. They’re in the village and they’ve been killing Tiste Edur. Lots of Tiste Edur.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The munitions we heard yesterday.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just so, Fist,’ Beak said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right, finally some good news. How many?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seven, eight squads,’ Beak replied. He delighted in being able to talk, in person, with a real Fist. Oh, he’d imagined scenes like this, of course, with Beak there providing all kinds of information to make the Fist do all the heroic things that needed doing, and then at last Beak himself being the biggest hero of all. He was sure everyone had dreams like that, the sudden revealing of some hidden, shy side that no-one else knew anything about and couldn’t ever have guessed was even there. Shy, until it was needed, and then out it came, amazing everyone! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-381.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
