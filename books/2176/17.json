(Unless he killed Art and dumped his body as he darted between worlds, says an inner voice which I ignore.) So I search for my brother instead. To my surprise, it takes me a few seconds to bring up an image of him. His face is hazy in my mind and I have to concentrate hard to make it clear. For some odd reason, I think of the orange marbles which he was playing with before he was stolen. He dropped them on his way to the window and I picked them up. Put them in my pocket. I reach in and touch them now, and when I do that, I click on an image of Art in Sally\u0027s house, that night in the bedroom when he was holding them up in front of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I recall that, a number of lights round me pulse. Many are orange, reminding me of the orange patch I saw over Art\u0027s head that time. Maybe individual colours are associated with certain people. I must take more notice of the colours the next time I\u0027m looking for someone, to check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0027t reached out to the lights yet. I find myself reluctant to start. Afraid almost. Because now, finally, I have to face the facts. If Art\u0027s dead, I\u0027ll know as soon as I step through the window. I\u0027ve been living in hope, trying to convince myself that he\u0027s alive and well. But once I put these pulsing lights together, hope will vanish, leaving me with the truth. Which is fine if Cadaver hasn\u0027t killed him. But if he has...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI steel myself against the possible awfulness of the discovery. I can\u0027t falter now, when I\u0027m so close. If I\u0027d known about my gift earlier, I could have gone after him from that first demon world. But this has been a learning process. I\u0027ve found out things about myself, and this strange universe, bit by bit. Time to put my learning to good use - and pray it\u0027s not too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a deep breath. Scratch an itchy spot on my head. Start to slot the lights into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe window is orange when it forms, which is no great surprise. I step back from it, nervous, thinking about how angry Beranabus will be if Art isn\u0027t with Cadaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magician steps up to the window and sniffs at it. Looks back at us. There\u0027s a glint to his eyes which, looking round, I see reflected in Shark\u0027s. The eager glint of men who enjoy fighting. Sharmila looks scared. Dervish seems more confused than anything else. He\u0027s put his leather jacket on and is stroking one of his spiky clumps of hair for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nadia,\" Beranabus calls. She\u0027s still sitting with her back to us, though her shoulders are no longer heaving. At the call, she stands and turns. Her pale, pockmarked face is composed, like a mask. Her eyes are red from crying but there are no fresh tears. She walks towards us at an even pace, stops close to Beranabus, looks at him without interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to concentrate,\" Beranabus says. \"See if you can gain an insight which might let us know what\u0027s on the other side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia smiles coldly. \"I\u0027m not feeling very insightful,\" she says then steps through the window before Beranabus can respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeranabus curses, but the slightest look of guilt flits across his face. He shrugs it off and nods sharply at Sharmila. \"You next. I\u0027ll come after you. Then the boy, Dervish and Shark. Is everybody ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready for what?\" Dervish asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeranabus chuckles. \"Hell, most likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebs everywhere. Strand after strand, some the thickness of several trees placed together, others as fine as a length of thread. A gloomy, silvery, moonless sky, dotted with giant meteor-like demons. Nothing but blackness when I look down through the many layers of web. I wriggle my bare toes over the moist, sticky fabric of the strand. It\u0027s like standing on candyfloss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a demon close to us, a nightmarish beast. He has the body of a child but the head of an adult. Pale green skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo hair, but a wig-like cluster of lice scuttle around his scalp, feeding on his flesh, digging holes through to his brain. No eyes - instead, a ball of fire burns in either socket. A large mouth full of sharp teeth, no tongue. Two smaller mouths set in his palms, one in either hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon hisses when he sees us, turns and races away at a great speed, crisscrossing the network of webs, leaping from one level to another. Nobody gives chase, not even Shark. We\u0027ve just spotted the castle towards which the demon is running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA castle of webs, set amidst a cluster of extra thick strands. It looks like a medieval castle, except ten times bigger. Taller than any skyscraper I\u0027ve ever seen, wider than a couple of street blocks in the city where I used to live. Towers and turrets galore. Several huge drawbridges. Everything spun out of webs. Glistening and forbidding, even from this distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a moat round the castle. The hell-child leaps across it with ease, but instead of waiting for the drawbridge to be lowered, he scales the outside wall of the castle like a spider. Disappears through a narrow window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is bad,\" Beranabus says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know this place?\" Sharmila asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the home of a demon master called Lord Loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like his style,\" Shark grunts, then looks around. \"So, where\u0027s the demon we\u0027re meant to be chasing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where else?\" Beranabus points to the castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\" Dervish asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No demon can set foot here without Lord Loss\u0027 permission. Only his familiars and those he chooses to shelter are welcome. Cadaver isn\u0027t one of his slaves, so I\u0027m guessing he asked for sanctuary and it was granted - otherwise he would have fled from here already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Company\u0027s coming,\" Nadia says, smirking at us crookedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spot scores of demons wriggling through the windows of the castle and over the tops of turrets. A couple of the drawbridges are lowered and more of the monsters advance over them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish glances back at the orange window, still open behind us. He looks at Beranabus questioningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" the magician says after a moment\u0027s hesitation. \"We can\u0027t defeat Lord Loss on his own territory. But maybe we can bargain with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bargain with a demon?\" Sharmila frowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not like other demons. He prefers suffering to execution - he feeds on the misery of the living rather than the bodies of the dead. He won\u0027t kill us swiftly. If we can find some way to amuse him... give him something which Cadaver can\u0027t... maybe he\u0027ll turn the thief over to us. And let us go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really believe that?\" Sharmila asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Beranabus chuckles drily. \"But it\u0027s the only hope we have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the demons are upon us. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-17.html","bookId":2176,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM"}
