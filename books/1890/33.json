I beamed, I couldn’t even stop myself, \"Luce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"The whole gang is here. Arthur, Tex, Daniela, Sal, me and Will. We all came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother bustled in, no doubt smelling the money and position all over his Armani suit. \"Jacqueline, who is your friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly laughed, \"Lucian Nooruddin, this is my mother, Mrs. Jillian Croix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother held her hand out like he might kiss it. Of course he did. She blushed, \"Not of the Nooruddin family in Bahrain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have to murder my big-mouthed sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushed, \"Yes, but I\u0027m more like Nooruddin who plays for Boston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother\u0027s face got tight, \"With Michael?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him the fake smile and me a slightly-worried look, \"It was lovely to have met you. Thank you for coming, but I must get back to my guests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a subtle nod, \"I am so sorry for your loss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t even try to accept the condolences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a look, \"If you ever have the misfortune of meeting my parents, you will see that look perfected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, \"I am so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"Jacqueline, never apologize for other people. I have long been the wrong kind of Nooruddin, your mother has nothing on my parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that story all too well.\" I stepped closer to him, wanting so badly to mention the handkerchief, but I loved the mystery and romance of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down on me, \"How are you holding up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip, \"I would love to be sad for his death, but I am sadder for his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark-green eyes sparkled, \"I pity our parents, they have no idea what a simple glass of wine and a sunset can feel like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"Or a painting of a man when he was a young man. Long before he was beheaded for his beliefs and humble ways.\" He lit me up inside with a joie de vivre. I could have gotten drunk off of the inspiration he put into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped an arm around my shoulder and led me back into the rest of the house, \"The funeral was lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"It was far too lovely but his friends are as fake as he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill walked up to us, opening his arms for me. I hugged him, \"Thanks for coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"Of course. How are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"She is upstairs, crying still, but I doubt very much it has much to do with our father\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his gaze, \"Does everyone know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"I came to be supportive. That’s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped his hand, \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSal, Arthur, Tex and Daniela made their way over to me. I hugged each and stepped back into our circle, \"Thank you for coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur shook his head, \"Sorry about your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"Thank you. Are you making a trip out of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela gave Tex a pout, \"No. We have to go back. They have games.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTex wrapped a beefy arm around her, \"Now come on. We talked about this. We\u0027ll be stateside all summer long.\" He winked at me, \"I heard someone might be opening a winery and we could all stop by for a tasting, since Mike ruined the last one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Who told you such lies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded his head at Will. Will put his hands in the air, \"I heard it through the vine of doom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cocked an eyebrow, \"I\u0027m not sure. I doubt I\u0027ll be able to pull it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill crossed his arms, \"Well, the way I heard it, you wouldn’t have much choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, \"I have two weeks to think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce looked down on me, \"A villa of your own to drink your own label and make it as amazing as that castle in Rome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t stop the smile crossing my lips. I noticed the hateful looks I was getting from the people at the funeral and toned it down a little, \"Yes. It would be mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce shrugged, \"I think you should do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur and Sal nodded. Tex slapped me on the arm, \"Make a villa like the one in Rome and we\u0027ll be there all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. Even with that threat lingering in the air, I couldn’t stop thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike came over to our little chat with a tray of drinks. I smiled, \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at the kitchen, \"There aren’t enough people to serve what\u0027s made. Your dad firing all the staff really put your mom in a bind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a drink and shook my head, \"You are too nice to my mom. She hates you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whined at me, \"Jack, that’s all an act. She hit on me an hour ago.\" He nodded at Will, \"Get a tray, slackers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood back and watched as three NHL stars and three Italian league stars served the drinks and food at my father\u0027s funeral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela slid up next to me with her drink, \"What\u0027s up with you and Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. Friends.\" I looked up at her, \"I am sorry for what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, \"Not me. Tex is the right one. He keeps me on my toes. Mike was too easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"He is still too easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winked, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost sneered, but I managed to keep my hateful expressions to myself. If he was having sex with her, that was his choice. Of course, the fact I\u0027d offered myself to him and he\u0027d turned me down made me feel a little sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleanor came slinking up in a cute grey dress and huge crimson heels. She smiled, \"I am so sorry to hear about your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled politely, \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at Daniela, noticing she was no longer the prettiest girl in the room, \"How is your mother holding up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"Devastated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn queue, my mother laughed from the kitchen with Muriel. They just needed one more widow to complete the Bitches of Eastwick, the Hamptons version.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you are still friends with Mike France?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled again, desperate to keep the plastic look on my face, \"Yes. He\u0027s a dear friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winked, \"You can give him my number if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela laughed, \"Let me guess, you tried to give it to him and he turned you down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleanor\u0027s face grew tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela waved a hand, \"It was lovely of you to come.\" And with that, Eleanor was dismissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snickered and pointed at the group of women I used to call best friends, \"Can you come with me to see the mean girls of the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winked at me, \"I am the mean girl of the party. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe linked her arm into mine and walked with me to Angela, Helena, and Diane. They all gave me a sympathetic smile and tilted their heads perfectly, \"Oh, how are you?\" Diane asked, giving me a pathetic hug. I smiled at the three of them, \"Wonderful. I mean Dad died, but whatever. I\u0027ve been traveling Europe for months, living at vineyards, and drinking wine. I was just at Daniela\u0027s wedding just outside of Rome. It was held at a four hundred-year-old castle, amazing. How are you all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane smiled, \"Great. The kids are busy with activities and our eldest is in school now, so that’s really busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelena gave me the same sweet look the others were giving me, \"Spending the summer with my mother in the South of France again. Richard is working hard this year with land deals. You know how I love the South of France.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and looked at Angela. She shook her head, \"Miserable. I have missed you. My mother forced me to go to Phil\u0027s joke of a wedding to that child. She is a spoiled bitch, who I heard, has got him nearly broke. His dad is footing the bill for things because she is so high maintenance. Speaking of high maintenance, my kids are driving me insane and it\u0027s not even summer yet. I wish I were traveling with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a genuine smile, \"Well, I wish I were married and having babies with someone I loved.\" I paused, \"Maybe not babies, maybe wine. But same thing. I wish I had something that was mine. The traveling is a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela rolled her eyes, \"Sounds horrid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelena finally stopped faking it and started acting normal, \"I love that the NHL is serving at this funeral. You know you\u0027re rich when.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"It was a fundraiser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked an eyebrow. I shook my head, \"Father fired all of the staff a few months ago. Mother has been roughing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three made a face, \"Dear God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Daniela but she had the same look. I nodded, \"Yes. It was horrible.\" I felt like that first-world problems commercial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane took my hand, \"Your father was so crazy the last year. Your family has been through a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sick and tired of fucking smiling. I gave her a sad face, \"Yes, it was an ordeal.\" Little did they know, how much of one. If they ever knew how my year had been spent, they would never have believed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela excused herself and instantly they started the gossiping, \"Who is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"She is sweet. Stay on her good side but she is sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce circled over, kissing my cheek and passing me a drink, \"There you are, my love.\" He walked off with the full tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned but I didn’t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela, no doubt to blame for that little act, was back with a drink herself. She nudged me, \"You scored. Who else would be so lucky to snag one of the richest men in the whole world, and have him so well trained that he serves at your father\u0027s wake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to correct her but she leaned into my friends, \"Lucian Nooruddin\u0027s family are some of the wealthiest bankers in the world, and he is the only son of the family. He is smitten with Miss Thing here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed and looked down, \"He is not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nudged me harder, \"He absolutely is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls were green-eyed with jealously. I let it slide. It wasn’t entirely true, but it would make my mother happy to have it circulate.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-33.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
