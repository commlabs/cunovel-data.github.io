Jesus. My retriever does a better job than this.\" He snatches the tape from my hands where I have squished it a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is like Michelle. She is more like her than I imagined. I\u0027ve created a monster. I step back and walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m catching a late-afternoon flight to see her parents and go over the final plan for the meeting on her real birthday in a week. I am scared to have to show them the person I accidentally helped make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart gives me a desperate look, \"Is she asking Angelo out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I think me and you might need a new gym to fight at. I don’t want to go to jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps forward, \"I don’t care about jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod at the showers, \"Let\u0027s wait for him in the change room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look in his eyes is insane. There is no way he can have a normal talk with Angelo. I grab him and drag him to our gear. I grab the bags and pull him to the Tahoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is vibrating when we get to the truck. \"Why is she doing this? What could she possibly want to hurt me that bad for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him and try to be calm and not say the things I want to say, \"She is a bad person, Stu. She doesn’t love you. She doesn’t. That’s not love. That is awful. I don’t even know what to say about it, except that you need to move on. It\u0027s been months of this. She is stringing you along with the texts and trying to make you jealous, but I honestly think it\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens his mouth to argue but he doesn’t. He can\u0027t. There is nothing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive us to my parents and knock on the door. My mother answers and glances at my workout clothes, \"Hello, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point at the truck, \"Can he stay with you? He\u0027s been through a bad breakup and we\u0027re all he has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face turns worried. She opens the door, \"Of course. I\u0027ll have Franklin make all his favorite foods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"Where is Franklin?\" She never answers the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles, \"He went to get some things the deli forgot to put in the order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes me smile. I can\u0027t even imagine my parents in a grocery store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the door of the truck and open it, \"Come on, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbs out, looking confused, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom smiles sweetly, \"Stuart, honey. Come inside and I\u0027ll make you some of that tea you like so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart gives me a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"I have to go to Chicago and see the Mastermen family. You can\u0027t be alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom takes his hand from mine and drags him inside, \"We\u0027ll pour you a nice bubble bath and you can relax, and afterward you can tell me all about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and kiss my mom on the cheek, \"See you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart has the look of a hostage but I know he loves my mom. She is cold and detached and unloving to me in every way, but she adores Stuart, as does my dad. It\u0027s easy to love him, they know none of his secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closes the door, winking at me. He won\u0027t have time to feel sorry for himself. She will drive him insane with her snobbery and bizarre stories of who came to which party with whom and how ridiculous it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get to Chicago at seven and drive for their neighborhood. Richard answers the door with a beaming smile, \"Eli!\" Seeing them now is so different. They are so grateful and alive inside. They even went on a cruise a few months ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hugs me and pulls me inside. They live vicariously through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen rushes down the stairs when I get inside, \"Eli!\" She wraps herself around me. I hug and smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish they had been the parents I had come home to after Em died. No matter what Sarah has been through, they will love her and welcome her warmly and forget everything else. My parents were so cold and detached. They saw my failure. They knew I didn’t protect her like I should have. Helen and Richard are not like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"She is blissfully normal. It\u0027s ridiculous how far she has come in the last few months since Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen\u0027s eyes water and Richard inhales slowly as if trying not to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she still want to see us on her birthday?\" Helen\u0027s voice breaks. I can see the preparation for disappointment in her eyes. I nod, \"She does. She really does. We walk up the stairs and I start the explanation for how it will all go. It was Jane\u0027s original plan to be part of it, but she will have no part in this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will we finally meet the doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"She died. It was tragic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both gasp. I nod, \"Heart condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt isn’t so far from the truth, Jane is gone from Boston. An envelope was delivered days ago with the last of the money she will ever see from my family, and pictures that would end everything. She would get jail time for them. Pictures of a young man, not yet legal, being whipped by his physician and taught to like being dominated. I didn’t take pictures of the encounter years later, where I dominated her and fucked her. I would hate for her to have anything she could enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard passes me a cold beer. It is the only house in the world where I drink beer, because I don’t have the heart to tell them I hate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is doing well, she is enjoying college and she is no longer trapped by anything. She is free and ready to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen starts to cry fully. She always does. She wipes her face, stammering, \"I just—I don’t know how we can ever thank you. I don’t know what to say or do to make it up to you. I don’t understand why or how you would ever help, but I am grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes water too. She does this every time but I\u0027m dying inside with every word she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did it all for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did it all for love, my love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave their house the next day, just wishing I could somehow still be part of their family when it all ends and she is with them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dial Stuart from the airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounds better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"How\u0027s it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffs, \"Did you know dudes could get a pedicure and they just put clear polish on your toes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. He is everything I need sometimes. I shake my head, \"She is going to have you waxing your eyebrows soon. Don’t fall for that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"I think they’re good. They\u0027re way cleaner than before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh harder, \"Stu, the only people who notice a guy\u0027s eyebrows are gay guys. Until they grow back in you\u0027re going to have a lot of dinner invitations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is silent for a second, \"Oh snap. You know what, I do kinda look like those two guys who do the property renovations on that girlie channel. My grandma loved that shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and sigh, \"That’s about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You almost home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe goes quiet, \"I gotta go, man. She is making something called a dirty martini and making me try it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimace, the olive juice always makes me gag, \"Good luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs and hangs up. We may not be perfect or normal, or even barely a family, but we have each other. We will never be the Mastermen family. They\u0027re about to get their daughter back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake up the morning of her birthday and drive over to the dorm. I have a plan for the entire day. Flowers, hair, spa, and then meet her parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I discover is Sebastian walking into the dorms with flowers, daisies. They are her favorite flower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe week that I have left her alone and let her cool off from the lies Jane told her, has proved to be a disaster. It has pushed her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe goes in and she comes out moments later. They walk and smile and I feel sick. I do the thing I don’t want to do. I follow them. They get into the car laughing and happy but after a minute she gets out. She looks angry. He jumps out of the car and rushes to her, kissing her savagely. I don’t turn away. The white noise comes and makes me watch. It freezes my face to make sure I suffer as much as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch her hands climb up his hair, pulling him down on her. He pushes her back into the car and storms to his side. He is pissed off. I hurry to my car and follow them. He drives like a maniac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turn into the underground parking of a building. I park on the road, frozen. They are going to fuck. She is going to give him everything that is mine. I smash my head down on the steering wheel, \"You win, Jane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stay there as long as I have to, hoping to see her leave looking like she just ate too many waffles or had a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dread seeing that satisfied look on her face, but I force myself to wait and see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when she does come, hours later, she doesn’t look the same. She looks haunted and upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did he do to her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugs herself and walks along the street. She doesn’t see me or anything. She shakes her head and looks back at the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever he did, she doesn’t have the carefree ’Ha, I got you to like me’ look she always does when she leaves my place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cock an eyebrow and let a glimmer of hope in that she couldn’t do it. She doesn’t like him the way she does me, maybe. I want to go to his apartment and beat the ever-loving shit out of him and make him tell me what they did, but it\u0027s time to pick her parents up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive to the airport in a trance. I should be excited. The whole journey is about to come to an end, but I\u0027m not. I haven’t won her over and when I give her back to them, I will have no reason to see her anymore. She will be theirs. She always was theirs. I have no legitimate rights to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I pull up, they\u0027re waiting with frightened faces and hopeful eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get out and smile, \"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of them nod. Lyle, one of her brothers, smiles, \"I feel sick I\u0027m so excited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I know that feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard and I put the bags in the back and climb into the company SUV I took so we would all fit. My car hardly fits me and Stuart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotel is close so they don’t have time to be nervous. They\u0027re excited, scared, and jittery. Everything they say is too loud and not quite funny. Everyone is on edge. We get to the valet and I smile, \"I will stand outside and wait for her. You guys go on up.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-29.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
