His wife thought he was out of town on business. I thought Amelia had gone to visit her sister in Denver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia said nothing, just shook her head sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After the funeral his widow and I talked. We both decided that, for the sake of her son and mine, we would let the story stand about her husband having given my wife a lift to Colorado. Everyone bought it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" She lowered her fingers. \"I\u0027m sorry, Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to feel sorry for me.\" He took his hands off her shoulders and cupped her face between his palms. \"I just want you to understand why I\u0027ve been a little reluctant to rush back into a serious relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set his jaw. \"I am not scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are. You made the kind of mistake that Hartes aren\u0027t supposed to make. You screwed up and married the wrong woman once, and you\u0027re absolutely terrified of screwing up again. So it\u0027s easier to play it safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made a mistake. I\u0027ll give you that much. And it\u0027s true that Hartes don\u0027t usually make those kinds of mistakes. But I\u0027ll never regret it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe comprehended immediately. \"Because of Carson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amelia gave me my son. I will always be thankful to her memory for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you will, and that is as it should be. But that doesn\u0027t mean that deep down you\u0027re not afraid of trusting your emotions again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not afraid,\" he said evenly, \"but I am damn careful these days. Amelia and I rushed into marriage because we both thought passion was enough. It wasn\u0027t. Next time around, I\u0027m going to take my time and make certain that I know what I\u0027m doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what I think? I think you\u0027re being so careful that you get nervous when there\u0027s even a hint that a relationship might cross the line between casual and serious.\" She searched his face. \"Is that what happened the other night? Did you panic because you thought our one-night stand might turn into something more than that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the last time, I did not panic. And for the record, I never intended it to be a one-night stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon, did you freak out because you were worried that our little summer fling might get too heavy and too complicated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe refused to let her push him into losing his temper. He was trying to accomplish an objective here. Hartes never lost sight of their goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct me if I\u0027m wrong,\" he said, \"but I was under the impression that you weren\u0027t looking for anything more than a short-term arrangement either, Miss Free Spirit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flushed. \"I wasn\u0027t the one who ran for the door that night. I was doing just fine with the summer-fling thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not run for the door. I left in a hurry, but I did not run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Important details. And I\u0027d like to remind you that I showed up at your gallery the next morning,\" he said. \"It\u0027s not like I didn\u0027t call. And how the hell do you think I felt when you told me that the sex had been therapeutic? You made it sound like a good massage or a tonic, damn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip. \"Well, it was, in a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. Well, do me a favor. The next time you want physical therapy, call a masseuse or a chiropractor. Or buy a vibrator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened. She was starting to look a little unnerved, he thought. For some reason, that gave him an unholy amount of satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t push me,\" she warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t been pushing you.\" He hauled her close. \"This is what I call pushing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her, using everything he had to seduce her into a response. He was not sure what he expected, but he knew what he wanted. He had his agenda. He was going to make her admit that the sex hadn\u0027t been merely a therapeutic tonic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was vaguely surprised and somewhat reassured when she made no move to free herself. After an instant\u0027s hesitation, her mouth softened under his. Her arms went around his neck and her fingers sank into his hair. Heat swirled through him, igniting his senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been right about this much, at least, he thought. She still wanted him. Nothing had changed on that front. He could feel the passion quickening within her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she shivered in his arms and tightened her hold on him, his triumph was tempered by the sheer enormousness of his sense of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dragged his mouth away from hers and nibbled on her earlobe. \"It was good between us. Give me that much at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never said that it wasn\u0027t good.\" She tipped her head back, giving him access to her throat. \"It was great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why not enjoy it?\" The taste of her skin and the herbal fragrance of her hair combined into an intoxicating perfume. He knew that he would never forget her scent as long as he lived. \"We have the rest of the summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tensed in his arms. Her fingers stopped moving through his hair. Very slowly she pulled away and raised her lashes. \"Maybe you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed the tip of her nose. \"No maybe about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible that I overreacted the other night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understandable,\" he assured her. \"You were coming off a difficult year. A lot of emotional stuff going on in your life. You\u0027re making some major decisions about your business and your future. Lot of stress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you were right about one thing,\" he offered, feeling generous now. \"Okay, it\u0027s not easy to think of myself as a sort of physical therapist, but I have to admit that there is a therapeutic side to really good sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably releases a lot of endorphins, and then there\u0027s the exercise aspect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Exercise.\" He was not sure this was going the direction he had intended, but it wasn\u0027t like he had a lot of alternatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rather like taking a brisk walk on the beach, I think,\" she mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made himself count to ten and forced a smile. \"No need to analyze it too much. Sex is perfectly natural and there\u0027s no reason that two healthy, responsible adults who happen to be single and uncommitted shouldn\u0027t enjoy it together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did step back then, slipping out from under his hands. \"I\u0027ll think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not move. \"You\u0027ll think about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She turned and went down the steps. \"I can\u0027t give you an answer tonight. I\u0027m not thinking clearly right now, and I don\u0027t want to make another rash decision based on overheated emotions. I\u0027m sure you can understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now who\u0027s panicking?\" he asked softly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-47.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
