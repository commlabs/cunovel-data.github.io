What would Dr. Stein tell him to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen the door. I can\u0027t; she\u0027s locked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk to her. I can\u0027t; she won\u0027t listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurn on your air. I can\u0027t; she has control of the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet control of the system. I can\u0027t; she is in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFind help inside the room. I can\u0027t; there is nothing left to help me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen leave. I can\u0027t; I -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. That wasn\u0027t true. He could leave by smashing a porthole, or, for that matter, by opening the hatch in the ceiling. But there was no place to go. He didn\u0027t have a suit. The water was freezing. He had been exposed to that freezing water for only a few seconds and he had nearly died. If he were to leave the room for the open ocean, he would almost surely die. He\u0027d probably be fatally chilled before the chamber even filled with water. He would surely die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his mind he saw Stein raise his bushy eyebrows, give his quizzical smile. So? You\u0027ll die anyway. What have you got to lose?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA plan began to form in Norman\u0027s mind. If he opened the ceiling hatch, he could go outside the habitat. Once outside, perhaps he could make his way down to A Cyl, get back in through the airlock, and put his suit on. Then he would be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he could make it to the airlock. How long would that take? Thirty seconds? A minute? Could he hold his breath that long? Could he withstand the cold that long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll die anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he thought, You damn fool, you\u0027re holding an oxygen bottle in your hand; you have enough air if you don\u0027t stay here, wasting time worrying. Get on with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he thought, there\u0027s something else, something I\u0027m forgetting. ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet on with it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he stopped thinking, and climbed up to the ceiling hatch at the top of the cylinder. Then he held his breath, braced himself, and spun the wheel, opening the hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Norman! Norman, what are you doing? Norman! You are insa - \" he heard Beth shout, and then the rest was lost in the roar of freezing water pouring like a mighty waterfall into the habitat, filling the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment he was outside, he realized his mistake. He needed weights. His body was buoyant, tugging him up toward the surface. He sucked a final breath, dropped the oxygen bottle, and desperately gripped the cold pipes on the outside of the habitat, knowing that if he lost his grip, there would be nothing to stop him, nothing to grab onto, all the way to the surface. He would reach the surface and explode like a balloon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding the pipes, he pulled himself down, hand over hand, looking for the next pipe, the next protrusion to grab. It was like mountain-climbing in reverse; if he let go, he would fall upward and die. His hands were long since numb. His body was stiff with cold, slow with cold. His lungs burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had very little time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the bottom, swung under D Cyl, pulled himself along, felt in the darkness for the airlock. It wasn\u0027t there! The airlock was gone! Then he saw he was beneath B Cyl. He moved over to A, felt the airlock. The airlock was closed. He tugged the wheel. It was shut tight. He pulled on it, but he could not move it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was locked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most intense fear gripped him. His body was almost immobile from cold; he knew he had only a few seconds of consciousness remaining. He had to open the hatch. He pounded it, pounded the metal around the rim, feeling nothing in his numb hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wheel began to spin by itself. The hatch popped open. There must have been an emergency button, he must have - He burst above the surface of the water, gasped air, and sank again. He came back up, but he couldn\u0027t climb out into the cylinder. He was too numb, his muscles frozen, his body unresponsive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to do it, he thought. You have to do it. His fingers gripped metal, slipped off, gripped again. One pull, he thought. One last pull. He heaved his chest over the metal rim, flopped onto the deck. He couldn\u0027t feel anything, he was so cold. He twisted his body, trying to pull his legs up, and fell back into the icy water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled himself up again, one last time - again over the rim, again onto the deck, and he twisted, twisted, one leg up, his balance precarious, then the other leg, he couldn\u0027t really feel it, and then he was out of the water, and lying on the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shivering. He tried to stand, and fell over. His whole body was shaking so hard he could not keep his balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the airlock he saw his suit, hanging on the wall of the cylinder. He saw the helmet, \"JOHNSON\" stenciled on it. Norman crawled toward the suit, his body shaking violently. He tried to stand, and could not. The boots of his suit were directly in front of his face. He tried to grip them in his hands, but his hands could not close. He tried to bite the suit, to pull himself up with his teeth, but his teeth were chattering uncontrollably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intercom crackled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Norman! I know what you\u0027re doing, Norman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny minute, Beth would be here. He had to get into the suit. He stared at it, inches from him, but his hands still shook, he could not hold anything. Finally he saw the fabric loops near the waist to clip instruments. He hooked one hand into the loop, managed to hold on. He pulled himself upright. He got one foot into the suit, then the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Norman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for the helmet. The helmet drummed in a staccato beat against the wall before he managed to get it free of the peg and drop it over his head. He twisted it, heard the click of the snap-lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still very cold. Why wasn\u0027t the suit heating up? Then he realized, no power. The power was in the tank pack. Norman backed up against the tank, shrugged it on, staggered under the weight. He had to hook the umbilicus - he reached behind him, felt it - held it - hook it into the suit - at the waist - hook it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard a click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fan hummed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt long streaks of pain all over his body. The electrical elements were heating, painful against his frozen skin. He felt pins and needles all over. Beth was talking - he heard her through the intercom - but he couldn\u0027t listen to her. He sat heavily on the deck, breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut already he knew that he was going to be all right; the pain was lessening, his head was clearing, and he was no longer shaking so badly. He had been chilled, but not long enough for it to be central. He was recovering fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio crackled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never get to me, Norman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got to his feet, pulled on his weight belt, locked the buckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Norman!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing. He felt quite warm now, quite normal. \"Norman! I am surrounded by explosives! If you come anywhere near me, I will blow you to pieces! You\u0027ll die, Norman! You\u0027ll never get near me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Norman wasn\u0027t going to Beth. He had another plan entirely. He heard his tank air hiss as the pressure equalized in his suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumped back into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e0500 HOURS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphere gleamed in the light. Norman saw himself reflected in its perfectly polished surface, then saw his image break up, fragmented on the convolutions, as he moved around to the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like a mouth, he thought. Like the maw of some primitive creature, about to eat him. Confronted by the sphere, seeing once again the alien, unhuman pattern of the convolutions, he felt his intention dissolve. He was suddenly afraid. He didn\u0027t think he could go through with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t be silly, he told himself. Harry did it. And Beth did it. They survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe examined the convolutions, as if for reassurance. But there wasn\u0027t any reassurance to be obtained. Just curved grooves in the metal, reflecting back the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, he thought finally. I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027ve come this far, I\u0027ve survived everything so far. I might as well do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo ahead and open up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sphere did not open. It remained exactly as it was, a gleaming, polished, perfect shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the purpose of the thing? He wished he understood its purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of Dr. Stein again. What was Stein\u0027s favorite line? \"Understanding is a delaying tactic.\" Stein used to get angry about that. When the graduate students would intellectualize, going on and on about patients and their problems, he would interrupt in annoyance, \"Who cares? Who cares whether we understand the psychodynamics in this case? Do you want to understand how to swim, or do you want to jump in and start swimming? Only people who are afraid of the water want to understand it. Other people jump in and get wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, Norman thought. Let\u0027s get wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to face the sphere, and thought, Open up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphere did not open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open up,\" he said aloud. The sphere did not open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he knew that wouldn\u0027t work, because Ted had tried it for hours. When Harry and Beth went in, they hadn\u0027t said anything. They just did something in their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, focused his attention, and thought, Open up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes and looked at the sphere. It was still closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am ready for you to open up, he thought. I am ready now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened. The sphere did not open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman hadn\u0027t considered the possibility that he would be unable to open the sphere. After all, two others had already done it. How had they managed it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry, with his logical brain, had been the first to figure it out. But Harry had only figured it out after he had seen Beth\u0027s tape. So Harry had discovered a clue in the tape, an important clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth had also reviewed the tape, watching it again and again, until she finally figured it out, too. Something in the tape ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad he didn\u0027t have the tape here, Norman thought. But he had seen it often, he could probably reconstruct it, play it back in his mind. How did it go? In his mind he saw the images: Beth and Tina talking. Beth eating cake. Then Tina had said something about the tapes being stored in the submarine. And Beth said something back. Then Tina had moved away, out of the picture, but she had said, \"Do you think they\u0027ll ever get the sphere open?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Beth said, \"Maybe. I don\u0027t know.\" And the sphere had opened at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think they\u0027ll ever get the sphere open?\" Tina had asked. And in response to such a question, Beth must have imagined the sphere open, must have seen an image of the open sphere in her mind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a deep, low rumble, a vibration that filled the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphere was open, the door gaping wide and black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it, he thought. Visualize it happening and it happens. Which meant that if he also visualized the sphere door closed -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith another deep rumble, the sphere closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- or open -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphere opened again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better not press my luck,\" he said aloud. The door was still open. He peered in the doorway but saw only deep, undifferentiated blackness. It\u0027s now or never, he thought. He stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphere closed behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is darkness, and then, as his eyes adjust, something like fireflies. It is a dancing, luminous foam, millions of points of light, swirling around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is this? he thinks. All he sees is the foam. There is no structure to it and apparently no limit. It is a surging ocean, a glistening, multifaceted foam. He feels great beauty and peace. It is restful to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves his hands, scooping the foam, his movements making it swirl. But then he notices that his hands are becoming transparent, that he can see the sparkling foam through his own flesh. He looks down at his body. His legs, his torso, everything is becoming transparent to the foam. He is part of the foam. The sensation is very pleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grows lighter. Soon he is lifted, and floats in the limitless ocean foam. He puts his hands behind his neck and floats. He feels happy. He feels he could stay here forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe becomes aware of something else in this ocean, some other presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anybody here?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost jumps, it is so loud. Or it seems loud. Then he wonders if he has heard anything at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you speak?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow are we communicating? he wonders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way everything communicates with everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich way is that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do you ask if you already know the answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don\u0027t know the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe foam moves him gently, peacefully, but he receives no answer for a time. He wonders if he is alone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought you had gone away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is nowhere to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you mean you are imprisoned inside this sphere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill you answer a question? Who are you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not a who.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you God?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod is a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, are you a higher being, or a higher consciousness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigher than what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigher than me, I suppose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow high are you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty low. At least, I imagine so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, then, that\u0027s your trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiding in the foam, he is disturbed by the possibility that God is making fun of him. He thinks, Are you making a joke?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do you ask if you already know the answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I talking to God?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are not talking at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou take what I say very literally. Is this because you are from another planet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you from another planet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you from another civilization?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere are you from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do you ask if you already know the answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn another time, he thinks, he would be irritated by this repetitive answer, but now he feels no emotions. There are no judgments. He is simply receiving information, a response.

It is a large animal, sometimes larger than you, and it is clever and has ingenuity, and it has a brain as large as yours. But the bear differs from you in one important way. It cannot perform the activity you call imagining. It cannot make mental images of how reality might be. It cannot envision what you call the past and what you call the future. This special ability of imagination is what has made your - species as great as it is. Nothing else. It is not your ape - nature, not your tool-using nature, not language or your violence or your caring for young or your social groupings. It is none of these things, which are all found in other animals. Your greatness lies in imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ability to imagine is the largest part of what you call intelligence. You think the ability to imagine is merely a useful step on the way to solving a problem or making something happen. But imagining it is what makes it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the gift of your species and this is the danger, because you do not choose to control your imaginings.

Answer me, Norman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved past the flight deck, going toward the airlock. \"It won\u0027t do you any good, Norman. I\u0027m in charge now. Do you hear me, Norman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the airlock, he heard a click as his helmet ring locked; the air from the tanks was cool and dry.

Are you afraid, Norman?\" The repetition of his name irritated him. He pressed the buttons to open the airlock. Water began to flood in from the floor, rising swiftly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, there you are, Norman. I see you now.\" And she began to laugh, a high, cackling laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman turned around, saw the video camera mounted on the robot, still inside the airlock.

The Tevac explosives, rows of glowing red dots, extended away in erratic lines, like an airplane runway laid out by some demented engineer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Norman? Why don\u0027t you answer me, Norman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth was unstable, erratic. He could hear it in her voice.
