He\u0027d changed out of his suit into jeans and a white button-down shirt and jacket. She had to admit he didn\u0027t look nearly as menacing as he had earlier. If she didn\u0027t know who he was and had seen him walking down the street, she would definitely have been attracted. Men like him turned heads. Too bad he was an agent. Allison grabbed her purse and headed outside to meet him halfway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam stopped as soon as she came down the steps. He watched her stride toward him and made every effort not to react, but it was nearly impossible. He couldn\u0027t explain the pull he\u0027d felt the moment he met her. He just knew he didn\u0027t like it one little bit. She was a job. Nothing more, nothing less. A means to an end, he reminded himself. She moved as though she were on a runway-back straight, head held high, her expression giving nothing away-no doubt a pose she\u0027d practiced until she perfected it. Damn, she was one beautiful woman . . . a woman with an attitude.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got close to him, she frowned and said, \"I really don\u0027t want to go out tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer, he opened the car door for her to get in. \"Sure, you do,\" he said, closing the door before she could respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they were on their way, he asked, \"Are you hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m always hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought she was joking and laughed, until he glanced at her and saw that she was serious. She stared straight ahead at the street with no expression on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is really a waste of time, you know,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t understand what you think you\u0027ll accomplish by taking me to Jordan\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d be more receptive to my proposal if you were in a friendlier environment.\" When she looked skeptically at him, he added, \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not going to hold you captive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why me? How did all this come about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve worked with Alec Buchanan a few times, and he told me about his sister, Jordan, and what a computer genius she is. Right now I need a genius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jordan is brilliant. Everyone knows that. You heard her speak at the seminar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So . . . why didn\u0027t Phillips offer her the job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t know that,\" she protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I can. I came to the seminar to hear Jordan, but I also heard you. That\u0027s when I began to do some checking. You\u0027d be surprised what you can find out about a person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slight grin that turned the corners of his mouth made Allison extremely uneasy. Was he teasing? Or was he smiling because he was so pleased with the incriminating information he\u0027d found on her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still don\u0027t understand,\" she said. \"If you wanted to ask me to work for you, why didn\u0027t you just arrange a meeting and ask me? Why the deception to get me out to the FBI\u0027s cyber center?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was Phillips\u0027s idea. He didn\u0027t think you\u0027d talk to us. Plus, he didn\u0027t believe the reports on your abilities. He had to see for himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already given you my answer. You needn\u0027t have gone to all this trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing was said for several blocks, and the silence was only making Allison more anxious. She crossed one leg over the other, then uncrossed it and crossed it again . . . and again . . . and again. Her hands were folded loosely on her lap, and she was sure she looked relaxed . . . until Liam reached over and put his hand on top of hers. She realized then how jittery she appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you nervous with me?\" he asked. The notion seemed absurd to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nervous? No, of course not. Why would I be nervous? I have nothing to be nervous about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Liam said. He couldn\u0027t imagine what was going on inside her mind, but she appeared to be close to hyperventilating. \"Tell me about yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Allison could hear the apprehension in her voice and cringed inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to get to know you, and you can get to know me,\" he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a file on me. I would think you\u0027d already know everything.\" The second the words came out of her mouth, she realized how caustic they sounded. God, she wished she could calm down. \"Okay. What would you like to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You live with two men. Are you involved with either of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two students,\" she corrected, \"and no. They\u0027re my friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you always lived in Boston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. What about you? Where did you grow up?\" she asked in an attempt to divert his attention from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was born in Philadelphia and lived there with my family until I was three,\" he explained. \"Then my dad was promoted and transferred to Melbourne, Australia. I grew up there but moved back to the States to go to Princeton.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-19.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
