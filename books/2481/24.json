A solid blow to the head and they go down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could go get more guns,\" Jenni said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both looked at her and she blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean Ralph,\" Katie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah. I mean, I know you said that thing about the guns drawing the zombies, but one day, they are just gonna show up. And they\u0027re gonna make it real hard on us to do anything,\" Jenni said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Jenni\u0027s right. Those zombies are just gonna come here anyway because we\u0027re here,\" Jason agreed. He chewed away on a chicken bone as Jack nudged his elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis frowned a little and slowly nodded. \"My family originally came from England when I was a boy. They were very anti-gun. We\u0027ve done all right so far with our shovels. But…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie laid her revolver on the table in front of him. \"Discretion was in order for you to get this place secure as fast as you did, but soon this will be the answer. It\u0027s fast and more efficient if you got good aim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friend, Ralph, he has weapons? He just told us he was the Mayor of a small town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is, but he also owns a pretty big hunting and camping store,\" Jenni said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis rubbed his chin thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t hurt to talk to him about this. Besides, I just realized we need to let him know we\u0027re okay.\" Katie looked at Jenni and winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ralph must be worried sick,\" Jenni answered. She felt a little better now that she was part of the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie turned to Travis. \"I know you\u0027re in charge here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mayor-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re in charge here,\" Katie repeated \"and I\u0027d like to suggest that maybe you should arrange with Ralph to go pick up some weapons. If you really can clear out a lot of the zombies that are out there right now, maybe we can head over to Ralph\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis looked at Katie for a long moment, his gaze steady and thoughtful. \"Yeah, you got a good idea there. We got about twenty of those things out there now. More on the way. They may break out of the school soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we can\u0027t waste time,\" Katie suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis thought for a long moment. \"Yeah. I think it’s time to go talk to the Mayor and get hold of your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie had barely eaten, but she stood up as Travis did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni pushed her plate away quickly and followed suit. \"I\u0027ll come with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to keep eating,\" Jason said firmly and Jack seemed to agree with this decision as he licked his chops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni hurried around the table to follow Katie and Travis, desperate to be included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs they entered a large room that was sectioned off into cubicles. The city secretary and her little boy were fixing up a bed for themselves behind her desk while the Mayor sat in a nearby chair listening to the emergency broadcasting channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"…as communication with Europe has ceased there is no word on how far the plague as spread. The CDC, operating in a slowly burning Atlanta, continue to issue guidelines for destroying the reanimates…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mayor looked up to see them and turned off the radio. \"They are beginning to repeat the broadcast. Not a good sign is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis shook his head and sat in a folding chair across from the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the CB?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of truckers still out there trying to find safe places, but some are running out of gas. There are not as many out there as there were.\" The Mayor folded his hands on the desk and sighed. \"How is the wall coming along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We still think we\u0027ll have the area fully enclosed by morning if we keep working all night. Another batch of zombies are headed our way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. Other zombies following Katie and Jenni here. Maybe twenty. I have Juan organizing some men to kill as many as they can. We\u0027ll use safety lines this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mayor let out a long breath as he ran a hand over his balding head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the school…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Which brings me to something. That man, Ralph, the Mayor who told us the girls were in route. He owns a hunting store. He has guns.\" Travis spoke softly with respect, but Jenni could tell he was subtly trying to steer the Mayor in the direction he wanted him to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mayor took in this information, then said, \"I have an idea. We could send someone out to get some guns once we thin out the zombies around the wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis hesitated and said, \"That sounds like a good idea. I can try to get ahold of Ralph tonight and maybe send out someone in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See what you can figure out and let me know,\" the Mayor said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis nodded. \"I\u0027ll get right on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mayor slowly turned and once more checked on his computer. The CNN homepage was up on the screen. \"Still the same page as yesterday. No updates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis motioned to the women and they followed him into a side room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurtis, the cop, sat beside a ramshackle set up of communication equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked pale beneath his tan and his thin blond hair was matted with sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Curtis!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cop looked up and said, \"It\u0027s getting quieter out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis nodded, walked over and laid a hand on the cop\u0027s shoulder. He squeezed it lightly. \"What about that man, Ralph?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked about the women. I told him they arrived safely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Think you could get him back on the line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Give me a sec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni stood close to Katie, watching, taking it all in. It felt good to be here. Safer somehow. But she still felt thrown off balance. Katie looked at her, smiled, and tenderly swept some loose locks of Jenni\u0027s black hair back from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni smiled immediately under the attention. \"Yeah. Just nervous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie kissed her cheek lightly and slid her arm around Jenni\u0027s waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, outside, the moans and screeches of the dead rose to mingle with shouts of alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies had arrived at the perimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. The Night of the Dead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis rushed over to a window, pulled back the curtains and swore under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two stay here,\" he said, and rushed out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurtis looked at the two women, then lowered his head solemnly. He seemed worn down, tired, and overwhelmed. Katie remembered that Travis said that the police force had been wiped out. She had a feeling Travis had asked him to oversee the communications center they had set up to keep him from the action. Curtis looked no older than twenty-one and Katie bet he hadn\u0027t been on the job long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni grabbed her hand. \"If we go upstairs we could probably see out the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie nodded. \"Let\u0027s go see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, they ran out of the room and up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small crowd of people clustered around the windows to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManaging to worm their way into a good position to watch out of one of the windows, Katie and Jenni looked down at the men taking position to fight the zombies. Ladders had been used to scale the wall and get up onto the trucks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe harness lines glinted in the light from the huge lights set up around the perimeter. The men had only shovels and strange spears with what looked like trowels attached to the ends. Since the windows were looking out at the street over the top of the wrought iron fence, it was easy to see the zombies desperate to reach the men. Moaning loudly, some of them screeching, thirty or so zombies clustered under the men, beating the sides of the trucks, demanding the flesh of those above them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie\u0027s heart jumped a little, as she caught sight of Travis running up one of the ladders, still fastening his harness, his spear under his arm. Of course he would be part of this. He was not the sort of man to send others to do something he wouldn\u0027t do himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if his presence on top of the truck was a sign, all the men began to squat down and ram their weapons down as hard as they could on the heads of the dead below. Katie could see the shovels busting open heads as the trowel-ended spears were driven through the eye sockets in upturned faces. Some of the zombies managed to grab the weapons and those wielding them immediately let go and were handed a new one. She wondered if the man that had been lost in the earlier battle had tried to fight with a zombie for his weapon. In this new world you had to learn fast to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first few minutes, the construction workers took out at least ten zombies. The crush of the other zombies against their now truly dead comrades became greater, holding up dead. This made the men reach out further to actually hit one of the living undead. One man lost his footing altogether and swung out over the crowd. Juan shouted and immediately his towline was drawn up and back. Zombies tried to grab his feet, but the man was swung to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" someone said nearby and Katie couldn\u0027t agree more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes continuously strayed to Travis. He had a greater reach and seemed to be driving his shovel down with a strange, staccato rhythm. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-24.html","bookId":2481,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:56:42 PM"}
