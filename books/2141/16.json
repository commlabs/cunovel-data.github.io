The woman couldn\u0027t afford to watch that missile, though, for she was already being hard pressed by the pair of orcs that remained of the trio charging her position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had taken one of them down with Taulmaril, but then came the barrage from those distant giants on the western ridge. They couldn\u0027t reach the dwarves\u0027 position with any large stones, so they were throwing slabs of shale instead, the thin, sharp missiles catching drafts of air in wild and arcing spins. Most of the throws went far wild, spinning crazily, turning up on end and soaring far to one side or the other, but some cut in too close to be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother arrow went up on the bowstring, and Catti-brie drew back just as the lead orc came around, the side of the stone, club raised, teeth bared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blew the creature away, her arrow blasting it right in the chest, lifting it from the ground and throwing it a dozen feet backward to the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively, the woman dropped the bow straight down, caught it at its end and stabbed out with it behind her to intercept the attack of a second orc. The curve of the bow brought the free tip up under the ore\u0027s chin, and Catti-brie kept the pressure on as she turned around, reversing her grip and pressing forward. She had the orc straining to its tiptoes then, and it reached up to grab the bow and push it aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Catti-brie moved more quickly, turning slightly and putting her back in tight against the stone, angling the bow out. She twisted and shoved, and the orc had to retreat and twist away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately for the orc, it happened to be standing on the edge of Keeper\u0027s Dale. It managed to grab the bow as it started to fall, forcing Catti-brie to let go. She grimaced as she saw Taulmaril go over the edge. She didn\u0027t dwell on the loss, but rather quickly drew out Khazid\u0027hea and spun back to face the threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ugly orc face greeted her, leering at her from across the flat stone. The creature did a feint to the right, and the woman sent her sword out that way. It went back to the left quickly, and Catti-brie reacted accordingly. The orc shifted fast back to center and moved as if to scramble over the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Catti-brie tired of the game and thrust straight ahead, her fabulous sword slicing through the stone and right through the chest of the orc up against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature\u0027s bloodshot eyes stared at her incredulously over the sheared rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye almost fooled me,\" Catti-brie said with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother orc leaped at her then, suddenly and without warning, coming in from far and wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not leaped, she realized as the flailing creature soared right past, soared right out over the drop to the dale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie understood as Wulfgar appeared, hammer in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready your bow,\" he bade her. \"We are turning them yet again!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie held up her free hand helplessly and started to motion toward the cliff. But she just shrugged when she realized that Wulfgar wasn\u0027t watching, having already turned back to the main fight. She leaped ahead, scrambling to the top of the stone and away in fast pursuit of her barbarian friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSide by side, they waded into the closest group of orcs, Aegis-fang swiping back and forth, scattering the closest enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie darted out to the side, where an orc presented a shield against her. It was a feeble defense against Khazid\u0027hea. The blade bit right through the wooden shield, right through the arm strapped against its other side, and right through the ore\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie slashed across to intercept the charge of a second creature, and the fine blade, so aptly nicknamed Cutter, sliced through bone and flesh and wood to tear free of its first victim. Turning it down, Catti-brie caught the second ore\u0027s thrusting spear and dropped its tip harmlessly. She snapped the blade back up with two quick stabs - two clean holes in the ore\u0027s chest. The creature staggered backward and tried to regroup, but the swiping Aegis-fang caught it in the back and sent it flying past Catti-brie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put Cutter into its side for good measure as it went by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow fine I eat this night! came a thought in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the words hardly registered, the sensation of bloodthirst surely did. Before she could even consider the implications, before she even realized that the sentient sword had awakened and found its way into her conscious once more, the woman charged ahead, past Wulfgar, rushing with abandon into a throng of orcs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFerocity replaced finesse, with Cutter lashing out wickedly at anything that moved near. Out to the left she thrust, across her chest and through one shield and arm. A quick retraction and the blade slashed across in front of her, forcing the two orcs before her to stumble backward and taking the tip from the spear of another that was coming in from her right. Catti-brie turned her trailing foot and swung her hips, then charged out suddenly to the right, stabbing repeatedly, poking hole after hole into the curling and screaming orc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecognizing her vulnerability, the woman turned back to face the remaining two, and she dived aside as something flew past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAegis-fang, she realized when one of the two orcs seemed to simply disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shares our plate! Khazid\u0027hea protested, and the sword compelled the woman to charge forward at the remaining orc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrified, the creature threw its sword at her and turned and fled, and though the weapon smacked against her, it hardly slowed her. She caught the orc as it joined up with a pair of its fellows and still didn\u0027t slow, coming in with fury, stabbing and slashing. She took a hit and ignored the pain, willing to trade strike for strike, orc weapon against marvelous Khazid\u0027hea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three were down, and Catti-brie ran on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" came a cry behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Wulfgar\u0027s cry, but it seemed distant and not insistent. Not as insistent as the hunger in her thoughts. Not as insistent as the fire coursing through her veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother orc fell before her. She hit another, thinking to rush past with a following stab on the creature behind it. But her strike was too strong, and the fine blade slashed through the ore\u0027s upper arm, severing the limb, then bit deeply into the creature\u0027s side, cutting halfway through its torso. There the blade halted and got stuck, for the momentum of the slash was stolen by too-eager Catti-brie, her weight coming past before she had finished the move. The dying orc flopped about and the woman nearly lost her grip on the blade. She turned and tugged fiercely, knowing she had to get it free, seeing the next creature barely feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah! Ye\u0027re taking all the fun!\" that creature called at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did Catti-brie stop struggling with the stuck sword. Only then did she realize that she had already reached the end of the dwarven line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe offered a sheepish smile at the dwarf, keeping the thought private that if she hadn\u0027t accidentally caught her blade on the orc, that dwarf would likely have fallen to the hunger of Khazid\u0027hea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpurred by that thought, the woman silently swore at the sword, which of course heard her clearly. She planted a foot on the dead orc and tried again to pull Khazid\u0027hea free but was stopped by a large hand gripping her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy,\" Wulfgar bade her. \"We fight together, side by side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie let go of the blade and stepped back, then took a long and steadying deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sword\u0027s hungry,\" she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar smiled, nodded, and said, \"Temper that hunger with common sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie looked back at the path of carnage she had wrought, at the sliced and slashed orcs, and at herself, covered head to toe in orc blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not all of it was orc, she only then realized and only then felt the burning pain. The thrown sword had opened a gash along her left arm, and she had another wound on her right hip and another where a spear tip had cut into her right foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need a priest,\" Wulfgar said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie, jaw clenched against the pain, stubbornly stepped forward and grabbed Khazid\u0027hea\u0027s hilt. She roughly tore it free - and yet another fountain of orc blood painted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a bath,\" Wulfgar remarked, half in humor and half in sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanak Brawnanvil shoved two thick fingers into his mouth and blew a shrill whistle. The orcs were in retreat yet again, and the dwarves were giving chase, holding perfectly to their formations as they went. But those orcs were veering, Banak realized from his high vantage point back near the cliff face. They were sidling west in their run down the slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanak whistled again and again and called for his nearby commanders to turn the dwarves around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore that order ever reached the pursuing force, though, all the dwarves, commander and pursuer alike, came to understand its intent and urgency. For in their bloodlust, the dwarves had moved too far to the north and west, too close to the high ridge and the waiting giants. As one, the formation skidded to a stop and swung around as giant boulders began to rain down upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir focused turn became an all-out retreat, and the orcs who had baited them turned as well, making the pursuers the pursued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damned clever pigs,\" Banak grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve got the tactical advantage with them giants on the ridge,\" agreed Torgar, who stood at Banak\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat advantage was likely leading to complete disaster. Those orcs in pursuit, with the artillery support of the giants, would likely cut deep into the dwar-ven lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two dwarf commanders held their breaths, praying that the errant band would get out of the giants\u0027 effective range and would then be able to offer some defense against the orcs. Banak and Torgar measured the ground, both calling out commands to support groups, moving all the remaining dwarves into position to catch and bolster their running kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir plans took a sudden turn, though, as one group from the fleeing dwarves broke away from the main force, turning back upon the orcs with sudden ferocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d be Pwent,\" Banak muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTorgar tipped his helmet in admiration of the brave Gutbusters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePwent and his boys hit the orc line with abandon, and that line broke almost immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giants turned their attention to that particular area. Boulders rained down, but there were many more orcs than dwarves, a ratio of more than five to one - and that ratio held up concerning the numbers dropped by giant-thrown stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pursuit was over and the main dwarven force was able to return to their defensive positions. All eyes turned back to the area of carnage, to see a group f Gutbusters, less than half of those who had bravely turned and charged, come scrambling out, running zigzags up the inclining stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanak\u0027s charges cheered for them, urging them on, shouting for them to, \"Run!\" and, \"Duck!\" and, \"Keep going!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut rocks smashed among the zigzagging group, and whenever one of Pwent\u0027s boys went down, the cheering dwarves gave a collective groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne figure in particular caught the attention of the onlookers. It was Pwent himself, running up the slope with not one, but a pair of wounded dwarves slung over his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cheers went up for him, for \"Pwent, Pwent, Pwent!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lagged behind, so he became the focus of the giants as well. Rocks smashed down all around him. Still he charged on, roaring with every step, determined to get his wounded boys out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rock hit the ground behind him and skipped forward, slamming him in the back and sending him flying forward. The wounded dwarves rolled off to either side, all three hitting the ground hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp above, cheers turned to stunned silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePwent struggled to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother stone clipped him and laid him face down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo figures broke out from the dwarf ranks then, running fast on longer legs, sprinting down the slope toward the fallen trio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazingly, Pwent forced himself back up and turned to face the giants. He swung one arm up, slapping his other hand across his elbow so that his fist punched high in the air - as rude a gesture as he could offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother boulder smashed the stone right in front of him, then bounced up over him and clunked down behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there stood Pwent, signaling curses at the giants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie wished that she had her bow with her! Then, perhaps, she could at least offer some cover against that suicidal charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar outdistanced her, his hands free, for he had left Aegis-fang back up with the dwarves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get to Pwent!\" the barbarian cried, and he veered for one of the two more seriously wounded warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie reached the stubborn battlerager and grabbed him by the still-cursing arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, ye dolt!\" she cried. \"They\u0027ll crush you down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah! They\u0027re as stupid as they are tall!\" Pwent shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his arm from Catti-brie, hooked a finger of each hand into either side of his mouth, and pulled it wide, sticking out his tongue at the distant behemoths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sobered almost at once, though, and not from Catti-brie\u0027s continuing pleas, but from the specter of Wulfgar crossing before him, an unconscious dwarf over one shoulder. Pwent watched as Wulfgar moved to the second fallen Gutbuster, a huge hand clasping over the scruff of the dwarf\u0027s neck and hoisting him easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Catti-brie tugged again, Pwent didn\u0027t argue, and the woman pulled him along, back up the slope. The rain of boulders commenced with full force, but luck was with the trio and their unconscious cargo, and Wulfgar was hardly slowed by the burden of the two injured dwarves. Soon enough, they were out of range of the boulders. The frustrated giants went back to their shale then, filling the air with spinning and slashing sharp-edged stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwarves cheered wildly as the group of five approached. As one, the hundreds lifted their arms in rude gestures and stood defiantly against the whizzing missiles of slate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get yer bandages ready,\" Banak shouted to Pikel Bouldershoulder, who was off to the side, jumping around excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oo oi!\" the dwarf yelled back, and he turned and lifted an arm in salute to Banak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slate flew past, taking Pikel\u0027s raised arm at the elbow. The green-bearded dwarf put on a puzzled look and stumbled forward, then shrugged as if he didn\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his eyes went wide as he saw the severed limb - his severed limb! -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;lying off to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother Ivan slammed into him from the side, slapping a cloak tightly around Pikel\u0027s blood-spurting stump, and other dwarves nearby howled and rushed to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel was sitting then, ushered down by his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooo,\" he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lone-drow-hunter-s-blades-2/page-16.html","bookId":2141,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:51 PM"}
