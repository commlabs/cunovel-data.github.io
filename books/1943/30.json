Until the divorce, Zach had always managed the money and had done an excellent job of handling their finances; now they shared this unpleasant task. The divorce had cost them both dearly and continued to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach had brewed a pot of coffee when she arrived at the house. The bills were spread out across the kitchen table, organized alphabetically. She noted that dishes were stacked in the sink and the living room needed to be straightened. From the look of the carpet, no one had vacuumed since before Christmas. She wasn’t about to mention his failings as a housekeeper, however, considering that she wasn’t much better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When we’re finished there’s something I need to discuss with you,” he said. He reached for the coffeepot and automatically filled two mugs, which he brought to the table. He set hers down, then pulled out a chair across from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudying the tense look on his face, Rosie decided she’d rather deal with whatever was bothering him first and get it over with. “What?” she said, picking up her mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It might be best if we talked about it later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are the kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eddie’s with Jeremy and his mother at the movies, and Allison’s in her room sulking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing had changed from earlier in the week. Rosie glanced at the electric bill and nearly groaned aloud. The water bill was equally high. With both of them employed, they managed to cover expenses, but paying attorneys’ fees and maintaining two residences didn’t leave anything for extras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year ago, Rosie had been shopping the after-Christmas sales, loading up on wrapping paper and ribbon and assorted bargains. This year she couldn’t afford to do that. It was a sad commentary on what her life had become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, we can talk about Allison first,” Zach said, leaning back in his chair. He folded his arms across his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body language made her feel a little wary, and she braced herself for whatever he had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For starters, Allison gave me a list I’m supposed to share with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A list?” Rosie asked, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Apparently she’s got it in her head that the judge awarded her and Eddie the house, so she’s the one in charge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not putting up with that notion,” Rosie assured him. Frankly she’d be shocked if Zach fell into line with any ultimatum their daughter presented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth quivered slightly and she could tell he was more amused than angry. “Take a look at this,” he said. He unfolded the single sheet of paper and handed it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosie scanned the carefully typed list of rules their fifteen-year-old daughter had given them. “What?” she burst out incredulously. “We’re supposed to stay out of the family room if Allison has a friend over and they’re watching television?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It gets better,” Zach told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosie’s eyes widened as she continued down the sheet. “We’re not to embarrass her by asking if she has her homework done or any other personal questions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s got a rule for Eddie, too.” He pointed toward the bottom of the page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosie couldn’t help it, she laughed outright at the last item on the page. “Eddie’s supposed to have his hair combed at all times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Apparently her little brother’s unruly hair is an embarrassment to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, and neither one of us makes the grade, either,” she said, waving the sheet of rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach nodded. “We’re forbidden to enter her room, you’ll notice. And we require Her Majesty’s permission before cleaning in there or touching her stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not in this lifetime.” Zach could make his own decisions when it came to Allison’s list, but for her part Rosie was planning to ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish this was the only letter I had to show you,” Zach said, growing serious. “The school wrote and said Allison’s grades have dropped considerably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did they suggest counseling?” Having Allison talk to a professional would be expensive, but Rosie would do whatever was necessary to help their daughter through this difficult transition period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think counseling’s the answer, especially with her attitude. I have a better idea, but only if you agree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” At this point Rosie was open to just about anything. They were losing Allison. Every day their daughter seemed to be drawing further and further away from them. She was angry and rebellious. Rosie knew Allison had every right to feel the things she did, but she couldn’t stand by and do nothing while her daughter self-destructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allison’s pretty disappointed about not getting a computer for Christmas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn’t news to Rosie; she’d already heard it, many times over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if she earns it?” Zach said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Earns it? How?” Rosie couldn’t see her daughter babysitting or doing the kinds of chores a typical fifteen-year-old did to earn extra cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if I bring her into the office?” Zach suggested. “Tax time is always hectic and we could use an extra pair of hands for filing, photocopying and so on. It would be a real part-time job with a real paycheck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosie’s heart started to pound with excitement. “That way we’d be able to monitor where she is after school, and who she’s with.” One of Rosie’s biggest concerns was the new friends Allison had found. Where Allison went and who she was with—those were major concerns for both Zach and Rosie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s a brilliant idea.” Rosie nodded happily. “And Eddie’s been going to his friend Nick’s place in the afternoons, so that’s not an issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allison has to agree first,” Zach reminded her. “I’m not exactly her favorite person at the moment. There are no guarantees. She could say no when she learns she’d be working at the office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But,” Rosie said, “she wants a computer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shall we mention it together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosie nodded, grateful to be included in the discussion. Zach went down the hallway that led to the bedrooms. A few minutes later, he returned with Allison, who had recently pierced her nose. Rosie cringed when she noticed, but managed to keep her opinion to herself. This new piercing was a response to not getting the computer she wanted, Rosie suspected. The kids had received some Christmas money from their grandparents, and the nose ring must be what Allison had spent hers on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother and I want to talk to you,” Zach said when Allison slouched against the counter, arms crossed, defiance radiating from every part of her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I figured you would when you read my list. I’m not willing to compromise on any of my fifteen points. Since the house belongs to Eddie and me, I expect you to live up to my stipulations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can discuss that later,” Zach said, smoothly diverting her from that subject. “What your mother and I wanted to tell you was how sorry we are that you didn’t get a computer for Christmas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison glanced between them, as though she wasn’t sure she should believe what Zach had said. She shrugged, implying it was no big deal, although that certainly wasn’t the impression she’d given earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t afford it, Allison. I couldn’t be sorrier.” Zach looked genuinely regretful. “But,” he said, “we’ve come up with a way for you to get a computer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have?” Her eyes brightened with hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to hire you,” Zach said. “Tax time’s coming and my new assistant needs some additional help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes, which had widened just a moment earlier, narrowed now with suspicion. “You want me to earn a computer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s your decision. I’m just giving you the opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged again, as if she wasn’t sure she should admit it. “I’d want a dollar more than minimum wage to start,” she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach nodded. “That’s acceptable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I should be paid overtime if I have to work extra hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s only fair,” Zach agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison glanced from Rosie to her father and then back. “All right,” she said. “I’ll do it, but only because I want a new computer. Don’t think you’re doing me any favors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Zach assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ready to talk about my list now?” she asked, straightening abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s leave that for later. All right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed in a loud, exasperated way. “I guess.” And with that she returned to her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach’s gaze met Rosie’s, and for the first time in what felt like years, they shared a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen had been feeling anxious all morning, the first day of the new year. She’d invited Jon to dinner, and to her delight and surprise, he’d accepted. Only later did she realize that she’d offered to cook a meal for a man who was a professional chef. Her expertise in the kitchen was limited to packaged macaroni and cheese and frozen entrées. With anyone else, she would’ve ordered takeout, but Jon ate restaurant food every day. She felt obliged to make the effort to cook for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the meal wasn’t even her main concern. The important thing about this dinner was what she planned to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to change the terms of their relationship. And she wanted him to know that she treasured his Christmas gift, a photo album filled with pictures of the first four months of Katie’s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon’s photographs revealed hidden beauty in nature, catching an unexpected pattern or a fleeting moment. But his pictures of their daughter showed far more than the changes he documented as she grew week by week. Maryellen also saw the deep love he felt for his child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristmas morning when she unwrapped his gift and slowly turned the pages of the album, tears had spilled from her eyes. Jon loved his daughter, and if she’d read him correctly, he had strong feelings for her, too. Maryellen prayed she was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first picture in the album was a shot of Maryellen smiling into the camera, her belly huge with their unborn child. The next photos were of her in the hospital and then of Katie in the nursery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer favorite was a picture he’d taken on the autumn day she’d gone out to his property and the eagle had been soaring high above, wings spread wide. Jon had captured Maryellen holding Katie and pointing toward the bird. He’d caught their daughter’s face in the sun, Katie’s jubilation and the soaring eagle, all in one dramatic shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, with Jon’s visit at hand and her insecurity about cooking, Katie was fussy all day, interrupting Maryellen at every turn. In the end, with cookbooks spread over the kitchen counters, she decided to bake a salmon, accompanied with wild rice and fresh asparagus. Meal preparation wasn’t exactly rocket science, but just then it felt like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe table was set and dinner ready to be served when Jon rang the doorbell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaryellen paused for a few seconds to calm her pounding heart before she answered, arranging a welcoming smile on her face, despite her nerves. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/311-pelican-court-cedar-cove-3/page-30.html","bookId":1943,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:11 AM"}
