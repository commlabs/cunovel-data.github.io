Main roads in pricey suburban Virginia ran alongside fenced and thickly wooded acres. The impression was of farms rather than residences. All the streets had Scottish names. I was leaving Braeburn Glen Lane for a private entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutumn would turn the winding driveway ahead of me into a carnival of falling colored leaves. Now everything was green and lush. The rental car nosed around descending curves until a low, sprawling house came into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI parked in the circular driveway before the double-doored entry and got out, smoothing my narrow navy skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heavy dark cotton suit would make me swelter in Las Vegas this time of year. Here, the summer temperature was lower but humid. I felt the film of a nervous sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d bought this vintage suit in Wichita because I loved the 1950s details: white piqu�� collar and matching cuffs, eight brass horse\u0027s-head buttons down the jacket front and a singleton at each short cuffed sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver familiar retained its discreet default mode: twin of the so-not-me silver hip chain I bought in the crazy rush of first romance with Ric. I figured the hidden familiar was too too tasteful to clash with my current outfit\u0027s brassy touches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTough. I\u0027d chosen this suit for this mission, for what its color and cut would unconsciously imply to the people I wanted to see inside this pleasantly expensive house on the groomed and expansive grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even wore the Suit Era\u0027s regulation white, wrist-length gloves and carried a neat navy patent leather envelope-style pocketbook. I took a deep breath before ringing the small round doorbell button with one gloved forefinger. Avon lady calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped they answered soon. My heart was beating like I was auditioning for the class play. A knob turned on the right-hand wood door, allowing me to glimpse the occupant as it opened slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman. Good. She registered my gender and opened the door further. The handsome blonde looked forty-something but was probably a poster child for the Washington, D.C., \"well-preserved\" matron set. She eyed me quizzically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your husband at home as well?\" I asked. \"I have important news for you both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy vintage apparel had subtly distracted her, causing a faint frown to materialize on her smooth forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed my face again, hard, then silently stepped into the shadows behind her, swinging the door wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entry area was paved in black marble, so the heels of my open-toed pumps made a military marching sound over the polished stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe living room was carpeted in deep shrimp plush wool, gorgeous and madly expensive to maintain. I almost wanted to step out of my shoes before I walked on it. Couldn\u0027t afford to lose one iota of authority, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband was reading a thin newspaper in an easy chair, hair thinning on top to match, half-glasses perched on a strong Roman nose. Old-fashioned habits died hard in this house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up, glanced at her, then eyed me again, rising slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Street,\" I said crisply. \"I\u0027ve come from Las Vegas with unwelcome news, but it\u0027s not dire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ric,\" the woman breathed beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newspaper was flung aside, the man striding toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you, young woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Street, Delilah Street. I\u0027m a... professional partner of your... of Ric\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Partner?\" he echoed dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A private investigator. Sometimes we work the same cases.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your news?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s under doctor\u0027s care but is doing fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing fine from what?\" the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a hand on my bare forearm. The woman\u0027s fingers were icy. I fought a sudden, rare urge for tears. She loved Ric too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our guest needs to sit down, and so do we, Philip,\" she told him. \" Miss Street said the situation isn\u0027t dire. She\u0027s come all this way to spare us a shocking phone call. Let\u0027s not make an interrogation of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ushered me to a love seat opposite her husband\u0027s chair and then paused. \"I suppose we should hear the rough scenario first, then I\u0027ll get some coffee and we can relax a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No relaxing here,\" he grumbled, sitting again to brace sweatered forearms on his thighs and lean forward, eyeing me like a murder suspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman\u0027s sigh was almost inaudible but she sank down beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ric was found,\" I began, \"with many superficial wounds and one more severe... stab wound in the neck that wasn\u0027t fatal, although he\u0027d lost a lot of blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laundered account came tripping off my tongue with a few hesitations that, I hoped, would be taken for difficulty recounting the hard facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I really had trouble doing was converting a gang vampire torture attack to something human. My instincts told me to go slowly. I had no idea what the Burnsides knew about Ric\u0027s consultancy work or even if they believed in the Millennium Revelation and the supernatural beings it had revealed. A lot of people still didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God,\" Mrs. Burnside said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a longer bio on Groggle than even her husband. A respected psychologist, her given name was Helena and her maiden name had been Troy. Luckily, she was beautiful enough to carry off that bit of parental hubris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer silky caftan\u0027s turquoise-and-purple floral print gleamed jewel-like against the yellow silk-upholstered sofa. Now I knew where Ric had acquired his polish and manners. Not a thing was out of place in this spacious formal room except for the crumpled tent of the tossed-aside Washington Post print edition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which hospital is he in?\" Mr. Burnside asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a... private facility, to keep his condition secret. We think... he fell into the hands of drug lords.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s his damn obsession with those endless Juarez murders!\" Burnside told his wife, his eyes furious over the forgotten half-glasses. \"What\u0027s the matter with the boy? He could have had a top FBI position here in D.C. He needs to stay out of Mexico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer faded blue eyes closed momentarily. \"That\u0027s the problem, Philip. He needs to pursue old demons there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost jumped. Did she mean \"demons\" literally?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How badly was he injured?\" she asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot of surface wounds on his chest and arms and face-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cigarette burns,\" Philip Burnside spit out. \"Bastards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the stab wound in the neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably happened when they captured him,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in a light coma and the doctors actually like that,\" I said. \"It gives his system time to repair. It\u0027s not his physical condition I\u0027m most worried about but his mental one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelena Troy Burnside was standing and nodding. \" Miss Street is right. New torture is the last thing I\u0027d want him to undergo. I\u0027ve got to get out there,\" she told her husband. \"The university jet-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll handle it.\" He reached for a cell phone on the end table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My work with Ric\u0027s case brought Georgetown a lot of good press, they\u0027d be happy-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll handle it,\" he repeated. \"You pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with me, Miss Street,\" she said, turning to me. \"You can tell me what to take for the current Nevada climate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was gone in a swirl of floral silk as I rushed to catch up to her. I didn\u0027t want to be left alone to answer any more questions from Ric\u0027s eagle-eyed \"father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic Montoya described himself as \"adopted,\" but told me it\u0027d never been made official. So. How should I regard this otherwise childless couple? I understood they wanted him to take pride in his heritage, not deny it after his ordeal. That\u0027s why Ric\u0027s \"chosen\" last name. Philip Burnside had rescued Ric as a \"wild child\" in a raid. Dr. Helena Troy Burnside had saved his sanity. Then they\u0027d housed him through high school and college. Maybe they were just \"the folks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stairs were steep but she had already vanished up them. I ran up after her, finding a bedroom with the door flung wide and her soft-sided suitcase already open on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was used to sudden trips out of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked me. \"Temps in the nineties in June?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused to study me as sharply as her husband had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That ensemble would be murderously hot to wear in Las Vegas. It suited perfectly here, especially to make instant subconscious points with my ex-military husband. I see you\u0027re a clever young woman, Delilah Street. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re a, an... associate of Ric\u0027s. You can take off the kid gloves now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed as I remembered my First Communion-style white cotton gloves. My outfit had been designed to imply military formality, of course, to ease me into the presence and confidence of an ex-officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mama was a high-ranking shrink, and she was even harder to bluff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You blush? I\u0027m liking you more and more, my old-fashioned girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated the blush, but a Snow White complexion hides neither minor social shame nor the flush of major arousal. Ric liked my blushes too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelena was whipping out casual slacks and tops from her wall-long closet in quick succession. I nodded or shook my head just as fast, so she soon made an apt selection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be able to stay long. I\u0027ll change and be right down. Philip should have arranged for the plane by now. Don\u0027t let him scare you. He\u0027s worried sick but can\u0027t show it. Needed to take some action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and ran back down again to find her husband pacing in front of the fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it\u0027s you. I\u0027ll drive you two to the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My rental car-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Papers in the glove compartment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a return plane ticket-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give it to me. I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the ticket out of my purse, much easier to do without the gloves, which I stuck in the purse in the ticket\u0027s stead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurnside lowered his voice as I heard Helena \u0027s footsteps on the stairs. \"Ric\u0027s going to be okay, isn\u0027t he? He\u0027s a tough kid. Did he-?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what he needed to know by the furtive, haunted look in his eyes he didn\u0027t want his wife to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t tell them anything they wanted to know,\" I said with all the conviction I felt in my soul. \"Not a word. No matter what.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, relieved and yet guilty about that. Then he left to fetch the car around before his wife could see his troubled expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelena \u0027s khaki slacks and azure silk-knit sweater set enhanced her similar coloring. It wasn\u0027t vanity, just habit. She looked cool and elegant and was watching me just as closely as I summed her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you gone without sleep, Delilah? That lovely pale complexion of yours looks as blue as skim milk under your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked at her, too weary-and wary-to admit I was afraid of Ric\u0027s dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll talk on the plane,\" she told me. \"It\u0027ll be more comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe endless drone of jet engines and those cramped rows of seats? I doubted it. Here it was so clean and peaceful I would have wanted to stay if I wasn\u0027t frantic about getting back to Ric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I\u0027d made it home to meet the parents. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-sunrise-delilah-street-3/page-5.html","bookId":2115,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:47 PM"}
