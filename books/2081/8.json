But she was thinking, He\u0027s so strong. Stronger than anybody I\u0027ve ever met. He could break mywrist without even trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that! Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s easier than carrying it down in myteeth,\" Maggie said. But that wasn\u0027t the real reason,of course. The truth was that she needed to get temptation out of the way. She was so thirsty thatit was a kind of madness, and she was afraid ofwhat she would do if she held onto this cool, sloshing water bag much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring at her with those startling eyes,as if he were trying to pryhis way into her brain.And Maggie had the odd feeling that he\u0027d succeeded, at least far enough that he knew the real reason she was doing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are an idiot,\" he said slowly, with cold wonder. \"You should listen to your body; it\u0027s telling youwhat it needs. You can\u0027t ignore thirst. You can\u0027tdeny it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you can,\" Maggie said flatly. Her wrist wasgoing numb. If this went on, she was going to dropthe bag involuntarily, and in the wrong place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t,\" he said, somehow making the wordsinto an angry hiss. \"I should know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he showed her his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie should have been prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeanne had told her. Vampires and witches and shapeshifters, she\u0027d said. And Sylvia was a witch,and Bern had been a shapeshifter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis boy was a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strange thing was that, unlike Bern, he didn\u0027tget uglier when he changed. His face seemed palerand finer, like something chiseled in ice. His goldeneyes burned brighter, framed by lashes that lookedeven blacker in contrast. His pupils opened and seemed to hold a darkness that could swallow aperson up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was the mouth that had changed the most.It looked even more willful, disdainful, and sullen-and it was drawn up into a sneer to displaythe fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpressive fangs. Long, translucent white, tapering into delicate points. Shaped like a cat\u0027s canines,with a sheen on them like jewels. Not yellowing tusks like Bern\u0027s, but delicate instruments of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat amazed Maggie was that although helooked completely different from anything she\u0027d seen before, completely abnormal, he also lookedcompletely natural. This was another kind of creature, just like a human or a bear, with as muchright to live as either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich didn\u0027t mean she wasn\u0027t scared. But shewas frightened in a new way, a way ready for action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was ready to fight, if fighting became necessary. She\u0027d already changed that much since entering this valley: fear now made her not panicked buthyper alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I have to defend myself I need both hands.And it\u0027s better not to let him see I\u0027m scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you can\u0027t ignore your kind of thirst,\" shesaid, and was pleased that her voice didn\u0027t wobble.\"But I\u0027m fine. Except that you\u0027re hurting my wrist. Can you please let go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor just an instant, the brilliant yellow eyesflared even brighter, and she wondered if he wasgoing to attack her. But then his eyelids lowered,black lashes veiling the brightness. He let go ofher wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u0027s arm sagged,and the leather bagdropped from her suddenly nerveless fingers. It landed safely at her feet. She rubbed her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd didn\u0027t look up a moment later, when he saidwith a kind of quiet hostility, \"Aren\u0027t you afraidof me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" It was true. And it wasn\u0027t just because hewas a vampire or because he had a power thatcould send blue death twenty feet away. It was because of him, of the way he was. He was scary enough in and of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what good is it, being afraid?\" Maggie said,still rubbing her hand. \"If you\u0027re going to try tohurt me,IT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efight back. And so far, you haven\u0027t triedto hurt me. You\u0027ve only helped me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, I didn\u0027t do it for you.And you\u0027ll neversurvive if you keep on being insane like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Insane like what?\" Now she did look up, to seethat his eyes were burning dark gold and his fangswere gone. His mouth simply looked scornful and aristocratic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trusting people,\" he said, as if it should havebeen obvious. \"Taking care of people. Don\u0027t youknow that only the strong ones make it? Weak people are deadweightand if you try to help them, they\u0027ll drag you down with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie had an answer for that. \"Cady isn\u0027tweak,\" she said flatly. \"She\u0027s sickShe\u0027ll get betterif she gets the chance. And if we don\u0027t take care ofeach other, what\u0027s going to happen to all of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked exasperated, and for a few minutesthey stared at each other in mutual frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Maggie bent and picked up the bag again.\"I\u0027d better give it to her now. I\u0027ll bring your can teen back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" His voice was abrupt and cold, unfriendly. But this time he didn\u0027t grab her.\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow me.\" He gave the order briefly andturned without pausing to see if she obeyed. It wasclear that he expectedpeople to obey him, withoutquestions. \"Bring the bag,\" he said, without lookingover his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie hesitated an instant, glancing down atCady. But the hollow was protected by the overhanging boulders; Cady would be all right there for a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed the boy. The narrow path that wound around the mountain was rough and primitive, interrupted by bands of broken, razor-sharpslate. She had to pick her way carefully aroundthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of her, the boy turned toward the rocksuddenly and disappeared. When Maggie caught up, she saw the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entrance was small, hardly more than acrack, and even Maggie had to stoop and go in sideways. But inside it opened into a snug littleenclosure that smelled of dampness and cool rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost no light filtered in from the outsideworld. Maggie blinked, trying to adjust to the neardarkness, when there was a sound like a match strike and a smell of sulphur. A tiny flame was born, and Maggie saw the boy lighting some kindof crude stone lamp that had been carved out ofthe cave wall itself. He glanced back at her and his eyes flashed gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Maggie was gasping, looking around her.The light of the little flame threw a mass of shifting, confusing shadows everywhere, but it alsopicked out threads of sparkling quartz in the rock.The small cave had become a place of enchantment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndatthe boy\u0027s feet was something that glitteredsilver. In the hush of the still air, Maggie couldhear the liquid, bell-like sound of water dripping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027sa pool,\" the boy said. \"Spring fed. The watees cold, but it\u0027s good. Water .Something like pure lust overcame Maggie. She took three steps forward, ignoring the boy completely, and then her legs collapsed.Shecupped a hand in the pool, felt the coolness encompass it to the wrist, and brought it out asif shewere holding liquid diamond in her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never tasted anything asgood as that water. No Coke she\u0027d drunk on the hottest day of summer could compare with it. It ran through herdry mouth and down her parched throatand then it seemed to spread all through her, sparklingthrough her body, soothing and reviving her. A sort of crystal clearness entered her brain. She drankand drank in a state of pure bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, when she was in the even more blissfulstate of being not thirsty anymore, she plunged the leather bag under the surface to fill it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that for?\" But there was a certain resignation in the boy\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cady. I have to get back to her.\" Maggie sat backon her heels and looked at him. The light dancedand flickered around him, glinting bronze off hisdark hair, casting half his face in shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said, quietly, but in a voice thatshook slightly. \"I think you probably saved mylife again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were really thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" She stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But when you thought there wasn\u0027t enoughwater, you were going to give it to her.\" He couldn\u0027tseem to get over the concept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if it meant you dying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t die,\" Maggie pointed out. \"And I wasn\u0027tplanning to. Butyeah, I guess, if there wasn\u0027t anyother choice.\" She saw him staring at her in utterbewilderment. \"I took responsibility for her,\" shesaid, trying to explain. \"It\u0027s like when you take ina cat, or-or it\u0027s like being a queen or something.If you say you\u0027re going to be responsible for your subjects, you are. You owe them afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething glimmered in his golden eyes, just fora moment. It could have been a dagger point ofanger or just a spark of astonishment. There wasa silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not thatweird, people taking care of each other,\" Maggie said, looking at his shadowed face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t anybody do it here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a short laugh. \"Hardly,\" he said dryly.\"The nobles know how to take care of themselves.And the slaves have to fight each other to survive.\" He added abruptly, \"All of which you should know.But of course you\u0027re not from here. You\u0027re fromOutside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know if you knew about Outside,\" Mag gie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t supposed to be any contact. Therewasn\u0027t for about five hundred years. But whenmy-when the old king died, they opened the pass,again and started bringing in slaves from the outside world. New blood.\" He said it simply andmatter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMountain men, Maggie thought. For years there had been rumors about the Cascades, about menwho lived in hidden places among the glaciers andpreyed on climbers. Men or monsters. There were always hikers who claimed to have seen Bigfoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe they had-or maybe they\u0027d seen ashapeshifter like Bern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think that\u0027s okay,\" she said out loud.\"Grabbing people from the outside world and dragging them in here to be slaves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Notpeople.Humans.Humansarevermin;they\u0027re not intelligent.\" He said it in that same dispassionate tone, looking right at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy?\"Maggie\u0027s fists were clenched; herhead was lowered. Stomping time. She glared upat him through narrowed lashes. \"You\u0027re talking to a human right now. Am I intelligent or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a slave without any manners,\" he saidcurtly. \"And the law says I could kill you for the way you\u0027retalkingto me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was so cold, so arrogant...but Maggiewas starting not to believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat couldn\u0027t be all there was to him. Becausehe was the boy in her dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gentle, compassionate boy who\u0027d looked ather with a flame of love behind his yellow eyes,and who\u0027d held her with such tender intensity, hisheart beating against hers, his breath on her cheek. That boy had been real-and even if it didn\u0027t makeany sense, Maggie was somehow certain of it. And no matter how cold and arrogant this one seemed, they had to be part of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t make her less afraid of this one, exactly.But it made her more determined to ignore herfear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In my dream,\" she said deliberately, advancinga step on him, \"you cared about at least onehuman. You wanted to take care of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t even be allowedto dream aboutme,\" he said. His voice wasas tense and grim asever, but as Maggie got closer to him, looking directly up into his face, he did something that amazed her. He fell back a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Because I\u0027m a slave? I\u0027m a person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took another step forward, still looking at him challengingly. \"And I don\u0027t believe that you\u0027re asbad as you say you are. I think I saw what youwere really like in my dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crazy,\" he said. He didn\u0027t back up anyfarther, there was nowhere left to go. But his wholebody was taut. \"Why should I want to take care of you?\" he added in a cold and contemptuous voice.\"What\u0027s so special about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good question, and for a moment Maggie was shaken. Tears sprang to her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she said honestly. \"I\u0027m nobodyspecial. There isn\u0027tany reason for you to care aboutme. But it doesn\u0027t matter. You saved my life whenBern was going to kill me, and you gave me waterwhen you knew I needed it. You can talk all youwant, but those are the facts. Maybe you just care about everybody, underneath. Or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never finished the last sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she had been speaking to him, she was doingsomething she always did, that was instinctive to.,her when she felt some strong emotion. She had done it with P.J. and with Jeanne and with Cady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out toward him. And although shewas only dimly aware that he was pulling his handsback to avoid her, she adjusted automatically,catching his wrists....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was when she lost her voice and whatshe was saying flew out of her head. Because something happened. Something that she couldn\u0027t ex plain, that was stranger than secret kingdoms orvampires or witchcraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happened justas her fingers closed on hishands. It was the first time they had touched like that, bare skin to bare skin. When he had grabbed her wrist before, her jacket sleeve had been in be tween them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt started as an almost painful jolt, a pulsatingthrill that zigged up her arm and then sweptthrough her body. Maggie gasped, but somehowshe couldn\u0027t let go of his hand. Like someone beingelectrocuted, she was frozen in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue fire, she thought wildly. He\u0027s doing thesame thing to me that he did to Bern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the next instant she knew that he wasn\u0027t. This wasn\u0027t the savage energy that had killed Bern, and it wasn\u0027t anything the boy was doing to her. Itwas something being done to both of them, by some incredibly powerful source outside either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was trying ... to open a channel. Thatwas the only way Maggie could describe it. It was blazing a path open in her mind, and connectingit to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe feltas if she had turned around and unexpectedly found herself facing another person\u0027s soul.A soul that was hanging there, without protection,already in helpless communication with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was by far the most intense thing that hadever happened to her. Maggie gasped again, seeingstars, and then her legs melted and she fellforward\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her, but he couldn\u0027t stand up either.Maggie knew that as well as she knew what wasgoing on in her own body. He sank to his knees, holding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a thought, but it wasn\u0027t Maggie\u0027s. It washis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know ...I\u0027m not doing it ... I don\u0027t understand!Maggie had no idea how to send herthoughts to another person. But she didn\u0027t need to,it was simply happening. A pure line of communication had been opened between them. It was afierce and terrible thing, a bit like being fused together by a bolt of lightning, but it was also so wonderful that Maggie\u0027s entire skin was prickling and her mind was hushed with awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt as if she\u0027d been lifted into some new andwonderful place that most people never even saw. The air around her seemed to quiver with invisible wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how people are supposed to be,shethought. Joined like this. Open to each other. Withnothing hidden and no stupid walls between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thought came back at her, sharp and quickasa hammer strike. No!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so cold, so full of rejection, that for a moment Maggie was taken aback. But then she sensedwhat else was behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger... and fear. He was afraid of this, andof her. He felt invaded. Exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I do, too,Maggie said mentally. It wasn\u0027tthat she wasn\u0027t afraid. It was that her fear was irrelevant. The force that held them was so much morepowerful than either of them, so immeasurably ancient, that fear was natural but not important. The same light shone through each of them, strippingaway their shields, making them transparent toeach other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all right for you. Because you don\u0027t have any thing to be ashamed of!The thought flashed by so quickly that Maggie wasn\u0027t even sure she hadheard it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you mean?she thought. Wait ... Delos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was his name. Delos Redfern. She knew itnow, as unquestionably as she knew the names ofher own family. She realized, too, as a matter of minor importance, an afterthought, that he was a prince. A vampire prince who\u0027d been born to rule this secret kingdom, as the Redfern family had ruled it for centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old king was your father,she said to him. And he died three years ago, when you were fourteen. You\u0027ve been ruling ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pulling away from her mentally, trying tobreak the contact between them. It\u0027s none of your business, he snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease wait,Maggie said. But as she chased after him mentally, trying to catch him, to help him,something shocking and new happened, like a second bolt of lightning. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-black-dawn-night-world-8/page-8.html","bookId":2081,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:55 PM"}
