Girls kept the same sports locker from year to year—Emma had opened Sutton’s designated tennis locker on the first day of practice and found a few things still inside, including a shiny nylon jacket that said HOLLIER TENNIS on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they rounded the corner to the tennis team’s bank of lockers, Madeline stopped short. “Whoa.” Laurel covered her mouth with her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma peered around them and nearly cried out. Papers lay scattered over the floor and on the benches. Red liquid covered a couple of doors and lockers. There was a tape outline of a body on the floor, with a big splattering of red stuff—blood?—near the head. Yellow police tape strung around the outline said CRIME SCENE: DO NOT CROSS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma’s vision began to narrow. She took a big step back. Could it be? She thought of the note again. Sutton’s dead. Maybe someone had found Sutton’s body . . . here. Maybe the snuff film had taken place in a field nearby. The killer had dragged Sutton into the locker room and deposited her here for someone to find. And if they’d found Sutton, what would that mean for Emma?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to imagine my body lying on the cold locker room floor, blood seeping out of my head, my eyes fluttering closed. Had this been it? Had someone dumped me here? But the locker room setting didn’t match the flickers I’d already had about my death—the screams, the darkness, the knife at my throat. Something seemed off about the whole thing. Then I noticed Laurel’s small, nervous smile behind her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Psst.” Charlotte yanked them into the shower room. The floor was shiny and wet, and someone had left a big bottle of Aveda shampoo on a built-in shelf in one of the stalls. Charlotte peeked around the doorway and gestured for the girls to do the same. A few girls on various teams passed the tennis lockers, doing a triple take at the crime scene. An angular cross-country runner took a picture of it with her phone. An Asian girl saw it and immediately turned around and went the other direction. When Nisha appeared at the far end of the hall, Charlotte squeezed Emma’s hand. “Let the games begin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold, clammy feeling of understanding washed over Emma. But before she could say anything, Charlotte put her finger to her lips. Shhh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNisha’s dark hair cascaded down her back. She carried a green tennis bag on her shoulder. When she turned the corner and noticed the crime scene, she stopped hard. She took a few tentative steps toward it, staring at the locker surrounded by police tape. A helpless look washed over her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss?” A woman in a police uniform burst into the room, making everyone, including Emma, Charlotte, and Madeline, jump. Nisha flinched and pressed her arm to her chest as if to say, Who me? “Can you tell me whose locker this is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNisha’s tawny skin turned ashen. She glanced at the cop’s badge, then at her gun. “Um, that’s my locker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel let out a tiny yelp of a laugh. Charlotte shot her a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cop tapped the locker door with the antenna of her walkie-talkie. “Would you mind opening it for me? I need to search it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNisha’s bag slipped from her shoulder to the floor. She didn’t pick it back up. “W-Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a warrant right here.” The cop unfolded a piece of paper and flashed it in Nisha’s face. “I need to search this locker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte covered her mouth with her hand. Madeline’s whole body shook, making tiny I-don’t-want-to-laugh squeaks. They both turned to Emma. Charlotte lifted her eyebrows in a silent look that seemed to ask, Don’t you love this? Emma looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore girls gathered in the locker room, nudging and staring. The cop paced the aisle. Nisha opened and closed her mouth a few times without speaking. Tears welled in her eyes. “Am I in trouble? I didn’t do anything!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be the judge of that,” the cop said. The handcuffs on her belt jingled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline nudged Laurel in the ribs. “Where did you find her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I put an ad on Craigslist.” Laurel beamed. “She’s a theater major at the U of A.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cop nodded at Nisha again, this time more forcefully. Nisha’s hands shook as she worked the combination. By now Charlotte was doubled over, her shoulders shaking. Madeline had her tongue wedged between her teeth to stave off giggles. When the locker opened, the cop plunged her hand inside and pulled out a kitchen knife. More red stuff smeared the pointed tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNisha sank down to the bench in the middle of the aisle. “I-I don’t know how that got there!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma picked nervously at dry skin on her palm. Sure, Nisha was a bitch, but was she this much of a bitch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched uncertainly, too. Maybe I’d been a prankster when I was alive, but from the other side, a staged murder definitely turned the proverbial stomach of a girl who’d just been killed. In fact, it seemed almost eerily coincidental. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to search the top part of the locker, too,” the cop demanded. “And then you and I are going to take a little trip down to the station.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But this is a mistake!” Nisha’s eyes filled with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma tugged Charlotte’s sleeve. “Guys. Come on. That’s enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte shot up and whirled around. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nisha seems kind of freaked out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline cocked her head. “That’s why it’s funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t want her to have a heart attack,” Emma argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like you haven’t done worse, Sutton?” A water droplet from the shower nozzle plopped on Charlotte’s head, but she ignored it. “Don’t get all soft on us now. Anyway, we had to go big with her. She knows what we’re about. We couldn’t just fill her pool with frogs or put Nair in her shampoo or something dumb like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it was a genius idea,” Laurel whispered behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” Charlotte grinned. “I knew we needed something special to kick off a new year of the Lying Game!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma chomped down on the inside of her cheek to keep from showing surprise. The Lying Game?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words swirled in my head, too. Sensations bobbed to the surface. Screams and laughs, hands clapped over mouths, the hot stomach-pull of excitement. I strained to remember more, but it was just a cascade of feelings that rushed over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the aisle, the cop pressed the latch to open the top compartment of Nisha’s locker. Charlotte grabbed Emma’s hand. “Get ready.” As the door opened, something shot out of the space. Nisha screamed and covered her eyes. Emma braced herself, too . . . and then she saw a shiny Mylar balloon float lazily into the aisle and bob to the ceiling. It was in the shape of a banana with bug eyes and a deranged smile. “That’s bananas!” a robotic voice rang out from the balloon as it bounced off the ceiling. “That’s bananas! That’s bananas!” A note dangled from the end of the string that said GOTCHA!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma couldn’t help but explode with laughter. Now that was funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNisha wiped her eyes, a tiny wrinkle forming between her eyebrows. She looked over her shoulder for the cop, but the University of Arizona drama student had run off, bloody knife and all. Nisha ripped the GOTCHA! note off the string, crumpled it up, and tossed it to the floor. “That’s bananas!” the balloon bleated again and again in a robotic voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte emerged from their hiding place in the showers, her high-heeled boots clicking on the tile. Nisha turned and glared at her, her face puce. “You better not tell on us,” Charlotte said in a chillingly even voice. She wagged her finger back and forth. “Or else we’ll get you worse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadeline and Laurel formed a convoy behind Charlotte, shooting Nisha the same don’t-mess-with-us looks, too. Emma ran past Nisha as fast as she could. Out in the hall, the girls leaned against the wall and laughed long and hard. Madeline grabbed Charlotte’s hand. Tears rolled down Laurel’s cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her face!” Charlotte said between breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Priceless!” Madeline cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel poked Emma’s side. “C’mon. You can admit it now. You loved it, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all staring at Emma like she was the be-all and end-all, the final thumbs-up or thumbs-down. Emma stared blankly out the floor-to-ceiling windows that lined the hallway. A mini yellow school bus pulled away from the curb. A group of girls in field hockey uniforms passed, all giggling. Then Emma turned back and regarded each of Sutton’s friends. Whatever this was, Sutton had clearly been the ringleader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte waved her hand in front of Emma’s face. “Well? A-plus or F-minus?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma hefted her purse higher on her shoulder and mustered a devious smile. “A-plus,” she managed to say, trying to channel her sister. “It was awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls smiled with relief. “I knew it.” Charlotte gave Emma a high five. The bell rang, and they linked elbows and started down the hall. Emma was pulled along with them, but all her body parts, down to the individual cells, were quivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lying Game. If this was something Sutton and her friends did often, if this was something they’d done to a lot of people at school, they might’ve pushed someone too far. She thought of what Charlotte had said. Like you haven’t done worse, Sutton? What if that was just it? What if Sutton had done worse—much worse—and someone had killed her for it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI concentrated hard, but I still couldn’t see what that horrible thing could have been. But even so, I had a sinking feeling Emma might be right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLAST BUS TO VEGAS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma pushed through the congested halls to her locker. Her nose still stung with the smell of the fake blood. Over her shoulder, she noticed two girls glance at her with a mix of fear and reverence. She distinctly heard them whisper the words “Nisha” and “crime scene.” A guy in a soccer jersey stood in the doorway of the student council room and chanted, “That’s bananas! That’s bananas!” Had the details of the prank gotten out already? How could they all laugh about it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Sutton!” a girl called to Emma as she passed, but her smile looked twisted and sinister. “What up, Sutton?” a tall guy in baggy pants and skate shoes called from inside a science classroom, but was it Emma’s imagination or did his voice have a steely, hateful edge? Sutton could’ve pranked these people—all of them. Anyone could be her killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whipped around the corner and nearly collided into a tall figure carrying a large cup of coffee. “Whoa,” he said, protectively placing a hand on the lid. Emma backed up. Ethan stood before her, wearing a gray hoodie, long army-green surfer shorts, and faded Converse shoes. His unapproachable, surly expression softened when he saw it was her. “Oh. Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Emma answered, grateful to see a friendly face. She started down the hall. “H-How are you?” She tried to sound cheerful, but her voice trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m cool.” Ethan kept pace with her. “You? You’ve got that the-bogeyman’s-after-me look again.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lying-game-the-lying-game-1/page-17.html","bookId":2393,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:33 AM"}
