Sophronia is more interested in dismantling clocks and climbing trees than proper etiquette at tea--and god forbid anyone see her atrocious curtsy. Mrs. Temminnick is desperate for her daughter to become a proper lady. She enrolls Sophronia in Mademoiselle Geraldine\u0027s Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBut little do Sophronia or her mother know that this is a school where ingenious young girls learn to finish, all right--but it\u0027s a different kind of finishing. Mademoiselle Geraldine\u0027s certainly trains young ladies in the finer arts of dance, dress, and etiquette, but also in the other kinds of finishing: the fine arts of death, diversion, deceit, espionage, and the modern weaponries. Sophronia and her friends are going to have a rousing first year at school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/etiquette-espionage-finishing-school-1.jpg","author":"Gail Carriger","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/etiquette-espionage-finishing-school-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:00:36 PM"}
