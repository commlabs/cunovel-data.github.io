{"id":26248,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 8 Waiting For The Damn Fight To Start Already","content":"\"Jeez, Paul, don\u0027t you freaking have a home of your own?\"Paul, lounging across my whole couch, watching some stupid baseball game on my crappy TV, justgrinned at me and then—real slow—he lifted one Dorito from the bag in his lap and wedged it into hismouth in one piece.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"You betterVe brought those with you.\"Crunch. \"Nope,\" he said while chewing. \"Your sister said to go ahead and help myself to anything Iwanted.\"I tried to make my voice sound like I wasn\u0027t about to punch him. \"Is Rachel here now?\"It didn\u0027t work. He heard where I was going and shoved the bag behind his back. The bag crackled as hesmashed it into the cushion. The chips crunched into pieces. Paul\u0027s hands came up in fists, close to hisface like a boxer.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Bring it, kid. I don\u0027t need Rachel to protect me.\"I snorted. \"Right. Like you wouldn\u0027t go crying to her first chance.\"He laughed and relaxed into the sofa, dropping his hands. \"I\u0027m not going to go tattle to a girl. If you gotin a lucky hit, that would be just between the two of us. And vice versa, right?\"Nice of him to give me an invitation. I made my body slump like I\u0027d given up. \"Right.\"His eyes shifted to the TV.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I lunged.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　His nose made a very satisfying crunching sound of its own when my fist connected. He tried to grab me,but I danced out of the way before he could find a hold, the ruined bag of Doritos in my left hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"You broke my nose, idiot.\"\"Just between us, right, Paul?\"I went to put the chips away. When I turned around, Paul was repositioning his nose before it could setcrooked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The blood had already stopped; it looked like it had no source as it trickled down his lips and off hischin. He cussed, wincing as he pulled at the cartilage.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"You are such a pain, Jacob. I swear, I\u0027d rather hang out with Leah.\"\"Ouch. Wow, I bet Leah\u0027s really going to love to hear that you want to spend some quality time with her.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　It\u0027ll just warm the cockles of her heart.\"\"You\u0027re going to forget I said that.\"\"Of course. I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t slip out.\"\"Ugh,\" he grunted, and then settled back into the couch, wiping the leftover blood on the collar of hist-shirt. \"You\u0027re fast, kid.I\u0027ll give you that.\" He turned his attention back to the fuzzy game.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I stood there for a second, and then I stalked off to my room, muttering about alien abductions.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Back in the day, you could count on Paul for a fight pretty much whenever. You didn\u0027t have to hit himthen—any mild insult would do. It didn\u0027t take a lot to flip him out of control. Now, of course, when Ireally wanted a good snarling, ripping, break-the-trees-down match, he had to be all mellow.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Wasn\u0027t it bad enough that yet another member of the pack had imprinted—because, really, that madefour of ten now! When would it stop? Stupid myth was supposed to be rare, for crying out loud! All thismandatory love-at-first-sight was completely sickening!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Did it have to be my sister? Did it have to be Paul?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　When Rachel\u0027d come home from Washington State at the end of the summer semester—graduatedearly, the nerd—my biggest worry\u0027d been that it would be hard keeping the secret around her. I wasn\u0027tused to covering things up in my own home. It made me real sympathetic to kids like Embry and Collin,whose parents didn\u0027t know they were werewolves. Embry\u0027s mom thought he was going through somekind of rebellious stage. He was permanently grounded for constantly sneaking out, but, of course, therewasn\u0027t much he could do about that. She\u0027d check his room every night, and every night it would be emptyagain. She\u0027d yell and he\u0027d take it in silence, and then go through it all again the next day. We\u0027d tried totalk Sam into giving Embry a break and letting his mom in on the gig, but Embry\u0027d said he didn\u0027t mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The secret was too important.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　So I\u0027d been all geared up to be keeping that secret. And then, two days after Rachel got home, Paul raninto her on the beach. Bada bing, bada boom—true love! No secrets necessary when you found yourother half, and all that imprinting werewolf garbage.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Rachel got the whole story. And I got Paul as a brother-in-law someday. I knew Billy wasn\u0027t muchthrilled about it, either. But he handled it better than I did. \u0027Course, he did escape to the Clearwaters\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　more often than usual these days. I didn\u0027t see where that was so much better. No Paul, but plenty ofLeah.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I wondered—would a bullet through my temple actually kill me or just leave a really big mess for me toclean up?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I threw myself down on the bed. I was tired—hadn\u0027t slept since my last patrol—but I knew I wasn\u0027tgoing to sleep. My head was too crazy. The thoughts bounced around inside my skull like a disorientedswarm of bees. Noisy. Now and then they stung. Must be hornets, not bees. Bees died after one sting.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And the same thoughts were stinging meagain and again.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　This waiting was driving me insane. It had been almost four weeks. I\u0027d expected, one way or another,the news would have come by now. I\u0027d sat up nights imagining what form it would take.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Charlie sobbing on the phone—Bella and her husband lost in an accident. A plane crash? That would behard to fake. Unless the leeches didn\u0027t mind killing a bunch of bystanders to authenticate it, and whywould they? Maybe a small plane instead. They probably had one of those to spare.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Or would the murderer come home alone, unsuccessful in his attempt to make her one of them? Or noteven getting that far. Maybe he\u0027d smashed her like a bag of chips in his drive to get some? Because herlife was less important to him than his own pleasure...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The story would be so tragic—Bella lost in a horrible accident. Victim of a mugging gone wrong.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Choking to death at dinner. A car accident, like my mom. So common. Happened all the time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Would he bring her home? Bury her here for Charlie? Closed-casket ceremony, of course. My mom\u0027scoffin had been nailed shut...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I could only hope that he\u0027d come back here, within my reach.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Maybe there would be no story at all. Maybe Charlie would call to ask my dad if he\u0027d heard anythingfrom Dr. Cullen, who just didn\u0027t show up to work one day. The house abandoned. No answer on any ofthe Cullens\u0027 phones. The mystery picked up by some second-rate news program, foul play suspected...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Maybe the big white house would burn to the ground, everyone trapped inside. Of course, they\u0027d needbodies for that one. Eight humans of roughly the right size. Burned beyond recognition—beyond the helpof dental records.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Either of those would be tricky—for me, that is. It would be hard to find them if they didn\u0027t want to befound. Of course, I had forever to look. If you had forever, you could check out every single piece ofstraw in the haystack, one by one, to see if it was the needle.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Right now, I wouldn\u0027t mind dismantling a haystack. At least that would be something to do. I hatedknowing that I could be losing my chance. Giving the bloodsuckers the time to escape, if that was theirplan.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　We could go tonight. We could kill every one of them that we could find.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I liked that plan because I knew Edward well enough to know that, if I killed any one of his coven, Iwould get my chance at him, too. He\u0027d come for revenge. And I\u0027d give it to him—I wouldn\u0027t let mybrothers take him down as a pack. It would be just him and me. May the better man win.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　But Sam wouldn\u0027t hear of it. We\u0027re not going to break the treaty. Let them make the breach. Justbecause we had no proof that the Cullens had done anything wrong. Yet. You had to add the yet,because we all knew it was inevitable. Bella was either coming back one of them, or not coming back.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Either way, a human life had been lost. And that meant game on.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　In the other room, Paul brayed like a mule. Maybe he\u0027d switched to a comedy. Maybe the commercialwas funny. Whatever. It grated on my nerves.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I thought about breaking his nose again. But it wasn\u0027t Paul I wanted to fight with. Not really.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I tried to listen to other sounds, the wind in the trees, it wasn\u0027t the same, not through human ears. Therewere a million voices in the wind that I couldn\u0027t hear in this body.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　But these ears were sensitive enough. I could hear past the trees, to the road, the sounds of the carscoming around that last bend where you could finally see the beach—the vista of the islands and therocks and the big blue ocean stretching to the horizon. The La Push cops liked to hang out right aroundthere. Tourists never noticed the reduced speed limit sign on the other side of the road.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I could hear the voices outside the souvenir shop on the beach. I could hear the cowbell clanging as thedoor opened and closed. I could hear Embry\u0027s mom at the cash register, printing out a receipt.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I could hear the tide raking across the beach rocks. I could hear the kids squeal as the icy water rushedin too fast for them to get out of the way. I could hear the moms complain about the wet clothes. And Icould hear a familiar voice....\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I was listening so hard that the sudden burst of Paul\u0027s donkey laugh made me jump half off the bed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Get out of my house,\" I grumbled. Knowing he wouldn\u0027t pay any attention, I followed my own advice. Iwrenched open my window and climbed out the back way so that I wouldn\u0027t see Paul again. It would betoo tempting. I knew I would hit him again, and Rachel was going to be pissed enough already. She\u0027d seethe blood on his shirt, and she\u0027d blame me right away without waiting for proof. Of course, she\u0027d be right,but still.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I paced down to the shore, my fists in my pockets. Nobody looked at me twice when I went through thedirt lot by First Beach. That was one nice thing about summer—no one cared if you wore nothing butshorts.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I followed the familiar voice I\u0027d heard and found Quil easy enough. He was on the south end of thecrescent, avoiding the bigger part of the tourist crowd. He kept up a constant stream of warnings.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Keep out of the water, Claire. C\u0027mon. No, don\u0027t. Oh! Nice, kid. Seriously, do you want Emily to yell atme? I\u0027m not bringing you back to the beach again if you don\u0027t—Oh yeah? Don\u0027t—ugh. You think that\u0027sfunny, do you? Hah! Who\u0027s laughing now, huh?\"He had the giggling toddler by the ankle when I reached them. She had a bucket in one hand, and herjeans were drenched. He had a huge wet mark down the front of his t-shirt.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Five bucks on the baby girl,\" I said.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Hey, Jake.\"Claire squealed and threw her bucket at Quil\u0027s knees. \"Down, down!\"He set her carefully on her feet and she ran to me. She wrapped her arms around my leg.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"UncaJay!\"\"How\u0027s it going, Claire?\"She giggled. \"Qwil aaaaawl wet now.\"\"I can see that. Where\u0027s your mama?\"\"Gone, gone, gone,\" Claire sang, \"Cwaire pway wid Qwil aaaawl day. Cwaire nebber gowin home.\"She let go of me and ran to Quil. He scooped her up and slung her onto his shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Sounds like somebody\u0027s hit the terrible twos.\"\"Threes actually,\" Quil corrected. \"You missed the party. Princess theme. She made me wear a crown,and then Emily suggested they all try out her new play makeup on me.\"\"Wow, I\u0027m really sorry I wasn\u0027t around to see that.\"\"Don\u0027t worry, Emily has pictures. Actually, I look pretty hot.\"\"You\u0027re such a patsy.\"Quil shrugged. \"Claire had a great time. That was the point.\"I rolled my eyes. It was hard being around imprinted people. No matter what stage they were in—aboutto tie the knot like Sam or just a much-abused nanny like Quil—the peace and certainty they alwaysradiated was downright puke-inducing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Claire squealed on his shoulders and pointed at the ground. \"Pity wock, Qwil! For me, for me!\"\"Which one, kiddo? The red one?\"\"No wed!\"Quil dropped to his knees—Claire screamed and pulled his hair like a horse\u0027s reigns.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"This blue one?\"\"No, no, no...,\" the little girl sang, thrilled with her new game.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The weird part was, Quil was having just as much fun as she was. He didn\u0027t have that face on that somany of the tourist dads and moms were wearing—the when-is-nap-time? face. You never saw a realparent so jazzed to play whatever stupid kiddie sport their rugrat could think up. I\u0027d seen Quil playpeekaboo for an hour straight without getting bored.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And I couldn\u0027t even make fun of him for it—I envied him too much.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Though I did think it sucked that he had a good fourteen years of monkitude ahead of him until Clairewas his age—for Quil, at least, it was a good thing werewolves didn\u0027t get older. But even all that timedidn\u0027t seem to bother him much.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Quil, you ever think about dating?\" I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Huh?\"\"No, no yewwo!\" Claire crowed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"You know. A real girl. I mean, just for now, right? On your nights off babysitting duty.\"Quil stared at me, his mouth hanging open.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Pity wock! Pity wock!\" Claire screamed when he didn\u0027t offer her another choice. She smacked him onthe head with her little fist.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Sorry, Claire-bear. How about this pretty purple one?\"\"No,\" she giggled. \"No poopoh.\"\"Give me a clue. I\u0027m begging, kid.\"Claire thought it over. \"Gween,\" she finally said.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Quil stared at the rocks, studying them. He picked four rocks in different shades of green, and offeredthem to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Did I get it?\u00277\"Yay!\"\"Which one?\"Vlaaaaw/obdem!!\"She cupped her hands and he poured the small rocks into them. She laughed and immediately clunkedhim on the head with them. He winced theatrically and then got to his feet and started walking back uptoward the parking lot. Probably worried about her getting cold in her wet clothes. He was worse thanany paranoid, overprotective mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Sorry if I was being pushy before, man, about the girl thing,\" I said.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Naw, that\u0027s cool,\" Quil said. \"It kind of took me by surprise is all. I hadn\u0027t thought about it.\"\"I bet she\u0027d understand. You know, when she\u0027s grown up. She wouldn\u0027t get mad that you had a life whileshe was in diapers.\"\"No, I know. I\u0027m sure she\u0027d understand that.\"He didn\u0027t say anything else.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"But you won\u0027t do that, will you?\" I guessed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"I can\u0027t see it,\" he said in a low voice. \"I can\u0027t imagine. I just don\u0027t... see anyone that way. I don\u0027t noticegirls anymore, you know. I don\u0027t see their faces.\"\"Put that together with the tiara and makeup, and maybe Claire will have a different kind of competitionto worry about.\"Quil laughed and made kissing noises at me. \"You available this Friday, Jacob?\"\"You wish,\" I said, and then I made a face. \"Yeah, guess I am, though.\"He hesitated a second and then said, \"You ever think about dating?\"I sighed. Guess I\u0027d opened myself up for that one.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"You know, Jake, maybe you should think about getting a life.\"He didn\u0027t say it like a joke. His voice was sympathetic. That made it worse.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"I don\u0027t see them, either, Quil. I don\u0027t see their faces.\"Quil sighed, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Far away, too low for anyone but just us two to hear it over the waves, a howl rose out of the forest.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\"Dang, that\u0027s Sam,\" Quil said. His hands flew up to touch Claire, as if making sure she was still there. \"Idon\u0027t know where her mom\u0027s at!\"Til see what it is. If we need you, HI let you know.\" I raced through the words. They came out allslurred together. \"Hey, why don\u0027t you take her up to the Clearwaters\u0027? Sue and Billy can keep an eye onher if they need to. They might know what\u0027s going on, anyway.\"\"Okay—get outta here, Jake!\"I took off running, not for the dirt path through the weedy hedge, but in the shortest line toward theforest. I hurdled the first line of driftwood and then ripped my way through the briars, still running. I feltthe little tears as the thorns cut into my skin, but I ignored them. Their sting would be healed before Imade the trees.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I cut behind the store and darted across the highway. Somebody honked at me. Once in the safety ofthe trees, I ran faster, taking longer strides. People would stare if I was out in the open. Normal peoplecouldn\u0027t run like this. Sometimes I thought it might be fun to enter a race—you know, like the Olympictrials or something. It would be cool to watch the expressions on those star athletes\u0027 faces when I blewby them. Only I was pretty sure the testing they did to make sure you weren\u0027t on steroids would probablyturn up some really freaky crap in my blood.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　As soon as I was in the true forest, unbound by roads or houses, I skidded to a stop and kicked myshorts off. With quick, practiced moves, I rolled them up and tied them to the leather cord around myankle. As I was still pulling the ends tight, I started shifting. The fire trembled down my spine, throwingtight spasms out along my arms and legs. It only took a second. The heat flooded through me, and I feltthe silent shimmer that made me something else. I threw my heavy paws against the matted earth andstretched my back in one long, rolling extension.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Phasing was very easy when I was centered like this. I didn\u0027t have issues with my temper anymore.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Except when it got in the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　For one half second, I remembered the awful moment at that unspeakable joke of a wedding. I\u0027d beenso insane with fury that I couldn\u0027t make my body work right. I\u0027d been trapped, shaking and burning,unable to make the change and kill the monster just a few feet away from me. It had been so confusing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Dying to kill him. Afraid to hurt her. My friends in the way. And then, when I was finally able to take theform I wanted, the order from my leader. The edict from the Alpha. If it had been just Embry and Quilthere that night without Sam... would I have been able to kill the murderer, then?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I hated it when Sam laid down the law like that. I hated the feeling of having no choice. Of having toobey.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　And then I was conscious of an audience. I was not alone in my thoughts.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　So self-absorbed all the time,Leah thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Yeah, no hypocrisy there, Leah,I thought back.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Can it, guys,Sam told us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　We fell silent, and I felt Leah\u0027s wince at the word guys. Touchy, like always.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Sam pretended not to notice. Where\u0027s Quil andJared?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Quit\u0027s got Claire. He\u0027s taking her to the Clearwaters\u0027.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Good. Sue will take her.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Jared was going to Kim\u0027s,Embry thought. Good chance he didn\u0027t hear you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　There was a low grumble through the pack. I moaned along with them. When Jared finally showed up,no doubt he\u0027d still be thinking about Kim. And nobody wanted a replay of what they were up to rightnow.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Sam sat back on his haunches and let another howl rip into the air. It was a signal and an order in one.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The pack was gathered a few miles east of where I was. I loped through the thick forest toward them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Leah,Embry, and Paul all were working in toward them, too. Leah was close—soon I could hear her footfallsnot far into the woods. We continued in a parallel line, choosing not to run together.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Well, we\u0027re not waiting all day for him. He\u0027ll just have to catch up later.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　\u0027Sup, boss?Paul wanted to know.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　We need to talk. Something\u0027s happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I felt Sam\u0027s thoughts flicker to me—and not just Sam\u0027s, but Seth\u0027s and Collin\u0027s and Brady\u0027s as well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Collin and Brady—the new kids—had been running patrol with Sam today, so they would knowwhatever he knew. I didn\u0027t know why Seth was already out here, and in the know. It wasn\u0027t his turn.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Seth, tell them what you heard.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I sped up, wanting to be there. I heard Leah move faster, too. She hated being outrun. Being the fastestwas the only edge she claimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Claimthis, moron, she hissed, and then she really kicked it into gear. I dug my nails into the loam andshot myself forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Sam didn\u0027t seem in the mood to put up with our usual crap. Jake, Leah, give it a rest.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Neither of us slowed.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Sam growled, but let it go. Seth?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Charlie called around till he found Billy at my house.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Yeah, I talked to him,Paul added.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I felt a jolt go through me as Seth thought Charlie\u0027s name. This was it. The waiting was over. I ran faster,forcing myself to breathe, though my lungs felt kinda stiff all of a sudden.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Which story would it be?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　So he\u0027s all flipped out. Guess Edward and Bella got home last week, and...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　My chest eased up.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　She was alive. Or she wasn\u0027t dead dead, at least.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I hadn\u0027t realized how much difference it would make to me. I\u0027d been thinking of her as dead this wholetime, and I only saw that now. I saw that I\u0027d never believed that he would bring her back alive. Itshouldn\u0027t matter, because I knew what was coming next.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Yeah, bro, and here\u0027s the bad news. Charlie talked to her, said she sounded bad. She told him she\u0027ssick. Carlisle got on and told Charlie that Bella picked up some rare disease in South America. Said she\u0027squarantined. Charlie\u0027s going crazy, \u0027cause even he\u0027s not allowed to see her. He says he doesn\u0027t care if hegets sick, but Carlisle wouldn\u0027t bend. No visitors. Told Charlie it was pretty serious, but that he\u0027s doingeverything he can. Charlie\u0027s been stewing about it for days, but he only called Billy now. He said shesounded worse today.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The mental silence when Seth finished was profound. We all understood.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　So she would die of this disease, as far as Charlie knew. Would they let him view the corpse? The pale,perfectly still, unbreathing white body? They couldn\u0027t let him touch the cold skin—he might notice howhard it was.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　They\u0027d have to wait until she could hold still, could keep from killing Charlie and the other mourners.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　How long would that take?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Would they bury her? Would she dig herself out, or would the bloodsuckers come for her?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The others listened to my speculating in silence. I\u0027d put a lot more thought into this than any of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Leah and I entered the clearing at nearly the same time. She was sure her nose led the way, though. Shedropped onto her haunches beside her brother while I trotted forward to stand at Sam\u0027s right hand. Paulcircled and made room for me in my place.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Beatcha again,Leah thought, but I barely heard her.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I wondered why I was the only one on my feet. My fur stood up on my shoulders, bristling withimpatience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Well, what are we waiting for?I asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　No one said anything, but I heard their feelings of hesitation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Oh, come on! The treaty\u0027s broken!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　We have no proof —maybe sheis sick....\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　OH, PLEASE!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Okay, so the circumstantial evidence is pretty strong. Still... Jacob.Sam\u0027s thought came slow, hesitant.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Are you sure this is what you want? Is it really the right thing? We all know what she wanted.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The treaty doesn\u0027t mention anything about victim preferences, Sam!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Is she really a victim? Would you label her that way?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Yes!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Jake,Seth thought, they aren\u0027t our enemies.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Shut up, kid! Just \u0027cause you\u0027ve got some kind of sick hero worship thing going on with thatbloodsucker, it doesn\u0027t change the law. They are our enemies. They are in our territory. We take themout. I don\u0027t care if you had fun fighting alongside Edward Cullen once upon a time.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　So what are you going to do when Bella fights with them, Jacob? Huh?Seth demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　She\u0027s not Bella anymore.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　You gonna be the one to take her down?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I couldn\u0027t stop myself from wincing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　No, you\u0027re not. So, what? You gonna make one of us do it? And then hold a grudge against whoever itis forever?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I wouldn\u0027t...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Sure you won\u0027t. You\u0027re not ready for this fight, Jacob.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Instinct took over and I crouched forward, snarling at the gangly sand-colored wolf across the circle.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Jacob!Sam cautioned. Seth, shut up for a second.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Seth nodded his big head.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Dang, what\u0027d I miss? Qu\\thought. He was running for the gathering place full-out. Heard aboutCharlie\u0027s call....\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Were getting ready to go,I told him. Why don\u0027t you swing by Kim\u0027s and drag Jared out with yourteeth? We\u0027re going to need everyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Come straight here, Quil,Sam ordered. We\u0027ve decided nothing yet.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I growled.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Jacob, I have to think about what\u0027s best for this pack. I have to choose the course that protects you allbest. Times have changed since our ancestors made that treaty. I... well, I don\u0027t honestly believe that theCullens are a danger to us. And we know that they will not be here much longer. Surely once they\u0027ve toldtheir story, they will disappear. Our lives can return to normal.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Normal?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　If we challenge them, Jacob, they will defend themselves well.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Are you afraid?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Are you so ready to losea brother? He paused. Or a sister? he tacked on as an afterthought.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I\u0027m not afraid to die.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I know that, Jacob. It\u0027s one reason I question your judgment on this.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I stared into his black eyes. Do you intend to honor our fathers\u0027 treaty or not?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I honor my pack. I do what\u0027s best for them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Coward.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　His muzzle tensed, pulling back over his teeth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Enough, Jacob. You\u0027re overruled.Sam\u0027s mental voice changed, took on that strange double timbre thatwe could not disobey. The voice of the Alpha. He met the gaze of every wolf in the circle.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　The pack is not attacking the Cullens without provocation. The spirit of the treaty remains. They are notadanger to our people, nor are they a danger to the people of Forks. Bella Swan made an informedchoice, and we are not going to punish our former allies for her choice.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Hear, hear,Seth thought enthusiastically.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　/ thought I told you to shut it, Seth.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Oops. Sorry, Sam.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Jacob, where do you think you\u0027re going?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I left the circle, moving toward the west so that I could turn my back on him. I\u0027m going to tell myfather goodbye. Apparently there was no purpose in me sticking around this long.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Aw, Jake— don\u0027t do that again!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Shut up, Seth,several voices thought together.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　We don\u0027t want you to leave,Sam told me, his thought softer than before.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　So force me to stay, Sam. Take away my will. Make me a slave.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　You know I won\u0027t do thatThen there\u0027s nothing more to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I ran away from them, trying very hard not to think about what was next. Instead, I concentrated on mymemories of the long wolf months, of letting the humanity bleed out of me until I was more animal thanman. Living in the moment, eating when hungry, sleeping when tired, drinking when thirsty, and running—running just to run. Simple desires, simple answers to those desires. Pain came in easily managedforms. The pain of hunger. The pain of cold ice under your paws. The pain of cutting claws when dinnergot feisty. Each pain had a simple answer, a clear action to end that pain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Not like being human.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Yet, as soon as I was in jogging distance of my house, I shifted back into my human body. I needed tobe able to think in privacy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I untied my shorts and yanked them on, already running for the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　I\u0027d done it. I\u0027d hidden what I was thinking and now it was too late for Sam to stop me. He couldn\u0027t hearme now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Sam had made a very clear ruling. The pack would not attack the Cullens. Okay.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　He hadn\u0027t mentioned an individual acting alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　Nope, the pack wasn\u0027t attacking anyone today.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e　　But I was.  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/151/5979.html","bookId":740,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 11:54:13 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 11:54:13 PM"}
