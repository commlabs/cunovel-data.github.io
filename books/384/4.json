{"id":37803,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 3 Dearly Departed","content":"\u003cp\u003ePolice Plaza, Haven City;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Lower Elements Captain Holly Short was up for a promotion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was the career turnaround of the century. Less than a year had passed since she had been the subject of two internal affairs inquiries, but now, after six successful missions, Holly was the Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance squad’s golden fairy. The Council would soon meet to decide whether or not she would be the first female major in LEP-RECON’S history. And to tell the truth, the prospect did not appeal to her one bit.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMajors rarely got to strap on a set of wings and fly between land and stars. Instead, they spent their time sending junior officers topside on missions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly had made up her mind to turn down the promotion if it were offered to her. She could live with a smaller paycheck if it meant she could still see the surface on a regular basis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly decided it would be wise to tell Commander Julius Root what she planned to do. After all, it was Root who had stood by her through the inquiries, and it was Root who had recommended her for promotion in the first place. The commander would not take the news well. He never took any kind of news well: even good news was received with a gruff thank-you and a slammed door.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly stood outside Root’s office on that morning, working up the courage to knock. And even though, at three feet exactly, she was just below the average fairy height, Holly was glad of the half inch granted by her spiky auburn hair.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could knock, the door was yanked open, and Root’s rosy-cheeked face appeared in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Captain Short!“ he roared, his gray buzz cut quivering. ”Get in here!“ Then he noticed Holly standing beside the door. “Oh, there you are. Come in. We have a puzzle that needs solving. It involves one of our goblin friends.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly followed Root into the office. Foaly, the LEP’S technical adviser, was already there, close enough to the wall plasma screen to singe his nose hairs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Howler’s Peak video,“ explained Root.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘General Scalene escaped.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Escaped?“ echoed Holly. ”Do we know how?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly snapped his fingers. “D’Arvit! That’s what we should be thinking about, instead of standing around here playing still Spy!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘We don’t have time for the usual sarcastic small talk, Foaly,“ snapped Root, his complexion deepening to burgundy. ”This is a PR disaster.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eScalene is public enemy number two, second only to Opal Koboi herself. If the journos get wind of this, we’ll be the laughingstock of Haven. Not to mention the fact that Scalene could round up a few of his goblin buddies and reactivate the triad.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly crossed to the screen, elbowing Foaly’s hindquarters out of the way. Her little talk with Commander Root could wait. There was police work to be done.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What are we looking at?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly highlighted a section of the screen with a laser pointer. “Howler’s Peak, goblin correctional facility. Camera eighty-six.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Which shows?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘The visiting room. Scalene went in, but he never came out.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly scanned the camera list. “No camera in the room itself?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot coughed, or it may have been an actual growl. “No. According to the third Atlantis convention on fairy rights, detainees are entitled to privacy in the visiting room.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘So we don’t know what went on in there?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Not as such, no.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What genius designed this system, anyway?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of the seriousness of the situation, Root chuckled. He never could resist needling the smug centaur.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Our horsey friend here designed the Howler’s Peak automated security system all on his own.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly pouted, and when a centaur pouts, his bottom lip almost reaches his chin. “It’s not the system. The system is foolproof. Every prisoner has the standard subcutaneous seeker-sleeper in his head. Even if a goblin manages to miraculously escape, we can remotely knock them out, then pick him up.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly raised her palms. “So what’s the problem?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘The problem is that the seeker-sleeper is not broadcasting. Or, if it is, we’re not picking up the signal.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘That is a problem.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot lit a noxious fungal cigar. The smoke was instantly whipped away by an air recycler on his desk. “Major Kelp is out with a mobile unit, trying to get a fix on a signal.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTrouble Kelp had recently been promoted to Root’s second in command. He was not the kind of officer who liked sitting behind a desk, unlike his little brother, Corporal Grub Kelp, who would like nothing better than to be stuck behind a nice safe desk for the remainder of his career. If Holly was forced into promotion, she hoped she could be half the major that Trouble was.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly returned her attention to the plasma screen. “So, who was visiting General Scalene?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘One of his thousand nephews. A goblin by the name of Boohn. Apparently that means of noble brow in Goblin cant.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I remember him,“ said Holly. ”Boohn.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCustoms and excise think he’s one of the goblins behind the B’wa Kell smuggling operation. There’s nothing noble about him.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly opened a folder on the plasma screen with his laser pointer. “Here’s the visitor list. Boohn checks in at seven fifty, Lower Elements mean time. At least I can show you that on video.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA grainy screen showed a bulky goblin in the prison’s access corridor, nervously licking his eyeballs while the security laser scanned him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnce it was confirmed that Boohn wasn’t trying to smuggle anything in, the visitors“ door popped open.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly scrolled down the list. “And look here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe checks out at eight fifteen.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBoohn left swiftly, obviously uncomfortable in the facility. The parking lot camera showed him reverting to all fours for a dash to his car.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly scanned the list carefully. “So you’re saying that Boohn checked out at eight fifteen?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I just said that didn’t I, Holly“ replied Foaly testily. “I’ll say it again slowly. Eight fifteen.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly snatched the laser pointer. “Well, if that’s true, how did he manage to check out again at eight twenty?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. Eight lines down on the list, Boohn’s name popped up again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I saw that already. It’s a glitch,“ muttered Foaly. ”That’s...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t leave twice. It’s not possible. We get that sometimes, a bug, nothing more.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Unless it wasn’t him the second time.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe centaur folded his arms defensively.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t you think I thought of that? Every one who enters or leaves Howler’s Peak is scanned a dozen times. We take at least eighty facial points of reference with each scan. If the computer says Boohn, then that’s who it was. There’s no way a goblin beat my system. They barely have enough brainpower to walk and talk at the same time.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly used the pointer to review the entry video of Boohn. She enlarged his head, using a photo-manipulation program to sharpen the image.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What are you looking for?“ asked Root.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know, Commander. Something. Anything.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt took a few minutes, but finally Holly got it. She knew immediately that she was right. Her intuition was buzzing like a swarm of bees at the base of her neck. “Look here,” she said, enlarging Boohn’s brow. “A scale blister. This goblin is shedding.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘So?“ said Foaly grumpily.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly reopened Boohn’s exit file. “Now look. No blister.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘So he burst the blister. Big deal.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘No. It’s more than that. Going in, Boohn’s skin was almost gray. Now he’s bright green. He even has a camouflage pattern on his back.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly snorted. “A lot of good camouflage is in the city.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s your point, Captain?“ asked Root, stubbing out his cigar.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Boohn shed his skin in the visitors’ room. So where’s the skin?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence for a long moment as the others absorbed the implications of this question.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Would it work?“ asked Root urgently.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly was almost dumbstruck. “By the gods, I think it would.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe centaur pulled out a keyboard, his thick fingers flying across the Gnommish letters. A new video box appeared on the screen. In this box, another goblin was leaving the room. It looked a lot like Boohn. A lot, but not exactly. Something wasn’t quite right. Foaly zoomed in on the goblin’s head. At high magnification it was clear that the goblin’s skin was ill-fitting. Patches were missing altogether, and the goblin seemed to be holding folds together across his waist.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘He did it. I can’t believe it.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘This was all planned,“ said Holly. ”This was no opportunistic act. Boohn waits until he’s shedding. Then he visits his uncle and they peel off his skin. General Scalene puts on the skin and just walks out the front door, fooling all your scanners on the way. When Boohn’s name shows up again, you think it’s a glitch. Simple, but completely ingenious.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly collapsed into a specially designed office chair. “This is incredible. Can goblins do that?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you kidding?“ said Root. ”A good goblin seamstress can peel a skin without a single tear. That’s what they make their clothes from, when they bother wearing any.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I know that. I meant, could goblins think of this all on their own. I don’t think so. We need to catch Scalene and find out who planned this.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly dialed a connection to the Koboi-cam in the Argon clinic. “I’m going to check that Opal Koboi is still under. This sort of thing is just her style.” A minute later, he swiveled to face Root. “Nope. Still in dreamland. I don’t know if that’s good or bad. I’d hate to have Opal back in circulation, but at least we’d know what we were up against.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA thought struck Holly, draining the blood from her face. “You don’t think it could be him, do you?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn’t be Artemis Fowl?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Definitely not,“ said Foaly. ”It’s not the Mud Boy. Impossible.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot wasn’t convinced. “I wouldn’t be throwing that word around so much, if I were you. Holly, as soon as we catch Scalene, I want you to sign out a surveillance pack and spend a couple of days on the Mud Boy’s trail. See what he’s up to. Just in case.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, sir.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘And you, Foaly. I’m authorizing a surveillance upgrade. Whatever you need. I want to hear every call Artemis makes, and read every letter he sends.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘But, Julius. I supervised his mind wipe myself. It was a sweet job. I scooped out his fairy memories cleaner than a goblin sucking a snail out of its shell. If we were to turn up at Artemis’s front door dancing the cancan, he still wouldn’t remember us. It would take some kind of planted trigger to initiate even partial recall.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot did not appreciate being argued with.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘One, don’t call me Julius. Two, do what I say, horsey boy, or I’ll have your budget slashed. And three, what in Frond’s name is the cancan?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly rolled his eyes. “Forget it. I’ll organize the upgrades.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Wise move,“ said Root, plucking a vibrating phone from his belt. He listened for several seconds, grunting affirmatives into the speaker.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Forget Fowl for the moment,“ he said, closing the phone. ”Trouble has located General Scalene. He’s in E37. Holly, you’re with me. Foaly, you follow us in the tech shuttle. Apparently the general wants to talk.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHaven City was waking up for morning trade.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlthough to call it morning was a bit misleading, as there was only artificial light this far underground. By human standards, Haven was barely more than a village, having fewer than ten thousand inhabitants. But in fairy terms, Haven was the largest metropolis since the original Atlantis, most of which lay buried beneath a three-story shuttle dock in the new Atlantis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCommander Root’s LEP cruiser cut through the rush- hour traffic, its magnetic field automatically shunting other vehicles out of the way into slots in the slow lane. Root and Holly sat in the back, wishing the journey away. This situation was becoming stranger by the minute. First of all, Scalene escapes, and now his locater shows up and he wants to talk to Commander Root.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you make of this?“ asked Root eventually. One of the reasons he made such a fine commander was that he respected his officers’ opinions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know. It could be a trap. Whatever happens, you can’t go in there alone.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot nodded. “I know. Even I am not that stubborn. Anyway, Trouble will probably have the situation secured by the time I get there. He doesn’t like waiting around for the brass to arrive. Like someone else I know, eh, Holly?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly half grinned, half grimaced. She had been reprimanded more than once for ignoring the order to wait for reinforcements.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot raised the soundproof barrier between them and the driver.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘We need to talk, Holly. About the major thing.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly looked her superior in the eyes. There was a touch of sadness in them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I didn’t get it,“ she blurted, unable to hide her relief.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘No. No, you did get it. Or you will. The official announcement is tomorrow. The first female major in Recon history. Quite an achievement.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘But, Commander, I don’t think that…“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot silenced her with a wave of his finger. “I want to tell you something, Holly. About my career. It’s actually a metaphor for your career, so listen carefully and see if you can figure it out. Many years ago, when you were still wearing one-piece baby suits with padded backsides, I was a hotshot Recon jock. I loved the smell of fresh air. Every moment I spent in the moonlight was a golden moment.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly had no trouble putting herself in the commander’s shoes. She felt exactly the same way about her own surface trips.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘So I did my job as well as I could-a little bit too well, as it happened. One day I went and got myself promoted.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot clamped a purifier globe around the end of a cigar so the smell would not stink up the car. It was a rare gesture.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Major Julius Root. It was the last thing I wanted, so I marched in to my commander’s office and told him so. “I’m a field fairy,” I said. “I don’t want to sit behind a desk filling out e-forms.” Believe it or not, I got quite agitated.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly tried to look amazed, but couldn’t pull it off. The commander spent most of his time in an agitated red-faced state which explained his nickname, Beetroot.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘But my commander said something that changed my mind. Do you want to know what that was?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot plowed on with his story without waiting for an answer. “My commander said; ”Julius, this promotion is not for you; it’s for the People.“” Root raised one eyebrow. “Do you see what I’m getting at?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly knew what he meant. It was the flaw in her argument.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot placed a hand on her shoulder. “The People need good officers, Holly. They need fairies like you to protect them from the Mud Men. Would I prefer to be zipping around under the stars with the wind in my nostrils? Yes. Would I do as much good? No.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot paused to suck deeply on his cigar, the glow illuminated the purifier globe. “You’re a good Recon officer, Holly. One of the best I’ve seen. A bit impulsive at times, not much respect for authority, but an intuitive officer, nonetheless. I wouldn’t dream of taking you off the front lines if I didn’t think you could serve the LEP better belowground. Do you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Commander,“ said Holly glumly. He was right, even if her selfish side wasn’t ready to accept it just yet. At least she had the Fowl surveillance to look forward to before her new job anchored her in the lower elements.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is a perk to being a major,“ said Root.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Sometimes, just to relieve the boredom, you can give yourself an assignment. Something on the surface. In Hawaii, maybe, or New Zealand. Look at Trouble Kelp. He’s a new breed of major, more hands-on. Maybe that’s what the LEP needs.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly knew that the commander was trying to soften the blow. As soon as the major’s acorns were on her lapel, she wouldn’t get aboveground as much as she did now. If she was lucky.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m putting my neck on the block here, Holly, recommending you for major. Your career so far has been, eventful, to say the least. If you intend to turn the promotion down, tell me now and I’ll withdraw your name.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLast chance, thought Holly. Now or never.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘No,“ she said. ”I won’t turn it down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow could I? Who knows when the next Artemis Fowl will turn up?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn Holly’s ears, her voice sounded distant, as though someone else were speaking. She imagined the bells of lifelong boredom clanging behind her every word. A desk job. She had a desk job.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot patted her on the shoulder, his huge hand knocking the air from her lungs. “Cheer up, Captain. There is life belowground, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I know,“ Holly said with an utter lack of conviction.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe police cruiser pulled in beside E37.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot opened the car door, began to disembark, then stopped.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘If it makes any difference,“ he said quietly, almost awkwardly, ”I’m proud of you, Holly.“ And he was gone, out the door and into the throng of LEP officers training their weapons on the chute entrance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt does make a difference, thought Holly, watching the commander instantly take command of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA big difference.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe chutes were natural magma vents that stretched from the earth’s core to the planet’s surface. Most emerged under water, supplying warm streams that nurtured deep- sea life, but some filtered their gasses through the network of cracks and fissures that riddled the dry land surface. The LEP used the power of magma flares to propel their officers to the surface in titanium eggs. A more leisurely shuttle trip could be taken in a dormant chute.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eE37 emerged in downtown Paris, and until recently, had been the chute used by goblins in their smuggling operations. Closed to the public for many years, the chute’s terminal had fallen into disrepair. Currently, E37’s only occupants were the members of a movie company that was making a TV film about the B’wa Kell rebellion. Holly was being portrayed by three-time AMP winner, Skylar Peat, and Artemis Fowl was to be completely computer generated. When Holly and Root arrived, Major Trouble Kelp had three squads of tactical LEP arranged around the terminal’s entrance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Fill me in, Major,“ ordered Root.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eKelp pointed to the entrance. “We have one way in, and no way out. All the secondary entrances have long since subsided, so if Scalene is in there, he has to go through us to go home.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Are we sure he’s there?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘No,“ admitted Major Kelp. ”We picked up his signal. But whoever helped him to escape could have sliced open his head and removed the transmitter. All we know for sure is that someone is playing games with us. I sent in a couple of my best Recon sprites and they came back with this.“ Trouble handed them a sound wafer. The wafers were the size of a thumbnail and were generally used to record short birthday greetings. This one was in the shape of a birthday cake. Root closed his fingers around the wafer. The heat from his hand would power its microcircuits.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA sibilant voice issued from the tiny speaker, made even more reptilian by the cheap wiring.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Root,“ said the voice. ”I would speak to you. I would tell you a great secret. Bring the female, Holly Short. Two only, no more. Any more, and many will die. My comrades will see to it.. The message ended with a traditional birthday jingle, its cheeriness at odds with the message.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot scowled. “Goblins. Drama queens, the lot of them.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s a trap, Commander,“ said Holly without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘We were the ones at Koboi Labs a year ago. The goblins hold us responsible for the rebellion’s failure. If we go in there, who knows what’s waiting for us.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot nodded approvingly. “Now you’re thinking like a major. We’re not expendable. So what are our options, Trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘If you don’t go in, many will die. If you do, you might.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Not a nice set of options. Don’t you have anything good to tell me?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTrouble lowered his helmet’s visor, consulting a mini- screen on the Perspex. “We managed to get the terminal’s security scanners back online and ran substance and thermal scans. We found a single heat source in the access tunnel, so Scalene is alone, if it’s him. Whatever he’s doing in there, he doesn’t have any known form of weaponry or explosives. Just a few beetle bars and some good old H2O.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Any magma flares due?“ asked Holly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTrouble ran his index finger along a pad on his left glove, scrolling down the screen on his visor. “Nothing for a couple of months. That chute is intermittent. So Scalene is not planning to bake you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot’s cheeks glowed like two heating coils.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘D’Arvit,“ he swore. ”I thought our goblin troubles were over. I’m tempted just to send in tactical and take a chance that Scalene is bluffing.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘That would be my advice,“ said Trouble. ”He doesn’t have anything in there that could harm you. Give me five fairies, and we’ll have Scalene in a wagon before he knows he’s been arrested.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I take it the sleeper half of the seeker-sleeper is not working?“ said Holly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTrouble shrugged. “We have to suppose it’s not. The seeker-sleeper didn’t function until now, and when we got here the wafer was left out for us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eScalene knew we were coming. He even left a message.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot punched his palm with a fist. “I have to go in. There’s no immediate danger inside, and we can’t assume that Scalene hasn’t come up with a way to carry out his threat. I don’t have a choice, not really. I won’t order you to come with me, Captain Short.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly felt her stomach lurch, but she swallowed the fear. The Commander was right. There was no other way. This was what being an LEP officer was all about. Protecting the People.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You don’t have to order me, Commander. I volunteer.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Good. Now, Trouble, let Foaly and his shuttle through the barricade. We may have to go in, but we don’t have to go in unarmed.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly had more weaponry crammed into the back of a single shuttle than most human police forces had in their entire arsenal. Every inch of wall space had a power cable screwed into it or a rifle dangling from a hook. The centaur sat on the center, fine-tuning a Neutrino handgun. He tossed it to Holly as she entered the van.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe caught it deftly. “Hey, careful with that.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly snickered. “Don’t worry. The trigger hasn’t been coded yet. Nobody can fire this weapon until its computer registers an owner. Even if this weapon did fall into goblin hands, it would be useless to them. One of my latest developments. After the B’wa Kell rebellion, I thought it was time to upgrade our security.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly wrapped her fingers around the pistol’s grip. A red scanner light ran the length of the plastic butt, then switched to green.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s it. You’re the owner. From now on that Neutrino 3000 is a one-female gun.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly hefted the transparent gun in her fist. “It’s too light. I prefer the 2000.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly brought the gun’s specifications up on a wall screen. “It’s light, but you’ll get used to it. On the plus side, there are no metal parts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s powered by kinetics, the motion of your body, with a backup mini-nuke cell. Naturally it’s linked to a targeting system in your helmet. The casing is virtually impregnable, and if I do say so myself, it’s a cool piece of hardware.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly passed a larger version of the gun to Root. “Every shot is registered on the LEP computer, so we can tell who fired, when they fired, and in what direction. That should save internal affairs a lot of computer time.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe winked at Holly. “Something you’ll be glad to hear.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly leered back at the centaur. She was well known to IA. They had already conducted two inquiries into her professional conduct, and would just love the opportunity backslash to conduct a third. The one good thing about being promoted would be the looks on their faces when the. commander pinned those major’s acorns to her lapel.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot holstered his weapon. “Okay. Now we can shoot. But what if we get shot?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You won’t get shot,“ insisted Foaly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ve hacked into the terminal scanners, I’ve planted a couple of sensors of my own, too.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere’s nothing in there that can harm you. Worst-case scenario, you trip over your own feet and get a sprained ankle.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot’s complexion reddened all the way down his neck. “Foaly, do I have to remind you that your sensors have been fooled before, in this very terminal, if I remember correctly.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Okay, okay. Take it easy, Commander,“ said Foaly under his breath. ”I haven’t forgotten about last year. How could I with Holly reminding me every five minutes?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe centaur hefted two sealed suitcases onto a workbench. He keyed in a number sequence on their security pads and popped the lids. “These are the next- generation Recon suits. I was planning to unveil them at the LEP conference next month, but with a real-live commander going into action, you better have them today.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly pulled a jumpsuit from the case. It glittered briefly, then turned the color of the van walls.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘The fabric is actually woven from cam-foil, so you are virtually hidden all the time. It saves you using your magical shield,“ explained Foaly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course the function can be turned off. The wings are built into this suit. A completely retractable whisper design, a brand-new concept in wing construction. They take their power from a cell on your belt, and of course each wing is coated with mini-solars for aboveground flights. The suits also have their own pressure equalizers; now you can go directly from one environment to another without getting the bends.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot held the second suit before him. “These must cost a fortune.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFoaly nodded. “You have no idea. Half of my research budget for last year went to developing those suits. They won’t replace the old suit for five years at least. Those two are the only operational models we have, so I would appreciate getting them back. They are shockproof, fire resistant, invisible to radar, and relay a continuous stream of diagnostic information back to Police Plaza. The current LEP helmet sends us basic vitals data, but the new suit sends a second stream of information that can tell us if your arteries are blocked, diagnose fractured bones, and even detect dry skin. It’s a flying clinic. There’s even a bulletproof plate on the chest, in case a human shoots at you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly held the suit before a green plasma screen. The cam-foil instantly turned emerald.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I like it,“ she said. ”Green is my color.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTrouble Kelp had commandeered spotlights left on-site by the movie company and directed them into the shuttleport’s lower level. The stark light picked up every floating speck of dust, giving the entire departures area an underwater feel. Commander Root and Captain Short edged into the room, weapons drawn and visors down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you think of the suit?“ asked Holly, automatically keeping track of the various displays on the inside of her visor. LEP trainees often had difficulty developing the double focus needed to watch the terrain and their helmet screens. This often resulted in an action known as filling the vase, which was how LEP officers referred to throwing up in one’s helmet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Not bad,“ replied Root. ”Light as a feather, and you wouldn’t even know you were wearing wings.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDon’t tell Foaly I said that; his head is swelled enough as it is.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘No need to tell me, Commander,“ said Foaly’s voice in his earpiece. The speakers were a new gel-vibration variety, and it sounded as though the centaur was in the helmet with him. ”I’m with you every step of the way, from the safety of the shuttle, of course.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course,“ said Root dourly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe pair advanced cautiously past a line of check-in booths. Foaly had assured them that there was no possible danger in this area of the terminal, but the centaur had been wrong before. And mistakes in the field cost lives.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe film company had decided that the actual dirt in the terminal was not authentic enough, and so had sprayed piles of gray foam in various corners.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey had even added a doll’s head to one mound. A poignant touch, or so they thought. The walls and escalator were blackened with fake laser burns.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Quite a shooting match,“ said Root, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Slightly exaggerated. I doubt if half a dozen shots were fired.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey proceeded through the embarkation area into the docking zone. The original shuttle used by the goblins in their smuggling runs had been resurrected and lay in the docking bay. The shuttle had been painted gloss black to make it seem more menacing, and a goblinesque decorated prow had been added to its nose.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘How far?“ said Root into his mike.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m transferring the thermal signature to your helmets,“ replied Foaly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later a schematic appeared in their visors. The plan was slightly confusing, as, in effect, they were looking down on themselves. There were three heat sources in the building. Two were close together, moving slowly toward the chute itself: Holly and the commander. The third figure was stationary in the access tunnel. Inches past the third figure, the thermoscan was whited out by the ambient heat from E37.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the blast doors: seven feet of solid steel that separated the access tunnel from the rest of the terminal. Shuttles and eggs would glide in on a magnetized rail, to be dropped into the chute itself. The doors were sealed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Can you open these remotely, Foaly?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘But of course, Commander. I have managed, quite ingeniously, to marry my operating system with the terminal’s old computers. That wasn’t as easy as it sounds…“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ll take your word for it,“ said the commander, cutting Foaly off. ”Just push the button, before I come out there and push it with your face.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Some things never change,“ muttered Foaly, pushing the button.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe access tunnel smelled like a blast furnace. Ancient swirls of melted ore hung from the roof, and the ground underfoot was cracked and treacherous. Each footfall punctured a crust of soot, leaving a trail of deep footprints. There was another set of footprints leading to the shadowy figure huddled on the ground a few feet from the chute itself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘There,“ said Root.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Got him,“ said Holly, resting the bull’s-eye of her laser sight on the figure’s trunk.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Keep him covered,“ ordered the commander.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m going down.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot advanced along the tunnel, keeping well out of Holly’s line of fire. If Scalene did make a move, Holly would need a clear shot.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut the general (if it was him) squatted immobile, his spine curled along the tunnel wall. His frame was covered by a full-length hooded cape.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe commander turned on his helmet PA, so he could be heard above the howl of core wind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You there. Stand facing the wall. Place your hands on your head.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe figure did not move. Holly had not expected it to. Root stepped closer, always cautious, knees bent, ready to dive to one side.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe poked the figure’s shoulder with his Neutrino 3000.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘On your feet, Scalene.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe poke was sufficient to knock the figure sideways. The goblin keeled over, landing faceup on the tunnel floor. Soot flakes fluttered around him like disturbed bats. The hood flopped to one side, revealing the figure’s face: most important, the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s him,“ said Root. ”He’s been mesmerized.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe general’s slitted eyes were bloodshot and vacant. This was a serious development, as it confirmed that somebody else had planned the escape, and Holly and Root had walked into a trap.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I recommend we leave,“ said Holly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Immediately.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘No,“ said Root, leaning over the goblin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Now that we’re here, we might as well take Scalene back with us.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe placed his free hand on the goblin’s collar, preparing to haul him to his feet. Later, Holly would record in her report that it was at that precise moment when things began to go terribly wrong. What had been a routine, albeit strange, assignment, suddenly became an altogether more sinister affair.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Do not touch me, elf,“ said a voice. A hissing goblin voice. Scalene’s voice. But how could that be? The general’s lips had not moved.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot reared back, then steadied himself. “What’s going on here?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly’s soldier’s sense was buzzing at the base of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Whatever it is, we won’t like it. We should go, Commander, right now.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot’s features were thoughtful. “That voice came from his chest.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Maybe he had surgery,“ said Holly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Let’s get out of here.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe commander reached down a hand, flipping Scalene’s cape aside. There was a metal box strapped to the general’s chest. The box was a foot square with a small screen in the center. There was a shadowy face on the screen, and it was talking.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, Julius,“ it said in Scalene’s voice. ”I knew you’d come. Commander Root’s famous ego would not allow him to stay out of the action. An obvious trap, and you walked straight into it.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was definitely Scalene’s, but there was something about the phrasing, the cadence. It was too sophisticated for a goblin. Sophisticated and strangely familiar.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Have you figured it out yet, Captain Short?“ said the voice. A voice that was changing. Slipping into a higher register. The tones were no longer male, not even goblin. That’s a female talking, thought Holly. A female that I know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA face appeared on the screen. A beautiful and malicious face. Eyes bright with hate. Opal Koboi’s face. The rest of the head was swathed in bandages, but the features were only too visible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly began to speak rapidly into her helmet mike. “Foaly, we have a situation here. Opal Koboi is loose. I repeat, Koboi is loose. This whole thing is a trap. Cordon off the area, sixteen-hundred-foot perimeter, and bring in the medical warlocks. Someone is about to get hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe face on the screen laughed, tiny pixie teeth glinting like pearls.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Talk all you want, Captain Short. Foaly can’t hear you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMy device has blocked your transmissions as easily as I blocked your seeker-sleeper and the substance scan that I assume you ran. Your little centaur friend can see you, though. I left him his precious lenses.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly immediately zoomed in on Opal’s pixelated face. If Foaly got a shot of the pixie, he would figure out the rest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAgain Koboi laughed. Opal was genuinely enjoying herself. “Oh very good, Captain. You were always a smart one. Relatively speaking, of course. Show Foaly my face and he will initiate an alert. Sorry to disappoint you, Holly, but this entire device is constructed from stealth ore and is practically invisible to the artificial eye. All Foaly will see is a slight shimmer of interference.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStealth ore had been developed for space vehicles. It absorbed every form of wave or signal known to fairy or man, and so was virtually invisible to everything but the naked eye. It was also incredibly expensive to manufacture. Even the small amount necessary to cover Koboi’s device would have cost a warehouse full of gold.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot straightened quickly. “The odds are against us here, Captain. Let’s move out.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly didn’t bother with relief. Opal Koboi wouldn’t make things that easy. There was no way they were just walking out of here. If Foaly could hijack the terminal’s computers, then so could Koboi.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOpal’s laugh stretched to an almost hysterical screech.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘M? we out? How very tactical of you, Commander.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll need to expand your vocabulary. Whatever next? Puck and cover?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly peeled back a Velcro patch on her sleeve, revealing a Gnommish keyboard. She quickly accessed her helmet’s LEP criminal database, opening Opal Koboi’s file in her visor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Opal Koboi,“ said Corporal Frond’s voice. The LEP always used Frond for voice-overs and recruitment videos. She was glamorous and elegant, with flowing blond tresses and inch-long manicured nails that were absolutely no use in the field. ”LEP enemy number one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCurrently under guard in the J. Argon Clinic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOpal Koboi is a certified genius, scoring over three hundred on the standardized IQ test.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe is also a suspected megalomaniac, with an obsessive personality. Studies indicate that Koboi may be a pathological liar, and suffers from mild schizophrenia. For more detailed information, please consult the LEP central library on the second floor of Police Plaza.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly closed the file. An obsessive genius and a pathological liar. Just what they needed. The information didn’t help much; it pretty much told her what she already knew. Opal was loose, she wanted to kill them, and she was smart enough to figure out how to do it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOpal was still enjoying her triumph. “You don’t know how long I have waited for this moment,” the pixie said, then paused. “Actually, you do know. After all, you were the ones who wrecked my plan. And now I have you both.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly was puzzled. Opal may have serious mental issues, but that could not be confused with stupidity. Why would she prattle on? Was she trying to distract them?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe same thing occurred to Root. “Holly! The doors!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly whirled around to see the blast doors sliding across, the sound of their engines masked by core wind. If those doors closed they would be completely cut off from the LEP, and at the mercy of Opal Koboi.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly targeted the magnetic rollers along the doors’ upper rim, sinking blast after blast from her Neutrino into their mechanisms. The doors jerked in their housings, but did not stop. Two of the rollers blew out, but the massive portals’ momentum carried them together. They connected with an ominous bong.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Alone at last,“ said Opal, sounding for all the world like an innocent college fairy on her first date.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot pointed his weapon at the device belted around Scalene’s middle, as if he could somehow hurt Koboi.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you want?“ he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You know what I want,“ replied Opal. ”The question is, how am I going to get it? What form of revenge would be the most satisfying? Naturally, you will both end up dead, but that’s not enough. I want you to suffer as I did. Discredited and despised. One of you at least; the other will have to be sacrificed. I don’t really care which.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot retreated to the blast doors, motioning for Holly follow. “Options?” he whispered, his back to Koboi’s device.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly raised her visor, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow. The helmets were air-conditioned, but sometimes sweating had nothing to do with temperature.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘We have to get out of here,“ she said. ”The chute is the only way.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot nodded. “Agreed. We fly up far enough to clear Koboi’s blocker signal, then alert Major Kelp.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What about Scalene? He’s mesmerized to the gills; he can’t look after himself. If we do escape, Opal is not going to leave him around as evidence.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was basic criminal logic. Your typical take-over-the- world types are not averse to knocking off a few of their own if it means a clean getaway.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot actually growled. “It really tugs my beard to put us in harm’s way over a goblin, but that’s the job. We take Scalene with us. I want you to sink a few charges into that box around his waist, and when the buzzing stops, I throw him over my shoulder and we’re off up E37.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Understood,“ said Holly, lowering the setting on her weapon to minimum. Some of the charge would be transferred to Scalene, but it wouldn’t do much more than dry up his eyeballs for a couple of minutes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIgnore the pixie. Whatever she says, keep your mind on the job.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, sir.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot took several deep breaths. Somehow it calmed Holly to see the commander as nervous as she was. “Okay. Go.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe two elves turned and strode rapidly toward the unconscious goblin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Have we come up with a little plan?“ said Koboi, mocking them from the small screen. ”Something ingenious, I hope. Something I haven’t thought of?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGrim faced, Holly tried to shut out the words, but they wormed their way into her thoughts. Something ingenious? Hardly. It was simply the only option open to them. Something Koboi hadn’t thought of?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDoubtful. Opal conceivably could have been planning this for almost a year. were they just about to do exactly what she wanted?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir…“ began Holly, but Root was already in position beside Scalene.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly fired six charges at the small screen. All six impacted on Koboi’s pixelated features. Opal’s image disappeared in a storm of static. Sparks squeezed between the metal seams and acrid smoke leaked through the speaker grid.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot hesitated for a moment, allowing any charge to disperse, then grabbed Scalene firmly by the shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI was wrong, thought Holly, releasing a breath she not realize she’d been holding. I was wrong, thank the gods. Opal has no plan. But it wasn’t true, and Holly didn’t really believe it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe box around Scalene’s midriff was secured by a set of octo-bonds, eight telescoping cables often used by the LEP to restrain dangerous criminals. They could be locked and unlocked remotely, and once cinched, could not be removed without the remote or an angle grinder. As soon as Root leaned over, the octo-bonds released Scalene and whiplashed around the commander’s torso, releasing Scalene and drawing the metal box tight to Root’s own chest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eKoboi’s face appeared on the reverse side of the box. The smokescreen had been just that: a smokescreen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Commander Root,“ she said, almost breathless with malice. ”It looks like you’re the sacrifice.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘D’Arvit!“ swore Root, beating the metal box with the butt of his pistol. The cords tightened until Root’s breath came in agonized spurts. Holly heard more than one rib crack.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe commander fought the urge to sink to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMagical blue sparks played around his torso, automatically healing the broken bones.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly rushed forward to help, but before she could reach her superior officer, an urgent beeping began to emanate from the device’s speaker. The closer she got, the louder the beep.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Stay back,“ grunted Root. ”Stay back. It’s a trigger.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly stopped in her sooty tracks, punching the air in frustration. But the commander was probably right.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe had heard of proximity triggers before. Dwarfs used them in the mines. They would set a charge in the tunnels, activate a proximity trigger, and then set it off from a safe distance, using a stone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOpal’s face reappeared on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Listen to your Julius, Captain Short,“ advised the pixie. ”This is a moment for caution.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour commander is quite right: the tone you hear is indeed a proximity trigger. If you come too close, he will be vaporized by the explosive gel packed into the metal box.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Stop lecturing and tell us what you want,“ snarled Root.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Now, now, Commander, patience. Your worries will be over soon enough. In fact they are already over, so why don’t you just wait quietly while your final seconds tick away.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly circled the commander, keeping the beep constant, until her back was to the chute. “There’s a way out of this, Commander,” she said. “I just need to think. I need a minute to sort things out.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Let me help you to sort things out,“ said Koboi mockingly, her childlike features ugly with malice. ”Your LEP comrades are currently trying to laser their way in here. Of course they will never make it in time. But you can bet that my old school chum, Foaly, is glued to his video screen. So what does he see? He sees his good friend Holly Short apparently holding a gun on her commander. now why would she want to do that?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Foaly will figure it out,“ said Root. ”He beat you before.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOpal remote-tightened the octo-bonds, forcing the commander to his knees. “Maybe he would figure it out at that. If he had time. But unfortunately for you, time is almost up.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOn Root’s chest, a digital readout flickered to life. There were two numbers on the readout. A six and a zero. Sixty seconds.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘One minute to live, Commander. How does that feel?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe numbers began ticking down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe ticking and the beeping and Opal’s snide sniggers drilled into Holly’s brain. “Shut it down, Koboi. Shut it down, or I swear I’ll…”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOpal’s laughter was unrestrained. It echoed through the access tunnel like the attack screech of a harpy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You will what? Exactly. Die beside your commander?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMore cracks. More ribs broken. The blue sparks of magic circled Root’s torso like stars caught in a whirlwind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Go now,“ he grunted. ”Holly. I am ordering you to leave.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘With respect, Commander. No. This isn’t over yet.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Forty-eight,“ said Opal in a happy singsong voice. ”Forty-seven.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Holly! Go!“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’d listen if I were you,“ said Koboi. ”There are other lives at stake. Root is already dead; why not save someone who can be saved?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly moaned. Another element in an already overloaded equation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Who can I save? Who’s in danger?“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, no one important. Just a couple of Mud Men.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, thought Holly: Artemis and Butler. Two others who had put a stop to Koboi’s plan.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What have you done, Opal?“ said Holly, shouting above the proximity trigger and core wind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eKoboi’s lip drooped, mimicking a guilty child. “I’m afraid I may have put your human friends in danger. At this very moment they are stealing a package from the International Bank in Munich. A little package I prepared for them. If Master Fowl is as clever as he is supposed to be, he won’t open the package until he reaches the Kronski Hotel and can check for booby traps.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen a biobomb will be activated, and bye-bye obnoxious humans. You can stay here and explain all this; I’m sure it won’t take more than a few hours to sort out with Internal Affairs. Or you can try to rescue your friends.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly’s head reeled. The commander, Artemis, Butler. All about to die. How could she save them?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way to win.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I will hunt you down, Koboi. For you, there won’t be a safe inch on the planet.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Such venom. What if I gave you a way out? One chance to win.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot was on his knees now, blood leaking from the corner of his mouth. The blue sparks were gone; he was out of magic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s a trap,“ he gasped, every syllable making him wince. ”Don’t be fooled again.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Thirty,“ said Koboi. ”Twenty-nine.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly felt her forehead throb against the helmet pads. “Okay. Okay, Koboi. Tell me quickly. How do I save the commander?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOpal took a deep theatrical breath. “On the device. There’s a sweet spot. One inch diameter. The red dot below the screen. If you hit that spot from outside the trigger area, then you overload the circuit. If you miss, even by a hair, you set off the explosive gel.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a sporting chance; more than you gave me, Holly Short.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly gritted her teeth. “You’re lying. Why would you give me a chance?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t take the shot,“ said Root, strangely calm. ”Just get out of range. Go and save Artemis. That’s the last order I’ll ever give you, Captain. Don’t you dare ignore it.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly felt as though her senses were being filtered through three feet of water. Everything was blurred and slowed down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t have any choice, Julius.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRoot frowned. “Don’t call me Julius! You always do that just before you disobey me. Save Artemis, Holly. Save him.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly closed one eye and aimed her pistol.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe laser sights were no good for this kind of accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe would have to do it manually.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ll save Artemis next,“ she said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly took a deep breath, held it, and squeezed the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly hit the red spot. She was certain of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe charge sank into the device, spreading across the metal face like a tiny bushfire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I hit it,“ she shouted at Opal’s image.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I hit the spot.“\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eKoboi shrugged. “I don’t know. I thought you were a fraction low. Hard luck. I mean that sincerely.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘No!“ screamed Holly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe countdown on Root’s chest ticked faster than before, flickering through the numbers. There were mere moments left now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe commander struggled to his feet, raising the visor on his helmet. His eyes were steady and fearless. He smiled gently at Holly. A smile that laid no blame. For once there wasn’t even a touch of feverish temper in his cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Be well,“ he said, and then an orange flame blossomed in the center of his chest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe explosion sucked the air from the tunnel, feeding on the oxygen. Multicolored flames roiled like the plumage of battling birds. Holly was shunted backward by a wall of shock waves, the force impacting every surface facing the commander. Microfilaments blew in her suit as they were overloaded with heat and force. The camera cylinder on her helmet popped right out of its groove, spinning into E37.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly herself was borne bodily into the chute, spinning like a twig in a cyclone. Sonix sponges in her earpieces sealed automatically as the sound of the explosion caught up with the blast. The commander had disappeared inside a ball of flame. He was gone, there was no doubt about it. Even magic could not help him now. Some things are beyond fixing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe contents of the access tunnel, including Root and Scalene, disintegrated into a cloud of shrapnel and dust, particles ricocheting off the tunnel walls. The cloud surged down the path of least resistance, which was of course directly after Holly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe barely had time to activate her wings and climb a few meters, before flying shrapnel drilled a hole in the chute wall below her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly hovered in the vast tunnel, the sound of her own breathing filling the helmet. The commander was dead. It was unbelievable. Just like that, at the whim of a vengeful pixie. Had there been a sweet spot on the device? Or had she actually missed the target? She would probably never know. But to the LEP observers, it would seem as though she had shot her own commander.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly glanced downward. Below her, fragments from the explosion were spiraling toward the earth’s core.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs, they neared the revolving magma sphere, the heat ignited each one, utterly cremating all that was left of Julius Root, For the briefest moment the particles twinkled gold and bronze, like a million stars falling to earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly hung there for several minutes, trying to absorb what had happened. She couldn’t. It was too awful. Instead she froze the pain and guilt, preserving it for later. Right now, she had an order to follow. And she would follow it, even if it was the last thing she ever did, because it had been the last order Julius Root ever gave.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHolly increased the power to her wings, rising through the massive charred chute. There were Mud Men to be saved.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/61/226.html","bookId":384,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 8:14:05 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 8:14:05 AM"}
