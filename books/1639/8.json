Osman was tal , not Spartan tal , but conspicuous just the same. Parangosky settled down at the far corner of the tables and gestured to them to sit. The old girl handed six datapads to Osman, who passed them around. Mal didn’t get a chance to look to Vaz for a reaction before his screen flashed into life and told him the captain was Serin Osman, ONI, and Phil ips was a Sangheili expert from Wheatley University.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebrief, then. About what? The bloody Spirit? What was so special about that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’l get to the point,” Parangosky said. “You’re under no obligation to undertake this mission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sealed the deal for Mal. ODSTs didn’t turn down tasking, any tasking. They’d automatical y volunteered for everything and anything, now and forever, world-without-end-amen, on the day they’d turned up for the selection board. Being RTU’d—Returned to Unit, sent back to their original regiment or ship or squadron in whatever country because they didn’t make the grade as a Hel jumper—was the worst thing that could happen to them. Death was a minor embarrassment by comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParangosky fixed Vaz with a watery but intimidating gaze. “Corporal, when’s the best time to kick a man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When he’s down, ma’am,” Vaz said quietly. “And preferably in the nuts. Hard as you can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal could have sworn that Parangosky smiled. It was more like a twitch of the lips, but he was pretty sure Vaz had hit the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A man after my own heart,” she said. “Very wel , I’m asking you al to go and kick the Sangheili in their col ective nuts in ways that might seem foreign to you. I want you to sow discontent and strife. They’re already infighting and I want to keep that going until we’re ready to finish the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone not keen on that? There’s no shame in refusing. I’ve seen your service records and you’ve al more than earned the right to say no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, Mal was pretty sure she knew every last thing about them, right down to how many sugars they took in their coffee. So she had to know the answer she’d get. It was stil a decent gesture, though. Nobody said a word. Osman seemed to be keeping an eye on the Spartan, and the Spartan kept giving her a furtive glance as if something was bothering her. They were both roughly the same age, so maybe there was some weird alpha female power struggle going on. Mal made mental note to stay wel clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m up for it, ma’am,” Devereaux said. “But how foreign is this going to get? Because we’re fine with assassination and sabotage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I’m talking about arming Sangheili dissidents. Misinformation. Al deniable.” Parangosky squinted at her datapad for a moment. “You’re going to have to think on your feet. Intel’s very patchy now and we’re not sure exactly where the fault lines are forming between the various factions, so you’l be gathering information as you go. I wish I could prepare you more thoroughly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal knew that ONI were a law unto themselves, and the one question he’d learned never to ask was why. It was always how and when. He certainly didn’t plan to ask if every member of the UNSC security committee was on board with Parangosky’s op.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevereaux didn’t seem to worry about al that. “We’l manage, ma’am. So no peace treaty, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Admiral Hood believes it’s possible to reach a formal deal with the Arbiter,” Parangosky said. “But he’s going to be busy dealing with the colonies now that we need to bring our wayward sheep back into the fold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal thought she’d avoided the question until the answer sank in. Oh God. She’s even sidelining Hood now. Never mind. That’s so far above my pay grade that I’d need a telescope to see it. Had he been given a lawful order? Wel , he hadn’t been given an unlawful one yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil ips was stil sitting there with the expression of a rabbit about to be hit by a truck that it just hadn’t seen coming. He hadn’t said a word yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz glanced at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what’s the professor’s status, ma’am?” Vaz asked. “We’re looking after him, yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, he’l be armed and he’l take his chances, just like you.” Parangosky hovered on the edge of looking concerned. “You’l have to forget the chain of command and make your own decisions out there. Our comms are a shambles, we’ve got relays down, our people out there are struggling to get word to us, and the colonies—wel , where they’ve gone silent, we don’t know whether they’re a smoking heap of charcoal or if they’ve just decided to sever links with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal wanted to ask why she’d picked them. He could understand the professor, the spook, and the Spartan, but there were stil plenty of ODSTs around, and any of them could have done the job. It obviously wasn’t a lottery or else Vaz wouldn’t have been here too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d find out sooner or later. It didn’t make any difference anyway. He was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re shipping out in the morning,” Osman said. “If you want to do any drinking tonight, do it within the complex. Your personal effects are being brought over from the barracks. We’l transfer to the ship at Midpoint—it’s Port Stanley. She’s got the latest Forerunner enhancements to her drives, so we can cover a lot of space fast. A corvette’s a big vessel for six, but we’l have an AI to handle her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParangosky laid her pad down like a winning hand of cards. “Come on, BB. Don’t be coy. Introduce yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal had never worked with smart AIs. A ship would drop him and his mates, and if they were lucky it would show up again and extract them when the job was done, but he didn’t get to play with any of the technology that ONI took for granted. He waited for the hologram to appear. When a blue cube materialized in the center of the tables, it was a bit of an anticlimax. He’d expected something a little more exotic. He’d heard al the hairy stories about the weird forms that AI avatars took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’d be me,” the blue cube said in a news anchor’s tenor voice. “The taxi driver. Black-Box. Airport runs my specialty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal leaned back in his seat and caught Vaz’s eye for a second. He looked careful y blank, like he always did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t do psyop. We’ve never worked with Spartans before. And we’re definitely not trained for this spook stuff. But how hard can it be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were ODSTs. They could do anything. It was al about the right attitude—a commando’s state of mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, BB,” Mal said. “Take us to Hinge-head World, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT’S BEEN ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT ADMIRAL LORD HOOD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS, IS TO HEAD A DIPLOMATIC MISSION TO THE SURVIVING EARTH COLONIES TO DISCUSS RECONSTRUCTION. UEG SOURCES SAY THAT SOME COLONIES HAVE REBUFFED THE OFFER AND WON’T NEGOTIATE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THEY FEEL ABANDONED THEM. IN OTHER NEWS, UEG PRESIDENT CHARET HAS UNVEILED HER NEW CABINET. AMONG THE CASUALTIES IS COLONIES MINISTER DAVID AGNOLI, WHO’S BEEN REPLACED BY AKEYO ODUYA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(WAYPOINT NINE NEWS UPDATE, JANUARY 2553)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFORERUNNER DYSON SPHERE, ONYX: FOUR HOURS INTO RECONNAISSANCE PATROL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez did the calculations in his head again as he waded through long grass that left burrs on his pants. Three thousand times three, divided by five hundred, equaled eighteen. They could eke out their emergency rations for eighteen days if they scraped by on a rock-bottom five hundred calories a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEighteen days eating that crap. It’s going to seem like a hell of a lot longer. How bad can lizard be? I ate a lot worse in escape-and-evasion training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as he knew, Halsey didn’t carry an escape belt, which meant she didn’t have a survival pack that included three bars of the most foul- tasting but nutritional y dense substance known to man. Anyone who’d had to survive on special forces emergency bars found regular MREs to be a damn five-star restaurant experience by comparison. It was just as wel the escape belt included an animal snare plus a hook and line. Mendez was up for cooking anything that moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he and the Spartans would have to pool their supplies to feed Halsey if push came to shove. He wasn’t sure if he resented that or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, stay hydrated, and hope the Forerunners thought of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two structures looked more like old-fashioned cooling towers the closer he got to them. Their wal s seemed to be either tiled or decorated with ashlars. It was hard to tel with Forerunner structures because they had a habit of shifting and changing moment to moment, but he could definitely see a grid of indented lines at regular intervals. The grass gave way to scattered trees. Mendez kept a wary eye above him, expecting more flying cylinders to buzz them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom caught up with him as if he was going to ask a question but he didn’t say anything. They walked side by side in silence for a while, picking their way through the trees, dividing their attention between scanning for possible threats in the branches and checking the ground beneath for anything edible. Mendez couldn’t see Tom’s expression. He knew him wel enough by now to pick up on his mood, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay, son?” Mendez asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Chief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know you did al you could.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. It’s just the first time someone’s sacrificed their life for me. Deliberately, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez knew that was hard and that it would only get harder until Tom made peace with himself about it. But it was way too soon. Kurt, Wil iam, Dante, and Hol y weren’t cold in their graves yet, and everyone—himself included—was stil at that stage where the deaths hadn’t become an integral part of the new reality. Mendez found himself thinking and acting as if nothing much had happened, and then suddenly remembering who he’d lost. He hadn’t forgotten about it; it was just that grief was set aside out of habit because that was the only way to cope, and every so often it would come crashing back on him, triggered by a dumb thought like needing to tel Kurt something and then remembering that he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t have a war to fight any longer. Terrible as it was, combat could be a blessing. It didn’t give you time to think until much later. Now they al had plenty of quiet time on their hands to brood about the people they’d lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t know he’s dead,” Tom said. “Only that he didn’t make it into the sphere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez just looked at him. He didn’t believe in humoring anyone. It didn’t spare them the reality that would eventual y hit them al the harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even a Spartan can’t hold off a Covenant army,” he said. And even Spartans lose one buddy too many and start to crack. He thought of Lucy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No matter how much gung-ho BS we spin the public.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom did a quick reluctant nod that seemed almost apologetic, as if he was embarrassed to be caught clutching at straws. Mendez turned slowly and took a few paces backward to check behind, but he was more interested in keeping an eye on Halsey. You wouldn’t stop at anything, would you, Doc? Kel y ambled along beside her, looking more like close protection. She didn’t seem remotely troubled by the fact that Halsey had abducted her for this jaunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for the first time, either. Goddamn. The things we treat as normal. The things we accept. I used to be a regular guy, and now look at the crap I get up to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalsey glanced at him for a second, al suspicion. Yeah, so Ackerson took her research and Mendez had cooperated with him. So what? She’d already given up on the Spartan program because she didn’t think her next tranche of candidates was good enough. What did she think this was, some private hobby, that al those lives lost and al that pain could just be flushed because it didn’t meet her personal standards? If she’d cal ed it a day because her conscience had kicked in, that would have been different. But it hadn’t. And Ackerson, unlovable dick or not, at least made sure that lives spent on the program hadn’t been wasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonder where he is now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen to yourself, Mendez. Denial. You’re still in goddamn denial. The UNSC used child soldiers. Under-tens. Tin-pot dictators who did that ended up charged with war crimes. What does that make you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez forced himself to concentrate on the crisis right in front of him. Being cooped up with Halsey and the fruits of their guilty labor was only going to get harder. He brought the patrol to a halt fifty meters from the towers to assess the entrance and the safest way to approach, looking up at the concave wal s for anything that resembled doors. He couldn’t see any, but that didn’t necessarily mean there was no entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the radio attached to his col ar. “Lieutenant? We’ve reached the foot of the tower. We don’t see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We took a detour, Chief.” Fred sounded upbeat. “Got something to show you. We’re heading for your position.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trees and grass ended fifteen meters from the tower. A paved perimeter surrounded the whole structure, like a service road made of completely regular flagstones. Mendez walked a few meters along the wal , peering at the pale gold stone blocks in the hope of seeing a hairline split that would indicate an opening. He didn’t plan to touch it until the other squad caught up with him, just in case he triggered an unknown mechanism that swal owed them up in another protective sphere. Halsey wandered along behind him. She didn’t touch the wal either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If this place is a survival bunker, then there has to be more here than supplies and accommodation for sitting this out,” Mendez said. “There’l be whatever the Forerunners needed to start rebuilding after it was safe to come out. Weapons. Comms. And transport. How did they get ships in here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKel y took off her helmet to scratch her scalp. “Let’s hope they were as smart about expiration dates as they were with dimensional physics.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But how would they know when it was safe outside?” Olivia asked. “Okay, they’d have a good idea in theory of how long the Halos would take to wipe out the Flood, but if al that was left of their entire civilization was holed up here, they’d want to make absolutely sure.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-glasslands-halo-8/page-8.html","bookId":1639,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:30 PM"}
