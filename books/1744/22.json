He could see her face now and then, dimly through the faceplate, when the Earthlight caught it at the proper angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Don\u0027t you see the stars on Earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not like this. Even when there are no clouds, the air on Earth absorbs some of the light. Temperature differences in the atmosphere make them twinkle, and city lights, even distant city lights, wash them out\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds disgusting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like it out here, Selene? On the surface?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not crazy about it really, but I don\u0027t mind it too much, now and then. It\u0027s part of my job to bring tourists out here, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now you have to do it for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t I convince you it\u0027s not the same thing at all, Ben? We\u0027ve got a set route for the tourists. It\u0027s very tame, very uninteresting. You don\u0027t think we\u0027d take them out here to the slide, do you? This is for Lunarites - and Immies. Mostly Immies, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t be very popular. There\u0027s no one here but ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well. There are particular days for this sort of thing. You should see this place on race days. You wouldn\u0027t like it then, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I like it now. Is gliding a sport for Immies, particularly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rather. Lunarites don\u0027t like the surface generally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about Dr. Neville?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, how he feels about the surface?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frankly, I don\u0027t think he\u0027s ever been up here. He\u0027s a real city boy. Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when I asked permission to go along on the routine servicing of the Solar batteries, he was perfectly willing to have me go, but he wouldn\u0027t go himself. I rather asked him to, I think, so I could have someone answer my questions, if there were any, and his refusal was rather strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope there was someone else to answer your questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. He was an Immie, too, come to think of it. Maybe that explains Dr. Neville\u0027s attitude toward the Electron Pump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well - \" Denison leaned back and kicked his legs up alternately, watching them rise and fall slowly with a certain lazy pleasure. \"Hey, that\u0027s not bad. Look, Selene -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What I mean is that Neville is so intent on developing a Pump Station on the Moon when the Solar batteries are so adequate for the job. We couldn\u0027t use Solar batteries on the Earth, where the Sun is never as unfailing, as prolonged, as bright, as radiant in all wave lengths. There\u0027s not a single planetary body in the Solar system, no body of any size, that is more suitable for the use of the batteries than the Moon is. Even Mercury is too hot. - But the use does tie you to the surface, and if you don\u0027t like the surface - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene rose to her feet suddenly, and said, \"All right, Ben, you\u0027ve rested enough. Up! Up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled to his feet and said, \"A Pump Station, however, would mean that no Lunarite would ever have to come out on the surface, if he didn\u0027t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uphill we go, Ben. Well go to that ridge up ahead. See it, where the Earthlight cuts off in a horizontal line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made their way up the final stretch silently. Denison was aware of the smoother area to their side; a wide swathe of slope from which most of the dust had been brushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s too smooth for a beginner to work up,\" Selene said, answering his thoughts. \"Don\u0027t get too ambitious or you\u0027ll want me to teach you the kangaroo-hop next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a kangaroo-hop as she spoke, turned about face almost before landing, and said, \"Right here. Sit down and I\u0027ll adjust - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison did, facing downhill. He looked down the slope uncertainly. \"Can you really glide on it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. The gravity is weaker on the Moon than on the Earth, so you press against the ground much less strongly, and that means there is much less friction. Everything is more slippery on the Moon than on the Earth. That\u0027s why the floors in our corridors and apartments seemed unfinished to you. Would you like to hear me give my little lecture on the subject? The one I give the tourists?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Selene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, we\u0027re going to use gliders, of course.\" She had a small cartridge in her hand. Clamps and a pair of thin tubes were attached to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\" asked Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a small liquid-gas reservoir. It will emit a jet of vapor just under your boots. The thin gas layer between boots and ground will reduce friction to virtually zero. You\u0027ll move as though you were in clear space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said uneasily. \"I disapprove. Surely, it\u0027s wasteful to use gas in this fashion on the Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, now. What gas do you think we use in these gliders? Carbon dioxide? Oxygen? This is waste gas to begin with. It\u0027s argon. It comes out of the Moon\u0027s soil in ton-lots, formed by the billions of years of breakdown of potassium-40 . . . That\u0027s part of my lecture, too, Ben . . . The argon has only a few specialized uses on the Moon. We could use it for gliding for a million years without exhausting the supply. . . . All right. Your gliders are on, Now wait till I put mine on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do they work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s quite automatic. You just start sliding and that will trip the contact and start the vapor. You\u0027ve only got a few minutes supply; but that\u0027s all you\u0027ll need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up and helped him to his feet. \"Face downhill. . . . Come on, Ben, this is a gentle slope. Look at it. It looks perfectly level.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it doesn\u0027t,\" said Denison, sulkily. \"It looks like a cliff to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense. Now listen to me and remember what I told you. Keep your feet about six inches apart and one just a few inches ahead of the other. It doesn\u0027t matter which one is ahead. Keep your knees bent. Don\u0027t lean into the wind because there isn\u0027t any. Don\u0027t try to look up or back, but you can look from side to side if you have to. Most of all, when you finally hit level, don\u0027t try to stop too soon; you\u0027ll be going faster than you think. Just let the glider expire and then friction will bring you to a slow halt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll never remember all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you will. And I\u0027ll be right at your side to help. And if you do fall and I don\u0027t catch you, don\u0027t try to do anything. Just relax and let yourself tumble or slide. There are no boulders anywhere that you can collide with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison swallowed and looked ahead. The southward slide was gleaming in Earthlight. Minute unevenness caught more than their share of light, leaving tiny uphill patches in darkness so that there was a vague mottling of the surface. The bulging half-circle of Earth rode the black sky almost directly ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\" said Selene. Her gauntleted hand was between his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready,\" said Denison faintly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then off you go,\" she said. She pushed and Denison felt himself begin to move. He moved quite slowly at first. He turned toward her, wobbling, and she said, \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m right at your side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel the ground beneath his feet - and then he couldn\u0027t. The glider had been activated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment he felt as though he were standing still. There was no push of air against his body, no feel of anything sliding past his feet. But when he turned toward Selene again, he noticed that the lights and shadows to one side were moving backward at a slowly increasing speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your eyes on the Earth,\" Selene\u0027s voice said in his ear, \"till you build up speed. The faster you go, the more stable you\u0027ll be. Keep your knees bent . . . You\u0027re doing very well, Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For an Immie,\" gasped Denison. \"How does it feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like flying,\" he said. The pattern of light and dark on either side was moving backward in a blur. He looked briefly to one side, then the other, trying to convert the sensation of a backward flight of the surroundings into one of a forward flight of his own. Then, as soon as he succeeded, he found he had to look forward hastily at the Earth to regain his sense of balance. \"I suppose that\u0027s not a good comparison to use to you. You have no experience of flying on the Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I know, though. Flying must be like gliding - I know what that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was keeping up with him easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison was going fast enough now so that he got the sensation of motion even when he looked ahead. The Moonscape ahead was opening before him and flowing past on either side. He said, \"How fast do you get to go in a glide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A good Moon-race,\" said Selene, \"has been clocked at speeds in excess of a hundred miles an hour - on steeper slopes than this one, of course. You\u0027ll probably reach a top of thirty-five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It feels a lot faster than that somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it isn\u0027t. We\u0027re leveling off now, Ben, and you haven\u0027t fallen. Now just hang on; the glider will die off and you\u0027ll feel friction. Don\u0027t do anything to help it. Just keep going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene had barely completed her remarks when Denison felt the beginning of pressure under his boots. There was at once an overwhelming sensation of speed and he clenched his fists hard to keep from throwing his arms up in an almost reflex gesture against the collision that wasn\u0027t going to happen. He knew that if he threw up his arms, he would go over backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe narrowed his eyes, held his breath till he thought his lungs would explode, and then Selene said, \"Perfect, Ben, perfect. I\u0027ve never known an Immie to go through his first slide without a fall, so if you do fall, there\u0027ll be nothing wrong. No disgrace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t intend to fall,\" whispered Denison. He caught a large, ragged breath, and opened his eyes wide. The Earth was as serene as ever, as uncaring. He was moving more slowly now - more slowly - more slowly -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I standing still now, Selene?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re standing still. Now don\u0027t move. You\u0027ve got to rest before we make the trip back to town. . . . Damn it, I left it somewhere around here when we came up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison watched her with disbelief. She had climbed up with him, had glided down with him. Yet he was half-dead with weariness and tension, and she was in the air with long kangaroo-leaps. She seemed a hundred yards away when she said, \"Here it is!\" and her voice was as loud in his ears as when she was next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was back in a moment, with a folded, paunchy sheet of plastic under her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember,\" she said, cheerily, \"when you asked what it was on our way up and I said we\u0027d be using it before we came down?\" She unfolded it and spread it on the dusty surface of the Moon,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Lunar Lounge is its full name,\" she said, \"but we just call it a lounge. We take the adjective for granted here on this world.\" She inserted a cartridge and tripped a lever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt began to fill. Somehow Denison had expected a hissing noise, but of course there was no air to carry sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before you question our conservation policies again,\" said Selene, \"this is argon also.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt blossomed into a mattress on six, stubby legs, \"It will hold you,\" she said. \"It makes very little actual contact with the ground and the vacuum all around will conserve its heat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me it\u0027s hot,\" said Denison, amazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The argon is heated as it pours in, but only relatively. It ends up at 270 degrees absolute, almost warm enough to melt ice, and quite warm enough to keep your insulated suit from losing heat faster than you can manufacture it. Go ahead. Lie down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison did so, with a sensation of enormous luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great!\" he said with a long sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mamma Selene thinks of everything,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came from behind him now, gliding around him, her feet placed heel to heel as though she were on skates, and then let them fly out from under her, as she came down gracefully on hip and elbow on the ground just beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison whistled. \"How did you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of practice! And don\u0027t you try it. You\u0027ll break your elbow. I warn you though. If I get too cold, I\u0027m going to have to crowd you on the lounge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safe enough,\" he said, \"with both of us in suits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, there speaks my brave lecher . . . How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, I guess. What an experience!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What an experience? You set a record for non-falls. Do you mind if I tell the folks back in town about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Always like to be appreciated . . . You\u0027re not going to expect me to do this again, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now? Of course not I wouldn\u0027t myself. Well just rest awhile, make sure your heart action is back to normal, and then we\u0027ll go back. If you\u0027ll reach your legs in my direction, I\u0027ll take your gliders off. Next time, I\u0027ll show you how to handle the gliders yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure that there will be a next time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course there\u0027ll be. Didn\u0027t you enjoy it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little. In between terror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have less terror next time, and still less the time after, and eventually you\u0027ll just experience the enjoyment and I\u0027ll make a racer out of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you won\u0027t. I\u0027m too old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on the Moon. You just look old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison could feel the ultimate quiet of the Moon soaking into him as he lay there. He was facing the Earth this time. Its steady presence in the sky had, more than anything else, given him the sensation of stability during his recent glide and he felt grateful to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Do you often come out here, Selene? I mean, by yourself, or just one or two others? You know, when it isn\u0027t fiesta time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Practically never. Unless there are people around, this is too much for me. That I\u0027m doing it now, actually, surprises me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" said Denison, noncommittally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not surprised?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I be? My feeling is that each person does what he does either because he wants to or he must and in either case that\u0027s his business, not mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Ben. I mean it; it\u0027s good to hear. One of the nice things about you, Ben, is that for an Immie, you\u0027re willing to let us be ourselves. We\u0027re underground people, we Lunarites, cave people, corridor people. And what\u0027s wrong with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to hear the Earthies talk. And I\u0027m a tourist guide and have to listen to them. There isn\u0027t anything they say that I haven\u0027t heard a million times, but what I hear most of all\" - and she dropped into the clipped accents of the typical Earthie speaking Planetary Standard \" - \u0027But, dear, however can all you people live in caves all the time? Doesn\u0027t it give you a terrible closed-in feeling? Don\u0027t you ever want to see blue sky and trees and ocean and feel wind and smell flowers - \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I could go on and on, Ben. Then they say, \u0027But I suppose you don\u0027t know what blue sky and sea and trees are like so you don\u0027t miss them.\u0027 . . . As if we don\u0027t receive Earth-television and as if we don\u0027t have full access to Earth-literature, both optical and auditory - and olfactory sometimes, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison was amused. He said, \"What\u0027s the official answer to remarks like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing much. We just say, \u0027We\u0027re quite used to it, madam.\u0027 Or \u0027sir\u0027 if it\u0027s a man. Usually it\u0027s a woman. The men are too interested in studying our blouses and wondering when we take them off, I suppose. You know what I\u0027d like to tell the idiots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please tell me. As long as you have to keep the blouse on, it being inside the suit, at least get that off your chest\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny, funny word play! . . . I\u0027d like to tell them, \u0027Look, madam, why the hell should we be interested in your damned world? We don\u0027t want to be hanging on the outside of any planet and waiting to fall off or get blown off. We don\u0027t want raw air puffing at us and dirty water falling on us. We don\u0027t want your damned germs and your smelly grass and your dull blue sky and your dull white clouds. We can see Earth in our own sky when we want to, and we don\u0027t often want to. The Moon is our home and it\u0027s what we make it; exactly what we make it. We own it and we build our own ecology, and we don\u0027t need you here being sorry for us going our own way. Go back to your own world and let your gravity pull your breasts down to your knees.\u0027 That\u0027s what I\u0027d say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said, \"All right. Whenever you get too close to saying that to some Earthie, you come say it to me and you\u0027ll feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what? Every once in a while, some Immie suggests that we build an Earth-park on the Moon; some little spot with Earth-plants brought in as seeds or seedlings; maybe some animals. A touch of home - that\u0027s the usual expression.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it you\u0027re against that,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, I\u0027m against it. A touch of whose home? The Moon is our home. An Immie who wants a touch of home had better get back to his home. Immies can be worse than Earthies sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Til keep that in mind,\" said Denison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not you - so far,\" said Selene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence for a moment and Denison wondered if Selene were going to suggest a return to the caverns. On the one hand, it wouldn\u0027t be long before he would feel a fairly strenuous craving to visit a rest-room. On the other, he had never felt so relaxed. He wondered how long the oxygen in his pack would hold out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Selene said, \"Ben, do you mind if I ask you a question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. If it\u0027s my private life that interests you, I am without secrets. I\u0027m five-foot-nine, weigh twenty-eight pounds on the Moon, had one wife long ago, now divorced, one child, a daughter, grown-up and married, attended University of - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Ben. I\u0027m serious. Can I ask about your work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you can, Selene. I don\u0027t know how much I can explain to you, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You know that Barron and L - M\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know,\" said Denison, brusquely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We talk together. He tells me things sometimes. He said you think the Electron Pump might make the Universe explode.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our section of the Universe. It might convert a part of our Galactic arm into a quasar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? Do you really think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said, \"When I came to the Moon, I wasn\u0027t sure. Now I am. I am personally convinced that this will happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you think it will happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I can\u0027t say exactly. Maybe a few years from now. Maybe a few decades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a short silence between them. Then Selene said, in a subdued voice, \"Barron doesn\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know he doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m not trying to convert him. You don\u0027t beat refusal to believe in a frontal attack. That\u0027s Lamont\u0027s mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Lamont?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Selene. I\u0027m talking to myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Ben. Please tell me. I\u0027m interested. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison turned to one side, facing her. \"All right,\" he said. \"I have no objection to telling you. Lamont, a physicist back on Earth, tried in his way to alert the world to the dangers of the Pump. He failed. Earthmen want the Pump; they want the free energy; they want it enough to refuse to believe they can\u0027t have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why should they want it, if it means death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All they have to do is refuse to believe it means death. The easiest way to solve a problem is to deny it exists. Your friend, Dr. Neville, does the same thing. He dislikes the surface, so he forces himself to believe that Solar batteries are no good - even though to any impartial observer they would seem the perfect energy source for the Moon. He wants the Pump so he can stay underground, so he refuses to believe that there can be any danger from it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelene said, \"I don\u0027t think Barron would refuse to believe something for which valid evidence existed. Do you really have the evidence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I do. It\u0027s most amazing really, Selene. The whole thing depends on certain subtle factors of quark-quark interactions. Do you know what that means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to explain. I\u0027ve talked so much to Barron about all sorts of things that I might be able to follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I thought I would need the Lunar proton synchrotron for the purpose. It\u0027s twenty-five miles across, has superconducting magnets, and can dispose of energies of 20,000 Bev and more. It turns out, though, that you people have something you call a Pionizer, which fits into a moderately sized room and does all the work of the synchrotron. The Moon is to be congratulated on a most amazing advance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said Selene, complacently. \"I mean on behalf of the Moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, my Pionizer results can show the rate of increase of intensity of strong nuclear interaction; and the increase is what Lamont says it is and not what the orthodox theory would have it be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And have you shown it to Barron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t. And if I do, I expect Neville to reject it. He\u0027ll say the results are marginal. He\u0027ll say I\u0027ve made an error. He\u0027ll say that I haven\u0027t taken all factors into account. He\u0027ll say I\u0027ve used inadequate controls . . . What he\u0027ll really be saying is that he wants the Electron Pump and won\u0027t give it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean there\u0027s no way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course there is, but not the direct way. Not Lamont\u0027s way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lamont\u0027s solution is to force abandonment of the Pump, but you can\u0027t just move backward. You can\u0027t push the chicken back into the egg, wine back into the grape, the boy back into the womb. If you want the baby to let go of your watch, you don\u0027t just try to explain that he ought to do it - you offer him something he would rather have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s that?\",\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, that\u0027s where I\u0027m not so sure. I do have an idea, a simple idea - perhaps too simple to work - based on the quite obvious fact that the number two is ridiculous and can\u0027t exist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence that lasted for a minute or so and then Selene, her voice as absorbed as his, said, \"Let me guess your meaning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that I have any,\" said Denison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me guess, anyway. It could make sense to suppose that our own Universe is the only one that can exist or does exist, because it is the only one we live in and directly experience. Once, however, evidence arises that there is a second Universe as well, the one we call the para-Universe, then it becomes absolutely ridiculous to suppose that there are two and only two Universes. If a second Universe can exist, then an infinite number can. Between one and the infinite in cases such as these, there are no sensible numbers. Not only two, but any finite number, is ridiculous and can\u0027t exist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison said, \"That\u0027s exactly my reas - \" And silence fell again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenison heaved himself into a sitting position and looked down on the suit-encased girl. He said, \"I think we had better go back to town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I was just guessing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"No, you weren\u0027t. Whatever it was, it wasn\u0027t just guessing.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gods-themselves/page-22.html","bookId":1744,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:25 AM"}
