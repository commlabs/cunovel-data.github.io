I had showered, eaten, dressed, redressed, and was sitting on the front steps, my hoodie tied around my waist, writing Alexander love notes. I was ready to call the school day off when she finally drove up my driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got into her pickup, and she barely said hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you?\" I asked. \"Did you oversleep? Or get halfway to school and realize you didn\u0027t pick me up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky didn\u0027t answer but continued to drive toward school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a polite conversation with her responses being \"uh-huhs,\" \"sures,\" and head nods, I\u0027d had enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s up with the silent treatment?\" I finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" she said as she turned the truck onto the road that led to school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you feeling well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m feeling fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you mad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not mad,\" she said, and turned up the radio. I turned the radio off. \"Okay. Let me have it. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky pulled into an empty spot next to the senior parking lot and turned off the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just seems odd,\" she began softly. \"You left Hatsy\u0027s as soon as our order arrived. Then shortly afterward Jagger and Luna left too. I heard you hung out with Luna at the park. And it was like you were best buds last night outside the Mansion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not my best bud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you have way much more in common with her,\" she continued. \"The gothic clothes. The dark music. She probably loves vampires, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what this is about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was anything worse than the jealousy between sweethearts, it was the threat of a new best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve found someone more like you,\" she said as she got out of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want someone more like me,\" I said as we walked toward school. \"I want someone just like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all the years Becky and I\u0027d been friends, she never judged the clothes I wore or the music I listened to. Becky never asked me to be anything but myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to know the truth?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are right, I owe you that.\" Becky and I went into the side entrance and snuck underneath the staircase. \"All right, here goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky looked anxious, as if I were going to hit her with \"Yes, I\u0027ve found a new best friend. Good riddance.\" \"This is top secret stuff,\" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" I took a deep breath. \"Here goes. Luna and Jagger are vampires,\" I began in a whisper, \"and they are trying to turn Trevor into one. We left Hatsy\u0027s because Alexander and I were trying to remove their coffins from Henry\u0027s treehouse, forcing them back to Romania.\" I sighed, feeling a sense of relief at finally being able to share my darkest secrets with my best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky studied me. Then she burst out laughing. \"You expect me to believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it was better than saying Luna and Jagger are friends of Alexander\u0027s from Romania,\" she said, \"and you felt obligated to help out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I lied. \"Sweet, but anticlimactic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of us laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I just got a little jealous,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I made you feel that way. We\u0027ll always be best friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forever,\" she confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For eternity,\" I added with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shoving my notebooks in my locker, which was filled with pictures of Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, and HIM, and stickers of black roses, spiders, and coffins, when I noticed Trevor passing out red flyers to the soccer snobs and cheerleaders. He was also taking pictures of them with his camera phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t aware Trevor had returned to school. I stepped back into a doorway so Trevor wouldn\u0027t spot me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bell rang and the crowds began to disperse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red flyer fell out of the goalie\u0027s notebook as he stepped into a biology classroom. Curious, I grabbed it. In black letters the flyer read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraveyard Gala\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovenant Ceremony\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~Dare to dance among the dead~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDate: This Saturday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime: Sunset\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttire: Nightmarish costume\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe there or be dead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d spent a whole lifetime partying alone at Dullsville\u0027s cemetery. Now all of Dullsville High was going to be at my hideout. And I wasn\u0027t even invited?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sticking your nose where it doesn\u0027t belong, Monster Girl?\" I heard Trevor say from behind me. \"What\u0027s this?\" I asked, shoving the flyer in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jagger\u0027s hosting a party. It\u0027ll be the blowout of the year! I\u0027m coming as the Grim Reaper. You\u0027re lucky. If you were invited, you could just come as yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Trevor a snarled look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is going to have a covenant ceremony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luna and I will be king and queen of the covenant. Like a medieval prom, in ominous costumes. It\u0027s a sexy Romanian ceremony I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve never heard of. When I accept the honor, Luna\u0027s going to kiss me in front of the whole school. It\u0027s going to be a total freakfest. But since you\u0027re not on the guest list,\" he continued, \"you\u0027ll have to read about it in the school newspaper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed the flyer out of my hand as a cheerleader and a soccer snob stepped in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Trevor aimed his cell phone at them and a flash illuminated the hallway, momentarily blinding me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my eyes finally adjusted, Trevor and his cohorts disappeared into the crowd of students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood in the hallway, motionless, surrounded by the sounds of closing lockers and classroom doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had been Jagger\u0027s plan all along! The only way he could lure someone as conservative as Trevor to the sacred ground of a cemetery was the promise of a monster-size party and a never-ending lip-lock. The already pompous soccer snob would be sealing the deal with the gorgeous \"new hottie\" in front of the whole school. Trevor just didn\u0027t realize the deal would last an eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raven,\" I heard Becky call from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and Matt pushed through the crowd of students and caught up to me. \"Did you hear about the Graveyard Gala?\" she asked. \"Seems like you would be the one handing out invites, not Trevor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. And to top it off, I\u0027m not even invited. Not like I\u0027ve ever been on the A-list before, but this is at a cemetery. My dream party!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you would freak out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since you told Trevor to hit the road, the three of us are probably the only ones not invited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I spotted a red flyer poking out of Matt\u0027s algebra textbook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were on the guest list?\" I asked, horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole soccer team is invited,\" Matt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re not going, are you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to,\" Matt confessed. \"I don\u0027t want to be the only one in the locker room who wimped out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you?\" I said, turning to my best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt needs a date,\" she said apologetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt betrayed. Everyone at Dullsville High was going but me. Even Becky. More important, though, I was worried about Becky--I didn\u0027t want my best friend on sacred ground with vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Becky, you can\u0027t go,\" I said, sounding like her parent. \"Cemeteries make you nervous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there to protect her from any wayward ghosts,\" Matt said, putting his arm around my smiling friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I remembered the cemetery\u0027s caretaker and his dog. \"Old Jim will be there with his Great Dane, Luke,\" I warned Becky. \"There won\u0027t be trouble,\" Matt said. \"Trevor has assured everyone that on Saturday nights Old Jim has a barstool with his name on it at Lefty\u0027s Tavern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me you\u0027ll come,\" Becky pleaded. \"I\u0027d feel better if you were there, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought I wouldn\u0027t be there? And miss the chance to crash a party?\" I said, opening a classroom door. \"Only in my nightmares!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampireville-vampire-kisses-3/page-14.html","bookId":1868,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM"}
