I don’t know any of the strolling players who ever set eyes on one, except for Dustfinger, and he would always venture farther into the mountains than the rest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, Farid turned his back on Fenoglio and cut a few more twigs for the stretcher. The bear would happily have carried his master on his furry back, and Battista had some difficulty in persuading him to get out of the way when they lifted the Black Prince and put him on the stretcher. Only when his master spoke gently to him did the bear calm down, and he -lumbered along beside the Prince, looking dejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, come on, Fenoglio, the old man told himself, what are you waiting for? \"Go after them,\" he muttered as he followed Battista, his legs aching. \"No one’s going to carry you. And you’d better pray to whatever you believe in that the Milksop isn’t back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 64\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire was everywhere. It ate its way along the walls and licked down from the ceiling, crept out of the stone, and gave as much light as if the sun itself had risen in the darkened castle to scorch his bloated flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adderhead shouted at the Piper until he was hoarse. He struck him in his bony chest with his fists, longing to ram the man’s silver nose into his face, deep into the sound flesh that he envied him so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fire-Dancer was back from the dead for the second time, and the Bluejay had escaped from one of the cells that so his father-in-law had always claimed no prisoner ever left alive. \"Flown away!\" whispered the Adder’s soldiers. \"The bird has flown, and now he’s roaming the castle like a hungry wolf He’ll kill us all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adderhead had handed over the two guards of the cell to Thumbling for punishment, but the Bluejay had already killed six more, and the rumors grew louder with every dead man they found. His soldiers were running away, over the bridge or along the tunnel under the lake, anywhere to get away from the bewitched castle that now belonged to the Bluejay and the Fire-Dancer. Some of them had even jumped into the lake, never to climb out again. The rest were shaking in their shoes like a crowd of terrified children, while the painted walls burned and the light scorched the Adder’s brain and his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring me Four-Eyes!\" he shouted, and Thumbling dragged Orpheus into his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacopo crept in at the door, too, like a worm that had dug its way out of damp earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put out the fire!\" How his throat hurt! As if the sparks were in there, too. \"Put it out at once and bring me back the Bluejay, or I’ll cut your slimy tongue out! Is this why you persuaded me to throw him into that cell? So that he could fly away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pale blue eyes blurred behind the man’s glasses and the flattering tongue sounded as if it had been bathed in precious oil. But it was impossible to mistake the fear in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told the Piper he ought to post more than two guards outside the cell,\" said the sly little snake. So much cleverer than Silvernose, so much mock innocence, even the Adderhead couldn’t quite see through it. \"Only a few more hours and the Jay would have been pleading with you to let him bind the Book. Ask the guards. They heard him down there writhing like a worm on the hook, groaning and sighing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guards are dead. I handed them over to Thumbling and told him to make sure their screams could be heard all over the castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThumbling adjusted his black gloves. \"Four-Eyes is telling the truth. The guards kept bleating over and over that the Bluejay was in a very bad state down in that cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard him screaming and groaning, and they checked a couple of times to make sure he was still alive. I’d like to know how you did it,\" he said, his hawklike gaze resting on Orpheus for a moment. \"But anyway, they said the Jay kept whispering one name again and again. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adderhead put his hands over his burning eyes. \"What name? My daughter’s name, by any chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, the name of some other woman,\" replied Thumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Resa. His wife, Your Highness.\" Orpheus smiled. The Adderhead was not sure whether his smile expressed deference or self-satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Piper cast a vicious glance at Orpheus. \"My men will soon have caught his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his daughter, too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what use is that to me now?\" The Adderhead pressed his fists into his eyes, but he could still see the fire all the same. Pain was cutting him into slices, stinking slices, and now the man to whom he owed it all had fooled him for the second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed the Book! A new Book to heal his flesh. It was hanging off his bones like mud heavy, damp, stinking mud. Bluejay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take two of those who tried to run away up onto the bridge where everyone can see them,\" he said grimly. \"And you, fetch that dog of yours!\" he snapped at Orpheus. \"It must be hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men screamed like animals as the black shadow devoured them, and the Adderhead imagined that the cries echoing all the way to his room were the Bluejay’s. The man owed him many screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrpheus listened with a smile, and the Night-Mare returned to him like a faithful dog after its meal. Panting, it merged with Orpheus’s shadow, and its darkness made even the Adderhead shudder. Orpheus, however, adjusted his glasses with a satisfied expression. Their round lenses reflected the sparks burning on the walls. Four-Eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ll bring you back the Bluejay,\" he said, and even against his will the Adderhead felt the confidence in that velvety voice soothing him once again. \"He hasn’t escaped you, however it may seem. I have bound him in invisible chains. I forged them myself with my black art, and wherever he’s hiding, those chains will pull at him and bring back old pain. He knows I am the one sending him the pain, and he knows it will never end as long as I live. So he’ll try to kill me. Set Thumbling to guard my room, and the Bluejay will stumble into his arms. He’s not our problem anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Fire-Dancer is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hatred in his pale face surprised the Adderhead. Usually, such hatred comes only after love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, he’s back from the dead again!\" Loathing clung to every word that Orpheus spoke, slowing his smooth tongue. \"He’s acting as if he were lord of this castle, but take my advice and his fire will soon be extinguished!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what advice might that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrpheus smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send Thumbling to your daughter. Have her thrown into one of the cells, and spread word that she helped the Bluejay to escape. That’ll stop all the nonsense talk that makes your soldiers tremble with fear. As for her beautiful maidservant, lock her up in the cage where the Bluejay himself was held. And tell Thumbling he needn’t treat the girl too gently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire was still reflected in Orpheus’s glasses. They made his eyes almost invisible, and for a moment the Adderhead felt something he had never felt before fear of another man. It was an interesting sensation. Like a tingling on the back of the neck, a slight pressure in the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what I planned to do,\" he said and read in Orpheus’s face that he knew he was lying. I’ll have to kill him, thought the Adderhead. As soon as the new Book is bound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo man should be cleverer than his master. Particularly not when he controlled so dangerous a dog. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inkdeath-inkworld-3/page-121.html","bookId":2721,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:40 PM"}
