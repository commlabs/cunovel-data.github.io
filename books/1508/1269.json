Compared to the current Dragon One, the past Dragon One was at least two times more formidable.

As for Dragon One’s death, they couldn’t be sure that event was related to Lin Ming. At that time, Lin Ming had simply been far too weak and he didn’t possess the strength to kill Dragon One. It might have been that Dragon One died under the onslaught of the mystic realm demons.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHanging onto the cliffs of the Divine Seal Altar, Lin Ming looked up.
