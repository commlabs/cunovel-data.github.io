She was a rakish little craft, with a slippery keel,—quick to mind her helm and would carry sail to the last, but we\u0027d had a long, rough voyage and all hands was pretty nigh used up, but when we was about three days from the eastern port we was struck, almost unawares, by a terrible gale. I say unawares, but I must own we was in pretty good shape for squalls all the time, but on this[Pg 160] partic\u0027lar night I staid below more\u0027n I should if it hadn\u0027t been that one of the young chaps that shipped \u0027tween decks in the cargo at Liverpool, was a dyin\u0027 out of pure out and out sea sickness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, as I was sayin; the first officer was on the bridge and I was sittin\u0027 below with young Sinclair, when\"—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Excuse me, Captain,—Sinclair, did you say?\" exclaimed Sir Frederic, suddenly aroused to interest by the familiar name.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Aye, Aye, Sir, Maurice Sinclair, a lad of about fifteen years. He said he\u0027d got into some scrape at home and had just started out on his own hook, and\"—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maurice Sinclair,—Twelve years ago,—Did he die?\" Sir Frederic almost screamed in the old Captain\u0027s ear as a howling blast swept by, nearly driving their feet from under them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old man steadied him with a powerful hand but his ire was rising at these frequent interruptions to his favorite yarn, and he answered somewhat snappishly, \"Die? Yes, poor lad. He died in my arms that very night in the height of the gale, when the rigging was[Pg 161] swept away and the waves was washing the upper deck—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you prove that?\" demanded Sir Frederic, excitedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Prove what? that the rigging was swept away?\" thundered the old salt, now thoroughly angry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No! No!—that Maurice Sinclair died in your arms, twelve years ago.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well I ruther guess I can, seein\u0027 as I\u0027ve got the young chap\u0027s partin\u0027 letter to his mother in London and a picter of the old lady herself\"—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me see it, quick,\" said Sir Frederic, then in a measure controlling himself, he told him as briefly as possible of Maurice Sinclair\u0027s return to his mother\u0027s house a little over two years ago and of the crime for which he was wanted by the city authorities.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old Captain was inclined to be incredulous, but before Sir Frederic had finished his story, his ire had vanished, so also had all recollection of the yarn he had been about to spin, and leaving the timid young man to return as best he could, he laid his hand on Sir Frederic\u0027s arm and hurried[Pg 162] him down the companion way while he muttered spitefully between his teeth:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s a lie.
