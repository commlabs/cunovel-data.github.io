He could tell that some undetectable transformation had occurred to his seven Nascent Souls and seven totems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to whether the transformation was good or bad, it was impossible for him to tell. However, he had the faint sensation that it had caused him to take a first step down the true path of seven Nascent Souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, up to now, whenever he entered the Seventh Anima, the seven Nascent Souls in his body appeared to be unhampered by anything. Obviously, he could enter the Seventh Anima and explode out with the power of sixty-four great circle Nascen Souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, though, he had to force them to fuse together, which he could accomplish only because of his profound foundation. The instability of the combination of the seven totems caused Meng Hao to become aware of his oversight. However, a strange, unfamiliar aura had emerged from his seven Nascent Soul totems, causing them to bind together. Now the solitary totem was stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, Meng Hao was able to solve this problem that, in the future, would surely have led to great danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, though, he was in the middle of fighting Patriarch Huyan, and had little time to think about the matter. He put the matter to rest in his heart and then performed a double-handed incantation. Instantly, the solitary totem in front of him began to pulsate with a shocking aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe totem had no shape, and was constantly changing. Sometimes it was big, sometimes small. The primordial chaos inside of it looked almost like droplets of water, but also like a sea of flames. It was blurry, and impossible to see clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the aura spreading out from within the blurriness only continued to grow more powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Huyan was astonished, as were the streams of Divine Sense from the Patriarchs of the other Tribes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant the seven Nascent Soul totems combined, Patriarch Huyan’s eyes flickered with shock. He once again drew circles in front of him, and then gestured forward sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The seven emotions are needed by the heart. But within the soul, there are only three types of emotion. Family love, friendship and romantic love. I severed family love, extinguished friendship, and cut off romantic love. From then on I was… emotionless!” With that, the seven circles of emotion shattered, transforming into a blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blade was illusory, but was capable of extinguishing all types of life. Suddenly, the blade lifted high up into the air, and then descended down onto the solitary combination totem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chopping blow was imbued with an aura that could conquer mountains and rivers. This blade... was a blade of emotionlessness! All of the cultivation that Patriarch Huyan had practiced in his entire life transformed into a Spirit Severing blade that could shake Heaven and Earth. The entire world seemed to disappear in the face of the resplendently glowing blade that shot toward Meng Hao’s combination totem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blade hit the totem. In the instant that they struck each other, an indistinct, unclear aura erupted out from the solitary totem. The aura caused all the wind and clouds in the area to stop moving. Everything up above and down below grew still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange, otherworldly feeling spread out with incredible intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Patriarch Huyan sensed it, his heart filled with shock. This aura made him feel as if an incredible pressure was weighing down on him. His heart began to pound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling came so quickly that he had no time to do anything. Nor was he prepared for it; his mind filled with roaring, and blood oozed out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, cracks began to spread out across the blade that had chopped down onto the solitary totem. The cracks eventually joined together, and then a popping sound could be heard as the blade shattered into seven pieces that shot out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seven pieces represented the seven emotions, and their shattering caused a tremor to run through Patriarch Huyan’s body. He coughed up a huge mouthful of blood, and his face went pale. He staggered backward more than thirty meters, whereupon he looked up with a face full of shock and disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had long since ceased to look down upon Meng Hao. However, it was only at this moment that he suddenly realized that he himself… still didn’t fully understand Meng Hao. The sight of Meng Hao combining seven totems into one, and the resulting aura that erupted out, left Patriarch Huyan profoundly shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What totem is that?! What is that aura?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t just Patriarch Huyan who felt his heart trembling. Equally shaken were the other Spirit Severing Patriarchs who had gathered to watch the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of those patriarchs was the red-robed boy from the great Cloud Sky Sect. His eyes shone with a strange light, and his stream of Divine Sense quivered. “Where did this guy come from?” he thought. “Even I would be shaken by that aura.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spirit Severing Patriarchs from the great Wild Flame Tribe and the great Demon Butterfly Tribe made an undetectable mutual communication. As of now, they dispelled any notion of joining forces to make a sneak attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aura of Meng Hao’s solitary totem was shocking, and they were unable to see through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, Patriarch Huyan was in full retreat. Meng Hao’s solitary totem gradually faded away. It wasn’t destroyed by Patriarch Huyan; in fact, his blade hadn’t hurt it even in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason it was fading was because, even in the Seventh Anima, Meng Hao was incapable of sustaining it for very long. At the most, it could last for the space of a handful of breaths. That was, in fact, a bit different from what he had estimated before actually combining the totems during this battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only three breaths of time!” he sighed, his eyes shining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Internally, seven Nascent Souls combine, allowing me to enter the Seventh Anima. Externally, seven totems combine to form primordial chaos, my solitary totem!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alone, either the internal or the external change can be sustained for a long period of time. However… when both the internal and the external reach a peak simultaneously, it can only last for three breaths of time!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“During those three breaths, my battle prowess….” Meng Hao was panting as he thought back to what he had experienced moments ago. However, just as quickly, he looked back at Patriarch Huyan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Huyan was breathing deeply. As he shot backward, he tapped his right foot down into the air. A boom rattled out as he stopped in place, finally diffusing some of the recoil power in his body. He looked at Meng Hao and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Nascent Soul Cultivation base that can shake the Spirit Severing stage. If you had enough time, who knows, you might actually be able to achieve Immortal Ascension in South Heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I will use all the power I possess to smash you to death. Regardless of whether or not I succeed, the process will give birth to Dao Fruit. I can enjoy that flavor even in the yellow springs.” Patriarch Huyan laughed and slapped his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slap caused Patriarch Huyan’s aura to explode out, growing more and more intense. His hair was no longer white, but black. His skin were no longer old, but rather sleek and smooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was now not an old man any more, but middle-aged, his countenance dignified. Then, his aura continued to become even more shocking. Now, he looked like a young man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis robe was black, his eyebrows sharp and slanted, and his eyes shone as brightly as the stars. As of this moment, Patriarch Huyan seemed to have recovered his youth. His aura was intense, capable of shaking the Heavens, causing everything to dim and a huge wind to kick up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes narrowed as this indescribable, formless aura exploded out from Patriarch Huyan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handful streams of Spirit Severing Divine Sense were now all looking at Patriarch Huyan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The great circle of the First Severing!” said the Spirit Severing Patriarch from the Wild Flame Tribe. He was a tall, stalwart old man, within whose eyes could be seen an expression of intense concentration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patriarch Huyan never reached the great circle before….” said the red-robed boy from the great Cloud Sky Tribe. “Oh, I understand. He used the eradication of his Tribe to complete the great circle. How cold-blooded, this Huyan Yunming!” Shocked, the boy looked at Patriarch Huyan with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, in the other Tribes in the Black Lands who were observing the goings-on, most of the Cultivators weren’t able to tell the exact extent to which Patriarch Huyan’s aura had grown. However, it was shocking to them nonetheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the great Cloud Sky Tribe, Zhou Dekun’s eyes went wide and his heart began to beat nervously. After learning that Meng Hao had returned, he had felt happiness, but even more so, worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the great Demon Butterfly Tribe, Duo Lan sat quietly off to the side, gazing at Meng Hao. A stubborn gleam could be seen in her eyes. During the past more than one hundred years, she had learned a lot about Meng Hao. She was a Chosen, and although she hated to admit it, the distance between the two of them was vast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment in which Patriarch Huyan’s Cultivation base exploded up to the great circle of the First Severing, everyone who was watching, be they Spirit Severing Patriarchs or Cultivators from other Tribes in the Black Lands, were thoroughly shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin Meng Hao’s eyes, a strong desire to battle was suddenly ignited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, though, he frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep within his bag of holding, he could sense the Demon Spirit emanating an intense teleportation power. It seemed that it could teleport him away at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao couldn’t do anything about, but neither could he ignore it. He slapped his bag of holding, producing the blood-colored mask, which he slipped on his face. At the same time, the mastiff lifted its head up and howled. It transformed into a red beam of light which shot toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red light fused into the mask, causing Meng Hao’s robes to whip about and his hair to float up. His aura instantly burst out violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch eruption instantly caught the attention of the Spirit Severing Patriarchs, as well as all the observers from the other Tribes in the Black Lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmidst the roaring sound, Meng Hao’s robes became blood red, as did his hair. A glow of blood surrounded him, and behind him, a red throne appeared. Seated there was a woman wearing a mask identical to Meng Hao’s. As she became visible, she sat down coldly onto the throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood Immortal!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this moment the entire world was crimson. Even people who were merely watching the scene on a screen suddenly felt as if all the blood in their bodies wished to burst out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked up, and an oppressive glow could be seen in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-555\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-557\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-4-chapter-556","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
