{"id":89163,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u003cp\u003eI SPREAD OUT MY BEACH blanket, wishing with all my heart that my sunglasses were bigger and darker. The sun was blazing and not helping my dull hangover. Thankfully Paige and Jordan were watching a movie with Dody up at the cottage so I had a few minutes to myself. I settled in with my new book, The Moron\u0027s Manual for Starting Your Own Business. A gift from Fontaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of hot sand and cool water was a tonic, lulling me into a lethargic stupor. I closed my eyes and my mind drifted back to last night. The end part was a little fuzzy. The last thing I remembered was watching Des lumber unsteadily down the beach toward the Pullmans\u0027 house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes sleepily. There he was, lumbering again. I blinked, thinking it might be a mirage. But he was really there, making his way toward me much slower than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how are you?\" I asked when he finally reached my blanket and sat down with a heavy thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think?\" he asked. He took off his sunglasses, making me gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis left eye was swollen and red, with dark bruises all around it. He looked like the final scene from a boxing movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! My! God! What happened to your eye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled. \"You guys got me drunk last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh. I think I might be in trouble. I hesitated to ask, \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when I got home it was very late and very dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you know that table you moved in my front hallway to make it look more welcoming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said welcoming the way most people say horseshit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I walked in the door, tripped over the goddamned cat, and crashed into the table on my way to the floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was annoyed. And I should feel terrible! This was all my fault, just like Dody tripping over Jordan\u0027s truck had been. But the mental picture of him stumbling and bumbling through a dark house and falling flat on his face was too much to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to fight it. I really did. But then I busted out with a full-volume, head-tipped-back guffaw. I couldn\u0027t help it! I slapped my hand over my big, loud mouth but the laugh was already out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think this is funny?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my lips together and shook my head, but the bubbles of laughter were filling up my throat and going into my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadie,\" he huffed again. \"It\u0027s not funny!\" But one corner of his mouth twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know!\" I nodded fast then burst out laughing even harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me, until at last, he started laughing too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry, Des!\" I choked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but I am, really.\" I tried to appear sincere, attempting to do my Sad Paige impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet it does. I woke up this morning and thought my head was going to explode. I figured it was just from the drinks, but then I saw myself in the mirror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed again, imagining the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, it hardly hurt at all when I did it! The cat kind of broke my fall. Anyway, I\u0027m willing to let you make it up to me.\" His other eye crinkled in amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how would I do that?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his sunglasses back on. \"Go out to dinner with me tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the alcohol still in my system rushed back to my head. I felt dizzy and slightly seasick. He was asking me on a date. I didn\u0027t want him to ask me on a date. I had an allergic reaction to dates. I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. \"I\u0027m only here for the summer, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes smiled. \"Dinner should only take a couple of hours. We should be back in plenty of time for you to pack up for Glenville.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seasickness swelled. I tingled with hope and panic. A date. He was asking me out on a date. A million reasons I should say no pinballed around inside my skull, colliding and ringing warning bells. Loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how about it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, sure,\" I heard someone answer. Someone who sounded just like me. \"That would be nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" He fell back against the blanket, flung his arm over his eyes, and promptly went to sleep. Wasn\u0027t that just like a man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArriving back at the cottage after my afternoon in the sun, I found bags of pretzels, candy wrappers, and soda cans strewn all around as Dody, Fontaine, Jordan, and Paige lounged together on the big brown sofa in the family room. They were watching Phantom of the Opera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, I\u0027m thinking that movie is not so appropriate for my kids, Dody.\" I bent over and started picking up wrappers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous. It\u0027s a musical. Didn\u0027t your mother ever let you watch musicals when you were little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, like Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" She drank from her soda then offered it to Jordan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not quite the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhhh, shhh!\" Fontaine hissed, not taking his eyes off the television. \"The Phantom is luring the girl into his dungeon lair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know! That\u0027s a little dark and twisted for a six- and four-year-old, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was sitting on Fontaine\u0027s lap, enthralled by the movie. \"Why is he wearing a mask?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he\u0027s a mutant musical genius,\" Fontaine answered. \"Like Lady Gaga.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around the room, conflicting thoughts swirling in my mind. If I went to dinner with Des, I\u0027d have to ask one of these two to watch my kids. Could I really do that? Jordan\u0027s head rested in Dody\u0027s lap while she petted him like a dog. Richard would have a conniption if he saw this. Where was my parental guidance? Where was the adult supervision? I bit my lip and thought about Des\u0027s hair and the way it was always just a little messy, begging me to run my fingers through it. My hand twitched. I could almost feel his hair against my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, what the hell. My kids would be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the plunge. \"Dody, can you watch the kids tomorrow night so I can go out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine\u0027s head popped up like a prairie dog\u0027s. He immediately paused the movie while he and Dody looked at me as if I\u0027d just announced my nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you going out with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed my arms. They didn\u0027t need to sound so surprised. \"Just dinner with Des.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy aunt and cousin high-fived each other. Very mature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027ll watch the children,\" Dody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine hopped up, oblivious to Paige tumbling onto the floor from his lap. \"And I\u0027ll go pick out your outfit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said. \"And I will go call Penny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny didn\u0027t answer her phone, which was an enormous problem for me. I needed her to talk me down from the ledge onto which I had crawled. What the hell was I thinking, telling Des I\u0027d go out to dinner with him? I could have said I had plans. I should have told him I had to sort Dody\u0027s ceramic-unicorn collection or help her tie-dye a tablecloth. Maybe it wasn\u0027t too late to cancel. I could wait until tomorrow and then tell him Jordan had a fever. But Des was a doctor. He\u0027d want to come over and help. Frickin\u0027 Hippocratic oath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine walked into my bedroom and started strewing my clothes all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I yelled. \"That\u0027s sorted and organized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Into what categories? Ugly clothes and uglier clothes? I have been dying to do this, girlfriend. We have got to take you shopping. What the hell is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up my most prized possession, a sweatshirt from spring break during my senior year of college. It was faded, tattered, and perfect for wearing while eating peanut butter with your fingers and crying about your incredibly shitty marriage. I tried to snatch it from his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance. It\u0027s going in the composter with this other pile of crap you call a wardrobe. Like this stuff would ever decompose. No wonder I\u0027ve had a stuffy nose. It\u0027s all these synthetic fabrics you snuck in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine\u0027s assault on my meager wardrobe further shredded my nerves. What the hell was I going to wear?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing to work with here,\" he sighed. \"Get your shoes on. It\u0027s time for a little Extreme Ho Makeover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You expect me to go shopping simply because some guy asked me out to dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. But you can go shopping to buy things to make you feel pretty. You deserve it. It\u0027s not for him, it\u0027s for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine sang a different song two hours later as I stood in the dressing room of a Bell Harbor boutique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Des will love that!\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stuffed into a tiny red dress with a plunging neckline and not enough fabric. Even my feet felt naked in strappy high-heeled sandals with rhinestone buckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s skimpy. He\u0027ll think I\u0027m trying too hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine shook his head. \"The only thing that dress will make him think about is taking it off you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach recoiled like I\u0027d been kicked in the gut. Taking it off me? I hadn\u0027t even thought of that! I mean, I had thought about it, but only in the most movie-version way. The way I imagined the right conditioner could make my hair swirl around like it does in the commercials, or how I daydreamed about doing something fabulous for mankind and being congratulated by Bono.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFantasies were one thing, but actual physical contact with another human being? Fontaine was talking about skin to skin. There was no way I was ready for that. I suddenly remembered my last horrific blind date. This time I would know better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The shoes are too much. I have shoes I can wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those white sandals I saw in your closet? No fucking way, baby. Those puppies have been donated to the community theatre for their production of The Golden Girls. Next stop, Victoria\u0027s Secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t feel any better about the dress, or the shoes, or my silky new unmentionables the next day either as I stood in front of the mirror minutes before Des was scheduled to pick me up. I tugged at the neckline, but that only made the dress shorter. No good. And the sandals were cruel, pinching my toes as if I were Cinderella\u0027s ugly stepsister who had accidentally scored a date with Prince Charming. What if he showed up and said, \"Wait, I didn\u0027t mean you. Where\u0027s the pretty one?\" I started to hyperventilate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fontaine, I have to change. Let me wear the black pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get a hold of yourself, woman!\" he scolded. \"You\u0027re not going to a craft show with Dody. This is a date. Don\u0027t make me slap you, because you know I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew he would. He\u0027d done it once before, when I used up the last of his strawberry-kiwi-scented exfoliation scrub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, why are you so blasted nervous? It\u0027s Des.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to take a deep breath, but the dress wouldn\u0027t let me. \"I know. That\u0027s the problem.\" I bit my lip. My voice dropped to a whisper. \"Fontaine, what if I start to like him? I mean, really like him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine patted my arm. \"Then let yourself really like him. The alternative is pure boredom, and you\u0027re too fun for that. Now I\u0027m going downstairs to make you a cocktail. You\u0027re so jittery, you\u0027re making me nervous. Just relax.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine went downstairs, and I sat in my bedroom to collect myself. I could do this. Of course I could. This wasn\u0027t some cheesy blind date like the last guy had been. It was Des. He was a nice guy. This would be OK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDody and the kids were in the kitchen and I was coming down the stairs when my date arrived. Fontaine opened the door to let him in, and I was grateful for the distraction they offered. Gracious. Des looked so delicious he took my breath away. I\u0027d only seen him in doctor stuff and scruffy beach clothes, in which he was damn fine. But cleaned up? Yum yum. His hair was combed, and he wore nice slacks and an ironed shirt. The idea of him standing at an ironing board pressing his clothes for a night out with me gave me tingles in all the places tingles tingled most often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kids swarmed around him like eager puppies, and he scratched at their heads as if they were. Fortunately Lazyboy and Fatso had been locked out on the porch, or Des would be covered in slobber. Then again, that might happen anyway. My tongue suddenly felt too thick for my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Des looked at me. His eyes started at my shoes and traveled up slowly, making my nerves so taut I thought I might be audibly crackling. He hesitated ever so slightly at the neckline of my little red dress. Damn. I think Fontaine was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up a little straighter, leveling my shoulders like a broken athlete daring to go out onto the field for one last play. Put me in, coach. I\u0027m ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw his Adam\u0027s apple bob as he swallowed. \"You look nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words were plain and simple, but the way he said them made me flutter inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, so do you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh!\" Fontaine uttered softly, pressing a fist to his mouth. He wrapped an arm around a beaming Dody. \"You kids go on. We\u0027ll be fine here.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-10.html","bookId":2788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM"}
