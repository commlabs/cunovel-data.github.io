She hadn’t gone to college, hadn’t finished high school, but somewhere along the way she had acquired a veneer of sophistication that reflected more concrete knowledge than a diploma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poor, Karen,” she said. “Poor Karen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t say anything. She sat somberly for a moment, then tossed her head so that her bleached blond mane rippled like a wheat field in the wind. “I’m getting morbid as hell,” she said. “You’d better take me home, Ed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climbed three flights of stairs. I stood next to her while she rummaged through her purse. She came up with a key and turned to face me before opening the door. “Ed,” she said softly, “if I asked you, would you just come in for a few drinks? Could it be that much of an invitation and no more?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate to sound like—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went inside. She turned on lamps in the living room and we sat on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started talking about the modeling session she’d gone through that afternoon. “The money was good,” she said, “but I had to work for it. He took three or four rolls of film. Slightly advanced cheese-cake, Ed. Nudes, underwear stuff. He’ll print the best pictures and they’ll wind up for sale in the dirty little stores on 42nd Street.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With the face retouched?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “He won’t bother. Nobody’s going to look at the face, Ed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And not the body?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me for a long moment. There was something electric in the air. I could feel the sweet animal heat of her. She was right next to me. I could reach out and touch her, could take her in my arms and press her close. The bedroom wasn’t far away. And she would be good, very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo drinks later, I got up and walked to the door. She followed me. I stopped at the doorway, started to say something, changed my mind. We said good night and I started down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she had been just any girl—actress, secretary, college girl, or waitress—then it would have ended differently. It would have ended in her bedroom, in warmth and hunger and fury. But she was not just any girl. She was a halfway tramp, a little tarnished, a little soiled, a little battered around the edges. And so I could not make that pass at her, could not maneuver from couch to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to go back to my apartment. It would be lonely there. I drove to a Third Avenue bar where they pour good drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere between two and three I left the bar and looked around for the Chevy. By the time I found it I decided to leave it there and take a cab. I had had too little sleep the night before and too much to drink this night, and things were beginning to go a little out of focus. The way I felt, they looked better that way. But I didn’t much feel like bouncing the car off a telephone pole or gunning down some equally stoned pedestrian. I flagged a cab and left the driving to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to tell me three times that we were in front of my building before it got through to me. I shook myself awake, paid him, and wended my way into the brownstone and up a flight of stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I blinked a few times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something on my doormat, something that hadn’t been there when I left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was blond, well-bred, and glassy-eyed. It had an empty wine bottle in one hand and its mouth was smiling lustily. It got to its feet and swayed there, then pitched forward slightly. I caught it and it burrowed its head against my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You keep late hours,” it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very soft and very warm. It rubbed its hips against me and purred like a kitten, I growled like a randy old tomcat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been waiting for you,” it said. “I’ve been wanting to go to bed. Take me to bed, Ed London.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts name, in case you haven’t guessed, was Lynn Farwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were a pair of iron filings and my bed was a magnet. I opened the door and we hurried inside. I closed the door and slid the bolt. We moved quickly through the living room and along a hall to the bedroom. Along the way we discarded clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left her skirt on my couch, her sweater on one of my leather chairs. Her bra and slip and shoes landed in various spots on the hall floor. In the bedroom she got rid of her stockings and garter belt and panties. She was naked and beautiful and hungry…and there was no time to waste on words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body welcomed me. Her breasts, firm little cones of happiness, quivered against me. Her thighs enveloped me in the lust-heat of desire. Her face twisted in a blind agony of need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were both pretty well stoned. This didn’t matter. We could never have done better sober. There was a beginning, bittersweet and almost painful. There was a middle, fast and furious, a scherzo movement in a symphony of fire. And there was an ending, gasping, spent, two bodies washed up on a lonely barren beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end she used words that girls are not supposed to learn in the schools she had attended. She screamed them out in a frenzy of completion, a song of obscenity offered as a coda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd afterward, when the rhythm was gone and only the glow remained, she talked. “I needed that,” she told me. “Needed it badly. But you could tell that, couldn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re good, Ed.” She caressed me. “Very good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. I win blue ribbons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was I good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her she was fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmmmm,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled out of bed just as the noon whistles started going off all over town. Lynn was gone. I listened to bells from a nearby church ring twelve times; then I showered, shaved, and swallowed aspirin. Lynn had left. Living proof of indiscretions makes bad company on the morning after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught a cab, and the driver and I prowled Third Avenue for my car. It was still there. I drove it back to the garage and tucked it away. Then I called Donahue, but hung up before the phone had a chance to ring. Not that I expected to reach him anyway, since calling him on the phone didn’t seem to produce much in the way of concrete results. But I didn’t feel like talking to him just then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours ago I had been busy coupling with his bride-to-be. It seemed an unlikely prelude to a conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy \u0026amp; Bates wasn’t really on Madison Avenue. It was around the corner on 48th Street, a suite of offices on the fourteenth floor of a twenty-two-story building. I got out of the elevator and stood before a reception desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Phil Abeles,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“May I ask your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go right ahead.” I smiled. She looked unhappily snowed. “Ed London,” I finally said. She smiled gratefully and pressed one of twenty buttons and spoke softly into a tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’ll have a seat, Mr. London,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have a seat. I stood instead and loaded up a pipe. I finished lighting it as Abeles emerged from an office and came over to meet me. He motioned for me to follow him. We went into his air-cooled office and he closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up, Ed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure,” I said. “I want some help.” I drew on the pipe. “I’ll need a private office for an hour or two,” I told him. “And I want to see all of the men who were at Mark Donahue’s bachelor dinner. One at a time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of us?” He grinned. “Even Lloyd and Kenneth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose we can pass them for the time being. Just you and the other five then. Can you arrange it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded with a fair amount of enthusiasm. “You can use this office,” he said. “And everybody’s around today, so you won’t have any trouble on that score. Who do you want to see first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I might as well start with you, Phil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI talked with him for ten minutes. But I had already pumped him dry the day before. Still, he gave me a little information on some of the others I would be seeing. Before, I had tried to ask him about his own relationship with Karen Price. Although that tack had been fairly effective, it didn’t look like the best way to come up with something concrete. Instead, I asked him about the other men. If I worked on all of them that way, I just might turn up an answer or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbeles more or less crossed Fred Klein off the suspect list, if nothing else. Klein, whose wife was in Reno, had tentatively made the coulda-dunnit sheet on the chance that Karen was threatening to give his wife information that could boost her alimony, or something of the sort. Abeles knocked the theory to pieces with the information that Klein’s wife had money of her own, that she wasn’t looking for alimony, and that a pair of expensive lawyers had already worked out all the details of the divorce agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked Phil Abeles which of the married men he knew definitely had contact at one time or another with Karen Price. This was the sort of information a man is supposed to keep to himself, but the mores of Madison Avenue tend to foster subtle backstabbing. Abeles told me he knew for certain that Karen had been intimate with Harold Merriman, and he was almost sure about Joe Conn as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Abeles left, I knocked the dottle out of my pipe and filled it again. I lit it, and as I shook out the match, I looked up at Harold Merriman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pudgy man with a bald spot and bushy eyebrows, forty or forty-five, somewhat older than the rest of the crew. He sat down across the desk from me and narrowed his eyes. “Phil said you wanted to see me,” he said. “What’s the trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just routine.” I smiled. “I need a little information. You knew Karen Price before the shooting, didn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I knew who she was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, I thought. But I let it pass and played him the way I had planned. I asked him who in the office had had anything to do with the dead girl. He hemmed and hawed a little, then told me that Phil Abeles had taken her out for dinner once or twice and that Jack Harris was supposed to have had her along on a business trip to Miami one weekend. Strictly in a secretarial capacity, no doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, no,” Merriman said. “I’d met her, of course, but that was as far as it went.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hesitation was admission enough. “L-listen,” he stammered, “all right, I…saw her a few times. It was nothing serious and it wasn’t very recent. London—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep it a secret, will you?” He forced a grin. “Write it off as a symptom of the foolish forties. She was available and I was ready to play around a little. I’d just as soon it didn’t get out. Nobody around here knows, and I’d like to keep it that way.” He hesitated again. “My wife knows. I was so damn ashamed of myself that I told her. But I wouldn’t want the boys in the office to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t tell him that they already knew, and that they had passed the information on to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay Powell came in grinning. He was a bachelor, and this made a difference. “Hello, London,” he said. “I made it with the girl, if that’s what you want to know.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-night-stands-and-lost-weekends/page-47.html","bookId":2318,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM"}
