It was minutes before her husband could extract sense from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was saying finally, \"I tell you they\u0027re in the barn. I don\u0027t know what they are. No, no-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe barred the Industrialist\u0027s quick movement in that direction. She said, \"Don\u0027t you go. Send one of the hands with a Shotgun. I tell you I never saw anything like it. Little horrible beasts with-with- I can\u0027t describe it. To think that Red was touching them and trying to feed them. He was holding them, and feeding them meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed began, \"I only-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Slim said, \"It wasn\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Industrialist said quickly, \"Now you boys have done enough harm today. March! Into the house! And not a word; not one word! I\u0027m not interested in anything you have to say. After this is all over, I\u0027ll hear you out and as for you, Red, I\u0027ll see that you\u0027re properly punished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to his wife, \"Now whatever the animals are, we\u0027ll have them killed.\" He added quietly once the youngsters were out of hearing, \"Come, come. The children aren\u0027t hurt, and after all, they haven\u0027t done anything really terrible. They\u0027ve just found a new pet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Astronomer spoke with difficulty. \"Pardon me, ma\u0027am, but can you describe these animals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. She was quite beyond words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you just tell me if they-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" said the Industrialist apologetically, \"but I think I had better take care of her. Will you excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A moment. Please. One moment. She said she had never seen such animals before. Surely it is not usual to find animals that are completely unique on an estate such as this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.

The Astronomer followed and the woman\u0027s wail rose unheeded behind them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-21.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
