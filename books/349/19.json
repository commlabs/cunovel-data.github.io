A DRAMATIC SCENE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;It was generally after vespers that Mr. Smith communicated to the school anything which he desired to call to their attention. This was to be the occasion of bringing our hero into disgrace. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The boys assembled, most of them quite ignorant that anything exceptional was to occur. Hector himself, the person chiefly interested, was entirely unconscious that he was to be made “a shining mark” for the arrows of suspicion and obloquy. If he had noticed the peculiar and triumphantly malicious looks with which Jim Smith, the bully and tyrant, whom he had humiliated and deposed, regarded him, he might have been led to infer that some misfortune was in store for him. But these looks he did not chance to notice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were two other boys, however, who did notice them. These were Ben Platt and Wil-kins, who had very good reasons, as we know, for doing so.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I believe old Sock is going to pitch into Roscoe at vespers,” said Ben, in a whisper, to his roommate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So do I. There’s a look about him like that of a tiger about to pounce on his prey.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Or a cat with murderous designs on a mouse.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We must expose the whole thing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Won’t Jim be mad?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let him! He won’t dare to thrash us while Roscoe is round.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was, indeed, about Socrates Smith an air of mystery, portentous and suggestive. He looked like one meditating a coup d’etat, or, perhaps, it might better be said, a coup de main, as the hand is with schoolmasters, generally, the instrument of attack.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the proper time arrived, Mr. Smith cleared his throat, as he always did before beginning to speak.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Boys,” he said, “I have an important, and I may say, a painful, communication to make to you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All the boys looked at each other in curiosity, except the three who were already in the secret.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You know, boys,” continued Socrates, “how proud I am of this institute, how zealous I am for its good reputation, how unwearied I am in my efforts for your progress and welfare.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Smith’s unwearied efforts were largely in the line of making out and receipting bills for tuition, and it may be said that this was to him by far the most agreeable of the duties he undertook to perform.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have been proud of my pupils,” continued the principal, “and it has given me pleasure to reflect that you all reflected credit, more or less, upon my teaching. I have, also, sought to form your manners, to train you to fill the positions which Providence may have in store for you. In a word, while from time to time you may have indulged in little escapades, slightly-culpable, I have felt that you were all gentlemen.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What in the world does he mean?” thought more than one puzzled boy. “What is all this leading to?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Among those to whom this thought occurred, was Hector Roscoe, who was very far from conjecturing that all this long preamble was to introduce an attack upon him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But,” proceeded Socrates, after a pause, “I have this afternoon been painfully undeceived. I have learned, with inexpressible pain, that Smith Institute has received an ineffaceable stigma.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Old Sock is getting eloquent!” whispered Ben Platt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have learned,” continued Socrates, with tragic intensity, “that I have nourished a viper in my bosom! I have learned that we have a thief among us!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This declaration was greeted with a buzz of astonishment. Each boy looked at his next door neighbor as if to inquire, “Is it you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Each one, except the three who were behind the scenes. Of these, Jim Smith, with an air of supreme satisfaction, looked in a sidelong way at Hector, unconscious the while that two pairs of eyes—those of Wilkins and Ben Platt—were fixed upon him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I thought you would be surprised,” said the principal, “except, of course, the miserable criminal. But I will not keep you in suspense. To-day, by inadvertence, I left my wallet, containing a considerable sum of money, on the bureau in my chamber. An hour later, discovering my loss, I went upstairs, but the wallet was gone. It had mysteriously disappeared. I was at a loss to understand this at first, but I soon found a clew. I ascertained that a boy—a boy who is presently one of the pupils of Smith Institute—had entered my chamber, had appropriated the wallet, had carried it to his dormitory, and there had slyly concealed it in the pocket of a pair of pants. Doubtless, he thought his theft would not be discovered, but it was, and I myself discovered the missing wallet in its place of concealment.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here Mr. Smith paused, and it is needless to say that the schoolroom was a scene of great excitement. His tone was so impressive, and his statement so detailed, that no one could doubt that he had most convincing evidence of the absolute accuracy of what he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who was it?” every boy had it on his lips to inquire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Three hours have elapsed since my discovery,” continued Mr. Smith. “During that time I have felt unnerved. I have, however, written and posted an account of this terrible discovery to the friends of the pupil who has so disgraced himself and the school.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben Platt and Wilkins exchanged glances of indignation. They felt that Mr. Smith had been guilty of a piece of outrageous injustice in acting thus before he had apprised the supposed offender of the charge against him, and heard his defense. Both boys decided that they would not spare Jim Smith, but at all hazards expose the contemptible plot which he had contrived against his schoolfellow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I waited, however, till I was somewhat more calm before laying the matter before you. I know you will all be anxious to know the name of the boy who has brought disgrace upon the school to which you belong, and I am prepared to reveal it to you. Hector Roscoe, stand up!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If a flash of lightning had struck him where he sat, Hector could not have been more astonished. For a moment he was struck dumb, and did not move.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Stand up, Hector Roscoe!” repeated the principal. “No wonder you sit there as if paralyzed. You did not expect that so soon your sin would find you out.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Hector recovered completely his self-possession. He sprang to his feet, and not only that, but he strode forward, blazing with passion, till he stood before Mr. Smith’s desk and confronted him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Smith!” he said, in a ringing tone, “do I understand you to charge me with stealing a wallet of yours containing money?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I do so charge you, and I have complete evidence of the truth of my charge. What have you to say?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What have I to say?” repeated Hector, looking around him proudly and scornfully. “I have to say that it is an infamous lie!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hold, sir!” exclaimed Socrates, angrily. “Shameless boy, do you intend to brazen it out? Did I not tell you that I had complete proof of the truth of the charge?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t care what fancied proof you have. I denounce the charge as a lie.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That won’t do, sir! I myself took the wallet from the pocket of your pantaloons, hanging in the chamber. Mrs. Smith was with me and witnessed my discovery, and there was another present, one of the pupils of this institute, who also can testify to the fact. It is useless for you to deny it!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You found the wallet in the pocket of my pantaloons?” asked Hector, slowly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes. There can be no doubt about that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who put it there?” demanded Hector, quickly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Socrates Smith was staggered, for he had not expected this query from the accused.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who put it there?” he repeated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir,” continued Hector, firmly. “If the matter is as you state it, some one has been mean enough to put the wallet into my pocket in order to implicate me in a theft.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course you put it there yourself, Roscoe. Your defense is very lame.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hector turned round to his fellow-scholars.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Boys,” he said, “you have heard the charge that has been made against me. You know me pretty well by this time. Is there any one of you that believes it to be true?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No! No!” shouted the boys, with one exception. Jim Smith was heard to say distinctly, “I believe it!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Silence in the school!” shouted Socrates. “This is altogether irregular, and I won’t have it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hector turned to the principal, and said, calmly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You see, Mr. Smith, that, in spite of your proof, these boys will not believe that your charge is well founded.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is neither here nor there, Roscoe. Will anyone step up and prove your innocence?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was another sensation. In the second row back a boy was seen to rise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Smith,” said Ben Platt, “I can prove Roscoe’s innocence!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2974/81935.html","bookId":349,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:20:33 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:20:33 AM"}
