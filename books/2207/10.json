{"id":101906,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" Magda asked an hour later as I hoisted myself onto the windowsill of a large house that sat directly behind the church used by the Brotherhood. \"I don\u0027t think your husband is going to like you missing your wedding night. Your second husband, that is, not your first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced and let myself drop to the ground, oofing as quietly as I could. Magda\u0027s feet appeared next to my head. Hurriedly, I moved out of the way so she could climb out. \"My husband has nothing to say about it. Either one of them. And as far as the latter one goes, I told him I was too tired to play house tonight, and wanted to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He bought that?\" she asked in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had no choice.\" I gave her a quick smile. \"One of the perks of being Zorya is that he pretty much has to do what I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hrmph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will say that I\u0027m glad the Brotherhood folk were content with their version of a marriage ceremony rather than a civil ceremony, because I really would have hated to explain to them why they couldn\u0027t take out a marriage license in my name. You really want to do this? Audrey and Ray must be worried about where you\u0027ve been all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda brushed off my concerns and led the way out of the tiny yard to the street, being careful to stick to the shadows. \"I called them while you were chatting with your hubby, and told them I\u0027d see them in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we drop references to Mattias as my husband? It makes me feel... I don\u0027t know, uncomfortable somehow. As if I\u0027m doing something underhanded. Which I realize is silly because that\u0027s exactly what I am doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except you\u0027re doing it for a good reason,\" she said, completing my thought. We paused at an intersection, carefully eyeing the streets for signs of police, tour members, Brotherhood people, or incredibly handsome vampires. \"So it really doesn\u0027t count as a sin, if that\u0027s what\u0027s worrying you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hurried across the street, heading toward the section of town where our hotel was located. Luckily, at that time of night, there wasn\u0027t much traffic, either pedestrian or vehicular. \"I\u0027m not overly concerned about sinning - I just don\u0027t want them to find out the truth and hack off my head or burn me at the stake, or whatever it is they do to people they think have signed on with the enemy. Which is just one more reason why I wanted to get away tonight - if something happens to me, I don\u0027t want them coming down on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pfft,\" she said dismissively, giving me a friendly little shove. \"What\u0027s a friend for if not to face almost certain death with, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A worthy attitude, but you don\u0027t know to what lengths these guys will go,\" I answered, rubbing my arms. \"That little chat I had with Mattias after the ceremony wasn\u0027t just to discuss the sleeping arrangements. Did you know that even though Anniki picked me to be her successor, and I have ghostly charges and such, I\u0027m still not officially recognized as Zorya? Evidently they have to conduct some sort of recognition ritual where the Brotherhood people assemble to acknowledge me. Only after that is over will I be able to take the ghosts to their destination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ritual?\" she asked. \"Like an initiation at fraternities and such?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assumedly without the wild orgies and drunkenness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned at me. \"But that\u0027s the best part! Did Mattias say what the initiation is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my arms again, not sure if the goose bumps were from the cold air or nerves. \"He didn\u0027t really go into it much, other than to say that just as the Zorya requires the stone to channel power, so does she require the acceptance of the community to be recognized as Zorya. The ceremony is supposed to do the latter bit, and I gather after that I\u0027ll be put through my paces in front of everyone. It sounds kind of creepy, to be honest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very Masonic,\" Magda agreed as we kept to the shadows at the next intersection. I recognized a couple of buildings, guessing we were a few blocks away from the hotel. \"So that\u0027s going to take place tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the plan. In the ruins we were supposed to go to the other night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, good. I really wanted to see that place. I hope no one minds if I come along tomorrow? Ack. It\u0027s almost ten. You\u0027d better get some sleep or you\u0027re going to be exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027m a bit pooped. Whoops. Come back. I think that\u0027s a cop car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled back as we were rounding a corner, both of us watching suspiciously as a man strolled out of the front of the hotel, pausing to talk to someone sitting in an unmarked car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cop?\" I asked Magda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely. They must be watching for you. Let\u0027s go around the back. Maybe there\u0027s a way we can get in there without them seeing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe slipped around the block, coming up against the kitchen entrance, but there was a policeman there, too, talking with easy amiability with a woman wearing a traditional white chef\u0027s hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn. OK, how\u0027s this? I go in and distract the cop in the lobby, and you sneak through to the side stairs and go up to your room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have my key,\" I whispered, my hopes sinking. Although the Brotherhood people had said they would give me money, I wanted my own clothing and things, which Magda thought were still in my room. \"It was in my room when I left, but I\u0027m sure the manager or police picked it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda pulled out her hotel key - really a plastic card with a magnetic strip - and looked thoughtful. \"There\u0027s the bathroom. That\u0027s a way in for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my mind back to the morning, shuddering at the memory. \"I left the door unlocked when I went to bed, in case you needed to use the room, but this morning when I found Anniki, it was locked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a little grimace, then said thoughtfully, tapping the key card on her lips, \"That\u0027s as may be, but the police unlocked it at one point. I caught them peeking in while I was getting dressed. If they didn\u0027t lock it, I bet you could get into your room from mine via the bathroom. Or in a worst-case scenario, use the balcony our rooms share.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s still the matter of getting up into your room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and fluffed her substantial cleavage. \"Oh, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to be too difficult to overcome. The girls and I can keep the lobby cop\u0027s attention long enough for you to slip in and go up the side stairs. I would avoid the elevator, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if we\u0027re caught? I don\u0027t want you to get into trouble with the police for helping me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re seen, I\u0027ll simply point at you and scream bloody murder,\" she said confidently, giving me her key card. \"There\u0027s nothing they can do to me since I haven\u0027t done anything wrong. Just a little aiding and abetting, but what\u0027s that? Nothing, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhereas I\u0027d honored Anniki\u0027s last request, which left me running from the scene of a murder, I thought with a twinge of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, let\u0027s go in via the verandah, and I\u0027ll go dazzle the cop inside with my fabulous breasts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer plan - or breasts - worked like a charm. She had no difficulty engaging the cop\u0027s attention long enough for me to slip inside and along the far wall to the hallway that led to a set of lesser-used stairs. The reception clerk was too busy watching Magda to notice me, and my luck held all the way to Magda\u0027s room. With a quick, fearful glance up and down the hallway, I opened her room door and let myself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to turn on the light when a muffled snore emerged from her bed. Evidently Raymond had decided to wait for her here. I knew where the door to the bathroom had to be, and edged my way carefully through the room, but it was dark and impossible to navigate without running painfully into things. The third time I smashed my toe against a piece of furniture and uttered a smothered yelp, Raymond snorted, and groggily asked, \"Honeycakes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI murmured something that I hoped sounded Magda-ish, and almost sighed with relief when the door to the bathroom opened easily. I closed the door behind me before turning on the light, hesitating for a moment as I considered locking it in case Raymond decided to follow me, but decided against such an action. It wouldn\u0027t be fair to keep Magda from using the room for a second night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom had been cleaned up, so presumably the police were done with their forensics work. I eyed the spot where Anniki had lain, begging me for justice, and renewed my intention to fulfill her dying wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it was Kristoff that killed you, he won\u0027t go unpunished,\" I told the empty room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if it was Alec? my inner critic asked. I moved toward the door, mentally shaking my head. It couldn\u0027t be Alec. I would know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom door that led into my room wasn\u0027t locked. I sagged with relief for a moment before peeking inside. The room was dark. \"Thank heavens for police who don\u0027t stay at a crime scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was halfway into the room before the voice spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention women who just can\u0027t live without their things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped and whirled as the lights came on. Kristoff stood next to the bed, dressed entirely in black, the golden glow from the lamp casting sinister shadows across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" I asked in a high, wavering voice. I started to back away from him but realized I had nowhere to go. There was no safety for a fugitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waiting for you. Alec had an idea you\u0027d be back. I packed up your things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked where he gestured. My large leather bag was sitting on a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you following me?\" I asked without thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you run from me?\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed a man! Right in front of me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I killed a reaper,\" he corrected. \"One who was about to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was not. He was just using me as a shield so you wouldn\u0027t bite him and turn him into the evil undead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff adopted a martyred expression that for some reason, I found endearing. \"Dark Ones are very much alive, and we do not turn people without a profound reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened at his words. Until that moment, I wasn\u0027t sure what part of the vampire myth was true. \"You mean you can turn people into vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can. It strips the soul from the person, so it is not done frequently. Certainly we are not building some sort of Dark One army to take over the world, if that\u0027s what you were about to ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my mouth. I was, in fact, about to ask that very thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, if there are no more ridiculously misinformed ideas you\u0027d like debunked, I\u0027d like to get going. The night is young, and I have much to do.\" He started toward me as he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you come near me.\" I said with rising panic, backing up and reaching around blindly for an object to use as protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped, a mildly amused look on his face. \"Why? What will you do? Call the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sank as I realized the veracity of his words. There was no one I could call to help me. Magda must be in her room by now, but I didn\u0027t really want to get her involved. Not with a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you wanted to see Alec. Or was your night with him so unmemorable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy spine stiffened at his mocking tone. \"I do want to see him, not that the night I spent with him is any of your business. I have several things I\u0027d like to ask him, not the least of which is why he felt it necessary to give you my passport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come along, then,\" he said, opening the door to the hallway a smidgen. He closed it quickly. \"We have to leave. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is someone coming?\" I asked, torn between a desire to seek help and a knowledge that I was better off without becoming involved with the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Police. Evidently you aroused suspicion getting in here.\" He turned off the light, grabbed my suitcase, and flung open the French doors on the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But no one saw me... unless the desk clerk caught a glimpse. Oy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff didn\u0027t say anything, just leaped off the balcony. I followed, closing the French doors behind me, peering hesitantly down to the ground, where he stood waiting impatiently in the indigo shade cast by a nearby hedge. The midnight sun was still up, but at its lowest point, which left everything bathed in a lovely twilight glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything but the vampire glaring up at me. \"Hurry. My car is parked a block away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long jump down,\" I said softly, trying to gauge the distance between the ground and the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you said you jumped down this way earlier.\" Exasperation was beginning to make itself heard in his deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but that was in the heat of the moment. I was scared and panicky. I\u0027m not panicking now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe muttered something that I suspected wasn\u0027t at all a good reflection on me, setting down the bag and holding his arms up. \"Jump down and I\u0027ll catch you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have got to be kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teal eyes glittered wickedly in the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too big! I\u0027ll squash you flat,\" I pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For god\u0027s sake, woman, jump now, or I\u0027ll leave you to the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swung my legs over the railing, sitting on it for a moment as I tried to make up my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight filtered out from the curtains on the French door. Someone was in my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll squash - \" I started to say again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jump!\" he commanded, and I threw all caution to the wind and did just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see? I told you I was too heavy!\" I looked down at Kristoff\u0027s face. As I suspected, I had toppled him like a bowling pin. He lay beneath me with a dazed look in his eyes that quickly faded to familiar irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All women think they\u0027re too fat. I am perfectly capable of catching you, regardless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers were splayed on my hips, his breath brushing my lips. We were fitted together in an intimate way that seemed to make thinking difficult. His gaze dropped to my mouth, and I started to tingle all over at the thought of kissing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice shouting from the balcony roused us both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get moving,\" he growled as I rolled off him, quickly getting to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my suitcase in one hand and me with the other, dragging me after him as he raced out of the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of someone hitting the ground hard behind us kept me from protesting the cavalier treatment. I concentrated on keeping my feet beneath me as we raced down the block, around a corner, and back behind a small brick building. Kristoff tossed my bag into the back of the red car, shoving me inside before getting in himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA uniformed policeman appeared just as Kristoff slammed his foot onto the accelerator, sending us rocketing out of the small parking lot. He swore and jerked on the wheel, narrowly avoiding the cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy crap!\" I yelled as he took the corner on what felt like only two wheels. \"Are you trying to kill us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thought had crossed my mind,\" he ground out, his eyes glittering in the darkness as he sped out of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going? Are you and Alec staying at a hotel in town?\" I asked, looking behind us to see if we were being followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but that\u0027s not where we\u0027re going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027re clear. I don\u0027t see any cars racing up the hill after us,\" I said, looking back down at the town as Kristoff shifted gears and sent us flying out of town on the road that led to the main highway. I sat back down in my seat, relieved to have escaped at least one form of trouble. I eyed the other one. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you stalled so long getting off that damned balcony that the police saw my license plate. It won\u0027t take them long to trace it back to Alec, which means they\u0027ll know where we\u0027re staying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I just wanted to keep from flattening you,\" I said, wrapping the tattered remains of pride around myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"Women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, you have to admit, I was right. I did knock you down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was off balance,\" he said, his gaze fixed on the road. \"And you\u0027ll notice that you didn\u0027t flatten me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just a matter of semantics,\" I said righteously, looking out the window. \"If we can\u0027t go to Alec\u0027s hotel room, where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somewhere safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he wouldn\u0027t answer. He didn\u0027t say another word for the next twenty minutes as we drove through the twilight. I ignored him ignoring me and admired instead the lovely soft colors of the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are we stopping here?\" I finally broke the silence when Kristoff pulled off a winding rode and stopped in front of a long metal gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome to our accommodations for the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze moved from him as he climbed out of the car and opened the metal gate, to beyond where the outline of a rickety pink barn lurched drunkenly against the glowing sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff got back into the car and drove us around to the far side of the broken-down barn, tucking the car neatly away between the barn and a large, corroded metal cylinder, obviously some sort of farming equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re staying here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He got out, grabbing my bag and hauling it around to the front of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed staring at the back of the barn for a moment or two, noting with mild interest that a rat was observing me from the top of the metal cylinder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re staying here,\" I told the rat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t look impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not either,\" I told it, then gathering my wits, marched my way through thick, smelly mud to the front of the barn. Kristoff and my suitcase were nowhere to be seen, but a faint light glowed from inside the barn. I entered through one of the double doors that had been left slightly ajar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff had a cell phone to his ear, then closed it with a quick, jerky motion. \"Alec isn\u0027t answering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think something is wrong?\" I asked, watching him closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips thinned a smidgen. \"No. The police probably arrived, and he got out quickly. He might have left his phone behind. I\u0027ll try again in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. Um. Why are we here?\" I asked Kristoff as he jerked a couple of mildewy bales of hay off a platform. He had set a flashlight on an overturned bucket, since the interior of the barn was almost completely dark. \"That is to say, why are we not at a hotel or something like that? I know we can\u0027t go to yours if they saw your license plate, but that doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t go to somewhere civilized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yanked an empty moth-eaten grain bag onto the upper half of his bale platform. \"Unfortunately, I did not think to bring a false passport with me, so once the police have my name - which they will get from the hotel where Alec and I were staying - they will simply track that no matter what hotel I register at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I thought about that for a moment, distastefully eyeing the refuge he\u0027d found us. There was a suspicious rustling behind the bales. \"You couldn\u0027t... you know... make someone give us a room without registering under your real name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me. \"And how am I supposed to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know!\" I slapped my hands on my legs in exasperation. \"You\u0027re a vampire, aren\u0027t you? Doesn\u0027t that mean you can mind meld with people? Or brain wave them into doing what you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With my mesmerizing powers, you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! Those!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed a martyred sigh. \"I am a Dark One, Zorya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Pia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not have magical powers that affect mortals. So no, I cannot stare deep into someone\u0027s eyes and convince them to give me a room without first providing my passport and credit card.\" He went back behind a half wall and brought out a really filthy-looking blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what\u0027s the use in being a vampire if you don\u0027t get any special powers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say I don\u0027t have any powers - I simply said that I do not have any over mortals. And the only one I can mind meld with, as you put it, is someone close to me, like a Beloved, and I sincerely doubt such a woman exists.\" He plopped himself down on a couple of the bales of hay, and pulled the blanket over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I asked, feeling somewhat lost and alone. I rubbed my arms against the cold - it was cold and dank in the barn, the night air teasing its way in through a dozen or more missing slats in the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going to sleep.\" The words emerged with a surly edge to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered the black lump that he made in the near darkness of the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where am I supposed to sleep?\" I asked, hating the pitiful tinge to my voice, but feeling particularly vulnerable at the moment. Being helpless in the company of a murderous vampire will do that to a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made you a bed over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black lump bulged in the direction of the clumped bales of hay with the dirty feed bag. I looked at the so-called bed, moving hesitantly toward it. The rustling had stopped. Maybe it was the wind, not rodents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn off the flashlight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on your life,\" I said, edging my way over to the bed. One squeak, one sign that there were rats or mice near my bed, and I\u0027d go sleep in the car, small as it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. If you want the police to come investigating who is hiding out in a barn that\u0027s supposed to be unoccupied, leave it on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you deliberately being as obnoxious as possible?\" I asked, hefting the flashlight. It had a nice solid feel in my hand. It would make a reasonable weapon in case anything with four legs decided to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I have a feeling it was the two-legged predators I had to worry about more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I was being pleasant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pleasant.\" I snorted. \"You wouldn\u0027t know the meaning of the word. Don\u0027t I get a blanket?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat gingerly on the edge of my makeshift bed. \"You have one. I\u0027m cold. Why can\u0027t I have one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKristoff sighed heavily and rolled over to glare at me, his eyes glowing with a teal light in the dimness of the barn. \"Because I don\u0027t have a bloody bag full of clothing and you do. Now, will you turn off that light and go to sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled back over, leaving me staring balefully at his back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zen-and-the-art-of-vampires-dark-ones-6/page-10.html","bookId":2207,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:50 PM"}
