She flung her arms around him and hugged him tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal said, \"Hi, Dana. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re home. Did you bring me a Russian bear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did, but darn it, he escaped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal grinned. \"Are you going to stay home now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana said warmly, \"You bet I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Daley smiled. \"That\u0027s good news, Miss Evans. We\u0027re that glad you\u0027ve come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m that glad to be back,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the car, driving to the apartment, Dana said, \"How do you like your new arm now, Kemal? Are you getting used to it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad. How are you getting along in school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the pits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more fights?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful, darling.\" Dana studied him a moment. He seemed different somehow, almost subdued. It was as though something had happened to change him, but whatever it was, he certainly seemed a happy child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the apartment, Dana said, \"I have to go to the studio, but I\u0027ll be back, and we\u0027ll have dinner together. We\u0027ll go to McDonald\u0027s.\"Where we used to go with Jeff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana entered the huge WTN building, it seemed as though she had been away for a century. As she made her way to Matt\u0027s office, she was greeted by half a dozen fellow workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad you\u0027re back, Dana. We\u0027ve missed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad to be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, look who\u0027s here. Did you have a good trip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The place isn\u0027t the same without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana walked into Matt\u0027s office, he said, \"You\u0027ve lost weight. You look terrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana took a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t been sleeping?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way, our ratings have gone down since you\u0027ve been away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m flattered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elliot will be glad you\u0027ve given this up. He\u0027s been worried about you.\" Matt did not mention how worried he himself had been about Dana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked for half an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana got back to her office, Olivia said, \"Welcome back. It\u0027s been - \" The phone rang. She picked it up. \"Miss Evans\u0027s office...Just a moment, please.\" She looked at Dana. \"Pamela Hudson on line one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take it.\" Dana went into her own office and picked up the phone. \"Pamela.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dana, you\u0027re back! We were so worried. Russia is not the safest place to be these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" She laughed. \"A friend bought me pepper spray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve missed you. Roger and I would love to have you come by for tea this afternoon. Are you free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three o\u0027clock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the morning was taken up with preparations for the evening broadcasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt three o\u0027clock, Cesar was greeting Dana at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Evans!\" There was a big smile on his face. \"I\u0027m so pleased to see you. Welcome home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Cesar. How have you been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just wonderful, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are Mr. and Mrs. - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. They\u0027re waiting for you. May I take your coat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana walked into the drawing room, Roger and Pamela both exclaimed at once, \"Dana!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePamela Hudson gave her a hug. \"The prodigal is back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger Hudson said, \"You look tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That seems to be the general consensus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, sit down,\" Roger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA maid came in carrying a tray of tea, biscuits, scones, and croissants. Pamela poured tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took seats, and Roger said, \"Well, tell us what\u0027s happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening is I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ve gotten nowhere. I\u0027m completely frustrated.\" Dana took a deep breath. \"I met a man named Dieter Zander who said he was framed by Taylor Winthrop and sent to prison. While he was there, his family was wiped out in a fire. He blames Winthrop for their deaths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePamela said, \"So he had a motive for killing the whole Winthrop family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. But there\u0027s more,\" Dana said. \"I talked to a man named Marcel Falcon in France. His only son was killed by a hit-and-run driver. Taylor Winthrop\u0027s chauffeur pleaded guilty, but the chauffeur now claims that Taylor Winthrop was the driver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger said thoughtfully, \"Falcon was on the NATO Commission in Brussels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. And the chauffeur told him that it was Taylor Winthrop who killed his son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very. Have you ever heard of Vincent Mancino?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger Hudson thought for a moment. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s Mafia. Taylor Winthrop got his daughter pregnant, sent her to a quack, and she had a botched abortion. The daughter is in a convent and the mother is in a sanitarium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The point is that all three have strong motives for revenge.\" Dana sighed in frustration. \"But I can\u0027t prove anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger looked at Dana thoughtfully. \"So Taylor Winthrop was really guilty of doing all those terrible things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no question about it, Roger. I\u0027ve talked to those people. Whichever one of them is behind the murders orchestrated them brilliantly. There are no clues - none. Each murder had a different modus operandi, so there is no obvious pattern. Every detail was carefully worked out. Nothing was left to chance. There was not one witness to any of the deaths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePamela said thoughtfully, \"I know this may sound far-fetched, but - is it possible that they\u0027re all in this together to get revenge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana shook her head. \"I don\u0027t believe there was collusion. The men I talked to are very powerful. I think each would want to do it on his own. Only one of them is guilty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut which one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana suddenly looked at her watch. \"Please excuse me. I promised to take Kemal to McDonald\u0027s for dinner, and if I hurry, I can do it before I go to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, darling,\" said Pamela. \"We understand completely. Thank you for stopping by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana got up to go. \"And thank you both for the lovely tea and for your moral support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving Kemal to school on Monday morning, Dana said, \"I\u0027ve missed doing this, but I\u0027m back now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad.\" Kemal yawned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana realized that he had been yawning ever since he had awakened. Dana asked, \"Did you sleep well last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I guess so.\" Kemal yawned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you do at school?\" Dana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean besides horrible history and boring English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I play soccer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not doingtoo much, are you, Kemal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the frail figure next to her. It seemed to Dana that all the energy had gone out of Kemal. He was unnaturally quiet. Dana wondered if she should have a doctor look at him. Maybe she could check and see if there were some vitamins that would give him energy. She looked at her watch. The meeting for this evening\u0027s broadcast was half an hour away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning went by swiftly, and it felt good to be back in her world. When Dana returned to her office, there was a sealed envelope on her desk with her name on it. She opened it. The letter inside read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Evans: I have the information you want. I have made a reservation in your name at the Soyuz Hotel in Moscow. Come immediately. Tell no one about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was unsigned. Dana read the letter again, unbelievingly. I have the information you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it was some kind of trick. If someone in Russia had the answer she was looking for, why hadn\u0027t whoever it was told her about it when she was over there? Dana thought about the meeting she had had with Commissar Sasha Shdanoff and his brother Boris. Boris had seemed anxious to talk to her, and Sasha had kept cutting him off. Dana sat at her desk, thinking. How had the note gotten on her desk? Was she being watched?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to forget it, Dana decided. She stuffed the letter in her purse. I\u0027ll tear it up when I get home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana spent the evening with Kemal. She had thought he would be fascinated by the new computer game she had bought him in Moscow, but he seemed indifferent. At nine o\u0027clock his eyes started to close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sleepy, Dana. I\u0027m going to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, darling.\" Dana watched him go into the study and thought, He\u0027s changed so much. He seems like a different boy. Well, from now on we\u0027re going to be together. If something\u0027s bothering him, I\u0027ll find out what it is. It was time to leave for the studio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the apartment next door, the tenant looked at the television set and spoke into a tape recorder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The subject has left for the television studio to do her broadcast. The boy has gone to bed. The housekeeper is sewing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re live!\" The camera\u0027s red light flashed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe announcer\u0027s voice boomed out, \"Good evening. This is your eleven o\u0027clock news on WTN with Dana Evans and Richard Melton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana smiled into the camera. \"Good evening. I\u0027m Dana Evans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated next to her, Richard Melton said, \"And I\u0027m Richard Melton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana began, \"We start our news tonight with a terrible tragedy in Malaysia...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where I belong, Dana thought, not running around the world on some wild-goose chase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe broadcast went well. When Dana returned to the apartment, Kemal was asleep. After saying good night to Mrs. Daley, Dana went to bed, but she was unable to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have the information you want. I have made a reservation in your name at the Soyuz Hotel in Moscow. Come immediately. Tell no one about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a trap. I\u0027d be a fool to go back to Moscow, Dana thought. But what if it\u0027s real? Who would go to all this trouble? And why? The letter could only have come from Boris Shdanoff. What if he really knows something? She was awake all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana arose in the morning, she telephoned Roger Hudson and told him about the note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God. I don\u0027t know what to say.\" He sounded excited. \"This could mean that someone is ready to tell the truth about what happened to the Winthrops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dana, it could be dangerous. I don\u0027t like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I don\u0027t go, we\u0027ll never find out the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"I suppose you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be careful, but I must go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger Hudson said reluctantly, \"Very well. I want you to stay in close touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise, Roger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana was at the Corniche Travel Agency buying a round-trip ticket to Moscow. It was Tuesday. I hope I won\u0027t be gone too long, Dana thought. She left a message for Matt to tell him what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana returned to her apartment, she said to Mrs. Daley, \"I\u0027m afraid I have to go away again. It\u0027s just for a couple of days. Take good care of Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to worry about anything, Miss Evans. We\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tenant next door turned away from the television set and made a hasty telephone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoarding the Aeroflot plane to Moscow, Dana thought, It\u0027s deja vu. Maybe I\u0027m making a big mistake. It could be a trap. But if the answer is in Moscow, I\u0027m going to find it. She settled back for the long flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the plane landed the next morning at the now familiar Sheremetyevo II airport, Dana collected her bag and walked outside into a blinding snowstorm. There was a long line of travelers waiting for taxis. Dana stood in the cold wind, grateful for her warm coat. Forty-five minutes later, when it was finally Dana\u0027s turn, a burly man tried to push in ahead of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nyet!\"Dana said firmly. \"This is my cab.\" She got inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver said, \"Da?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go to the Soyuz Hotel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look at her and said in halting English, \"You sure you wish to go there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana said, puzzled, \"Why? What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is very not nice hotel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana felt a frisson of alarm. Am I sure? Toolateto back off now. He was waiting for an answer. \"Yes. I - I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver shrugged, put the taxi in gear, and started off into the snowbound traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana thought, What if there is no reservation at the hotel? What if all this is some stupid joke?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Soyuz Hotel was located in a working-class district on the outskirts of Moscow on Levoberezhnaya Street. It was an old, unprepossessing building with brown paint peeling off the exterior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want I wait?\" the driver asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana hesitated for only an instant. \"No.\" She paid the driver, got out of the taxi, and the icy wind pushed her into the small, shabby lobby. An elderly woman sat behind the desk, reading a magazine. She looked up in surprise as Dana entered. Dana walked up to the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Da?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe I have a reservation. Dana Evans.\" She was holding her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman nodded slowly. \"Dana Evans, yes.\" She reached behind her and pulled out a key from a rack. \"Four-oh-two, fourth floor.\" She handed it to Dana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do I register?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman shook her head. \"No register. You pay now. One day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana felt a new sense of alarm. A hotel in Russia where foreigners didn\u0027t have to register? Something was very wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman said, \"Five hundred rubles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to get some money changed,\" Dana said. \"Later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Now. I take dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Dana reached into her purse and took out a handful of bills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman nodded, reached out, and extracted half a dozen of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I could have bought the hotel with that. Dana looked around. \"Where is the elevator?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No elevator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" A porter was obviously out of the question. Dana picked up her bag and started walking up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer room was even worse than she had anticipated. It was small and shabby, the curtains were torn and the bed unmade. How was Boris going to contact her? This could be a hoax, Dana thought, but why would anyone go to this much trouble?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana sat on the edge of the bed and looked out of the unwashed window at the busy street scene below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been a bloody fool, Dana thought. I could be sitting here for days, and nothing\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a soft rap on the door. Dana took a deep breath and stood up. She was either going to solve the mystery now or find out that there was no mystery. Dana walked over to the door and opened it. There was no one in the hallway. On the floor was an envelope. Dana picked it up and carried it inside. The piece of paper inside saidVDNKh 9:00 P. M. Dana stared at it, trying to make sense of it. She opened her suitcase and took out the guidebook she had brought. There it was, VDNKh. The text readUSSR, economic achievements exhibition, and it gave an address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt eight o\u0027clock that evening, Dana hailed a taxi. \"VDNKh. The park?\" She was not sure of her pronunciation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver turned to look at her. \"VDNKh? Everything closed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still go there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver shrugged and the cab leaped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast park was in the northeast section of Moscow. According to the guidebook, the lavish exhibitions had been planned as a monument to Soviet glory, but when the economy fell, funds were cut off, and the park had become a decaying monument to Soviet dogma. The grandiose pavilions were crumbling and the park was deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana stepped out of the taxi and took out a handful of American money. \"Is this - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Da.\"He grabbed the bills and a moment later was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana looked around. She was alone in the freezing, windswept park. She walked to a nearby bench and sat down and waited for Boris. She remembered how she had waited at the zoo for Joan Sinisi. What if Boris\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice from behind Dana startled her. \"Horoshiy vyecherniy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana turned, and her eyes widened in surprise. She had expected Boris Shdanoff. Instead, she was looking at Commissar Sasha Shdanoff. \"Commissar! I didn\u0027t expect - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will follow me,\" he said curtly. Sasha Shdanoff started walking rapidly across the park. Dana hesitated an instant, then got up and hurried after him. He walked into a small, rustic-looking cafe at the edge of the park and took a seat at a back booth. There was only one other couple in the cafe. Dana crossed over to his booth and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slovenly waitress in a soiled apron came up to them. \"Da?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dva cofe, pozhalooysta,\"Shdanoff said. He turned back to Dana. \"I was not sure you would come, but you are very persistent. That can be dangerous sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said in your note you could tell me what I want to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" The coffee arrived. He took a sip, and was silent for a moment. \"You want to know if Taylor Winthrop and his family were murdered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana\u0027s heart began to beat faster. \"Were they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" It came out in an eerie whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana felt a sudden chill. \"Do you know who killed them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised a hand to stop her. \"I will tell you, but first you must do something for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana looked at him and said cautiously, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get me out of Russia. I am no longer safe here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t you just go to the airport and fly away? I understand that foreign travel is no longer forbidden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear Miss Evans, you are naive. Very naive. True, it is not like the old days of communism, but if I were to try what you suggest, they would kill me before I even got close to an airport. The walls still have ears and eyes. I am in great danger. I need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for his words to sink in. Dana looked at him in dismay. \"I can\u0027t get you - I wouldn\u0027t know where to begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must. You must find a way. My life is in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana was thoughtful for a moment. \"I can talk to the American ambassador and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Sasha Shdanoff\u0027s voice was sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s the only way - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your embassy has traitors\u0027 ears. No one must know about this but you and whoever is going to help you. Your ambassador cannot help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana felt suddenly depressed. There was no possible way she could sneak a top Russian commissar out of Russia. I couldn\u0027t sneak a cat out of this country. And she had another thought. This whole thing was probably a ruse. Sasha Shdanoff had no information. He was using her as a means to get to America. This trip had been for nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana said, \"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you, Commissar Shdanoff.\" She got to her feet, furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! You want proof? I will give you proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of proof?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him a long time to answer. When he spoke, he said slowly, \"You are forcing me to do something I have no wish to do.\" He rose. \"You will come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later, they were going up the private back entrance to Sasha Shdanoff\u0027s offices at the Bureau for International Economic Development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could be executed for what I am about to tell you,\" Sasha Shdanoff said when they arrived. \"But I have no choice.\" He made a helpless gesture. \"Because I will be killed if I stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana watched as Shdanoff walked over to a large safe built into the wall. He spun the combination, pulled open the safe, and took out a thick book. He carried it to his desk. On the front of the book it said in red letteringKlassifitsirovann\u0027gy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is highly classified information,\" Commissar Shdanoff told Dana. He opened the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana looked closely as he slowly started to turn the pages. Each page contained color photographs of bombers, space launch vehicles, antiballistic missiles, air-to-surface missiles, automatic weapons, tanks, and submarines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Russia\u0027s complete arsenal.\" It looked enormous, deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At this moment, Russia has more than one thousand intercontinental ballistic missiles, more than two thousand atomic warheads, and seventy strategic bombers.\" He pointed to various weapons as he turned the pages. \"This is the Awl...Acrid...Aphid...Anab...Archer...Our nuclear arsenal rivals that of the United States.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very, very impressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Russian military has grave problems, Miss Evans. We are facing a crisis. There is no money to pay the soldiers, and the morale is very low. The present offers little hope, and the future looks worse, so the military is being forced to turn to the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana said, \"I - I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t understand how this - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Russia was truly a superpower, we built more weapons than even the United States. All those weapons are sitting here now. There are dozens of countries hungry for them. They are worth billions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana said patiently, \"Commissar, I understand the problem, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana looked at him, puzzled. \"No? Then what is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShdanoff chose his next words carefully. \"Have you heard of Krasnoyarsk-26?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana shook her head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not surprised. It is not on any map, and the people who live there do not officially exist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will see. Tomorrow I will take you there. You are to meet me at the same cafe at noon.\" He put his hand on Dana\u0027s arm, squeezing hard. \"You must not tell anyone about this.\" He was hurting her. \"Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orobopeno. It is agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt noon, Dana arrived at the little cafe in VDNKh Park. She walked in and sat at the same booth, waiting. Thirty minutes later Shdanoff had still not appeared. What happens now? she wondered anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dobry dyen.\"Sasha Shdanoff was standing at the booth. \"Come. We must go shopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shopping?\" she asked incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana followed him out into the park. \"Shopping for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShdanoff hailed a taxi and they rode in a strained silence to a mall. They got out of the taxi, and Shdanoff paid the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In here,\" Sasha Shdanoff said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked inside the mall past half a dozen stores. When they came to a shop with a display of provocative, sexy lingerie in the window, Shdanoff stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" He led Dana inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana looked around at the sleazy garments. \"What are we doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are going to change clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA saleslady approached them, and there was a rapid exchange in Russian. The saleslady nodded and a few moments later returned with a hot pink miniskirt and a beribboned, very low-cut blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShdanoff nodded his approval. \"Da.\" He turned to Dana. \"You will put these on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana recoiled. \"No! I\u0027m not going to wear that. What do you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must.\" His voice was firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana thought, The man is some kind of sex maniac. What the devil have I gotten myself into?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShdanoff was watching her. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana took a deep breath. \"All right.\" She went into a tiny dressing room and put the outfit on. When she came out, she looked in a mirror and gasped. \"I look like a whore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Shdanoff informed her. \"We are going to get you some makeup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commissar - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana\u0027s clothes were stuffed into a paper bag. Dana put on her wool coat, trying to hide her outfit as much as possible. They started walking through the mall again. Passersby were staring at Dana, and men were giving her knowing smiles. A workman winked at her. Dana felt degraded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in front of a beauty salon. Sasha Shdanoff went inside. Dana hesitated, then followed him. He walked to the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ano tyomnyj,\"he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beautician showed him a tube of a bright red lipstick and a jar of rouge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Savirshehnstva,\"Shdanoff said. He turned to Dana. \"Put it on. Heavy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana had had enough. \"No, thanks. I don\u0027t know what kind of game you think you\u0027re playing, Commissar, but I\u0027m not going to be a part of it. I\u0027ve had - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes bored into hers. \"I assure you it is not a game, Miss Evans. Krasnoyarsk-26 is a closed city. I am one of the select few with access to it. They allow a very, very few of us outsiders to bring in prostitutes for the day. That is the only possible way I can get you past the guards. That and a case of excellent vodka as payment for your entry. Are you interested or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosed city? Guards? How far are we going with this? \"Yes,\" Dana reluctantly decided. \"I\u0027m interested.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sky-is-falling/page-22.html","bookId":2369,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:17 AM"}
