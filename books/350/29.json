It was a lucky inspiration.

A further investigation showed that Russell was right.

In truth the Scotchman, with his national caution, was rather skeptical as to Tom\u0027s news, and did not suffer himself to become enthusiastic or excited. Tom had hard work to accommodate his impatient steps to the measured pace of his more sedate companion. When at length they reached the spot they found Russell no less impatient.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I thought you would never come,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Tom wanted to fly,\" said Ferguson; \"but I am too old for that.

Do not expect too much, however, and you will guard against possible disappointment.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But there was no disappointment awaiting them. They worked steadily for two weeks, with marvelous results. In this time they unearthed six thousand dollars\u0027 worth of gold, which by arrangement they divided equally between them; and still the gold deposit was far from being exhausted.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the end of the fortnight they were visited by a party of capitalists from San Francisco, who were out on an exploring expedition. They recognized the richness of the new discoveries, and after some negotiation offered the three friends ten thousand dollars for their claims. One consideration decided them to accept. It was absolutely necessary for[Pg 262] them to go to the city for clothing and other articles, of which they stood in imperative need. They closed the bargain and started on their return.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81912.html","bookId":350,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 4:28:28 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 4:28:28 PM"}
