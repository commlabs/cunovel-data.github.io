But he was always just there, at my shoulder, chanting, “Here, pretty pretty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was changing. Intensifying. He was growing bored, or thirsty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to do something. He’d act soon, and I’d need to beat him to it. I stopped short, whirled, and lunged for him, slamming my arm up, until my stake met flesh. The impact reverberated up my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screamed and flew backward. I’d pierced him, but it was lower than his heart. His eyes locked with mine as he pulled the stake from his body and tossed it over the cliff. He smiled at me, and it was chilling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty pretty likes to fight,” he said, and his voice was unexpectedly sultry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the most disturbing thing I’d ever heard. I gritted my teeth, mustering bravado. “Don’t think you can creep me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned at that. “A creep, am I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgust shriveled his features, and he lunged at me. It was too fast. I didn’t have a chance to pull my other stake all the way out. He held me, held my skull crushed between his hands. I fumbled, squirming and fighting against it, but he wrenched it back, exposing my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held my head, but he didn’t have my hands. I clawed at his face. Tore off his glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hissed again, shoving me away, flinching from the daylight. His eyes were pale and red. He squinted at me, staring, raging. No longer did he resemble a predator toying with his meal—he was all fury and retribution and malice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumbled backward, screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth to hiss, and kept his mouth hanging open. Other vampires hid their fangs, or at least tried to create the illusion of humanity. Not this one. This one kept his mouth open, hissing and hissing like a rabid animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d scratched a deep welt on his cheek, and reddish black blood oozed down. He stretched out his tongue, slowly licking his own blood, and it was obscene, almost sexual. I shuddered, watching as his skin healed, slowly knitting together before my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out my other stake, but he flew at me, swatting my hand, sending the bit of wood flying over the ledge. I fell from the impact and scuttled backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stakes were gone, but I still had my stars. I had to hope they’d be good enough. He watched, avid curiosity on his face, as I plucked them from my boot. Seeing the steel stars in my hand, he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore the strangest cockeyed grin as he began to prowl toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw a star. And another. And the third. Two hit; none did any damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin turned dark. He looked hungry, stalking toward me like an eager lover. “What other treasures do you hide, sweet pretty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI backed up, screamed. He backed me against the ledge. I hated how I screamed. But this was it. I had nowhere else to go. The end. My screams filled my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire bent down to me. Cold, bony fingers threaded through my hair, so gently. But then he pulled, yanking me to standing. I yelped with the shocking pain of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They all scream,” he said angrily. He wrenched my neck back, locking his eyes with mine, and I was instantly lost. “Silence,” he whispered, and the words came to me as though through a tunnel. Those pale red irises became my gravity, sucking me toward him, in and down. “Yes,” he cooed, sounding so pleased. “Yessss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut my eyes, waiting for it. Waiting to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shout cleared my head. A “No” growled so fiercely, it pierced my consciousness. “No,” bellowed in a voice deep enough to reverberate through me. Shaking me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exploded to life, wriggling and scratching and fighting. This thing wouldn’t kill me. Not today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Carden shouted again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as fingers appeared around the rogue vampire’s neck. I watched Carden, and his fury had altered his face to some other thing, some powerful, savage force I hadn’t seen before. He grabbed harder, and harder still, until his fingertips disappeared into the vampire’s flesh. He grasped the rogue’s neck and lifted him off the ground. Flung him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire landed hard and bounced, but then he was up again, swooshing right back to Carden, swinging at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Carden had seen it coming, and as he ducked, he reached back and swung. His arm arced wide, his fist slamming into the vampire. The creature flew backward, off the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clung to the ledge not to fall. “How did—” I began breathlessly, but Carden jumped after the rogue, disappearing before I could sputter a thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI skittered down the hill after him, gathering up a stake and a star as I went. I didn’t have time to find the other weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid down, and something punched me from the side as I landed. The world went black for a moment. I came to and found myself restrained. The rogue held me. I flailed, struggled, and kicked, but those hands only clawed more tightly into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This one is mine,” the thing said to Carden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Carden’s approach, footfalls in the sand. But this time the creature was ready, and he hauled his arm back and punched Carden, sending him flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire curled over me, hugging me. “Time to die, pretty. Are you ready?” His whole body enveloped mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was unable to move. I felt his breath on my neck. I forced my eyes to look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Carden? I was frantic to find him. I’d see Carden as I died—I’d have Carden be the last sight I saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I found him—he was running back toward us. Running back for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden, who’d somehow gotten free of his dungeon. Carden, who could’ve left me—he could’ve fled the island—but we were in this together, and he was running toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime slowed. He ran at us, his focus only on the vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I had an idea, and the moment the thought came to me, his eyes flashed to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still held a stake in my hand. I reached my arm back to toss it in the same instant Carden opened his hands to catch. It was as though we were one being, having the same thought at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw. Carden caught. And he staked the vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature released me, shrieking a cry so piercing, I had to clap my hands over my ears. I stumbled backward as he turned black, shriveling and sizzling before my eyes, howling and screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he was dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy knees gave way, but Carden was there, and suddenly I was in his arms. He carried me to the water’s edge and gently put me down. I saw I was covered in gore and leaned over to splash my hands, my face. But I was shaking too badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden stilled me. “Hush,” he said, cupping water and sloughing the blood from my arms. He worked down to my hands, tenderly rubbing circles over them until I was clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stood, his eyes were on me, bleak and relieved both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard you,” he said. “I heard your screams as though they were in my own head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell into him, crumpling into his arms. “Did they let you out? I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at him, and finally I registered his injuries, huge bands scored into his wrists, deep scrapes along his hands. I gently took one of those hands in mine. The wounds were healing quickly, but I saw how deep they’d been. How bloody. I gently rubbed away the flaking blood to reveal fresh skin, looking so angry and red beneath. “What did you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A man can do much when driven.” He took my face in his hands. “There is no chain that can keep me from you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d known I was in trouble. He’d come for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden had told me of his Druid ancestry, but it was then I saw firsthand how my Scottish vampire had abilities and powers that made him a threat to Alcántara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come, sweet. We must go back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will this”—I nodded to the pile of ash—“will he be enough to clear your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, more than enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a weak smile. “Ding-dong, the witch is dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped an easy arm around my shoulders. “As you say, you peculiar, wee thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the pile of blackened dust and grew serious. “How will we prove there even was a rogue vampire? How will they know we’re not lying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent and picked up the vampire’s sunglasses. “These.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is our proof?” I took them from him, studying them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This vampire was too old to go out in daylight. The Directorate will see these and know the meaning. Perhaps they’ll even recognize them. Either way, they’ll guess he was here, if they didn’t know already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They must’ve known,” I said. “Somebody did. That guy was way too clean to be completely rogue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My thoughts exactly.” He took the glasses back and pocketed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walked back to campus, I mused, “Why don’t more vampires wear sunglasses? Seems like a clever way to get around light sensitivity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simple. One cannot hypnotize one’s prey when one’s eyes are concealed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” I gazed up at him, staring at his profile, trying to make sense of it all. My thoughts drifted to Ronan, who’d used his own hypnotic powers to get me onto this island. “Did you ever want to hypnotize me? Did you ever try?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped short, looking amused by the notion. “Now, where’s the pleasure in that?” He cupped my cheek, and his next words were spoken low and husky, bringing all sorts of sexy implications to mind. “Seems I’ve been able to convince you to do things without resorting to trickery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat, feeling a blush rise to my face. “Seems so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe returned to campus and blamed the deaths on the vampire. All the deaths, even Masha’s, and it was just as well. I was a lousy liar, and a half-truth would be easier to maintain than pretending I hadn’t seen her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody questioned how Carden had known so many girls were under attack, how he’d sensed he was needed enough to break free and act as rescuer. The vampires weren’t surprised, and it wasn’t because they’d detected our bond. There was something about Carden that made him more powerful than the others, and powerful was dangerous. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-fever-the-watchers-3/page-38.html","bookId":2293,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:38 PM"}
