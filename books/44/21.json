{"id":1213,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"THE END OF THE WORLD was nigh, and Demora Sulu knew beyond any doubt that she was going to die alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Janice wasn\u0027t there with her. This, in and of itself, was nothing unusual. Rand\u0027s days had been more busy lately since she\u0027d been transferred to Starfleet Command. It had meant longer hours, but a step up in responsibility. And she did usually get home while Demora was still awake; indeed, oftentimes Demora would have dinner waiting for her. The situation made Janice laugh occasionally as she wondered just exactly who was supposed to be taking care of whom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Janice hadn\u0027t been home for nearly sixteen hours, and Demora … along with everyone else on the planet … was painfully aware why.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pictures of the Probe had been broadcast across all Earth bands. Demora had had trouble taking it seriously at first; it reminded her of nothing so much as a giant pecan log. \"Give me a fork and a really big glass of milk, I can take care of that thing no problem at all,\" she\u0027d said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there were no jokes now, no amused observations. No safety.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No hope.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It had drawn closer and closer to Earth, its reason a complete puzzlement. It didn\u0027t seem to want to destroy anything. On the other hand, it didn\u0027t seem inclined not to destroy anything. It just … was. Speculation was that it seemed to be searching for someone or something, although Demora was damned if she could figure out what it was. In that respect, the Probe was like a small child tearing apart a room while searching for something. Even if the object (whatever it was) was eventually located, the result was a trashed room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Earth was on the verge of becoming a trashed planet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She couldn\u0027t see it in the skies overhead, for it hung above the Earth\u0027s atmosphere. But she felt as if she could sense it. Sense its presence, its power. She heard it screech with a noise that chilled her. In response, the Earth seemed determined to tear itself apart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Janice Rand, Demora knew, was busy coordinating Earth\u0027s emergency operations at Starfleet Command. A fat lot of good that was going to do. The Probe couldn\u0027t be slowed down or stopped. It was like a force of nature, and confronting it was like standing on a shoreline and spitting at an incoming tidal wave.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora hadn\u0027t wanted to die in Janice\u0027s apartment. Because when all was said and done—despite it having been Demora\u0027s place of residence for three months—it was still Janice\u0027s apartment. She wanted her home. She wanted to be in her place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So that was where she had headed. It hadn\u0027t made tremendous sense when viewed with a dispassionate frame of mind. She was leaving one apartment to brave the wind, the rain, the trembling of the Earth\u0027s crust beneath her feet, all for the purpose of getting to … another apartment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The only thing it accomplished was making her feel—rightly or wrongly—that she was doing something. Making some sort of headway, indulging in some sort of activity that was, ultimately, preferable to simply waiting around for the end. If (when) she died, at least she could say to herself, \"I didn\u0027t die in someone else\u0027s home … I died in my own.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was cold comfort, but when your planet was being shaken apart by a lethal probe, you took what you could get.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She went to the bay window and looked out. In the distance was the Golden Gate Bridge. She could see the waves crashing against it, getting higher and higher, and it seemed only a matter of time before the entire span came crashing down. And there she stood, helpless and alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And all she could think about was her father.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Part of her was relieved for him. She knew the trajectory of the Probe very well from the news reports, and was aware that it had passed nowhere near Vulcan. So he was safe. Hiding away in exile, with the Federation Council making pronouncements against him and his friends, and now they were going to have the last laugh. His accusers were trapped on Earth, and he was high and dry on an alien world. He was going to survive and, after all, what good was served if both of them died?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the other part hated him. Hated him with a passion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked at the photographs and representations of his ancestors … hers, too, of course. They stared at her with varying degrees of sullenness and inscrutability, and she felt a rage building up inside her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All that talk about honor. About family. About commitment. And in the end, in the final analysis, what had it meant? What had any of it meant?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Damn you,\" she whispered, and then she practically screamed, \"Damn you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She ran to the wall and, her fingers curved into claws, she ripped at the pictures. She tore them off the wall, sending them flying everywhere. Her heart pounded against her ribs, and she yanked so violently that she sent herself tumbling over a chair and crashing to the floor. She lay there curled up, sobbing, feeling like a child again as she tore at the shag carpet with her fingernails.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You abandoned me, you son of a bitch!\" she howled, even though her voice couldn\u0027t even be heard above the crashing of the water outside. Rain was pouring down in torrents. It was becoming impossible to see anything at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes, abandoned her. Run off on an insane, criminal mission to help Spock. And he hadn\u0027t said anything to her about it, not a damned thing. He\u0027d sat there, cool as a cucumber on what now appeared to have been the last night they\u0027d ever spend together, and the most deeply moving thing he\u0027d said to her was \"Pass the rice.\" Hadn\u0027t said boo to her. Hadn\u0027t whispered a word of what he was going to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Because he still considered her a child. Still considered her \"not worthy\" somehow. That was it, of course. Four damned years ago, and he was still angry at her. She couldn\u0027t believe it. She was never going to live up to what he wanted, never be what he wanted her to be. Because he didn\u0027t want her to be human. It\u0027s just like that landscaper—Booby, or whatever the hell his name was. It was just like he\u0027d said. She was human and she screwed up, but her father didn\u0027t expect her to be human. He expected her to be this … this perfect little thing, this robot, wind her up, set her loose, and watch her never do a single thing wrong and flawlessly live up to some code of honor that was centuries old and as cold and unforgiving as the water pounding outside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So he hadn\u0027t trusted her, and he\u0027d abandoned her without caring if he\u0027d ever see her again. And he was off on Vulcan probably laughing his ass off while the entire world sank under the most cataclysmic flood since Noah had looked skyward and remarked that it looked like showers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She heard the Probe, getting louder and louder. It was the only noise that managed to surpass the unbridled fury of the storm outside. There was a deafening screech over and over, and she screamed, \"Shut up! Shut up! Just kill us already and get it over with, okay?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The wind bashed against the bay window. It shattered, pieces flying everywhere. Demora was positioned behind a couch as it so happened, and that\u0027s what saved her life. Shards embedded themselves in the cushion, and a few landed in her hair. If she\u0027d still been standing in front of the window, she would have been dead instantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The wind howled through the apartment, knocking over all the contents. Swords fell off the walls, antique guns went tumbling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was it. She knew this was it. And she seized upon the mostly demented notion that if she was going to die, then she was going to go down fighting. It didn\u0027t matter that the enemy was a soulless Probe orbiting the Earth … or the wind blasting her backward. It didn\u0027t matter that there was no thinking entity to combat, no villain to triumph over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She would fight against death itself. She would fight against all the anger, all the disappointment in her life, all the fear that threatened to overwhelm her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She crawled across the floor and grabbed a samurai sword, one that her father had told her once belonged to a great samurai ancestor. She imagined that she could feel strength flowing through the hilt. Her grip on it alone was enough to empower her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She pulled it from its scabbard, and the scrape of metal was oddly satisfying. Then Demora staggered to her feet, the blade poised. She stood facing the window, staggering from the power of the gale.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Never in her life had she felt so completely melodramatic. But what the hell. There was no one else around. She was about to die, and if she was going to go, then let it be with some style.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You want me?\" she shouted at Death, waving her sword in the wind. \"Come and get me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then she saw it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Death, streaking through the sky in the shape of a great dark bird. It was as if no doubt was being left. Death had made itself visible to the people of Earth, its massive wings moving slowly, like a massive bird of prey… .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bird of …\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wait a minute … what the hell?\" Her eyes narrowed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was. It was a Klingon bird-of-prey. But what the hell was it doing here? The entire Klingon contingent had stormed out of the Federation Council and left Earth a couple of days ago. It had been on all the news. The ambassador and delegation had withdrawn in a snit because the UFP hadn\u0027t honored their demands for Kirk\u0027s head on a silver platter. At the time no one had doubted that, sooner or later, the Klingons would return, if for no other reason than to harass the council some more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there was no way that they would have chosen now to return. Nor could it have been by accident: A planetary distress signal had gone out, warning away anyone who might even think about heading toward Earth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yet here was a Klingon bird-of-prey, big as life, twice as ugly, crashing into the surging water beneath the Golden Gate Bridge, disappearing in the clouds and blasts of rain that were everywhere in this moment of ultimate cataclysm. Who in hell would be so totally devoid of sanity—or, perhaps, of fear—that they would pilot a warship directly into the heart of the storm, facing certain death and …\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, my God,\" she whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They—Dad, Kirk, and the others—they had stolen a Klingon bird-of-prey. That was one of the things the ambassador had complained about, according to news reports as the facts of the entire affair had come to light.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was her father.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He\u0027d come home to die with her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tears ran down her face as she thought, That is so sweet. . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Long minutes passed, during which time an odd calm descended on her. She watched the clouds rolling, watched the waves leaping ever higher, and yet there was a certain … rightness about it all. She\u0027d found an inner peace, although her hands were gripping the hilt of the sword so tightly that her knuckles had turned white.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was all going to come to a head within the next seconds, she was certain of that. What would happen? Would a giant wave crash into the building? Would the Earth simply open and swallow them? Would a beam of force blast them to bits?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was so calm, she realized she didn\u0027t even have to wait to find out. Her father, in a final display of honor and integrity, had been willing to perform a final suicidal act rather than outlive his native planet. Perhaps it was an example that she should have the bravery to emulate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She reversed the sword, put it to her chest, gripping it firmly and taking a deep breath. She tried to find the strength and resolve to drive it home. It was becoming easier and easier for her to concentrate on her intention, thanks to the wind dying down and …\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dying down?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Startled at the realization, she looked out the window and couldn\u0027t believe what she was seeing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The storm clouds were blowing out to sea. It was as if someone had taken a vid of it and started rolling it backward. The Pacific was smoothing out, the waves lapping around the supports of the Golden Gate descending to their normal height. Demora watched the phenomenon with growing incredulity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sun was coming out. And high above, she saw a shuttle angling around and descending toward where the Klingon bird-of-prey had gone into the drink.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Within five minutes of the arrival of the bird-of-prey, the impending armageddon was not only no longer impending … it was, in fact, history.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What happened?\" she wondered out loud.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What happened was, we were cleared.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was Hikaru Sulu\u0027s first meal home in three months, and the events leading up to it had been nothing short of impressive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Demora hadn\u0027t had a chance to see him at first. The shuttle that had plucked Sulu and the others from the water had brought them straight to Starfleet Headquarters. Suspecting that that\u0027s where they would be, Demora had headed straight over there. Her efforts to get in to see her father had been herculean. She\u0027d tried every possible means of ingress, tried to talk her way past more guards than she would have believed conceivable. She offered every excuse, up to and including that she was dying and only had a very short time to live. (\"Bring a doctor\u0027s note,\" one amused guard instructed.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e None of it had worked. Despite Demora\u0027s best tries, the Enterprise seven had been kept under wraps. The only ones who might have gotten in to see them were legal counsel, but the accused had all refused the option (Scotty had been the most outspoken about that: \"Lawyers. As if we dinna have enough problems\"), until the council of the UFP had been able to convene and discuss the situation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The outcome of that discussion had been made public. It had been less than an hour ago when the renegades from the Enterprise had faced the council in closed session. Then the session had ended and the outlaws-turned-heroes had separated to return to home and loved ones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Sulu had walked in, Demora had been waiting for him. She\u0027d made desperate endeavors to clean up the apartment, but there were still many signs of the damage that the storm had wreaked. Sulu hadn\u0027t cared, however. His booted feet had crunched on the broken glass in the carpet as he walked quickly to his daughter and embraced her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you miss me?\" he asked her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, did you go somewhere?\" she replied with her typical breeziness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now they sat at the hastily cobbled-together dinner that Demora had managed to prepare for them. Many systems were still out of whack. It was going to take some time for everything to be restored to normal. Sulu made a point of saying that he didn\u0027t care, that being with her was all that mattered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They said that due to \u0027extenuating circumstances,\u0027 they were forgiving us our transgressions, basically,\" Sulu explained to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The circumstances being that you saved the Earth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027d have to say that\u0027s correct. The only one they came down on was the admiral … and they busted him back to captain.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She winced. \"That must have hurt.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not really. Between you and me, I don\u0027t think he was ever really happy as an admiral. As captain, he can—and will—be back in command of a starship. That\u0027s where he belongs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"From everything you\u0027ve said about him, I\u0027d have to agree. Of course, the Klingons are still angry with him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"True enough,\" Sulu agreed, twirling thin noodles onto his fork.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not a problem,\" said Demora. \"All he has to do is save the Klingons from some big catastrophe, and then they\u0027ll forgive him, too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Part of me wants to say that that\u0027s too absurd for words,\" Sulu said. \"On the other hand, I\u0027ve learned never to underestimate the adm … the captain.\" He sighed and looked around the apartment. \"My my, what a mess.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know. The storm was kind of hard on it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He glanced at the far wall. \"Even knocked down all the pictures of my family.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh yes,\" she said quickly. \"It was vicious. Just everything came down.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, you did your best.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dad … I have to tell you something …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He waited, eyebrows raised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When I saw your ship … I thought that that was going to be it for you. That there was no way you could possibly …\" Her voice trailed off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, come now, Demy,\" he chided her. \"You should have more faith. I was at the helm, remember. It was my job to bring her in safely. I\u0027m a helmsman, not a kamikaze. We came plowing into that bay with a plan and a crew to pull it off. I don\u0027t dispute that it was tricky, but believe you me, Demy … and you never have to worry about this … one thing I most definitely am not is suicidal.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said it with amusement in his voice. Laughing at the concept. Laughing at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sure, now, in the light of calm skies and the ebbing of her fears, it seemed laughable enough. But not at the time. Not only that, but her faulty reasoning had almost …\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e … almost …\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, of course you\u0027re not suicidal, Dad. I wouldn\u0027t even suggest such a thing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her fork dangled over the noodles. There was so much she wanted to say. So much that angered her, frustrated her, frightened her. So many unresolved sentiments that had been brought to the surface by Sulu\u0027s long absence. She wanted to bring it up, but she didn\u0027t even know where to begin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Janice treated you well, I assume,\" said Sulu.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh yes.\" She nodded. \"Yes, very well.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good,\" said Sulu. He reached over and patted her hand. \"I knew I could count on her. Just like I knew I could count on you to be a grown-up. You\u0027re getting so big, Demy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thanks, Dad.\" She cleared her throat. \"And it\u0027s … it\u0027s great to have you home. I can\u0027t begin to tell you how. And there\u0027s a lot I\u0027d—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The front door chimed. Demora started to rise, but Sulu said, \"No, no, I\u0027ll get it.\" He went to the door as Demora remained in her seat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chekov walked in, brimming with excitement. \"Now\" was all he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu looked surprised. \"Now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now. Ve\u0027re to report to the spacedock shuttle immediately. I vould have called ahead, but comm is still out in this section of town.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s going on?\" Demora asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chekov crossed quickly to her and kissed her on the cheek. \"Good to see you again, darling. Vat a mess, eh?\" He turned back to Sulu. \"So? Vat are you vaiting for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Despite Chekov\u0027s acknowledgment of her presence, she still felt as if she were invisible. \"Excuse me. He just got back. Dad, you just got back… .\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He paused, and then took her by the hands. \"Demy … I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t be for too long.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What \u0027it\u0027? What\u0027s going on?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027re putting the captain back in charge of a starship. I told you that. Taking a guess, the Excelsior. And we\u0027re going to be his command crew … just for the shakedown cruise, that\u0027s all. I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t be for too long.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She stared at him and thought, How can you be so sure? The moment you get out there, anything can happen at any moment. Isn\u0027t that what you\u0027ve always said? Another probe, another madman, another threat … and it\u0027ll be another three months? A year? Five? You just came back!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He squeezed her hand tightly and said, \"Demy … if you have a problem with it …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But she could see it in his eyes. He didn\u0027t want her to say anything unless it was approval. He didn\u0027t want to hear everything that was going through her mind, not really.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And she knew, right then. Knew that all her suspicions, all her guilt since she was a kid, was justified. Given a choice between her and the stars, there was simply no contest. He was meant to be a creature in flight and ever since she had first shown up, she\u0027d handicapped him. He\u0027d been a crippled, wretched bird flapping around, as destined for a crash as that Klingon bird-of-prey had been. It was all her fault, and the guilt and self-recrimination hardened into a wall surrounding her heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And at that moment she swore herself an oath … that she would never again say or do anything to hamper him. Here was a man who had just helped save the Earth. Save the Earth, for God\u0027s sake. And she was going to start trying to tie him down again? To heap guilt on him, make him feel he owed her something? She saw the excitement in his eyes over the prospect of getting right back out there again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e More: She saw the future. Suddenly it revealed itself to her, clear as the new day that had dawned on the salvaged Earth. The explorer, the space adventurer within Hikaru Sulu had reawoken with a ferocious appetite. The years with her had been wasted ones. All the times he\u0027d commented that saddling James Kirk with a teaching job was a waste of material, he could just as easily have been saying that about himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He would pursue more adventures, she knew that now. She saw him at the helm of a ship … hell, she saw him in a command chair. Fulfiling a destiny that had been sidetracked by the unexpected addition of a young girl. Sulu was meant to save planets, not be tied down to one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And she would follow him. She would. Within two years she\u0027d be eligible to enroll at Starfleet Academy. The final frontier pulled at her just as it did her father. Even more strongly, in fact, because joining Starfleet would enable her to become the only thing that he could ever respect: someone just like him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s okay, Dad,\" she said, in the greatest acting performance of her life. \"Really. It\u0027s okay. I\u0027m not a kid anymore, like you said. If there\u0027s any problems, I\u0027ve got Janice as back-up, but hey … gotta start being independent sometime. And after everything you\u0027ve been through … you deserve it. Go. I\u0027ll be here when you get back. Hell, if you\u0027re gone long enough, I\u0027ll be through the Academy and be coming out after you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Despite her resolve, just for a moment, she desperately wanted him to see through it. To validate for her their years together. To say, Don\u0027t be ridiculous. We could so easily have lost each other forever. I\u0027m going to stay with you right here, by your side, and we\u0027re going to talk and heal our relationship and …\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He held her tightly. \"I knew you\u0027d understand,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She smiled gamely. \"Hey, what are daughters for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then it was another hug, a quick kiss, a hurried farewell, and he and Chekov were out the door. Demora sat at the table for a long time after that, staring at the cooling bowl of noodles. Then, of their own volition it seemed, Demora\u0027s hands reached out, grabbed the bowl, and hurled it against the wall. The bowl shattered, noodles all over the wall and sliding down it in a large smear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a mess. But then again, what was one more mess in her life … more or less.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939/28437.html","bookId":44,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:55:23 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:55:23 AM"}
