I take it and swallow. The touch is a million times better than I thought it would be but I\u0027m still scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drags me to the small hotel. He climbs the stairs and produces a key. I\u0027m not even slightly surprised when he opens the door to my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Corrupt third world countries.\" I mutter. He closes the door and presses his back into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to jump on him but I have a slight twinge in my belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did I say when I left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said don’t go anywhere without your brothers and Stuart and not to leave Chicago or Boston. Did you misunderstand my words?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step forward on my tiptoes and press my sandy, salty lips against him. He doesn’t kiss back. I speak into his lips, \"You are not the boss of me. If you can gallivant in South America, then so can I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has me in his arms instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You scared me.\" He whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Ditto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls me back, \"We are leaving in an hour. I have flights booked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"You\u0027re leaving the missionaries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"Not exactly. We never made it to our last destination. There is a sickness. All tourists are being sent home unless they have medical experience. I do not. Pack your bags. We leave as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to pull his clothes off, but the idea of the sand and the dirt is a huge turn off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss his lips once more and pack my stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to your parents house. I confessed it was me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks concerned, \"They knew that already. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need absolution from God for my sin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls his eyes, \"You don’t get to pick and chose how religious you are. You never go to church. Why need absolution over that? It wasn’t your fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my stuff and walk to him, \"I just needed to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were they cruel to you?\" His eyes are hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost flinch, \"God no. They were perfectly polite. Hugged me once even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock lifts his eyebrows up before he can catch himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They told me about the center.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows, \"Did they?\" His eyes cool off again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. I put a hand out, it\u0027s so creamy white against his dark face. \"I needed to hold you and make sure you were okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses my palm, almost making me gag. He smiles, \"I have you. I\u0027ll always be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to now I was wrong. You don\u0027t need to live here and be grateful because it was so cushy and easy for you growing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twitches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My life was easier than yours. There is no doubt. Those nuns loved me way more than those people loved you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licks his lips and shakes his head, \"It doesn’t matter. I am grateful. I see what we have and I found you and I trust that you\u0027re going to be okay. Coming here made me see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Eli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses my lips softly, \"I am grateful for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and open the door. He grabs my arm and pulls me into his embrace. I close my eyes and it\u0027s perfection. The kiss is needy and desperate but it\u0027s closed mouth. It\u0027s the words we don\u0027t say. Words like I needed you more than anything in the entire world and here you are. It\u0027s the sentences neither of us can say. Neither of us likes grand gestures or big words. But the kiss says it all, the desperate tremble of his fears against mine, speak volumes compared to the words we may or may not be able to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it breaks he whispers, \"Let\u0027s go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know where he is. It was his stupid idea to move into together. I look out over the snow and in the window and grimace at the first snowfall of the year. I look around and wonder where he is. I rode the elevator alone, carried the groceries to the kitchen by myself and put them away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the couch for ten-minutes waiting for him to attack me savagely, but he never graced me with his presence. I sit down and tap my finger against the sofa and remind myself of Dr. Bradley. I stop and look around, sighing, annoyed. I get up and walk down the hallway to have a bath. I hear something that makes me stop. It\u0027s in the bedroom at the far end of the hall. The one I made him put a lock on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart pounds, excitement and terror take up equal amounts of space. The hair on my head even tingles. I shudder and slip my boots off. I tiptoe to the end of the hallway to the large door. I swallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and turn the knob. It\u0027s locked. I drop to my knees as a new terror begins to creep in. What if he isn’t alone? Is that a possibility that I have not ever considered out of foolish naivety? I place my fingers around the cold knob and peer into the keyhole on the wooden door. He insisted on it being an old fashioned key, an intricate looking one that would look like it belonged on the boudoir of a man and his mistress. I roll my eyes thinking about the way he said it, all pretentious and ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, however, I\u0027m grateful he\u0027s a snobby bastard. I\u0027m trying desperately to control my breathing as my mother\u0027s words about him loving me more than anything in the world are flashing through my mind. I blink in front of the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jump and scream when I see his eye, also peeking through the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door is unlocked and opened. He has the wickedly cocky smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spying on me? Really? Are you so insecure?\" I frown. He\u0027s in that mood. I want to argue, I know what that will entail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps to the side, leaving me just enough room to enter. I walk past him with my head high in the air. He loosens his tie and rolls his sleeves up. I catch a glimpse of his tats and scars. I lick my lips and forget about the bath. He closes the door, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks to the corner and sits in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s in luck. I had planned on us having savage sex in the living room. Mostly because he refuses to do it anywhere but a bed, but I\u0027ve been working on my seduction. Today I came prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unzip my jacket and let it drop to the floor. It\u0027s the only sound in the room. I pull my ponytail out and shake my head back and forth. Walking closer to the bed I undo one button on my blouse. I turn and face him as I slowly get the others. His mouth opens when he sees what\u0027s underneath. He\u0027s shocked. I like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite my lip and shoulder out of the blouse. I\u0027m wearing a strapless white bustier with a lot of push up. Maintaining eye contact with him, I undo my jeans. I turn around and pull them down, bending over completely. I have on ruffled white underwear that matches the bustier. His head tilts slightly as he watches, making a sliver of a smile grace my lips. I stand up and turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks flabbergasted. I have a small mental dance party and turn around. I bend over the bed and wait for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I hear him get up I brace for the hand on my ass. He\u0027s rushed from the unexpected aspects of this and not grabbed a paddle or hairbrush from the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I get surprises me. His warm lips press against my left ass cheek. His hands slide up and down my thigh. It\u0027s nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about to beg, he likes it when I beg, when he pulls his face away and his hand makes contact with my right cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moan into the bedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like that don’t you? You thought I was going to go easy on you because you wore pretty underwear?\" He slaps in the same spot. I writhe and mouth breathe into the blankets. \"What you didn’t know, is I like you in your cotton underwear. I like you that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do know that. I know how he feels about slutty underwear. I grin as his hand makes contact once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want to dress that way. I can treat you that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bury my face to hide the smile crossing my lips as I hear the buckle of his pants. He spreads my legs with his and slides my underwear to the side. His fingers slide up and down me, soaking in the moisture. He plunges a finger in, making a gasp rip from my parted lips. His body bends over mine as his finger plunges in and out. He grabs my shoulder and pulls me back a bit, arching my back more. He\u0027s pumping in and out and I\u0027m clawing at the bed. I pull away before I orgasm, making him chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the orgasm you want baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rips the panties off me, making me a bit sad momentarily. They cost a small fortune and matched the bustier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s between my thighs and pulling my butt into him. He rubs himself up and down me, before slipping only the tip in. I try to push back, to get more, but he doesn’t let me. He slowly enters, not rough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will come when I let you.\" He growls. He bends and kisses my back softly. He knows how much I hate soft slow sex. I clench my jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rams me once hard and fast. I cry out but then he slows again. He\u0027s driving me insane with the inconsistent thrusts. I\u0027m ready to knock him out and ride him my way. He slides his hand up my back, massaging and rubbing. He is thrusting slowly and evenly. His hand slides up the back of my head. He grabs a fist full of hair, right in the sweet spot and pulls my head back. Then he starts to buck, the right way. He\u0027s slamming me and pulling my hair like a savage. I\u0027m crying out and clenching him. I orgasm as he growls, \"You like it that way, don’t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moans as my clenching and squeezing forces his orgasm. He collapses on my back and kisses it softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe roll up into the bed and lie there for a minute, trying to catch our breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strokes my head and looks at me, \"What time are you going to the rings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk. There is no weird pillow talk and no pretending we\u0027re soft delicate people. No apologies, limits yes, but no shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up at him, \"I\u0027m meeting Angelo at seven. We\u0027re going to try to get as many places involved as we can. The program is looking like it will go ahead. Self-defense classes for free for every girl on Saturday afternoons. Angelo is cool with teaching it as long as he gets to kick my ass the whole time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arches an eyebrow, \"Yeah that\u0027s realistic. Stuart picking you up?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-46.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
