If Lin Ming had been holding the dark purple elastic iron spear, then this sword would have already pierced straight through the spear shaft!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming only felt an unrivaled sharp strength vigorously transmit through him, and his body flew back in the air. He tumbled backwards for several dozens of feet before using his own strength to hold himself down, but the blood in his chest was still roiling from the impact.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSo strong!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming could not help but acknowledge that even though Zhang Guanyu’s true essence was impure, his strength was utterly dreadful!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That slender sword bent a heavy spear. His sword was flooded with true essence, and with that irresistible strength, that sword forced me back so much.

He said, “Lin Ming, I told you that I already saw through you ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’! As long as I concentrate my true essence into a thin shape, I can use it to pierce through your vibrating true essence, and expose your weakness!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Expose my weakness?” Lin Ming smiled. This move might be somewhat useful to deal with the original ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’, but against ‘Flow like Silk’, it was pointless. The total wisdom of the Realm of the Gods had accumulated for countless millennia and repeatedly tempered into the ‘Chaotic Virtues Combat Meridians’; how could it be something that someone as insignificant like Zhang Guanyu could break?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, resign yourself to fate. Today, I will end the myth of your genius!” Zhang Guanyu howled like a depraved beast. The sword in his hand began to emit a keening wail, as if there were countless ghosts circling around the blade.

It was a demonic art that belonged to the path of evil. This so called demonic art was one that was filled with heretical and diabolical ways. For instance using women, devouring, going berserk, these were all methods in order to increase one’s strength and cultivation in a short time. It was easy for this cultivation method to cause one to be taken over by their darkest obsessions as if they were possessed by the devil. The sword would become slanted, and the style was insidious beyond measure; it could even cause damage to oneself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ‘Life Severing Dead Bone Blade’ was a sword move that released countless wronged spirits. Once this blade stabbed into its enemy, their true essence would be reversed, and it could absorb their flesh and blood life essence. If one’s cultivation was poor, then with a stab of the sword, it could even turn an enemy into bleached bones!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven a martial artist at a high cultivation who had thick true essence would suffer a miserable fate if they were stabbed by this sword. Their body would lose much of their inner vitality, and it would cause the body to atrophy and wither away. The meridians, muscles, and tendons would all be wasted away, until they were finally turned into a disabled vegetable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis kind of disability could only be cured by the rare material Human Lifedeath Boneflesh. Otherwise, it was simply impossible to cure. And this kind of rare material treasure was actually not something that a large sect like the Seven Profound Valleys could even make!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf one were to be struck by this ‘Life Severing Dead Bone Blade’, then their entire life’s martial arts cultivation would be half wiped out, or even completely ruined.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, although this ‘Life Severing Dead Bone Blade’ was a perverse and malefic move, one could not freely use it. This sword move would cause whoever used it to have their mind and soul eroded by the unjust ghosts, and it would cause their personality to turn to chaos, until they finally became a mind-touched devil.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This Zhang Guanyu is truly black hearted; he would actually dare to use this move. He is determined to destroy Lin Ming.” Qin Xingxuan was a core disciple of the Seven Profound Valleys, so she understood what effect the ‘Life Severing Dead Bone Blade’ had.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen she said this, Wang Yuhan’s heart suddenly painfully clenched. Lin Ming’s ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’ had already been suppressed. How would he confront this ‘Life Severing Dead Bone Blade’?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eZhang Guanyu’s sword had not even thrust out, yet Lin Ming could already feel a chilly wind blowing at him. This icy wind seemed to turn into a mass of aggrieved souls that wrapped around his hands and feet, suddenly slowing down Lin Ming’s movements.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming frowned. “Ah? This sword move can actually affect my movements?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha! This is my strongest move; it is impossible for you to hide!” Zhang Guanyu let loose a demented cackle. His handsome face had already been completely twisted from before, and now it was just a mockery of a human. Countless ghosts emerged from Zhang Guanyu’s body. His hair was completely loose and blown up by the chilling breeze. Like this, he seemed to have wholly become a demon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Don’t worry; I will let you keep your life!” Zhang Guanyu cried out like a evil monster, and his sword thrust towards Lin Ming. Those myriad ghosts condensed onto Zhang Guanyu’s sword, and the sword blade completely turned white like bleached bones. It was as if Zhang Guanyu was not holding a sword in his hand, but a white bone!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeeing this sword thrust reflected in his eyes, Lin Ming let loose a roar. True essence began to rapidly circulate throughout his body, and the Heretical God Seed in Lin Ming’s heart began to issue forth a blazing light. The highly compressed true essence scattered outwards and rushed into Lin Ming’s body and blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘Heretical God Force’ – open!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe first layer of the ‘Heretical God Force’ could instantly increase one’s strength and true essence by 50%. In addition to the increased power from the ‘Strife Seal’, Lin Ming only felt his entire body blazing with fighting spirit!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot only that, but all the accumulated momentum from his previous collisions with Zhang Guanyu instantly erupted at once. His spear thrust out and swept away the world!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs his unstoppable momentum burst forth, all the haunting ghosts that had affected his speed were blown away without a trace. Lin Ming was instantly restored to his peak speed. However, he did not intend to hide. His body contained a raging war-like thirst. He was like a volcano that had reached the critical point; he must erupt!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I’ll let you see, the true ‘Flow like Silk’! —“\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Flood Dragon Goes to Sea!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s spear flew forwards. With a loud explosion, the ground underneath his feet completely ruptured. The cracks spread like an ever widening spider web.
