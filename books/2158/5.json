Oh, how we laughed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was cruel.\" She touched his cheek and felt the beginning of his dark stubble. It was late but she did not feel sleepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose it was cruel. But when the twitch came, I knew it. I had never felt such a thing before. I was surprised by it, too, because knowing it then, I knew it had been there all along. It was familiar. It was my Truthsense twitching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she could feel Truthsense stirring within herself. The feeling of wonder in his voice aroused something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was mine then,\" he said. \"It belonged to me and I belonged to it.

It disgorged her beside the ship\u0027s discards and excrement but she did not mind. Home! I\u0027m home and Lampadas survives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rabbi, however, did not share her enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, they sat in his study, but now she felt more familiar with Other Memory, much more confident.

These are evil words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evil? Barbarism is not even the proper word for some of the evil things our ancestors did. The ancestors of all of us, Rabbi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw she had hurt him and felt the cruelty of her own words but could not stop. How could he escape the truth of what she said? He was an honorable man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke more softly but her words cut him even deeper. \"Rabbi, if you shared witness to some of the things Other Memory has forced me to know, you would come back seeking new words for evil.

It creaked mournfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rabbi, you I have always loved and respected. I went through the Agony for you. I shared Lampadas for you. Do not deny what I have learned from this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered his hands. \" I do not deny, daughter. But permit me my pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of all these realizations, Rabbi, the thing I must deal with most immediately and without respite is that there are no innocents. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rebecca!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guilty may not be the right word, Rabbi, but our ancestors did things for which payment must be made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I understand, Rebecca. It is a balance that -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me you understand when I know you don\u0027t.\" She stood and glared down at him. \"It\u0027s not a balance book that you set aright. How far back would you go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rebecca, I am your Rabbi. You must not talk this way, especially to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The farther back you go, Rabbi, the worse the evil atrocities and higher the price. You cannot go back that far but I am forced to it. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, she left him, ignoring the pleading in his voice, the painful way he said her name. As she closed the door, she heard him say: \"What have we done? Israel, help her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writing of history is largely a process of diversion. Most historical accounts distract attention from the secret influences behind great events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Bashar Teg\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen left to his own devices, Idaho often explored his no-ship prison. So much to see and learn about this Ixian artifact. It was a cave of wonders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused on this afternoon\u0027s restless walk through his quarters and looked at the tiny comeyes built into the glittering surface of a doorway. They were watching him. He had the odd sensation of seeing himself through those prying eyes. What did the Sisters think when they looked at him? The blocky ghola-child from Gammu\u0027s long-dead Keep had become a lanky man: dark skin and hair. The hair was longer than when he had entered this no-ship on the last day of Dune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBene Gesserit eyes peered below the skin. He was sure they suspected he was a Mentat and he feared how they might interpret that. How could a Mentat expect to hide the fact from Reverend Mothers indefinitely? Foolishness! He knew they already suspected him of Truthsay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved at the comeyes and said: \"I\u0027m restless. I think I\u0027ll explore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda hated it when he took that jocular attitude toward surveillance. She did not like him to roam the ship. She did not try to hide it from him. He could see the unspoken question in her glowering features whenever she came to confront him: \"Is he looking for a way to escape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly what I\u0027m doing, Bell, but not in the way you suspect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe no-ship presented him with fixed limits: the exterior forcefield he could not penetrate, certain machinery areas where the drive (so he was told) had been temporarily disabled, guard quarters (he could see into some of them but not enter), the armory, the section reserved to the captive Tleilaxu, Scytale. He occasionally met Scytale at one of the barriers and they peered at each other across the silencing field that held them apart. Then there was the information barrier - sections of Shiprecords that would not respond to his questions, answers his warders would not give.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin these limits lay a lifetime of things to see and learn, even the lifetime of some three hundred Standard Years he could reasonably expect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Honored Matres do not find us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho saw himself as the game they sought, wanting him even more than they wanted the women of Chapterhouse. He had no illusions about what the hunters would do to him. They knew he was here. The men he trained in sexual bonding and sent out to plague the Honored Matres - those men taunted the hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Sisters learned of his Mentat ability they would know immediately that his mind carried the memories of more than one ghola lifetime. The original did not have that talent. They would suspect he was a latent Kwisatz Haderach. Look how they rationed his melange. They were clearly terrified of repeating the mistake they had made with Paul Atreides and his Tyrant son. Thirty-five hundred years of bondage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut dealing with Murbella required Mentat awareness. He entered every encounter with her not expecting to achieve answers then or later. It was a typical Mentat approach: concentrate on the questions. Mentats accumulated questions the way others accumulated answers. Questions created their own patterns and systems. This produced the most important shapes. You looked at your universe through self-created patterns - all composed of images, words, and labels (everything temporary), all mingled in sensory impulses that reflected off his internal constructs the way light bounced from bright surfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho\u0027s original Mentat instructor had formed the temporary words for that first tentative construct: \"Watch for consistent movements against your internal screen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that first hesitant dip into Mentat powers, Idaho could trace the growth of a sensitivity to changes in his own observations, always becoming Mentat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda was his most severe trial. He dreaded her penetrating gaze and slashing questions. Mentat probing Mentat. He met her forays delicately, with reserve and patience. Now, what are you after?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if he didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore patience as a mask. But fear came naturally and there was no harm in showing it. Bellonda did not hide her wish to see him dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho accepted the fact that soon the watchers would see only one possible source for the skills he was forced to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Mentat\u0027s real skills lay in that mental construct they called \"the great synthesis.\" It required a patience that non-Mentats did not even imagine possible. Mentat schools defined it as perseverance. You were a primitive tracker, able to read minuscule signs, tiny disturbances in the environment, and follow where these led. At the same time, you remained open to broad motions all around and within. This produced naivete, the basic Mentat posture, akin to that of Truthsayers but far more sweeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are open to whatever the universe may do,\" his first instructor had said. \"Your mind is not a computer; it is a response-tool keyed to whatever your senses display.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho always recognized when Bellonda\u0027s senses were open. She stood there, gaze slightly withdrawn, and he knew few preconceptions cluttered her mind. His defense lay in her basic flaw: Opening the senses required an idealism that was foreign to Bellonda. She did not ask the best questions and he wondered at this. Would Odrade use a flawed Mentat? It went against her other performances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seek the questions that form the best images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoing this, you never thought of yourself as clever, that you had the formula to provide the solution. You remained as responsive to new questions as you did to new patterns. Testing, re-testing, shaping and re-shaping. A constant process, never stopping, never satisfied. It was your own private pavane, similar to that of other Mentats but it carried always your own unique posture and steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are never truly a Mentat. That is why we call it \u0027The Endless Goal.\u0027 \" The words of his teachers were burned into his awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he accumulated observations of Bellonda, he came to appreciate a viewpoint of those great Mentat Masters who had taught him. \"Reverend Mothers do not make the best Mentats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Bene Gesserit appeared capable of completely removing herself from that binding absolute she achieved in the Spice Agony: loyalty to her Sisterhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teachers had warned against absolutes. They created a serious flaw in a Mentat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything you do, everything you sense and say is experiment. No deduction final. Nothing stops until dead and perhaps not even then, because each life creates endless ripples. Induction bounces within and you sensitize yourself to it. Deduction conveys illusions of absolutes. Kick the truth and shatter it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bellonda\u0027s questions touched on the relationship between himself and Murbella, he saw vague emotional responses. Amusement? Jealousy? He could accept amusement (and even jealousy) about the compelling sexual demands of this mutual addiction. Is the ecstasy truly that great?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wandered through his quarters this afternoon feeling displaced, as though newly here and not yet accepting these rooms as home. That is emotion talking to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years of his confinement, these quarters had taken on a lived-in appearance. This was his cave, the former supercargo suite: large rooms with slightly curved walls - bedroom, library-workroom, sitting room, a green-tiled bath with dry and wet cleansing systems, and a long practice hall he shared with Murbella for exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rooms bore a unique collection of artifacts and marks of his presence: that slingchair placed at just the right angle to the console and projector linking him to Shipsystems, those ridulian records on that low side table. And there were stains of occupancy - that dark brown blot on the worktable. Spilled food had left its indelible mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved restlessly into his sleeping quarters. The light was dimmer. His ability to identify the familiar held true for odors. There was a saliva-like smell to the bed - the residue of last night\u0027s sexual collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is the proper word: Collision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe no-ship\u0027s air-filtered, recycled and sweetened - often bored him. No break in the no-ship maze to the exterior world ever remained open long. He sometimes sat silently sniffing, hoping for a faint trace of air that had not been adjusted to this prison\u0027s demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a way to escape!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wandered out of his quarters and down the corridor, took the dropchute at the end of the passage and emerged in the ship\u0027s lowest level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is really happening out there in that world open to the sky?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bits Odrade told him about events filled him with dread and a trapped feeling. No place to run! Am I wise to share my fears with Sheeana? Murbella merely laughed. \"I will protect you, love. Honored Matres won\u0027t hurt me.\" Another false dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sheeana... how quickly she had picked up the hand-language and entered the spirit of his conspiracy. Conspiracy? No... I doubt that any Reverend Mother will act against her Sisters. Even the Lady Jessica went back to them in the end. But I don\u0027t ask Sheeana to act against the Sisterhood, only that she protect us from Murbella\u0027s folly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enormous powers of the hunters made only the destruction predictable. A Mentat had but to look at their disruptive violence. They brought something else as well, something hinting at matters out there in the Scattering. What were these Futars Odrade mentioned with such casualness? Part human, part beast? That had been Lucilla\u0027s guess. And where is Lucilla?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself presently in the Great Hold, the kilometer-long cargo space where they had carried the last giant sandworm of Dune, bringing it to Chapterhouse. The area still smelled of spice and sand, filling his mind with long-ago and the dead far away. He knew why he came so often to the Great Hold, doing it sometimes without even thinking, as he had just done. It both attracted and repelled. The illusion of unlimited space with traces of dust, sand, and spice carried the nostalgia of lost freedoms. But there was another side. This is where it always happened to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill it happen today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, the sense of being in the Great Hold would vanish. Then... the net shimmering in a molten sky. He was aware when the vision came that he was not really seeing a net. His mind translated what the senses could not define.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shimmering net undulating like an infinite borealis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the net would part and he would see the two people - man and woman. How ordinary they appeared and yet extraordinary. A grandmother and grandfather in antique clothing: bib coveralls for the man and a long dress with headscarf for the woman. Working in a flower garden! He thought it must be more of the illusion. I am seeing this but it is not really what I see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey always noticed him eventually. He heard their voices. \"There he is again, Marty,\" the man would say, calling the woman\u0027s attention to Idaho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder how it is he can look through?\" Marty asked once. \"Doesn\u0027t seem possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s spread pretty thin, I think. Wonder if he knows the danger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanger. That was the word that always jerked him out of the vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at your console today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor just an instant, Idaho thought it was the vision, the voice of that odd woman, then he realized it was Odrade. Her voice came from close behind. He whirled and saw he had failed to close the hatch. She had followed him into the Hold, stalking him quietly, avoiding the scattered patches of sand that might have grated underfoot and betrayed her approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked tired and impatient. Why did she think I would be at my console?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though answering his unspoken question, she said: \" I find you at your console so often lately. For what do you search, Duncan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head without speaking. Why do I suddenly feel in peril?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rare feeling in Odrade\u0027s company. He could remember other occasions, though. Once when she had stared suspiciously at his hands in the field of his console. Fear associated with my console. Do I reveal my Mentat hunger for data? Do they guess that I have hidden my private self there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I get no privacy at all?\" Anger and attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head slowly from side to side as much as to say, \"You can do better than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is your second visit today,\" he accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must say you\u0027re looking well, Duncan.\" More circumlocution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what your watchers say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be petty. I came for a chat with Murbella. She said you\u0027d be down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose you know Murbella\u0027s pregnant again.\" Was that trying to placate her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For which we are grateful. I came to tell you that Sheeana wants to visit you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would Odrade announce that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words filled him with images of the Dune waif who had become a full Reverend Mother (the youngest ever, so they said). Sheeana, his confidante, out there watching over that last great sandworm. Had it finally perpetuated itself? Why should Odrade interest herself in Sheeana\u0027s visit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheeana wants to discuss the Tyrant with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the surprise this produced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could I possibly add to Sheeana\u0027s knowledge of Leto II?\" he demanded. \"She\u0027s a Reverend Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew the Atreides intimately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhhhhh. She\u0027s hunting for the Mentat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said she wanted to discuss Leto and it\u0027s not safe to think of him as Atreides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but he was. Refined into something more elemental than anyone before him, but one of us, nonetheless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of us! She reminded him that she, too, was Atreides. Calling in his never-ending debt to the family!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t we stop playing this foolish game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaution gripped him. He knew she saw it. Reverend Mothers were so damnably sensitive. He stared at her, not daring to speak, knowing even this told her too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We believe you remember more than one ghola lifetime.\" And when he still did not respond, \"Come, come, Duncan! Are you a Mentat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way she spoke, as much accusation as question, he knew concealment had ended. It was almost a relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Tleilaxu mixed the cells from more than one Idaho ghola when they grew you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho-ghola! He refused to think of himself in that abstraction. \"Why is Leto suddenly so important to you?\" No escaping the admission in that response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our worm has become sandtrout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they growing and propagating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you contain them or eliminate them, Chapterhouse may become another Dune. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You figured that out, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leto and I together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you remember many lives. Fascinating. It makes you somewhat like us.\" How unswerving her stare!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very different, I think.\" Have to get her off that track!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You acquired the memories during your first encounter with Murbella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho guessed it? Lucilla? She was there and might have guessed, confiding her suspicions to her Sisters. He had to bring the deadly issue into the open. \"I\u0027m not another Kwisatz Haderach!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not?\" Studied objectivity. She allowed this to reveal itself, a cruelty, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I\u0027m not!\" He was fighting for his life and knew it. Not so much with Odrade as with those others who watched and reviewed the comeye records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about your serial memories.\" That was a command from the Mother Superior. No escaping it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know those... lives. It\u0027s like one lifetime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That accumulation could be very valuable to us, Duncan. Do you also remember the axlotl tanks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer question sent his thoughts into the misty probings that caused him to imagine strange things about the Tleilaxu - great mounds of human flesh softly visible to the imperfect newborn eyes, blurred and unfocused images, almost-memories of emerging from birth canals. How could that accord with tanks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scytale has provided us with the knowledge to make our own axlotl system,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSystem? Interesting word. \"Does that mean you also duplicate Tleilaxu spice production?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scytale bargains for more than we will give. But spice will come in time, one way or another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade heard herself speak firmly and wondered if he detected uncertainty. We might not have the time to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Sisters you Scatter are hobbled,\" he said, giving her a small taste of Mentat awareness. \"You\u0027re drawing on your spice stockpiles to supply them and those must be finite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have our axlotl knowledge and sandtrout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shocked to silence by the possibility of countless Dunes being reproduced in an infinite universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will solve the problem of melange supply with tanks or worms or both,\" she said. This she could say sincerely. It came from statistical expectation. One among those Scattered bands of Reverend Mothers should accomplish it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tanks,\" he said. \"I have strange... dreams.\" He had almost said \"musings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And well you should.\" Briefly, she told him how female flesh was incorporated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For making the spice, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disgusting!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s juvenile,\" she chided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn such moments, he disliked her intensely. Once, he had reproached her for the way Reverend Mothers removed themselves from \"the common stream of human emotions,\" and she had given him that identical answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuvenile!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For which there probably is no remedy,\" he said. \"A disgraceful flaw in my character.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you thinking to debate morality with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought he heard anger. \"Not even ethics. We work by different rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rules are often an excuse to ignore compassion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I hear a faint echo of conscience in a Reverend Mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deplorable. My Sisters would exile me if they thought conscience ruled me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can be prodded, but not ruled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good, Duncan! I like you much better when you\u0027re openly Mentat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I distrust your liking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed aloud. \"How like Bell!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her dumbly, plunged by her laughter into sudden knowledge of the way to escape his warders, remove himself from the constant Bene Gesserit manipulations and live his own life. The way out lay not in machinery but in the Sisterhood\u0027s flaws. The absolutes by which they thought they surrounded and held him - there was the way out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Sheeana knows! That\u0027s the bait she dangles in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Idaho did not speak, Odrade said: \"Tell me about those other lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong. I think of them as one continuous life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No deaths?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let a response form silently. Serial memories: the deaths were as informative as the lives. Killed so many times by Leto himself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The deaths do not interrupt my memories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An odd kind of immortality,\" she said. \"You know, don\u0027t you, that Tleilaxu Masters recreated themselves? But you - what did they hope to achieve, mixing different gholas in one flesh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask Scytale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bell felt sure you were a Mentat. She will be delighted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will see to it that she is delighted. My! I have so many questions I\u0027m not sure where to begin.\" She studied him, left hand to her chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions? Mentat demands flowed through Idaho\u0027s mind. He let the questions he had asked himself so many times move of themselves, forming their patterns. What did the Tleilaxu seek in one? They could not have included cells from all of his ghola-selves for this incarnation. Yet... he had all of the memories. What cosmic linkage accumulated all of those lives in this one self? Was that the clue to the visions that beset him in the Great Hold? Half-memories formed in his mind: his body in warm fluid, fed by tubes, massaged by machines, probed and questioned by Tleilaxu observers. He sensed murmurous responses from semi-dormant selves. The words had no meaning. It was as though he listened to a foreign language coming from his own lips but he knew it was ordinary Galach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scope of what he sensed in Tleilaxu actions awed him. They investigated a cosmos no one but the Bene Gesserit had ever dared touch. That the Bene Tleilax did this for selfish reasons did not subtract from it. The endless rebirths of Tleilaxu Masters were a reward worthy of daring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace Dancer servants to copy any life, any mind. The scope of the Tleilaxu dream was as awesome as Bene Gesserit achievements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scytale admits to memories of Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s times,\" Odrade said. \"You might compare notes with him someday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That kind of immortality is a bargaining chip,\" he warned. \"Could he sell it to the Honored Matres?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might. Come. Let\u0027s go back to your quarters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his workroom, she gestured him to the chair at his console and he wondered if she was still hunting for his secrets. She bent over him to manipulate the controls. The overhead projector produced a scene of desert to a horizon of rolling dunes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chapterhouse?\" she said. \"A wide band along our equator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcitement gripped him. \"Sandtrout, you said. But are there any new worms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheeana expects them soon.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-5.html","bookId":2158,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM"}
