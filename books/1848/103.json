Jenny, this is England and your husband is—is a legend! You\u0027ll make a laughingstock of him! Everyone who\u0027s come to like you will despise you for it, even while they\u0027re deriding your husband for not being able to conquer his own wife. Please, I implore you—don\u0027t do this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I—I have to remind my husband about the time.\" Jenny replied desperately. \"Before we realized we\u0027d have so many guests, this night was set aside for the vassals to come to Claymore for the swearing of fealty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Jenny, two of her serfs stared after her as if they\u0027d been slapped, then they rushed over to the smithy who was standing with two dozen Claymore grooms. \"Her ladyship,\" one of the serfs burst out in anxiety and disbelief, \"is sittin\u0027 with the Scots tomorrow. She\u0027s sidin\u0027 agin us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re lyin\u0027!\" exploded a young groom whose burned hand Jenny had tended and bandaged herself yesterday. \"She\u0027d never do that. She\u0027s one o\u0027 us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lord,\" Jenny said when she reached Royce, and he turned to her at once, cutting off Lord Melbrook in the middle of his sentence. \"You said,\" Jenny reminded him, unable to banish Katherine\u0027s words about the way her husband looked at her. It did seem, Jenny thought dazedly, that there was something in his eyes when he gazed at her…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said what?\" he asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said everyone normally retires early on the night before a tourney,\" Jenny explained, recovering her composure and arranging her face in the same politely impersonal expression she\u0027d tried to adopt with him since William\u0027s death. \"And if you mean for everyone to do that, then \u0027twould be wise to get the swearing of fealty over and done with before it grows any later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you feeling unwell?\" he asked, his narrowed eyes searching her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jenny lied. \"Just tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swearing of fealty took place in the great hall, where Royce\u0027s vassals had all assembled. For nearly a full hour, Jenny stood with Katherine, Brenna, Sir Stefan, and several others, watching as each of Royce\u0027s vassals approached him one at a time. In accordance with ancient custom, each one knelt before him, placed his hands in Royce\u0027s, humbly bowed his head, and swore him fealty. It was an act of obeisance, oft portrayed in paintings of lofty nobles with their lowly subjects, instantly recognizable by posture alone. Jenny, who\u0027d seen it done at Merrick, had always thought it needlessly humbling to the vassal. So, in a way, did Katherine Melbrook, who quietly observed, \"It must be very demeaning to a vassal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Tis meant to be,\" said Lord Melbrook, obviously not sharing his wife\u0027s distaste for it. \"But then, I have assumed exactly the same position before King Henry, so you see, \u0027tis not quite the debasing gesture you ladies obviously find it. However,\" he amended after a moment\u0027s additional thought, \"perhaps it feels different where you\u0027re a noble bending your knee to a king.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the last vassal had knelt and sworn his fealty, Jenny quietly excused herself and slipped upstairs. Agnes had just finished helping her into a bedgown of soft white lawn embroidered with pink silk roses when Royce knocked on the door to her chamber and entered. \"I\u0027ll just go down to the Lady Elinor and see if she needs me,\" Agnes said to Jenny, then she bobbed a quick curtsy to Royce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealizing the linen gown was nearly transparent, Jenny snatched up a silver velvet dressing gown and hastily put it on. Instead of mocking the modest gesture—or teasing her about it—as he might have done when they\u0027d been happy together, Jenny noticed that his handsome face remained perfectly expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to talk to you about a few things,\" he began quietly, when she had belted the robe. \"First of all, about the badges you handed out to the villagers—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re angry about that, I don\u0027t blame you,\" Jenny said honestly. \"I should have consulted with you or Sir Albert first. Especially because I handed them out in your name. You weren\u0027t available at the time, and I—I don\u0027t like Sir Albert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m far from angry, Jennifer,\" he said politely. \"And after the tournament I\u0027ll replace Prisham. Actually, I came in here to thank you for noticing the problem and for solving it so cleverly. Most of all, I wanted to thank you for not letting your hatred for me show to the serfs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s stomach lurched sickly at the word hatred, as he continued, \"You\u0027ve done the opposite, in fact.\" He glanced toward the door by which Agnes had just departed and added ironically, \"No one crosses themselves any more when they walk near me. Not even your maid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny, who had no idea he\u0027d ever noticed that before, nodded, unable to think of what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated and then said with a sardonic twist to his lips. \"Your father, your brother, and three other Merricks have each challenged me to a joust tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensual awareness of him that had been plaguing Jenny ever since Katherine had remarked on Royce\u0027s alleged tenderness toward her was demolished by his next words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve accepted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally,\" she said with unhidden bitterness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had no choice,\" he said tautly. \"I am under a specific command from my king not to decline if challenged by your family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have a very busy day,\" she remarked, giving him a freezing look. It was common knowledge that Scotland and France had each picked their two premier knights, and that Royce was to confront them as well tomorrow. \"How many matches have you agreed to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eleven,\" he said flatly, \"in addition to the tournament.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eleven,\" Jenny repeated, her scathing voice filled with frustration and the endless pain of his betrayal. \"Three is the customary number. I take it you require four times the amount of violence as other men to make you feel brave and strong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face whitened at that. \"I have accepted only those matches which I was specifically commanded to accept. I\u0027ve declined more than two hundred others.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-103.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM"}
