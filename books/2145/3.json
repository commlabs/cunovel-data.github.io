Her back arched and her fur stood straight up. I couldn\u0027t contain her in my arms. She bolted across my bed and jumped on the windowsill. She batted the glass with her paw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s probably a bird, Nightmare. Calm down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I heard a tinyping,like something had hit the outside glass. Nightmare freaked. She dashed across my room and pushed through the cracked open door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peeked out into the darkness. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t see anything unusual around the garage or the swing set that was a few yardsaway .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a shadowy figure was leaning against the tree. I pressed my face to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere he was. My Gothic Guy, my Knight of the Night, my Vampire Prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart throbbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raced out of my room, down the stairs, out the back door, and into my boyfriend\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander greeted me with a long kiss. It sent shivers down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to see you,\" he said. \"I can\u0027t stay long but I wanted,to wish you luck before school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve missed you so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. I think even the Mansion misses you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Howare your parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they like?\" I probed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know...The same as any others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they happy to be home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom says the Mansion smells like flowers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you tell her I placed them around?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she guessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet you\u0027re glad to see them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander shrugged his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027sokay-I know you had to have missed them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated and then began as if he were revealing a national secret. \"It\u0027s been great to talk to my dad. He\u0027s an art dealer. He\u0027s very interesting and has so much to share about the art world. He brought me a painting from a rising artist inFrance .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he like your artwork?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure he takes me seriously yet. He thinks I just I -.tint for fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander\u0027s eyes couldn\u0027t help but twinkle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet she dotes on you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s my mom. She\u0027s insisting that I haven\u0027t eaten and I us promised to fatten me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will I meet them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hopefully soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re hiding me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true... I want you all to myself.\" He squeezed me hard and swung me around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they know everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t tell my parentseverything. Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander had a point. I certainly didn\u0027t tell my parents I hat we had dates in the cemetery and I slept during the day with him in a coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they know Tm not a vampire?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do your parents know Iam one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shocked. Did Alexander have to hide my identity like I had to hide his? I thought maybe they knew already or they\u0027d gotten wind of it from Jameson or theMaxwells .hut eitherJagger and his siblings, Luna and Valentine, hadn\u0027t returned toRomania or they hadn\u0027t wanted to sharei hat Alexander had preferred a mortal to Luna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe Alexander chose not to tell his parents that L was mortal-like I\u0027d chosen not to tell mine that he was a vampire. It didn\u0027t occur to me that he couldn\u0027t tell them the truth about me, I never realized how painful it must be for him that I couldn\u0027t disclose his reality to my parents or even my best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want me to meet them, do you?\" I asked. \"Then they\u0027ll know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are ashamed of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I be ashamed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I\u0027m mortal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All they know is that I have a girlfriend and that I\u0027m happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t mad at Alexander. How could I beangty with him, when I hadn\u0027t shared him with my family, who I saw every day and he hadn\u0027t seen his in months?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was disappointed. I assumed Alexander would have told his parents every detail about finding the girl of his dreams in Dullsville and our adventures. But then, Alexander was a guy. I knew Billy Boy hadn\u0027t shared with my mom any crush he\u0027d had on a very unlucky girl. I couldn\u0027t imagine Trevor spilling his guts about every girl he dated to Mrs. Mitchell-though he probably told the entire soccer team. Not only didn\u0027t Alexander talk to his parents, but he didn\u0027t have a friend in Dullsville besides me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a pang of loneliness for Alexander. He didn\u0027t have anyone to share his thoughts with. I guess that\u0027s why he spent so much of his waking hours painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of being impatient as I normally was, I knew I needed to give Alexander space to reunite with his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go now. But I wanted to say hi,\" he said suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you could come to school with me tomorrow. I might be more motivated to get a better education if you were in my classes.Especially if I got to pass you in the way for a quick kiss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about this to keep you company, since I can\u0027t be there with you?\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out a dark-stained wooden bracelet with a dangling silver heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love it!\" I said, putting it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander gave me a long squeeze and a tender good-night kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will I see you?\" I asked, wrapping my arms around his waist like a giant handcuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sooner than you think.\"He gently pried my hands apart, stepped into the shadows, and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander was still a mystery. I ached to know everything about him, and his evasiveness only made me want him more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-3.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
