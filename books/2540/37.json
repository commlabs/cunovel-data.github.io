He looked sweaty and scared, and Bryn knew that would probably, in the eyes of Walt and his men, translate into guilt. “I don’t know what he’s talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s talking about me paying somebody half a million dollars and getting two of my men arrested when they went to pick up the goods, and getting no product. You the man? You the one who was behind the jack?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got nothing to do with weapons! Nothing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s right,” Patrick said. “He’s a middleman who sells whatever people want. Drugs, weapons, hell, pirated DVDs for all I know. Doesn’t matter. He’s the one. He pocketed the cash and called the feds and walked away clean as a whistle. Until I found him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s lying!” Reynolds was trying his best to look sincere now, but he wasn’t doing a very good job of it; too scared, and too confused. “I told you, I’ll give you money. What did you say, half a million? I’ll double it. A million dollars to call my people and let me go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good offer,” Walt said, and nodded. The men on either side let Reynolds go. He looked relieved, and straightened up as much as he could in the too-small jumpsuit. “Too bad I don’t believe you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his gun and shot Reynolds straight between the eyes. Large caliber round. It left a significant hole in the front, and though Bryn couldn’t see much of it from where she sat, there wouldn’t have been a lot of skull left around the exit wound. A gout of blood sprayed a few feet from the back of Reynolds’ head, and his eyes rolled up to show the whites, and . . . he was down. Crumpled like a dropped toy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the shot echoed sharply from the surrounding mountains, but nobody reacted in any way. Not even a twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” Walt said. “Get him out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was stupid,” Patrick said. “You could’ve gotten paid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did get paid,” Walt replied. “That why you left? Looking for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the reasons,” Patrick said. He stretched his legs out in front of him and crossed them at the ankles, very much at ease even with his hands still pinned behind him. “Couldn’t stand looking at Queeg’s ugly face anymore, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueeg showed teeth, and Bryn had to admit, he didn’t look like something she’d want to wake up to, either. “Fuck you,” he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick puckered lips in a silent kiss. “Missed you, too, Queeg. What are you going to do with him?” Meaning Reynolds, who was being dragged off by Walt’s men toward the darkness. Bryn was wondering, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dumping him in a ditch for the night,” Walt said. “We’ll take him out and bury him good and deep tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a deadly shot, of course, but there was every chance that Reynolds would recover in a matter of an hour or two, and if he was just dumped in a ditch, he’d be off and running. Even out here, eventually he’d run into a hiker or hunter or ranger with a cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could not let him get away now. Not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalt was gesturing to his men again, but this time, they hauled her and Patrick up to their feet, turned them around, and released the handcuffs. She automatically rubbed at the sore places the metal had left on her wrists, but she was thinking fast, and she knew Patrick was doing the same. She locked eyes with him as she turned, and before he could speak, she said, “You let him kill our payday? You asshole! I needed my share!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got it, instantly, and shoved her backward. “Stow it, bitch. You’ll get paid when I say you get paid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t sign up for this cracker militia shit, and your friends just put a bullet in the skull of the man I found for you. You think that isn’t going to ruin my life just a little bit? You burned me, Vaughn. I’m not going to forget it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick looked at her with the deadest eyes she’d ever seen in him, an absolute zero of emotion, and in one smooth motion reached sideways, took Walt’s gun, and aimed it at her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you,” he said, and pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt it. Not an instant death, not quite; there was time for the shock to travel to her brain, for her heart to struggle to beat and fail and fibrillate, for shock and panic to set in. Her mouth worked, opening and closing for breath she couldn’t seem to pull into her lungs. The pain was sudden and shocking, but brief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw red, and then she saw black, and then she was just . . . gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d counted on Walt’s men to be economical, and she woke up right—they’d simply dumped her limp, dead body on top of Reynolds’ in the ditch at the edge of camp. In fact, she woke up with her head pillowed on his fat-soft stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long moment she didn’t move or react. Patrick had gone for the shortest-term kill wound he could; nanites rushed to repair heart damage, and it was much less complex than a brain repair, like what Reynolds’ little beasts were dealing with right now. He’d fixed it so she’d wake first . . . and she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way to tell how much time had passed, but it was quiet now, except for the rustle of wind in trees and the normal sounds of crickets and nocturnal creatures. Bryn carefully rolled herself off. The ditch was damp and muddy, but generally free of less pleasant things. At least it wasn’t a latrine. At moments like this, she’d learned to count her blessings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat there, trying to breathe slowly and calmly. Her newly repaired heart kept pounding, pounding, pounding, and she was filled with a furious, trembling rage. So tired of this, she thought. I don’t want to keep dying. Nobody should have to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she’d managed to stay with Reynolds, she was unbound, and Patrick’s actions had ensured that Walt believed him completely. Nobody could say he was a federal agent, not after watching him shoot his own girlfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d sold it even to her. The lightless look in his eyes haunted her. Was that who Patrick really was, down deep? Someone with no soul, no compass?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsn’t that what you are? a piece of her whispered. Aren’t you just like Jane? Remember what you did back at the river. Remember how good it felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t want to remember. Because remembering left her feeling not nauseated, but . . . hungry. Especially with Reynolds’ still body lying next to her in the ditch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy pickings. And something in her, something frighteningly cold and logical, was telling her that if she ate a couple of pieces, they’d heal, wouldn’t they? She needed the protein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, he deserved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stomped that part of her down, bolted it under steel, but it took a lot of effort, and it left her shaking. She heard crunching footsteps nearby—patrols, walking the gravel. They’d have to be quiet. Very quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fence was reinforced cement, and as far as she could see, there was no way underneath it. . . . They were diligent about their security, which was too bad, really. She remembered the motion lights, too. No going out the front, for certain. Maybe they’d neglected to put the same system on the side of the compound, since it faced only the forest, but she had to assume that Walt’s paranoia would have won out, even if all the security ever revealed were startled deer and the occasional wandering bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had to be another way out. Walt was one of those men who never had just one entrance and exit. He’d have something else, something concealed, probably under the camp, where he could evacuate his people in a crisis. At the very least, he’d have a defensible bunker. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. She thought it through, and the post-death fog finally lifted. The correct answer—the only answer—was to stay dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eased herself down into position. There was light on the eastern horizon, so dawn wouldn’t be far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in case, though, she quietly leaned her weight on Reynolds’ unresisting throat, and smashed his hyoid bone. Something else for his nanites to work on, and something to keep him out. . . . Having him wake up hysterical wouldn’t do, not now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men arrived, grumbling, before dawn even blushed; there were four of them, and the first two climbed in, grabbed Bryn’s wrists and ankles, and slung her out to roll bonelessly across the gravel, where she was picked up by the other two. They didn’t make any comments. She was just a job to them, something to be finished before breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two grunted and struggled getting Reynolds out, but soon they were moving. Bryn kept limp, though it was an uncomfortable position for her head hanging backward. She hoped the dim light would disguise the beating pulse that was probably visible on the exposed skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, they had absolutely no reason to check her, or even look at her for long. She was dead. And they just wanted to be rid of her before she started to make a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men carrying her went in silence, and they moved with assurance. At least one of them was wearing night vision; had to be, from the general speed at which they went down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them stopped, putting a strain on her feet, and Bryn resisted the urge to react. “Wait,” he said. “Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gully,” the other one said. “Come on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re supposed to bury them, Walt said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hard work to bury them. We toss ’em over, they get broken up in the fall. Come winter, nothing left but bones anyway. Nobody’s gonna find ’em down there except the bugs, and even if somebody does, there won’t be enough left to identify. Save us a couple of hours, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Seems—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Move it,” the first man said, and his voice had gone hard. “I ain’t tramping around here for my health, and I ain’t digging graves for these two assholes. You want to pray over ’em, pray over the gully that they get eaten quick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second man shut up, and started following the first man’s lead. The gully. Bryn hoped it was a long way off, but she didn’t expect it would be. These didn’t seem like men who wanted to go to a whole lot of trouble for a body dump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right. They slowed and stopped after about five minutes more, and she heard the men with Reynolds’ body pausing nearby. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/terminated-revivalist-3/page-37.html","bookId":2540,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:51 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:51 AM"}
