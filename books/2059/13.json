He refused to tell me any more details, only that Seth needed to undergo hypnosis and that more would be revealed once that happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you think I should know now?\" I demanded, for what felt like the hundredth time the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to influence either of you,\" came the response. \"Just in case I\u0027m wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you said you\u0027d figured it out! You\u0027re saying now that there\u0027s a chance you might be wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s always a chance,\" he said pragmatically. \"But I don\u0027t think I\u0027m wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that infuriating response, there was nothing I could do except wait and speculate. I couldn\u0027t figure out what exactly Roman planned on doing with hypnosis, but at least it seemed relatively safe. I wouldn\u0027t have put it past Roman to say, \"Let\u0027s stage a trap for some demons and use Seth as bait.\" There were worse things than being hypnotized into clucking like a chicken, I supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a number of days to get an answer. The delay came from finding a time when both Seth and Hugh were available. Despite his many formidable skills, hypnosis apparently wasn\u0027t in Roman\u0027s repertoire. It was, however, in Hugh\u0027s, which I found kind of surprising. When I asked him about it, he explained that he\u0027d once been at a medical conference, during which participants were required to take a certain number of seminars. He\u0027d chosen hypnosis because he thought it would be a blow-off class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was actually harder than it seemed,\" he remarked. \"I did some more follow-up on it after the conference. Dabbled here and there. Haven\u0027t put it to much use since then, aside from an ill-fated date last year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to be able to do what Roman needs you to today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded toward my living room, where Roman was pacing like a caged animal. We were all waiting on Seth to show up, and Roman kept obsessing over small details necessary to create \"the perfect hypnotic environment.\" He was constantly adjusting the lighting and moving the recliner. Sometimes he\u0027d put it in the center of the room. Other times, he\u0027d drag it to the side, where there were more shadows. We\u0027d given up on trying to advise him. He was too irritable and wound up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh frowned, watching Roman. \"I don\u0027t know. What he asked me to do . . . well, it\u0027s pretty basic, as far as technique goes. It\u0027s what he wants me to do with it that\u0027s kind of wacky. I\u0027ve read up on it a little this week, and honestly . . . I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s going to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still didn\u0027t know what \"it\" was and had resigned myself to patience. Seth arrived shortly thereafter, mood bright and optimistic. Andrea\u0027s improvement after Carter\u0027s visit had been remarkable, and it was affecting everyone in the household. I crossed my fingers every day that Hell wouldn\u0027t send someone back to undo what Carter had done. Seth gave me a half hug and kissed me on the lips, a further sign of his good mood since he was usually so reserved in front of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You missed a good time,\" he told me. He was wearing a Princess Bride shirt today. \"I took Kendall and the twins Christmas shopping. They got Ian some used copies of The Metamorphosis and Candide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s into those?\" I asked. \"I mean, they\u0027re great books, but I just never thought of them as his thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they aren\u0027t mainstream best sellers - like some people\u0027s sellout books - so he\u0027s into the elitist appeal. He likes to go to coffee shops - obscure ones that you\u0027ve never been to, naturally - and pretend to read counterculture literature. He\u0027ll be glad to have the new material.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth\u0027s amusement faded as he took in the living room, with all its drawn shades and Roman carefully arranging the recliner (again). Noticing our attention, Roman paused and glanced between the three of us. \"I wasn\u0027t sure what background noise would work best, so I loaded a few different things onto my iPod. I\u0027ve got ocean waves, wind chimes, and white noise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh shrugged. \"Makes no difference to me. I\u0027m not the one being hypnotized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m still not sure I can be hypnotized,\" said Seth. \"But if it doesn\u0027t matter . . . hmm, are there seagulls with the ocean waves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Roman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s go white noise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman obligingly started it up, filling the room with what sounded more like faulty radio reception than soothing neutral sounds. \"Maybe you should keep it at a low volume,\" I suggested delicately. \"You know, you don\u0027t want it to be so soothing that Seth falls asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman looked dubious, but at a nod from Seth, the volume decreased. I might not understand how hypnotizing Seth was going to play into Hell\u0027s greater plans, but so long as Roman believed it was necessary, Seth got to call the shots. Seth gave me a quick hand squeeze and a smile that was meant to be reassuring. He didn\u0027t like immortal affairs but had accepted this crazy venture for me. Following Roman\u0027s direction, Seth settled himself into the recliner and eased it back. Hugh pulled up a stool near Seth, but Roman and I sat on the periphery of the living room. Hypnosis required a minimum of distractions, which we clearly were. I\u0027d even had to lock the cats up in my bedroom earlier, to make sure Aubrey and Godiva didn\u0027t decide to jump on Seth\u0027s lap mid-session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" said Hugh, after clearing his throat. \"Are you ready?\" He took out a small notepad, filled with his illegible writing. It was the most low-tech thing I\u0027d seen him use in a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready as I\u0027ll ever be,\" said Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh glanced at Roman and me briefly, perhaps in case we had a last-minute change of heart, and then returned to the notepad. \"Okay, close your eyes and take a deep breath. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was familiar with some of the basics of hypnosis, and the exercises that Hugh began with were pretty standard. Although Seth had been joking, I too honestly wondered if he could be hypnotized. Part of his nature as a writer was to focus on all the details of the world, making it difficult to hone in on one thing sometimes. Of course, he could also show single-mindedness for his work, and that was the attribute that soon came out. After a few minutes of guided breathing, it became clear that Seth was definitely growing more and more relaxed. I almost thought he\u0027d actually fallen asleep, until Hugh began asking him questions. Seth responded, eyes closed, voice perfectly steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to go back,\" said Hugh. \"Back in your memories. Go past your thirties, into your twenties. From there, think about your college years. Then high school.\" He allowed a pause. \"Are you thinking about high school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Go further back in time, back to middle school. Then elementary school. Can you remember a time before then? Before you started school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a slight delay before Seth spoke. Then: \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your earliest memory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a boat, with my father and Terry. We\u0027re on a lake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fishing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watching. Sometimes I get to help hold a pole. But mostly I just watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a knot form in my stomach. I didn\u0027t fully understand Roman\u0027s strategy here, but there was something terribly personal and vulnerable about what we were doing, listening to these memories. Seth rarely spoke of his father, who had passed away when Seth was in his early teens, and it seemed wrong to \"make\" him do it in this state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back even further. Can you remember anything before that? Any earlier memories?\" asked Hugh. He seemed uneasy, a sharp contrast to Seth\u0027s utter calmness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" No. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try,\" said Hugh. \"Try to go back further.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . I\u0027m in a kitchen. The kitchen at our first house, in a high chair. My mom\u0027s feeding me, and Terry\u0027s walking through the door. He runs to her and hugs her. He\u0027s been gone all day, and I don\u0027t understand where he\u0027s been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchool, if I had to guess. I tried to put an age on this memory, using what I knew of the age difference between the brothers. How long did kids stay in high chairs? And how young would he have to be to not understand the concept of school? Three? Two?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great,\" said Hugh. \"That\u0027s really great. Now keep going even more. Go back to something even earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, thinking they were kind of pushing it now. I was no expert in human memory, but I thought I\u0027d once read about how two was the age when memories really began forming. Seth seemed to struggle with this as well, frowning despite his otherwise calm exterior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\" said Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother\u0027s face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. That\u0027s all I remember of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay,\" said Hugh. \"Now find something else before that. Any memory. Any image or sensation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing,\" said Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try,\" said Hugh, not looking nearly as confident as he sounded. \"It doesn\u0027t matter how vague it is. Anything you can remember. Anything at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . there\u0027s nothing,\" said Seth, the frown deepening. \"I can\u0027t remember anything before that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try,\" repeated Hugh. \"Go further back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was getting ridiculous. I opened my mouth to protest, but Roman caught hold of my arm, silencing me. I glared at him, hoping I could convey all my frustrations at what they were doing to Seth in one look. Roman simply shook his head and mouthed Wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember . . . I remember faces. Faces looking at me. Everyone\u0027s so much bigger than me. But they\u0027re mostly shadows and light. I can\u0027t see . . . can\u0027t comprehend much detail.\" Seth paused. \"That\u0027s it. That\u0027s all there is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re doing good,\" said Hugh. \"You\u0027re doing great. Just listen to the sound of my voice, and keep breathing. We need to go back even earlier. What do you remember before that? Before the faces?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" said Seth. \"There\u0027s nothing there. Just blackness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman shifted in his chair, going rigid. He leaned forward, eyes bright and excited. Hugh glanced over questioningly, and Roman gave an eager nod. Swallowing, Hugh turned back to Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you . . . to go past the blackness. Go to the other side of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" said Seth. \"It\u0027s a wall. I can\u0027t cross it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can,\" said Hugh. \"Listen to my voice. I\u0027m telling you, you can. Push back in your memories, past the memories of this life, to the other side of the blackness. You can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . I can\u0027t - \" Seth cut himself off. For a moment, there was no other sound save the white noise on Roman\u0027s iPod, though it was a wonder I couldn\u0027t hear the pounding of my own heart. The frown that had been intensifying on Seth\u0027s face abruptly smoothed out. \"I\u0027m there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh shifted awkwardly, disbelief registering on his face. \"You are? What are you doing? Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . .\" The frown returned, but it was different in nature. It was distress from the memory itself, not the effort. \"I\u0027m bleeding. In an alley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you . . . are you Seth Mortensen?\" Hugh\u0027s voice was a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" No. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luc.\" The frown smoothed again. \"And now I\u0027m dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back to the alley,\" said Hugh, regaining his courage. \"Before you . . . before, um, Luc died. How did it happen? Why were you bleeding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was stabbed,\" said Seth. \"I was trying to defend a woman. A woman I loved. She said we couldn\u0027t be together, but I know she didn\u0027t mean it. Even if she didn\u0027t, I still would\u0027ve died for her. I had to protect her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about that point that I stopped breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\" Hugh reconsidered his question. \"Do you know the year?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s 1942. I live in Paris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman reached across me to a stray catalog on a chair. Producing a pen, he scrawled something on the catalog\u0027s cover and then handed it to Hugh. Hugh read it and then gently placed it on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about the woman,\" he said to Seth. \"What\u0027s her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name is Suzette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone let out a strangled gasp. Me. I stood up then, and Roman jerked me back down. A million protests sprang to my lips, and he actually had the audacity to clamp a hand over my mouth. He shook his head sharply and hissed in my ear, \"Listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen? Listen? He had no idea what he was asking. He had no idea what he was hearing. For that matter, I wasn\u0027t sure either. All I knew was that there was no way this could be happening. Much like the night I\u0027d gotten into bed with Ian, I had the surreal feeling that the only way any of this could be real was if I\u0027d accidentally stumbled into someone else\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about Suzette,\" said Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has blond hair and blue eyes,\" said Seth levelly. \"She moves like music, but none of the music I make can compare to her. She\u0027s so beautiful . . . but so cruel. Not that I think she means to be. I think she believes she\u0027s helping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go back now,\" said Hugh. \"Back to your childhood, Seth - I mean, Luc. Go back to your earliest memories as Luc. Are you there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother\u0027s funeral, though I don\u0027t understand it. She was sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I need you to go back again, younger and younger, back until you hit more blackness. Can you do that? Can you find it again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the rest of us held our breath, waiting for Seth to respond. \"Yes,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh exhaled. \"Go to the other side of that blackness, back before Luc. You can cross it. You did it before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your name now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Etienne. I live in Paris . . . but it\u0027s a different Paris. An earlier Paris. There are no Germans here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you do for a living?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m an artist. I paint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a woman in your life? Girlfriend? Wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a woman, but she\u0027s none of those. I pay to be with her. She\u0027s a dancer named Josephine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to feel ill. The world was spinning, and I lowered my head, willing everything to settle back to its rightful order. I didn\u0027t need to hear Seth next describe Josephine. I could\u0027ve done it down to the last curl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love her?\" Hugh asked Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But she doesn\u0027t love me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I ask her to marry me, but she says she won\u0027t. That she can\u0027t. She tells me to find someone else, but there is no one else. How can there be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh had no answer for that, but he had his rhythm now. He kept repeating the pattern, pushing Seth back further and further through impossible memories, always crossing that black wall, always asking Seth\u0027s name and location, where he was, and if there was a woman who\u0027d broken his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Robert. I live in Philadelphia, the first of my family born in the New World. We run a newspaper, and I love a woman who works for us. Her name is Abigail, and I think she loves me too . . . but she disappears one night without a word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Niccol��. I\u0027m an artist in Florence. It\u0027s 1497 . . . and there\u0027s this woman . . . this amazing woman. Her name is Bianca, but . . . she betrays me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Andrew. I\u0027m a priest in southern England. There\u0027s a woman named Cecily, but I can\u0027t allow myself to love her, not even when the plague takes me. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn and on it went, and with each step Hugh helped Seth take back, part of my heart broke. All of this was impossible. Seth couldn\u0027t have lived all these lives and times he was describing - and not just because of the obvious problems of life and death as we knew them. Seth wasn\u0027t just describing his lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was describing mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had lived every one of these lives that Seth described. I had been Suzette, Josephine, Abigail, Bianca, Cecily . . . They were all identities I\u0027d assumed, people I\u0027d become when Hell had transferred me to new places over the centuries. I would reinvent myself, take on a new name, appearance, and vocation. For every one of my identities Seth mentioned, I had lived a dozen more. But the ones he talked about . . . the ones he claimed to know as well, they were the ones that stuck out to me. Because although I\u0027d had countless lovers, in countless places, there were a handful who had struck some part of my soul, a handful whom I had truly loved, despite the impossibility of our situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Seth was touching upon every one of them, checking them off like items on a grocery list. Only, he wasn\u0027t just talking about these men I\u0027d loved. He was talking about being them. Whereas I had created these lives, he was acting as though he\u0027d been born into them, born as these lovers I\u0027d had, only to die and be reborn again in some other place with me. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd eventually, it stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" said Seth at last. \"I can\u0027t go back further.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know you can,\" said Hugh. \"You\u0027ve done it before. Are you at the blackness again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes . . . but it\u0027s different than before. It\u0027s not like the others. It\u0027s more solid. Harder to cross. Impossible to cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not impossible,\" said Hugh. \"You\u0027ve already proven that. Cross back to the next life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing was, I was beginning to agree with Seth. I didn\u0027t think there was anything else he could go back to, not if he was paralleling my lives. I\u0027d jumped ahead of him at one point and made some educated guesses on what he would say, and I\u0027d been right each time. I knew how many great loves I\u0027d had as a succubus, and there were none left. Before Seth, there had been eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Push through,\" urged Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" said Seth. \"They won\u0027t let me. I\u0027m not supposed to remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That life. The first life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s part of the bargain. My bargain. No, wait. Not mine. Hers, I think. I\u0027m not supposed to remember her. But how can I not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was another of those rhetorical questions, and Hugh looked to Roman and me for help. The imp had been confident there for a while, once the lives began rolling off so easily, but this was something different. Seth wasn\u0027t making a lot of sense, not that this had all been particularly crystal clear so far. Roman made gestures that seemed to be both encouraging and impatient, with a general notion that Hugh should improvise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s this bargain with?\" asked Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . I don\u0027t know. They\u0027re just there, waiting for me in the blackness. After the first life. I\u0027m supposed to go on to the light, but I can\u0027t. There\u0027s something missing. I\u0027m incomplete. My life has been incomplete . . . but I can\u0027t remember why. . . .\" Seth furrowed his brow, straining with the effort of remembering. \"I just know I can\u0027t move on. So they make a bargain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the bargain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you can,\" said Hugh, surprisingly gentle. \"You were just talking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember the details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it was about you being incomplete. Something was missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No . . . someone. My soul mate.\" Seth\u0027s breathing, which had been so steady throughout all of this, grew a little shaky. \"I\u0027m supposed to go on with her, into the light. I can feel it. I wasn\u0027t supposed to live that life alone. I wasn\u0027t supposed to go to the light afterward alone. But she\u0027s not there. She\u0027s not anywhere I can get to now. They say they\u0027ll give me a chance to find her, a chance to find her and remember. They say I can have ten lives to be with her again but that one is used up. Then I have to go with them forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This life that you can\u0027t remember,\" prompted Hugh. \"You said it\u0027s your first life, right? The one that\u0027s on the other side of this, uh, extra thick wall of blackness? The life they say you\u0027ve already used?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Seth. \"That\u0027s the first. The one I\u0027m supposed to forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can remember it,\" said Hugh. \"You\u0027re already remembering parts of it, things you aren\u0027t supposed to. Go to the other side of the blackness, before the bargain, before your death. What do you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember a woman? Think about the bargain. The soul mate. Can you remember her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth\u0027s silence stretched into eternity. \"I . . . yes. Kind of. I feel her absence, though I don\u0027t understand it at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you made it back yet?\" asked Hugh. \"To the first life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kyriakos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where you are? Where you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I live south of Pafos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name meant nothing to Hugh, but it meant everything to me. I began to slowly shake my head, and Roman gripped hold of my arm again. I\u0027m not sure what he was afraid I\u0027d do. It seemed to be an all-purpose attempt to keep me from interrupting the nightmare unfolding before me, either with word or movement. He needn\u0027t have worried. The rest of me was frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know the year?\" asked Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you do?\" Hugh asked. \"What\u0027s your job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a musician. Unofficially. Mostly I work for my father. He\u0027s a merchant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a woman in your life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" No. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just said there was. Your soul mate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth considered. \"Yes . . . but she\u0027s not there. She was, and then she wasn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she was, then you must be able to remember her. What\u0027s her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027m not supposed to remember her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can. You\u0027re already doing it. Tell me about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember,\" said Seth, the faintest touch of frustration in his voice. \"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh tried a new tactic. \"How do you feel? How do you feel when you think of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel . . . wonderful. Complete. Happier than I ever believed possible. And yet . . . at the same time, I feel despair. I feel horrible. I want to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Why do you feel both happiness and despair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" said Seth. \"I don\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do. You can remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roman,\" I breathed, finding my voice at last. \"Make this stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe only shook his head, eyes riveted on Seth. Roman\u0027s entire body was filled with tension and eagerness, anxiously straining forward for the last pieces of info to fill out the theory he\u0027d put together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She . . . I loved her. She was my world. But she betrayed me. She betrayed me and tore my heart out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name,\" said Hugh, catching some of Roman\u0027s excitement. \"What was her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t remember,\" said Seth, shifting uncomfortably. \"It\u0027s too terrible. They made me forget. I want to forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t,\" said Roman, suddenly standing up. \"You didn\u0027t forget it. What is it? What is the woman\u0027s name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth\u0027s eyes flew open, either because of his own inner turmoil or from Roman breaking the trance. Either way, the calm state of relaxation was gone. Raw emotions played over Seth\u0027s features: shock, sorrow, hate. And as he gazed around and reoriented himself to his surroundings, his eyes - and all of those dark, terrible feelings - focused on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Letha,\" he gasped. \"Her name is Letha.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-revealed-georgina-kincaid-6/page-13.html","bookId":2059,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:40 AM"}
