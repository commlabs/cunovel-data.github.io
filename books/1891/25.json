An amazing smile when you use it on occasion. And fantastic tits. And yeah, I usually date blondes. But you’re a blonde. I think.” He laughed when my glower turned full on glare. “Doesn’t matter about the color. You never wear it down, and I can’t get the thought of you beneath me, and that hair spread out across my pillow while I move inside you, out of my head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I think mostly it’s your eyes. I want something from them no one else gets from them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what’s that?” I asked, my voice low, almost hoarse. His words had affected me as deeply as any aphrodisiac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soft.” His own voice had deepened with the highly sexual atmosphere. “Soft the way only a woman’s can be after she’s come for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped inwardly. Outwardly, I tilted my head to the side with a wry grin. “You’re good with the words, I’ll give you that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m good with my hands. Will you let me give you that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and his grin widened, wicked and beautiful. I sighed, and shook my head again. “It sounds like more than just sex, Braden. You’re asking for companionship. That’s complicating things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? It’s just two friends going on a few dates and having sex afterwards.” He sensed my unmoving doubt on that one because he shrugged. “Look, when have I ever gotten serious about a woman? I want you, you want me. It’s hanging over what should have been a perfectly nice friendship, so let’s just deal with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But adding date nights into it? Doesn’t that extend the time period on this thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I saw a flash of annoyance in his eyes, but it was gone with a flicker of his lashes. “You want to put a time period on it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A month.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he grinned, realizing I was giving in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. I was giving in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. “Two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at one another and as if it suddenly occurred to us we were talking about how long we were intending to explore a sexual relationship with each other, the already hot tension between us burned deeper, and thickened the air. It was like someone had lassoed a rope around the two of us and was tugging and tugging, trying to draw us closer. An image of us in my bed, naked and writhing, flashed across my mind and my body instantly responded. Panties sufficiently damp, my nipples joined the party and tightened—visibly. Braden’s eyes dropped to my breasts and started to smolder before they returned to my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Done,” I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis next question was unexpected but practical. “Are you on the pill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d had irregular, heavy periods so yes I was on the pill to stop that. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you been checked?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what he meant. And after my last sexual encounter and the whole not remembering what the hell had happened, yeah… I’d been checked for STDs. “Yes. Have you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After every relationship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I guess we’re good to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words were barely out of my mouth before Braden was standing above me, his large hand reaching out for mine, his face determined, serious. His eyes blazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Now?” I squeaked, totally unprepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked an eyebrow. “You want to wait?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just… I thought I’d have time to get ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get ready?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know… perfume, nice lingerie…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a grunt of amusement, Braden took hold of my wrist and hauled me out of my chair. My small body slammed into his and his arms came instantly around me, holding me to him. A hand slid down my hip and around to my butt. He squeezed it lightly and pressed me against him, his erection hard against my belly. I stifled a moan, tilting my head back to meet his eyes. They glittered down at me. “Babe, nice lingerie is for seducing a man. I’m already fucking seduced.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, but-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth cut me off, crushing against mine, his tongue seeking immediate entry. His kiss was deep and wet and it said ‘this isn’t a date, this is sex’. That was fine by me. I groaned and slid my arms up around his neck and Braden took that as my acquiescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne minute I was on the ground, the next I was in Braden’s arms, my legs around his waist, my hands in his hair as we kissed and bit and nipped and licked at each other’s mouths, learning the taste and feel of one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” Braden responded, the burr of the word vibrating against my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo time to complain about him leaving my mouth, I felt the air blow through my hair and we were moving into the hall, down the hall, into my bedroom and then I was falling. I hit the mattress with a surprised ‘oof’ and stared up at Braden indignantly. “Was that necessary?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Strip,” he answered gruffly, unbuttoning his shirt with quick, nimble fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sex clenched. My jaw did too. “Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped what he was doing and leaned down over me, his hands on either side of my hips on the mattress, his face in mine. “A second proposal: when we’re fucking, you don’t argue with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bu-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jocelyn,” he murmured in warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes dropped to his mouth, the mouth I wanted back on mine. If that meant not arguing during sex, fine. I’d just argue with him when we weren’t having sex. “Why do you insist on calling me Jocelyn?” I made sure my tone wasn’t argumentative, just curious. Because I was curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips touched mine, soft, gentle, and he pulled back, those pale blue eyes of his bright with heat. “Joss is a girl’s name. Possibly a tomboy’s name.” He smirked. “Jocelyn, on the other hand, is a woman’s name. A really sexy woman’s name.” He pulled back. “So strip, Jocelyn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. He could call me Jocelyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up and lifted the hem of my shirt, pulling it up and over my head. I threw it across the room and took a moment to watch Braden strip out of his own shirt. It dropped to the floor and I watched it, before letting my eyes travel back upwards. I smiled in anticipation at the sight of the hard-on tenting his pants, and then my mouth went dry as I took in his naked torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBraden worked out. Like really worked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waist of his pants hung low showing off his flat stomach and the sexy v-cut of his muscles there. I bit my lip. I wanted to touch him. My eyes followed his six-pack up to a strong chest and broad-shoulders. And it was all nicely wrapped up in unblemished golden skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, Jocelyn.” I looked up and found his gaze blazing even brighter than before. “If you keep looking at me like that, this is going to be over far sooner than I’d like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmm. I liked that. I liked that I had power over him. “Well, we can’t have that.” I grinned saucily, and reached around to undo my bra. The cold air hit my naked breasts as I dropped the bra off the side of the bed and this time I was treated to Braden’s perusal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes drifted from my chest to my face and suddenly he looked a little angry. I stiffened in surprise. “Do you know what it’s been like for me since that day in the flat? Sitting across from you in bars, at dinner, knowing that underneath all the attitude is every man’s fucking fantasy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, he was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed as he reached for the buttons and zip on his suit pants. The zip slid down loudly. “I’m going to make you pay for making me wait to have you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throbbing between the legs got worse. Sounds good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached up and unwound my hair, letting it fall around my shoulders in all its glory, shivering as the need in Braden’s eyes sharpened. “Fine,” I agreed huskily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know which one of us got our pants off faster after that, but one minute I was trying to take back some control with all my sexy attitude and hair. The next minute I was panty-less on my back, my breasts pressed against Braden’s chest, my thighs spread open to accommodate him between my legs… and I was staring up into his eyes, breathless with anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you waiting for?” I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gave me a wry smile. “For you to back out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI huffed in annoyance. “I’m naked aren’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So? You have been before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Braden!” I hit his shoulder as he chuckled softly, and his laughter caused his lower body to move–that long, thick, delicious cock of his sliding down over my belly and back up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped at the pulse of pleasure the tease of the action caused and Braden groaned in answer, his lips falling on mine. I’m sure the kiss was meant to be slow, sexy, tormenting. It started out that way. But weeks of forestalling this moment had made us both a little impatient. The kiss grew aggressive, bruising, my hands gripping tight to his hair, his hands kneading my waist, my ribs, my breasts. My breasts were particularly sensitive, and when his thumb brushed my nipple, my hips jerked against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You like that, babe,” he murmured, not really asking since the answer was obvious. His lips trailed kisses down my jaw and neck, my hands slipping out of his hair to his shoulders as he stopped at my right breast. He placed a soft, deliberate kiss to the rise of it and I swear I stopped breathing. Another kiss. Another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Braden…” I begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt him smile against my breast just before I felt the wet heat of his tongue against my nipple as his lips closed around it, drawing it in deep. A sharp lance of lust shot through my sex. “God, Braden!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did the same to the other breast and I found myself tilting my hips into his, more impatient it seemed than even he was. Then again, it had been longer for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Babe,” his voice rumbled above me as his hand slid down to my hip, stilling me. “Are you wet for me yet, Jocelyn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. God yes. “Braden…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Answer me.” I could feel his hand moving downwards; felt the graze of his fingers high on my inner thigh, teasing me. “Tell me you’re wet for me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-dublin-street-on-dublin-street-1/page-25.html","bookId":1891,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:04:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:04:54 PM"}
