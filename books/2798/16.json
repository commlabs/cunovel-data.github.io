I finish it with black silver-studded heels. I feel good in this dress. Although the back is so low you can’t wear underwear with it which I feel a little uncomfortable with but the girls swear you can’t tell. I put on a little eyeliner and mascara and finish with a light pink gloss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrive at The White Rabbit around 11pm and walk right up to B-Rock who smiles at us and says, “I was wonderin’ if I’d ever see you girls again. Thanks for not breakin’ my heart.” He winks and lets us in. Mimi rubs his bald head, Lola pats his cheek, Nat winks back at him and when I walk past him, I put my hand on his chest and kiss his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe club is pumping and we’re giddy. We walk straight up stairs to be greeted by Asian Alice who smiles at us and says, “Ah, the Safira party has arrived. Right this way, ladies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone knows us!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like a rock star!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsian Alice walks us to our huge booth and takes our first drink orders. We decide on cherry bombs which is a bad idea because these babies go straight to my head but I cave. All they are is Red Bull and cherry vodka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been sitting, chatting, and laughing for an hour and a half. We’re finishing our third drinks when I see Mimi smiling at something behind me. I turn and all the guys are there walking toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile a hugely stupid smile. I’m so happy to see them even though I just saw them some hours ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey look hawt!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrick and Ghost wear what I assume is their uniform which is a tight black V-neck t-shirt over black slacks and dress shoes. Max is wearing a black button up shirt over black jeans and dress shoes. And last but definitely not least is Nik. He’s wearing a white button up shirt over dark blue jeans and dress shoes and looks oh-so-yummy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the girls stand to exchange hugs and greetings, then we all sit back down. A waitress brings the guys a drink I hadn’t know they’d ordered and she also brings us another round. I’m already fuzzy headed. I haven’t eaten anything since lunch with Ceecee. Stupidly, I shoot the rest of my drink and pick up my fourth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik has chosen the seat next to me and I’m glad. I put my hand on his thigh and scootch over to be closer to him. He smiles down at me and puts his arm around my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make eye contact with Mimi who pokes her tongue out at me and shoots me a cruel smile. She speaks loudly so everyone can hear her, “I have a great idea. Who wants to play Truth or Truth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSon of a Big Mac… I’ll cut a bitch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knows I hate these games. They’re always dirty and give me hives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlucky for me, everyone agrees. Mimi goes first. “Max, have you ever fantasized about someone other than the person you were actually having sex with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, “Yep. I have. I was dating this girl in high school and every time I closed my eyes I’d see Christie Brinkley.” Everyone laughs with him and he asks, “Okay, Nat. If I were a food what would I be and how would you eat me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud chorus of Ooooooh crosses the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat takes it all in stride and says, “Well, I guess you’d be an ice cream.” She looks at Max with lowered eyes and makes her voice sultry. “I loooove ice cream. I like to lick it up slowly, especially when it runs down the cone.” She takes Max’s hand and licks his finger slowly. Max’s eye flutter closed and he looks like he’s in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re all laughing so hysterically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost doesn’t look impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat puts Max’s hand in his lap and he adjusts himself through his pants. “Damn girl, you gave me a semi.” She bursts out laughing and says, “Okay, Nik. What’s the most embarrassing thing you’ve ever done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretches his arms over his head and smiles. “When I was in fourth grade I had a crush on my teacher.” He chuckles at himself. “I wanted her to be my girlfriend. So, one afternoon I went to her house with flowers and candy. I rang the doorbell.” He puts a hand over his face. “And her husband answered the door. I dropped the shit and ran like hell.” After we stop laughing, he says, “Mimi, have you ever masturbated?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrick puts his arm around her and tells her, “Coz you know I’d be happy to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flashes a huge grin and says, “Yep. At least twice a week. Sorry guys but sometimes you just need to please yourself.” The guys groan in agony. Mimi asks, “Lola, who was the first guy you let touch your boobs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLola looks up and thinks hard. She tells us, “I think I was fifteen and barely had any boobs. It was my cousin’s best friend Frankie, he was sixteen and he gave me my first kiss and went in for a feelski. I didn’t mind though ‘coz he was hot.” She looks around the table. “Meanwhile, I saw him at church the other week. He was sporting a bald head and a pot belly! So lucky I didn’t end up with him. Trick, have you ever peed in a pool?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrick leans back in his chair with a goofy grin and says, “Yep! Just the other day at the gym.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all scoff in disgust and he defends himself with, “It don’t matter, all the chemicals kill the pee! Max, what was the worst pick up line you ever used and did it work?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax smiles and says,“I told a girl once I’d lost my bed and asked if I could borrow hers. She wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed. But I did get laid that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all boo and hiss. Max looks right at me and asks, “Teeny Tina, have you ever watched porn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap on a biscuit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh. I- Uh.” I cover my face with my hands and nod. I hear everyone laugh and can feel Nik’s arm tighten around my body shaking. I drop my hands and turn my flushed face and bright red neck to Ghost. “Ghost, what kind of underwear are you wearing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost smirks at me and answers quietly, “I would tell you if I were wearin’ any.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls whoop and the guys groan. He just smiles and asks, “Lola, what’s the strangest name someone’s asked to call you in bed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLola’s shoulders shake with silent laughter and she replies, “There was a guy who called me puppy and wanted me to bark like a dog.” Her body shakes and tears fall down her smiling face. “I didn’t like him enough to put up with that shit.” Lola looks at Trick with a shy smile and asks, “Trick, what do you find most sexy in a woman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at her with a slow smile. It’s a genuine smile and says softly, “I’m not sure, little Lola. Look in a mirror and let me know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all whoop and Lola blushes as red as a tomato.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrick looks at Nik and smirks, “What’s the fastest you’ve ever come?” Everyone bursts into laughter. Nik chuckles and says, “I think the first time I ever had sex I lasted about twenty seconds.” We’re all in hysterics. Nik interrupts our laughter with, “I’d like to let everyone know I’ve vastly improved since then!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik tugs my hair and I’m afraid to look at him. I know I’m next. He asks, “Tina, how many men have you slept with?” The whole table quiets down and my girls send me sympathetic smiles. I clear my throat and answer, “I’ve only ever slept with one guy. And it was a while ago.” I feel Nik’s body still against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax looks shocked but continues to probe, “Well then that question’s not valid. When is the last time you had sex?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty seconds pass and I hold up my hand extending my thumb and all my fingers. Max looks at my hand and says, “Five months? That’s rough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat shifts in her chair. Lola looks at the table. Mimi shoots me an apologetic look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper, “F- Five years.” I feel Nik’s body stiffen. Rock solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence is deafening. And I think I saw a tumble weed roll past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax whispers loudly, “No Fuckin’ Way!” He leans closer to me and asks, “How are you not masturbating at the table right now?! You must have a will of steel. That’s amazing, babe.” He sounds respectful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhh, Thanks Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI avoid the shocked stares of the guys and sympathetic smiles of the girls. I shrug and ask, “Anyone need a fresh drink? I certainly do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore anyone can answer I walk over to the bar and order another cherry bomb. I’m stumbling slightly and feeling loose. I’m tipsy and it feels good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk back to the booth. Trick and Ghost have left to do some work. Nat has gone to the bathroom. Nik pats his lap. I lower myself and sit sideways on him. He lifts my hair, puts his mouth to my ear and says, “I’m sorry for putting you on the spot, honey. If I knew it would make you uncomfortable I would never have asked that question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a hand on his chest and with a smile say, “That’s okay Niki. It is what it is. I can’t deny it.” I lift my drink to sip at it and miss my mouth completely. I may be a little more than tipsy. I spill my drink down the front of Nik’s shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trill, “Holy buckets! I’m so sorry, Nik.” I use my hand to wipe the drink off his shirt but all I do is smear the bright orange liquid over even more of it. He takes my hands and I look up at him. He’s smiling hard at me, dimple and all. He says, “I keep a spare shirt in my office. I’ll go change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move off his lap and as he goes to move away I hold on to his hand. “I’ll go with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik smiles and pulls me closer to him. “C’mon, honey.” He leads me into a hall behind the bar and opens the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt opens opposite the ‘chill out’ room. I follow him to his office and he starts unbuttoning his shirt. I know I should look away but I’m a bit drunk and I want to see what he’s got hiding there. He has all the buttons down the front open and he’s working on the sleeves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asks, “Can you please get my other shirt from over there?” He nods to the clothes hanger in the corner. I grab the freshly laundered garment and take off the wrapper. Underneath is the silk lilac shirt he was wearing the day we met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI state, “You were wearing this the day I met you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirks and says softly, “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he takes off his wet shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly smokes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik is even better looking without a shirt. His abs are clearly defined. He has a small smatter of chest hair. His arms are amazing! They’re muscular and have veins running up them. He has tattoos, too. His jeans fall low on his hips. On his right hip is a tattoo of a cross. On his right bicep is a large printed tattoo that looks like XAOC. I have no idea what that is. He’s removed his watch. His wrist has a tattoo on the inside. It says Ceecee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAww, I love Ceecee, too!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind his left ear is a tribal tattoo that comes down to his neck. Still shirtless, he turns and I think I gasp out loud. His entire back is tattooed. One big picture. It’s a bit scary actually. There are seven blank eyed angels up in the clouds holding swords of flame. They’re fighting off five devil-like creatures with horns on their heads and pointy tails that are reaching in to the clouds. It literally gives me shivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik breaks me out of my spell when he pulls the lilac shirt on. Once he’s buttoned up he holds out his hand, I take it and we exit his office. As we make our way down the hall Nik stops suddenly. He puts a finger to his mouth and I quiet myself. There are banging noises coming from the opposite end of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tiptoe to the conference room and the noise get louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang-Clink-Moan-Thump-Groan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik smirks and puts his ear to the door. His body shakes with silent laughter and he motions for me to come closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes wide, I put my ear to the door and listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl. “Oh my god.” Thump-Clink-Bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guy. “Fuck, you feel good.” Moan-Groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl. “Oh God. You’re amazing!” Moan. “I still hate you. Ooooh.” Thump-Clink-Bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy. “I hate you too, pretty girl.” Groan. “Fuck me, do that again.” Groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know that voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s Nat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up to Nik with a hand over my mouth. His eyes are dancing. He mouths, “Ghost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost moans again then says, “Say my name, pretty girl.” Thump-Bang-Thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat groans, “Ghost! Fuck me, Ghost!” Bang-Clink-Thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No baby, say my name.” Clink-Bang-Moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat pants, “Ash- Asher! Oh God, Ash... Harder Ash.” Groan-Thump-Bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost states, “Any harder and I’ll put you through the fuckin’ table!” Moan-Clink-Groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggle and Nik bursts into silent laughter. He pulls me back to his office, closes the door and we laugh hysterically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy best friend is shtupping broody Ghost!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik has his arms around my waist. I hold on to the front of his shirt. We laugh til we’re in tears. When we finally stop laughing we look into each other’s faces. I stop smiling. I want him so badly. And it’s not the booze talking. I want him to kiss me right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik’s also stopped smiling. I see him swallow hard. His face serious puts a hand to my belly and pushes me back gently til my back hits the wall. His amber eyes bore into me, they search my face. He lifts a hand to the side of my neck and moves his fingers slowly up and down my collarbone. I close my eyes and shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at me.” He says this firmly. It’s not a request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my eyes and he looks deeply into them before saying hoarsely, “I’m going to kiss you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHURRAH!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he does. He lowers his face til his lips softly touch mine. I huff in a shaky breath. Neither of us moves for seconds and its torture! It seems like days. My shoulders slump and my knees weaken when his tongue darts out to trace my lips. Luckily, the wall was doing a good job at holding me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp and he takes my weakness as an opportunity to kiss me deeply. He groans when his tongue touches mine. They dance together and I want to weep with joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow! Like… Wow!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarmth spreads through my belly to my core. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/friend-zoned-friend-zoned-1/page-16.html","bookId":2798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:23 PM"}
