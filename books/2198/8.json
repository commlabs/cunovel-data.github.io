Something had to change. I couldn\u0027t spend another night like this. I wondered if I should call Alcide and see if he\u0027d, ah, gone to the mattresses with his soldiers. Maybe they\u0027d let me have a corner? But the very idea of having to do that to feel safe made me angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t stop the thought from going through my head - If Quinn were here, I could stay in my own home without fear. And for a moment, I wasn\u0027t just worried about my missing wounded boyfriend, I was mad at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was ready to be mad at someone. There was too much loose emotion hanging around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, this was the beginning of a very special day, huh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Amelia. I had to assume she\u0027d spent the night with Pam. I didn\u0027t have any problem with their having a relationship. I simply wanted Amelia to be around because I was lonely and scared. Her absence left a little blank spot in my landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the air was cooler this morning. You could feel clearly that fall was on the way, was already in the ground waiting to leap up and claim the leaves and grass and flowers. I put on a sweater over my nightgown and went out on the front porch to drink my first cup of coffee. I listened to the birds for a while; they weren\u0027t as noisy as they were in the spring, but their songs and discussions let me know that nothing unusual was in the woods this morning. I finished my coffee and tried to plan out my day, but I kept running up against a mental roadblock. It was hard to make plans when you suspected someone might try to kill you. If I could tear myself away from the issue of my possibly impending death, I needed to vacuum the downstairs, do a load of my laundry, and go to the library. If I survived those chores, I had to go to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered where Quinn was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered when I\u0027d hear from my new great-grandfather again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if any more Weres had died during the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered when my phone would ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince nothing happened on my front porch, I dragged myself inside and did my usual morning get-ready routine. When I looked at the mirror, I was sorry I\u0027d troubled. I didn\u0027t look rested and refreshed. I looked like a worried person who hadn\u0027t gotten any sleep. I dabbed some concealer beneath my eyes and put on a little extra eye shadow and blush to give my face some color. Then I decided I looked like a clown and rubbed most of it off. After feeding Bob and scolding him for the litter of kittens, I checked all my locks again and hopped in the car to go to the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Renard Parish library, Bon Temps branch, is not a large building. Our librarian graduated from Louisiana Tech in Ruston, and she is a super lady in her late thirties named Barbara Beck. Her husband, Alcee, is a detective on the Bon Temps force, and I really hope Barbara doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s up to. Alcee Beck is a tough man who does good things... sometimes. He also does quite a few bad things. Alcee was lucky when he got Barbara to marry him, and he knows it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbara\u0027s the only full-time employee of the branch library, and I wasn\u0027t surprised to find her by herself when I pushed open the heavy door. She was shelving books. Barbara dressed in what I thought of as comfortable chic, meaning she picked out knits in bright colors and wore matching shoes. She favored chunky, bold jewelry, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Sookie,\" she said, smiling her big smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barbara,\" I said, trying to smile back. She noticed I wasn\u0027t my usual self, but she kept her thoughts to herself. Not really, of course, since I have my little disability, but she didn\u0027t say anything out loud. I put the books I was returning on the appropriate desk, and I began looking at the shelves of new arrivals. Most of them were some permutation on self-help. Going by how popular these books were and how often they were checked out, everyone in Bon Temps should have become perfect by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed up two new romances and a couple of mysteries, and even a science fiction, which I rarely read. (I guess I thought my reality was crazier than anything a science fiction writer could dream up.) While I was looking at the jacket of a book by an author I\u0027d never read, I heard a thunk in the background and knew someone had come in the back door of the library. I didn\u0027t pay attention; some people habitually used the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbara made a little noise, and I looked up. The man behind her was huge, at least six foot six, and whip thin. He had a big knife, and he was holding it to Barbara\u0027s throat. For a second I thought he was a robber, and I wondered who would ever think of robbing a library. For the overdue-book money?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t scream,\" he hissed through long sharp teeth. I froze. Barbara was in some space beyond fear. She was way into terror. But I could hear another active brain in the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone else was coming in the back door very quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective Beck will kill you for hurting his wife,\" I said very loudly. And I said it with absolute certainty. \"Kiss your ass good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know who that is and I don\u0027t care,\" the tall man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better care, muthafucker,\" said Alcee Beck, who\u0027d stepped up behind him silently. He put his gun to the man\u0027s head. \"Now, you let go of my wife and you drop that knife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sharp Teeth wasn\u0027t about to do that. He spun, pushed Barbara at Alcee, and ran right toward me, knife raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw a Nora Roberts hardback at him, whacking him upside his head. I extended my foot. Blinded by the impact of the book, Sharp Teeth tripped over the foot, just as I\u0027d hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell on his own knife, which I hadn\u0027t planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe library fell abruptly silent except for Barbara\u0027s gasping breath. Alcee Beck and I stared down at the creeping pool of blood coming out from under the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-oh,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welllllll... shit,\" said Alcee Beck. \"Where\u0027d you learn to throw like that, Sookie Stackhouse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Softball,\" I said, which was the literal truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you can imagine, I was late to work that afternoon. I was even more tired than I had been to start with, but I was thinking that I might live through the day. So far, two times in a row, fate had intervened to prevent my assassination. I had to assume that Sharp Teeth had been sent to kill me and had botched it, just as the fake highway patrolman had done. Maybe my luck wouldn\u0027t hold a third time; but there was a chance it would. What were the odds that another vampire would take a bullet for me, or that, by sheer accident, Alcee Beck would drop off his wife\u0027s lunch that she\u0027d left at home on the kitchen counter? Slim, right? But I\u0027d beaten those odds twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what the police were officially assuming (since I didn\u0027t know the guy and no one could say I did - and he\u0027d seized Barbara, not me), Alcee Beck now had me in his sights. He was really good at reading situations, and he had seen that Sharp Teeth was focused on me. Barbara had been a means to get my attention. Alcee would never forgive me for that, even if it hadn\u0027t been my fault. Plus, I\u0027d thrown that book with suspicious force and accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his place, I would probably feel the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now I was at Merlotte\u0027s, going through the motions in a weary way, wondering where to go and what to do and why Patrick Furnan had gone nuts. And where had all these strangers come from? I hadn\u0027t known the Were who\u0027d broken down Maria-Star\u0027s door. Eric had been shot by a guy who\u0027d worked at Patrick Furnan\u0027s dealership only a few days. I\u0027d never seen Sharp Teeth before, and he was an unforgettable kind of guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole situation made no sense at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I had an idea. I asked Sam if I could make a phone call since my tables were quiet, and he nodded. He\u0027d been giving me those narrow looks all evening, looks that meant he was going to pin me down and talk to me soon, but for now I had a breather. So I went into Sam\u0027s office, looked in his Shreveport phone book to get the listing for Patrick Furnan\u0027s home, and I called him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognized the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick Furnan?\" I said, just to be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you trying to kill me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Who is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on. It\u0027s Sookie Stackhouse. Why are you doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you trying to trap me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How? You think I got the phone tapped? I want to know why. I never did anything to you. I\u0027m not even dating Alcide. But you\u0027re trying to off me like I am powerful. You killed poor Maria-Star. You killed Christine Larrabee. What\u0027s with this? I\u0027m not important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick Furnan said slowly, \"You really believe it\u0027s me doing this? Killing female pack members? Trying to kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not me. I read about Maria-Star. Christine Larrabee is dead?\" He sounded almost frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, and my voice was as uncertain as his. \"And someone\u0027s tried to kill me twice. I\u0027m afraid some totally innocent person is going to get caught in the cross fire. And of course, I don\u0027t want to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurnan said, \"My wife disappeared yesterday.\" His voice was ragged with grief and fear. And anger. \"Alcide\u0027s got her, and that fucker is going to pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alcide wouldn\u0027t do that,\" I said. (Well, I was pretty sure Alcide wouldn\u0027t do that.) \"You\u0027re saying you didn\u0027t order the hits on Maria-Star and Christine? And me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, why would I go for the women? We never want to kill pure-blooded female Weres. Except maybe Amanda,\" Furnan added tactlessly. \"If we\u0027re going to kill someone, it\u0027d be the men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you and Alcide need to have a sit-down. He doesn\u0027t have your wife. He thinks you\u0027ve gone crazy, attacking women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. Furnan said, \"I think you\u0027re right about that sit-down, unless you made up this whole thing to get me into a position where Alcide can kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to live to see the next week myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll agree to meet with Alcide if you\u0027ll be there and if you\u0027ll swear to tell each of us what the other is thinking. You\u0027re a friend of the pack, all the pack. You can help us now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick Furnan was so anxious to find his wife he was even willing to believe in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of the deaths that had already taken place. I thought of the deaths that were to come, perhaps including my own. I wondered what the hell was going on. \"I\u0027ll do it if you and Alcide will sit down unarmed,\" I said. \"If what I suspect is true, you have a common enemy who\u0027s trying to get you two to kill each other off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that black-haired bastard will agree to it, I\u0027ll give it a shot,\" said Furnan. \"If Alcide has my wife, not a hair on her body better be disturbed, and he better bring her with him. Or I swear to God I\u0027ll dismember him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand. I\u0027ll make sure he understands, too. We\u0027ll be getting back with you,\" I promised, and I hoped with all my heart that I was telling the truth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-dead-to-worse-sookie-stackhouse-8/page-8.html","bookId":2198,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:11 PM"}
