She quickly turned around, seeing Cirvanas sneaking looks at her while hiding, his face incredibly pale. As soon as they made eye contact, the youth immediately turned his head like a startled rabbit, pretending to not have seen anything. Cirvanas’ acting skills really were quite terrible, and even he himself understood this well. However, the young man knew that if he tried to run, it would only end even worse for him. How could he escape from Madeline’s hands? This scandal covering cloth was best left untouched.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCirvanas didn’t know what Madeline was thinking about just now, only feeling thick killing energy continuously emit from her body. Meanwhile, that alloy heavy sword that brought death to countless individuals seemed incredibly frail under her hands, twisting and warping as she wished. Madeline’s slender and exquisite hands weren’t unfamiliar to Cirvanas at all, patting his head all too often. When he saw the alloy heavy sword’s conclusion, no matter how the young man thought, he didn’t feel that his skull would ever reach the rigidity of the alloy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMadeline’s current mood really wasn’t all that good, but when she thought to herself, it didn’t really seem proper for her to do much to the young man.

If she wanted to repair it, the only way would be to smelt and cast it again. However, the heavy cast needed to reach at least three thousand degrees, so where would she find these types of conditions? That was why the heavy sword could be considered to be completely ruined. Even the toughest alloy was a limitation, simply unable to endure Madeline’s ravage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eJust as the young lady was at a loss with her heavy sword, Su already found a safe place several kilometers out, burying himself inside the ice layer to slowly digest Pandora’s gift.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePandora’s genes were already separated from his blood, separated into several hundred pieces. Su’s body was currently instinctively evolving and deciphering it. His body even produced a brand new small organ that only carried tissue liquid, Pandora’s bone matter floating within it. The liquid inside of that organ bubbled like boiling liquid, countless fine bubbles produced from that skeletal fragment. Inside of this organ, the bodily liquid carried at least a hundred different types of cells, currently using all types of methods to attack this bone piece to break it down. Su’s consciousness continuously maneuvered and traced its internal composition, but both the composition and structure of this piece of bone were extremely unusual, completely different from any known creature. The rigidity of the bone itself was comparable to an alloy, and when Su scanned it with his spiritual power, it would deviate and scatter because of its complex internal structure, making it so that he could only examine the incredibly shallow first layer. Cross-Sectional Detection was completely ineffective.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEven though the process was difficult and complex, inside of that newly created organ, everything was neat and tidy. It was as if a small, yet complex, complete biochemistry laboratory was created in Su’s body, and several hundred experiments were being carried out at the same time. Moreover, there were already over a thousand experiments waiting to be started.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEverything was neat and tidy, to the point where it made one feel despair.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s body instinctively operated according to his own rhythm and method, and he was currently assuming control over more and more areas. What Su needed to do was only give the order, and then wait for the result. In addition, most of the time, the results were good to an unbelievable degree. Su’s body seemed to know exactly what to do under almost any situation, and the tasks were completed with the highest degree of efficiency. For example, when absorbing and breaking down unknown biological genes, it would oftentimes directly break off the pieces it needed, and then store the remainder as backup. During this process, Su’s body seemed to instinctively understand what was useful for himself. When Su felt like he was lacking in battle, wishing to develop abilities in a certain direction, his body would fetch the necessary parts from the backup storage of genes that grew by the day, then finally piece together a new fragment to be inserted into the genes that were in use. In addition, it would even ration out the necessary energy, nutrients, and consume the necessary evolutionary points, thus producing new tissues or modify existing organ tissues to produce the new ability.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf these things weren’t enough to prove that Su’s instincts were trying to awaken through some type of unknown method, then the absorption and decomposition of Pandora’s genes, as well as the analysis of the bone matter’s composition was completely enough to prove that his so-called body’s instinctive functions, from certain perspectives, actually possessed unimaginable intelligence.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s brain was currently operating at high speed, his brain divided through a certain method into several thousand processing cores, each region possessing its own independent operation and analysis ability. They were all allocated different jobs, and in the end, they would come together to produce a result. This process was a bit similar to the olden-era’s large-scale computer made up of several thousand processors, but there was still a fundamental difference. Su’s brain could not only carry out a vague processing, but was also able to accurately process data; this was something computers could not do at all. Right now, in Su’s brain, it was more similar to several thousand miniature human brains thinking together. Moreover, there was an invisible hand coordinating them, placing different data, distributing different missions to each processing core, and then conducting a summarized analysis result. The entire process didn’t have a single mistake, having not only the highly effective precision of an intelligence system, but also the intellectual analysis abilities intelligence systems weren’t equipped with.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe formless hand above all the processing cores was the pivotal factor. What kind of mechanism did it operate through, how could it distinguish between the sea of original data, formulate the direction and missions for analysis, and distribute it to the various processing cores? Even more importantly, what exactly was it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThere was no way to obtain the answers to these questions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-5-chapter-13-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-5-chapter-13-3\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-5-chapter-13-2","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM"}
