I owed you one for something you probably don’t even know you did for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at him, frowning in confusion. “What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe secretive smile kept playing around his mouth. “I’ll tell you about it sometime. But not yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed even more. I didn’t like how mysterious he was being. He didn’t seem to mind, though. He kept talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aside from that, there’s the fact I had to be the asshole who told you about your family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched, not wanting to go there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I feel like shit about that, man. And you had nowhere to go, no one to contact for help, no money for...fuck, anything. I wanted to make it up to you somehow. So I took you in and offered you a job because it was the first thing I could think to do. It was what you needed most.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to tell him he didn’t owe me shit—even if I had unknowingly done him a favor once upon a time—I could take care of myself. But he held up a hand. “And then I also felt inclined to keep tabs on you in case Felicity wanted to know where to find you when I told her you were out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust hearing her name slayed me. I winced and kept my eyes averted. “I can’t keep you from telling her, can I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.” He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffed, irritated that I couldn’t control this; she was going to find out about my release and whereabouts. Soon. But I still tried to fight it. “Well, I don’t see how she’d care to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you?” Pick murmured. “I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at him, wondering what the hell that meant. He’d used the words friendship and loyalty when talking about her, but just how the hell close were they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had she told him about us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid this mean she wanted to see me again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crazy, anxious hope raced through me, but I swallowed it down. Didn’t matter what she wanted. Didn’t matter what I wanted. After what I’d become, the safest place for her was as far away from me as I could keep her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t ever let me work with her,” I growled, piercing Pick with a deadly serious glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth as if to argue, so I waved a hand toward the dent in his wall. “Just look at what I did. I’m fucked up. I don’t want her anywhere near that.” I didn’t want her to see me like this; I didn’t even want her to know I was like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePick blinked away an expression of shock, but then nodded as if he understood. “Don’t worry. I’ve already scheduled it so none of your shifts coincide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “Good.” That was all I needed to hear. “I’ll find some homeless shelter or something to stay in tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot bothering to wait until I was dismissed, I stormed toward the door, but he called, “No, you won’t. I trust you, Knox. I trust you to sleep in the same apartment as my family, the same bed with my little boy and girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at him, shocked, and he nodded. “Yeah, we saw that they’d crawled in with you in the middle of the night, and we didn’t move them. Because both Tinker Bell and I trust you. We know you’d never hurt them. Don’t take that lightly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped and looked away, because shit, I didn’t take such conviction lightly. It humbled me, yet made me feel worse, because I knew I didn’t deserve it. Just what did he think he saw in me that was so reliable, and how in the hell could he have any kind of faith in me when I had none in myself? After what I’d just done? When my biggest fear these days was myself? How could he be so sure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething dark dwelled inside me now, something black and violent and ugly, like a stain on my soul that could never be washed away. I hadn’t been in control of myself at all when I’d destroyed his office. That scared me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should never be trusted near anything that anyone deemed valuable. And to me, Felicity Bainbridge topped that list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to take off in a few minutes,” Pick said. “You can get one of the guys to drop you off at my place after work, I’m sure. I will see you in the morning, Knox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t argue with his determined dismissal. His belief in me made me want to believe in myself. It made me fucking hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing I’d probably regret it, but still unable to tell him no, I nodded my acceptance for now and left him there. I was still shaken when I returned to the front, but I was determined to do this, work for him and pay him back for all his faith and charity. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-52.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
