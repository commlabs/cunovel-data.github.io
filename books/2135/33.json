His panting, too, stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suspected, on some level, that his body had expired...that it was now being fueled supernaturally by the dark entity that had entered him. I also suspected his soul was now trapped in this supernaturally vivified body. Forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His mortality ends,\" said Hanner next to me. \"And his immortality begins. Everyone should be so lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang was closed off to me. Our connection was forever severed. I had mixed feelings about that. My connection to Fang had been turbulent, at best. At times, it had been comforting. To know that I had instant access to someone who seemed to legitimately care for me - and perhaps even love me in his own way - was a rock I had relied on for many months now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that Fang always had an ulterior motive. Considering how the man had grown up and issues he\u0027d dealt with, his ulterior motive would surprise no one. That he stalked and befriended and ultimately loved a real vampire should be of no surprise either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had seen more than enough of Fang\u0027s mind to know the man was single-mindedly obsessed. His desire to be a real vampire trumped anything, perhaps even his love for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I looked at him now, lying there quietly, I noted that the wound in his neck - the wound I, myself, had felt just the night before - had already healed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, his desire to be a vampire had trumped even his love for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you do it?\" I said to Hanner, without looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw his potential, Samantha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not stable,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not looking for stability. I\u0027m looking for potential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, understanding. \"His potential to kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So much potential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why you turned him,\" I said, looking at her. \"To kill for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe calmly looked up from Fang and at me. She held my gaze. The fire just behind her pupil flared brightly. \"He is his own free man, Samantha. But I am sure he will show his appreciation when I am done revealing to him all that I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re doing this because I shut down your operation,\" I said. \"You\u0027re punishing me. You\u0027re stealing my friend - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m giving him everything you wouldn\u0027t, Samantha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll create a killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will be tamed, Sam. Even the worst of our kind can be tamed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or they are removed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot kill what\u0027s already dead, Sam. The entity within will simply withdraw, sacrificing its existence for the betterment of our kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when the entity withdraws?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The body will perish. Instantly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanner winced slightly at my involuntary utterance, which I noted. The name \"Jesus\" had no effect on me, but it appeared to on Hanner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what happens to his soul?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His soul?\" asked Hanner, looking at me and making an almost comical effort to blink. \"But whatever do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His soul,\" I said, my voice rising. \"Where is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanner smiled and it was, perhaps, the most unpleasant smile I had ever seen on anyone. Ever. \"Why, Samantha. His soul is long gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of panic swept over me. I wrapped an arm around myself. Hanner\u0027s unpleasant smile remained frozen on her face. The smile was not human. She did not look human. She looked slightly misshapen, hunched. She looked like pure evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not Hanner,\" I said. \"You\u0027re the thing that lives in her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good, Samantha Moon,\" she said. Or it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re trying to freak me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanner continued smiling that wicked smile. Or the thing within her did. \"Is it working, child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to hell,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Been there, done that,\" it said in a monotone, tilting its head slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Hanner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s here. Next to me. Waiting. I\u0027ve come for the big show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big show?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanner nodded toward Fang, who lay motionless on the couch. \"I wouldn\u0027t miss his transformation for the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s in me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanner grinned, except I knew it was not Hanner grinning. \"One of us, child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hanner shook her head. \"Not now. Not now.\" And Hanner kept on shaking her head...and finally blinked. Hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was back, looking slightly confused, and the thing within her - the thing that galvanized her dead body - had retreated, and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat such an entity was in me, watching over me, living through me, was almost enough to drive me insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had to be a way to fight back. To remove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that thought, I remembered the angel, Ishmael. He had told me he knew of a way for me to be free, to forever remove the thing within me. I thought about that, even while Fang continued to lay motionless, his chest unmoving. But alive. Supernaturally alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang had gotten his wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was one of us now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-33.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
