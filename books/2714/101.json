I could never be sorry for any time I had with Caroline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, if you’re going to fire me, just fire me already, all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a scowl, Pick muttered, “I’m not going to fire you. Jesus, just...don’t ever do that in my office again...or anywhere in the club, and especially not while you’re on the clock. I can’t believe you and Caroline...” Shaking his head, he blew out a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to tell Gamble?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat question made him laugh. “You think I’m insane? I’m not getting any more involved in this mess than I already am. He’s going to find out eventually, and when he does, I’m going to be as far away from the both of you as geographically possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I said. “Well...thank for not telling him yet.” With a grateful nod, I started for the door, but Pick grabbed my shirt, stalling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just tell me she means something to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. Pick was ever the lady’s protector. I had to like that about the guy. But still, “Jesus, man. No. She’s just a worthless lay I plan to completely blow off tomorrow.” When he scowled at my sarcastic answer, I shoved at his arm to dislodge his hand from my clothes. “What the hell do you think? I’m risking the wrath of Noel Gamble to be with her. She means fucking everything to me.” When Pick’s mouth quirked with appreciation, I sighed. “Now, can I get back to work, boss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One more thing,” he murmured. “Can you at least wait until after Skylar’s birthday party this weekend to tell him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, totally not expecting to hear that request. “Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My little girl’s first birthday,” he reminded me. “Tink and I invited you all to come for a cookout.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” I said. “So what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I thought one more time seeing the entire gang together before you break us up, and we’re forced to pick sides, might be nice. Plus, I don’t want you fucking up her birthday with all your drama. Tinker Bell’s gone to a lot to plan this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roll of my eyes, I snickered. “Yeah, sure. For Milk Tits, I’ll refrain from telling my best friend I’m boinking his sister. Got it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus, you are so freaking vulgar. I have no idea what poor Caroline sees in you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline saw past the vulgar, I wanted to tell him, but I didn’t bother, because he was too busy adding, “And stop calling Tink Milk Tits already. Damn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left his office, laughing. No way could anyone keep me from calling Eva Mercer Milk Tits, but that had been a nice attempt. I was still in a good mood when I strolled back into the bar and got to work. I spotted Caroline minutes later, closer to Blondie. When she sent me a worried glance, I winked and showed her a thumbs-up, which made her shoulders slump with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe still had time before Gamble found out the truth, and all the shit drama hit the fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea what to buy a one-year-old, but I walked into Pick’s backyard that Saturday afternoon with what looked like a puppy’s chew toy. Milk Tits had cursed me out a few months earlier when she and Pick had thrown a birthday party for their boy. She’d sent me out to get him something and ordered me not to return until I’d gotten the rug rat a gift. So, this time around, I came prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilk Tits cheered her appreciation as soon as she saw me carrying the stupid pink gift bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe it,” she gasped, coming to me and thankfully relieving me of my gift. “Ten-Ten can be taught manners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it’s a fucking miracle.” I scowled at her as I tugged at the collar of my shirt. “Where’s the beer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of pointing me in the right direction, Milk Tits folded her arms over her chest and arched an eyebrow. “Before you drink anything, you and I are going to have us a little chat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, that didn’t sound good. Pick must’ve told her about me and Caroline. “I’m guessing you’re not going to tell me you want to name your next kid after me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted. “No. My next kid is already named, but thanks. What I want to know is what you think went through my head the moment I walked into Pick’s office the other day and found a used condom sitting in the top of his trash can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes flared wide. “Oh, shit. I am so sorry.” I totally hadn’t even thought of that scenario. But then I frowned. “Wait, you didn’t really think he’d cheated on you, did you?” She and Pick were about as attached as Gamble and his woman, Hamilton and Blondie, Lowe and Buttercup. Those couples just didn’t cheat. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-101.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
