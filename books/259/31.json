You\u0027d better get off the hoss.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Walter felt that this was a command, and obeyed at once.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, gentlemen,” he said. “I will leave the horse in your hands, and depend upon you to return it to the owner.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As Walter spoke he turned to walk off, but the man who had first accosted him got in his way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t want to have any trouble with you, sir. Please get out of my way, and let me go.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not by a long shot.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What do you propose to do with me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Take you to the lockup.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Walter was now really alarmed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You\u0027ll have to go with us, young feller!” said Crane.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And leave the hoss?” asked Penton. “We\u0027d ought to take charge of it, and get the reward.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s so, Penton. You go and get a constable. We\u0027ll stand by the hoss.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Penton hurried off, and returned shortly with a constable in uniform.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What\u0027s up?” he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This young feller\u0027s rid into town with Colonel Richard Owen\u0027s hoss.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But I\u0027d ought to secure the hoss,” said the constable, who felt that perhaps he might be entitled to the reward offered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Look here, Cyrus Stokes, you secure the thief—that\u0027s your lookout.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Gentlemen,” said Walter, “I object to being called a thief. I have already told you I did not steal the horse.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The constable seized Walter by the arm and walked off with him. To add to his mortification, people whom they met on the street looked at him curiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3022/83606.html","bookId":259,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:01:26 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:01:26 AM"}
