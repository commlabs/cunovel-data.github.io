She looks over at Reeve and back at me. “Please. I need you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to get home before my curfew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Saturday night! Your mom always lets you stay out a little later on Saturday nights.” Rennie takes my hand in hers, and I know she’s not going to let me leave. “Just till midnight, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” I say with a sigh, “but I’m only watching. I’m not playing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me a grateful kiss on the cheek and pulls me over to the group that’s already formed on the floor. Alex is there, sitting next to Ashlin, his hair damp from the Jacuzzi. Jenn Barnes and Wendy Kamnikar, two juniors that Derek is friendly with, plant themselves across from them. I sit down next to Tyler Klask and PJ, a part of the circle but not completely. I’m checking my hair for split ends when Rennie says “Lillia first!” and thrusts the bottle at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth falls open. “Rennie!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be a spoilsport, Lil,” Rennie says, smiling at me. “Everyone has to play.” I narrow my eyes at her, but she just keeps smiling a sunny smile. “Hurry up and spin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Lil. Just say yes or she’ll never leave you alone,” PJ says in a low voice, nudging me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve, who’s watching me with this bemused look on his face, starts pounding his fists on the carpet. “Lilli-uh! Lilli-uh!” Everyone joins in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at everybody. “God, you guys! So immature.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlin spins the bottle and shouts, “This one’s for Lil!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt lands . . . on Reeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel my cheeks heat up as our eyes meet. I’m about to say No freaking way when Reeve reaches out and adjusts the bottle so it’s pointing at Alex. “I think it was going more in this direction,” Reeve says with a lazy grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” I object. “Interference!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex clears his throat and jokingly says, “Look, I don’t know what you’ve heard, but contrary to popular opinion, I’m not contagious or anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—I don’t think that! It’s just, those aren’t the rules.” I don’t want to kiss Reeve, and I definitely don’t want to kiss Alex. In fact, I don’t want to kiss anybody. Maybe I don’t want to kiss anyone ever again. At least not for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve raises an eyebrow. “I had no idea you wanted me so bad. I’m flattered, Cho.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s—that’s not what I’m saying, and you know it,” I say. I can feel myself getting flustered. Reeve’s always doing that. Twisting my words around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDerek says, “Reeve, just kiss her already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guys, don’t pressure her,” Rennie says hastily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, now she’s looking out for me? Give me a freaking break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust for that, I’m doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I crawl to the middle of the circle, I can’t seem to get a good deep breath. I sit on my knees, and I keep my palms flat on the ground to steady myself. Reeve leans toward me oh-so-slowly, dragging out the moment for as long as he can. He’s grinning at me, that smug self-satisfied grin I hate. I feel myself start to panic, but I try with all my might not to shrink away from him. If I freak out right now, everyone will see it and wonder why, and I can’t have that. I have to be normal. I have to pretend I’m the same girl I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve tips my face up, and that’s when something in his face changes. The grin drops and he’s staring into my eyes like he’s trying to puzzle something out. At the last second, instead of kissing my lips he plants a kiss at the top of my head, the kind my dad used to give me when he’d come in to say good night. I don’t know if I should feel grateful or insulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No fair,” Ashlin says, shaking her finger at Reeve. “It has to be on the mouth! Those are the rules.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePJ nods sagely and says, “Ash is right. Them’s the rules.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give it a rest,” Alex says. “He kissed her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve claps his hands together. “Who’s next?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawl back to my spot. I just want to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoudly Rennie says, “It’s Reeve’s turn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yay for me.” Reeve rubs his hands together and spins the bottle. Part of me hopes the bottle will land on Rennie so I can get out of here faster, but another part hopes it won’t, so she doesn’t get what she wants. The bottle doesn’t land on her. It lands on Josh Fletcher, and everyone busts up laughing. “Come on, Fletch. Don’t be scared,” Reeve says. “I’ll do you like I did Lillia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d better spin again, man,” Josh warns. “I don’t know where your lips have been.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve ends up spinning again, and this time it does land on Rennie. Grinning, he leans forward for a quick kiss. But Rennie has other ideas. She gets on her knees and inches across the circle until she’s right in front of him. She grabs a wad of his T-shirt and pulls him toward her. Then she kisses him like she wants to eat his face off. It starts close-mouthed, but a second later they are actually kissing kissing. She even puts her arms around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone starts whooping and screaming and freaking out. It’s so sad and gross. Rennie’s making a total fool of herself in front of everybody. Especially Reeve. He already let her down easy. It’s obvious he doesn’t want to date her, but it only makes Rennie want him more. It’s pathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER NINETEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMARY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSENOR TREMONT IS LINING UP A BUNCH OF PLASTIC vegetables on his desk and asking for volunteers to role-play a scene at a Spanish marketplace, and all I can do is smile at Alex’s empty seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night was maybe the most fun I’ve ever had. Sneaking out with Lillia and Kat, laughing our butts off, speeding through the darkness. When I got home, I crept back into bed and tried to sleep, but that was pretty much impossible. I just lay there in the dark, tracing the flowers on my wallpaper with my finger and thinking how this was even better than what I’d hoped to accomplish that first day. This isn’t just about Reeve. It’s about me, and it feels like fate or magic—the girls coming into my life, right when I needed them most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the window I spot Alex getting out of a car. A woman—his mom, I guess—waves good-bye and drives off. I watch him run all the way to the main doors. I hear Alex’s feet pounding the linoleum, over Senor Tremont haggling with the girl sitting behind me over how many pimentos he can buy for three euros. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burn-for-burn-burn-for-burn-1/page-30.html","bookId":2726,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:24 PM"}
