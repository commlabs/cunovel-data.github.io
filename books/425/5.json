And one time he was resting he took notice of a wild briar bush, with blossoms on it, that was growing beside a rath, and it brought to mind the wild roses he used to bring to Mary Lavelle, and to no woman after her. And he tore off a little branch of the bush, that had buds on it and open blossoms, and he went on with his song:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;The little fox he murmured,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0027O what of the world\u0027s bane?\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;The sun was laughing sweetly,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;The moon plucked at my rein;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;But the little red fox murmured,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u0027O do not pluck at his rein,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;He is riding to the townland\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;That is the world\u0027s bane.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he went on climbing the hill, and left the rath, and there came to his mind some of the old poems that told of lovers, good and bad, and of some that were awakened from the sleep of the grave itself by the strength of one another\u0027s love, and brought away to a life in some shadowy place, where they are waiting for the judgment and banished from the face of God.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And at last, at the fall of day, he came to the Steep Gap of the Strangers, and there he laid himself down along a ridge of rock, and looked into the valley, that was full of grey mist spreading from mountain to mountain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And it seemed to him as he looked that the mist changed to shapes of shadowy men and women, and his heart began to beat with the fear and the joy of the sight. And his hands, that were always restless, began to pluck off the leaves of the roses on the little branch, and he watched them as they went floating down into the valley in a little fluttering troop.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Suddenly he heard a faint music, a music that had more laughter in it and more crying than all the music of this world. And his heart rose when he heard that, and he began to laugh out loud, for he knew that music was made by some who had a beauty and a greatness beyond the people of this world. And it seemed to him that the little soft rose leaves as they went fluttering down into the valley began to change their shape till they looked like a troop of men and women far off in the mist, with the colour of the roses on them. And then that colour changed to many colours, and what he saw was a long line of tall beautiful young men, and of queen-women, that were not going from him but coming towards him and past him, and their faces were full of tenderness for all their proud looks, and were very pale and worn, as if they were seeking and ever seeking for high sorrowful things. And shadowy arms were stretched out of the mist as if to take hold of them, but could not touch them, for the quiet that was about them could not be broken. And before them and beyond them, but at a distance as if in reverence, there were other shapes, sinking and rising and coming and going, and Hanrahan knew them by their whirling flight to be the Sidhe, the ancient defeated gods; and the shadowy arms did not rise to take hold of them, for they were of those that can neither sin nor obey. And they all lessened then in the distance, and they seemed to be going towards the white door that is in the side of the mountain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The mist spread out before him now like a deserted sea washing the mountains with long grey waves, but while he was looking at it, it began to fill again with a flowing broken witless life that was a part of itself, and arms and pale heads covered with tossing hair appeared in the greyness. It rose higher and higher till it was level with the edge of the steep rock, and then the shapes grew to be solid, and a new procession half lost in mist passed very slowly with uneven steps, and in the midst of each shadow there was something shining in the starlight. They came nearer and nearer, and Hanrahan saw that they also were lovers, and that they had heart-shaped mirrors instead of hearts, and they were looking and ever looking on their own faces in one another\u0027s mirrors. They passed on, sinking downward as they passed, and other shapes rose in their place, and these did not keep side by side, but followed after one another, holding out wild beckoning arms, and he saw that those who were followed were women, and as to their heads they were beyond all beauty, but as to their bodies they were but shadows without life, and their long hair was moving and trembling about them, as if it lived with some terrible life of its own. And then the mist rose of a sudden and hid them, and then a light gust of wind blew them away towards the north-east, and covered Hanrahan at the same time with a white wing of cloud.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He stood up trembling and was going to turn away from the valley, when he saw two dark and half-hidden forms standing as if in the air just beyond the rock, and one of them that had the sorrowful eyes of a beggar said to him in a woman\u0027s voice, \u0027Speak to me, for no one in this world or any other world has spoken to me for seven hundred years.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0027Tell me who are those that have passed by,\u0027 said Hanrahan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0027Those that passed first,\u0027 the woman said, \u0027are the lovers that had the greatest name in the old times, Blanad and Deirdre and Grania and their dear comrades, and a great many that are not so well known but are as well loved. And because it was not only the blossom of youth they were looking for in one another, but the beauty that is as lasting as the night and the stars, the night and the stars hold them for ever from the warring and the perishing, in spite of the wars and the bitterness their love brought into the world. And those that came next,\u0027 she said, \u0027and that still breathe the sweet air and have the mirrors in their hearts, are not put in songs by the poets, because they sought only to triumph one over the other, and so to prove their strength and beauty, and out of this they made a kind of love. And as to the women with shadow-bodies, they desired neither to triumph nor to love but only to be loved, and there is no blood in their hearts or in their bodies until it flows through them from a kiss, and their life is but for a moment. All these are unhappy, but I am the unhappiest of all, for I am Dervadilla, and this is Dermot, and it was our sin brought the Norman into Ireland. And the curses of all the generations are upon us, and none are punished as we are punished. It was but the blossom of the man and of the woman we loved in one another, the dying beauty of the dust and not the everlasting beauty. When we died there was no lasting unbreakable quiet about us, and the bitterness of the battles we brought into Ireland turned to our own punishment. We go wandering together for ever, but Dermot that was my lover sees me always as a body that has been a long time in the ground, and I know that is the way he sees me. Ask me more, ask me more, for all the years have left their wisdom in my heart, and no one has listened to me for seven hundred years.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A great terror had fallen upon Hanrahan, and lifting his arms above his head he screamed out loud three times, and the cattle in the valley lifted their heads and lowed, and the birds in the wood at the edge of the mountain awaked out of their sleep and fluttered through the trembling leaves. But a little below the edge of the rock, the troop of rose leaves still fluttered in the air, for the gateway of Eternity had opened and shut again in one beat of the heart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3301/90295.html","bookId":425,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:24:33 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:24:33 AM"}
