She lifted her head. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rockets,” he hissed, straddling her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the world exploded with a crashing roar. Jack rolled off her and peeked out the window. Karen joined him. Off to the south she saw a billow of smoke and bits of rock climb high into the sky. As they watched, another explosion blew apart one of the basalt statues far to the west. A stone hand flew across the setting sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s happening?” Karen asked, cringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, a military jet streaked south. United States markings. Twin streams of fire bloomed as a pair of missiles were launched from the jet’s underbelly, screaming across the darkening sky. Other jets shot past, one winging low across the islands, trailing smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack pulled Karen back down. “Something tells me the blockade around Taiwan just exploded.” Together, they crawled to a window. The southern horizon glowed as if a new sun were rising. “We’d better get clear of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother explosion erupted nearby, quickly followed by another. Karen’s ears rang with the echoing roars as she scrambled to her feet. Out the window the twilight sky was streaked with ribbons of smoke. They moved back to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it,” Jack muttered. Their motorboat, untethered a moment ago, had drifted several yards away. He shrugged out of his own pack and kicked off a boot. “I’ll fetch it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren grabbed his elbow as he teetered on one foot. Another telltale whistle pierced their ears, much louder this time. Jack’s eyes were huge as he glanced at her. Together, they leaped away from the doorway and rolled behind sheltering walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren screamed as the blast shook the walls and dust showered her. The roar of the detonation seemed endless. Jack scuttled to her side. His lips moved but she could not make out his words. A huge boulder landed in the next room, crashing down. As the echoes faded, she could finally hear Jack’s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…okay. It was a near hit, but we’re safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, her eyes blurry with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped her up. This time she remained in the shelter of his arms. They returned to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack kicked off his other boot. “I’ll just grab the boat, and we’ll get our asses out of the line of fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren groaned as they reached the threshold. “Oh, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grip tightened on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe squat building across the canal was a blasted ruin. Smoke was so thick it was hard to see clearly. The force of the explosion had blown the boat right back to their doorway. They could easily clamber back in. But the boat was quickly filling with water. Huge rocks had pelted it, punching holes through its hull. Gas leaked in a slow spray from its ruptured outboard tank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now what?” Karen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore explosions erupted—but farther south. Jack pulled Karen to his side. “Sit down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sank to the stone floor, leaning against the wall. Each explosion trembled the stones. Karen found herself leaning less on the wall and more on Jack’s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a half hour they listened. Beyond the window, full night descended. The whistle of rocket fire and dull rumblings continued, but now far to the south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack finally spoke. “I think maybe they’re done with us. Just retaliatory strikes. Harassing fire meant to intimidate. I think we’ll be okay. We’ll hole up here tonight. In the morning I’ll swim to Chatan and get help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren shivered with his words. “The Chinese—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think they’ll leave us alone now.” Jack got up and crossed to the doorway. “I’ll keep watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren stood and joined him. She kept near his shoulder. With the night already cold, she could feel the heat radiating from Jack’s body and leaned closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark sky was foggy with smoke. A jet sped past to the west. Karen followed its course with worry. Movement closer at hand caught her eye. Glancing to the sea beyond the ruins, she spotted a brief glint of starlight on metal. “What’s that?” she asked, squinting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack squinted, then fished her binoculars out of her pack. He stared through them for a few seconds and scowled. “Great…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Conning tower. Chinese sub. Now I know why they were bombarding the ruins. Covering fire as it crept beyond the blockade. I spotted some type of special forces team loading into a pontoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? What are they doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably being sent in for surveillance and sabotage.” He lowered the binoculars. “How good a swimmer are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold terror trickled through her veins. “I was on the university’s intramural swim team. But that was ten years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good enough. We’re getting out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff in the distance, silent explosions bloomed in fiery flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll be okay,” he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the rumbling explosions, Karen heard a sound much closer. A scuff of rock. She swung around and was startled to see a dark stranger standing in the doorway. “Jack!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun, moving like a lion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man leveled a pistol at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in the gloom, Karen recognized the tattoo on the man’s forearm: a coiled snake with ruby eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5:55 A.M., Washington, D.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on the door woke Lawrence Nafe. He pushed to one elbow. “What is it?” he asked blearily. He glanced to the clock on the nightstand. It was not even six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swung partly open. “Sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized the voice and felt a twinge of misgiving. “Nicolas?” The CIA director had never called upon him in his bedroom. “What’s gone wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicolas Ruzickov entered the room, pausing at the threshold. “I’m sorry to disturb you and the First Lady, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNafe rubbed his eyes. “Melanie is still down in Virginia for the dedication of some damned statue. What do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuzickov closed the door firmly behind him. “The Chinese have attacked Okinawa.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Nafe sat up and switched on a lamp. In the light, he saw that the director was wearing the same suit as the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuzickov moved farther into the room. “We’ve just received word of skirmishes between their forces and ours along the Ryukyu Island chain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who shot first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All our reports claim the Chinese…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what are the Chinese saying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That we attempted to break their blockade of Taiwan, and they were defending.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great, just great…and which is true?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Between us and these four walls, who pulled the first trigger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuzickov glanced at a chair. Nafe waved him into it. The CIA director sat down with a long sigh. “Does it matter? The Chinese know of our intention to push for a formal declaration of war. If they mean to hold the region, Okinawa is the closer and more significant threat. They’ve been bombarding the island with missile fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the damage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A few strikes. Uninhabited areas. So far, our new Patriot missiles are doing a satisfactory job of protecting the island.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNafe eyed his CIA director. “What are we going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Joint Chiefs have already convened in the Situation Room, awaiting your order.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNafe got out of bed and paced the room. “With this newest aggression directed against our forces in the Pacific—” He stared pointedly at Ruzickov. “Unprovoked, of course…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is the way all newscasts will report it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “Then we should have little political opposition to a formal declaration of war.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNafe stopped before the mantel of the cold fireplace. “I’ll address the Joint Chiefs, but I want Congress fully behind this declaration. I don’t want another Vietnam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuzickov stood. “I’ll make sure all is in order.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNafe clenched a fist. “If need be, we’ll bring this war to Beijing. It’s about time we instilled the fear of God into the Chinese people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all they respond to, sir. Strength. We cannot show weakness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNafe scowled. “And neither will we show them mercy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8:14 P.M., ruins off the coast of Yonaguni\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrouched, Jack eyed the snub end of the pistol pointed at his chest. In a fraction of a second he quickly calculated the odds of disarming their assailant. He would have to take a bullet—there was no way around it—but he could still tackle the smaller man and probably knock the gun away. But what then? Depending on where he was hit, could he keep the man down long enough for Karen to grab the weapon? And what if there were others?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s the leader of the group that attacked us before,” Karen whispered beside him, hands half raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecalling Karen’s stories, Jack leaned closer to her. “I can take him out…but be ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can I help?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was surprised by Karen’s resolve. This woman was no wilting flower. “A distraction—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore any plan could be set in motion, the man acted first. “Come wit’ me,” he whispered in stilted English. “We must leave here. Danger.” He lowered his gun and holstered it at his waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack straightened from his half crouch, suspicious. He looked with confusion toward Karen, who wore a matching expression. “Do we trust this guy?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “He didn’t shoot us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man disappeared through the low doorway into the roofless building’s rear chamber. Jack glanced behind him. Distant explosions continued to echo across the water. Through the window, the glow of fires dotted the southern horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren nodded toward the grim view. “It’s not like we have a lot of choices here. Maybe we should go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack joined her. “Yeah, but did you ever hear the expression, ‘Out of the frying pan, into the fire’?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deep-fathom/page-48.html","bookId":1524,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:47:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:47:13 AM"}
