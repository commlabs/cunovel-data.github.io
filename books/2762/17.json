I might not know what I want, but I’m pretty sure that I don’t want anything to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I know that my memories have the potential to change everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bedroom has a private balcony. I think all of the bedrooms here at Giliberti House do. I’m sitting on mine tonight, alone, under the dark sky filled with twinkling stars. The night air is cool and it brushes over my skin softly, like tropical velvet fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m feeling nostalgic and poetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a book lying open in my lap. It feels good to lose myself in someone else’s world tonight, someone else’s fictional drama. Because my own drama is too real and raw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a knock on my bedroom door, soft and light. And before I can call out, the door opens and Reece is there. She’s wearing pajamas and holding a small box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I brought you something,” she announces as she crosses my room and joins me on the balcony. “You love these. They’re good for anything that ails you. You bought them for me when I was here this summer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thrusts the box into my hands and I peer inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny chocolate volcanoes sit amidst tissue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chocolate therapy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a better kind?” she tosses back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent point,” I answer. I pop one into my mouth and then I almost melt into my seat. “Oh my gosh. Yummo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReece looks satisfied. “Right? I braved the scary gypsy lady for you. That’s how much I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scary gypsy lady?” This intrigues me. Reece sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The woman in town who sells these is terrifying,” she tells me. “You laugh about her, but she’s got these cloudy eyes that see right through a person. And she always mutters vague things about people, as if she can see our future. Last time I was here, she told me that I was strong enough to handle anything. It was like she knew what was going on in my life. It was creepy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were you?” I ask. “Strong enough?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReece looks at me, gorgeous in her blonde, girl-next-door way. She finally nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I was. And I am. It’s something I learned while I was here. Everyone is strong enough. Sometimes, they just don’t know it. You’re strong enough too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re very profound, you know that?” I nudge her jokingly. But honestly, I’m not joking. Reece has given me some pretty good advice so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her. “So, I guess my best friend is a sage, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs. “I don’t know about that. But you’ve never steered me wrong, either, so I guess we’re good for each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offer her a chocolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for being my friend,” I tell her sincerely. “Thank you for sticking with me even when I don’t remember how good of a friend you actually are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReece looks at me like I’ve suddenly grown two heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously? That’s what friends do. You would do the same for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI honestly hope that is true, that I’m a good enough person for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe lean back onto our chairs and stare at the stars. Reece wraps her sweater more tightly around her and then pulls something from her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I almost forgot,” she tells me. She hands it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA picture in a silver frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s Dante, Gavin and me, and we’re standing in front of the sea. Sunshine bathes our bare shoulders and we’re wearing swimsuits. I have blue and green stripes in my dark hair, an interesting, peacock-like combination. It’s clear that we are having a good time because we’re all laughing. It’s a candid shot, not posed. Gavin’s eyes are twinkling and he’s bending toward me. Dante is laughing at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wish I could remember the joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReece watches me and I feel my lips curve into a smile, simply from the happy expression on my face in the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes me feel warm inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dante had this, so I had a copy made for you and framed. It was from a beach party this past summer. I love it. In fact, I love it so much that I had a copy made for me, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I tell her sincerely. “Very much. It’s like you’ve handed me a piece of my life, like I have a glimpse of who I was through this picture. I love it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears well up in my eyes and I don’t know why. I wipe at them impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReece looks at me sympathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay to be upset,” she tells me. “Anyone would be. And you’re handling it so much better than most people would. Cut yourself some slack, Mi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd her words make me cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like the barrier that I’ve built around myself lately crumbles down and I gulp at the air, sucking at it like a fish on a sidewalk as I heave in wracking sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first Reece is shocked, then she grabs me and pulls me to her. She pats my back and murmurs soothingly to me as I cry. And surprisingly, it feels good. When I’m finally finished and I’m lying in Reece’s lap, I feel cleansed. It’s like my tears washed my anxiety away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, temporarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I decide that if Gavin was right and I never cry, I might change that. A good cry every once in a while might be a good thing. A cleansing thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I do feel bad for falling apart on Reece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I tell her. “I didn’t mean to fall apart on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes. “Do you know how many times I’ve fallen apart on you? Trust me, I owe you a few breakdowns.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and nod like I know, even though we both know that I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what you need?” Reece asks. “You need some ice cream. With fudge and marshmallows. And then a bubble bath. Come on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow her from my bedroom, down the stairs and into the kitchen. There’s a soft nightlight shining in there, like a golden beacon. I love this kitchen. It’s warm and cozy, definitely a room where a family thrives. I don’t know why I’m drawn to it like I am. But it practically feels like the pulse of this large house beats from this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReece pulls things from the cupboard and drags a couple kinds of ice cream from a large freezer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe make two of the biggest ice cream sundaes in the history of the world and then make our way out to the terrace. We eat our ice cream curled up on elaborate wrought iron chairs and surrounded by fragrant flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love it here,” Reece tells me with a sigh. “Everything is so beautiful. I’m going to lobby hard to finish our senior year here. We’re needed here anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her, at my friend who seems to have such a big heart. She’s innocently licking her spoon when I hear a deep voice from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this a party and I wasn’t invited?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asks this as he saunters into the gardens. I think he saunters everywhere. There’s simply no other way to describe the way he moves. It’s fluid and confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope,” Reece tells him. “But I guess it is now. Isn’t it always a party when you’re around?” She grins at him and their manner is relaxed and easy, like two people who have grown up together, because that’s exactly who they are. They both have the same charming American accent and the same friendly way about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s so strange that you guys didn’t end up together,” I tell them. Reece looks over at me, startled, while Quinn laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you hear that, Reecie? I told you that we were perfect together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s kidding though and it is apparent. They are relaxed and friendly, but there is no sexual chemistry between them at and it’s hard to imagine that there ever was. Quinn nudges her shoulder, but he sits in the chair next to me. Something inside of me is happy about that, satisfied. I can smell him on the breeze, an outdoorsy man smell. I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReece rolls her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t date Quinn,” she tells me. “Because we know everything about each other. For example, I know that he passed out when he was giving blood last year.” She laughs again and Quinn glowers at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the last time,” he tells her. “The doctor said that there was a real medical reason for that—a vaso-vagal nerve reflex or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReece giggles. “Whatever, little kittie,” she laughs. “Meow!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m staring at her, wondering why the heck my seemingly sane friend is meowing at Quinn when she catches a glimpse of my face and laughs harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a nice way of calling him a pussy…cat.” She tacks the last word on as an afterthought. And then I have to laugh. Because the P-word coming out of sweet little Reece’s mouth in any context just doesn’t seem right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I meow at Quinn too, just because it is funny to associate him with the P-word in any way, shape or form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that is how Dante finds us a few minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReece and I are leaned together, meowing at big, strong Quinn under the light of the moon. We look like lunatics, I’m sure. And we most certainly sound like it. But I don’t even care. I grin up at Dante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, D,” I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante smiles back, then startles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“D?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him for a second, startled too, before I shrug. “It’s probably because I heard Elena call you that earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure, though. It could be a memory. I have no idea. But I’m distracted by listening to Reece complain about how Elena apparently calls Dante “D” just to annoy her now, and then by listening to her lecture Quinn on the fact that he needs to stay far, far away from Elena because she is a mean witch who would probably eat kittens for breakfast if she could, raw and with the fur still on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both listen to her patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then patiently ignore her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, they’re accustomed to her funny little outbursts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante wraps an arm around Reece’s shoulders and turns to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia, are you settling in all right? Is your room okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “I love my room and the balcony. Thank you so much for letting us stay here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante waves his hand. “I’m glad you’re here. It’s like a party. Well, it would be if Gavin were here, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, thoughts of him flood my mind and I feel guilty for sitting here with Quinn and I don’t know why. Neither of them belong to me. And I don’t answer to either of them. Yet whenever I’m with one, I feel guilty about the other. I sigh. My life is complicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante is tugging at Reece. “I think it’s time for bed,” he tells her. “We’ve had a long day and you haven’t been sleeping well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because I’m jet-lagged,” she tells him, somewhat grumpily. He smiles patiently. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mia-s-heart/page-17.html","bookId":2762,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:21 PM"}
