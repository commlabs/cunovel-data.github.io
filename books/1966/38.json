I’m gonna make him wait. But after about five minutes of doing everything from brushing my teeth to playing with the in-room coffee maker, I lose patience and text him back: On my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knock on the door to his room. A few seconds later, Henry, wearing a T-shirt and mesh shorts, opens the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s good, Woods?” I walk in to find a window providing a view of the university, and a pitcher of lemonade and a bunch of chocolate-chip cookies sit waiting on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hair is as unruly as ever, hanging down to his shoulders. He wipes a few curls off his face. “So, it’s real y good to spend time with you,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah…total y.” We just stare at each other for a long moment, a moment that seems to last longer than an overtime. Then I rush forward and hug him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe releases me a few seconds later, rubs my back, then takes a seat on the couch. He leans back and crosses his legs. After that hug, I don’t want to push it, so instead of joining him, I sit down on the bed and pul a pil ow to my chest. I prop my chin on the pil ow and rake a hand through my hair and peer up at Henry. He coughs. “So, I, uh, know I should’ve cal ed to apologize after Ty and I got into the fight,” he says. Leaning over onto his knees, he focuses on the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shouldn’t have hit him. I’m sorry I was so stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears rush to my eyes. “We were best friends for ten years—it’s pretty unforgivable that you didn’t cal . That you haven’t cal ed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears fal freely, and I dig the heels of my hands into my eyes, trying to stanch the flow, but it won’t stop. Suddenly I feel him sitting down on the bed. When I can open my eyes without a flood gushing out of them, I turn and see that he’s got both hands out as if he wants to play the hand-slap game. A grin starts to spread across my face as first, I slap him upside the head, then I shove his chest so hard he flies back onto the bed. Getting up onto my one good knee, I stretch my other leg out to the side and punch him in the gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, Woods!” Before I can slap his face, Henry rol s over and fal s off the bed. When he pokes his head up above the mattress, I see he’s cracking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Man, you deserved every bit of that, and more!” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we even?” He crawls up next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet.” I punch him in the jaw and I hear a crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ow!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringe. Shit, what’s his jaw made of? Titanium? I shake out my hand. “I’m so sorry, Henry! I didn’t mean to hit you so hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes watering, he rubs his chin. “Finished?” He smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh softly. “For now,” I reply, popping my knuckles. He goes over to the table, where he pours two glasses of lemonade, hands one to me, and uses the other to ice his jaw. I hold my glass of lemonade up to my knuckles. He sees me icing my hand and we laugh so hard—just like before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill holding the glass to his jaw, he shuffles his socked feet across the room and digs around in his bag, final y pul ing out a deck of cards. He sits back down on the bed, puts the glass on the nightstand, and starts dealing the cards into two stacks. “Let’s play some war.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab the plate of cookies from the table and set it on top of a pil ow. He picks a cookie, puts it in his mouth, and uses both hands to keep dealing. When al mouth, and uses both hands to keep dealing. When al the cards are dealt, he takes a bite of the cookie and wipes his mouth, then looks down at the plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Woods, where did al the cookies go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve already eaten four. “You snooze, you lose, man. Cal room service and order some more.” He throws down a queen, I throw down an eight. He sweeps the cards away and up into his pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way—I’m not made of money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I didn’t realize you were paying for al this,” I say, gesturing to the lavish room. “Charge it to my dad.” I throw down a five, he throws down a three. I sweep the cards away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins. “Fine.” Grabbing up the phone, he orders more cookies and lemonade, and even asks for some champagne too. He opens his wal et and pul s out a fake ID, showing it off for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the occasion?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances up at me and takes a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re the occasion, Woods. I’ve missed you so, so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering my chin, I bite my lip. A tear drops down my cheek. I throw down an ace, he throws down an ace. I deal three cards facedown, and he mimics me. At the same time, we each drop a fourth card. He has a queen; I, a king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at me again and grabs my hands, pul ing me up against his chest in one motion. He leans back against the pil ow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I hurting your knee?” he whispers as I drop my chin onto his chest and gaze up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closes his eyes. “You know what I regret more than anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not kissing you in my room that day.” He drags a hand across my head and rests it on my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and try not to cry again. “Yeah, you were pretty stupid, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know I could never deserve you, but can I try to make it up to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk. “How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lifetime supply of cookies and lemonade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s pretty tempting…” I clutch his side as he continues rubbing my back. His hand drifts up, and he sweeps my hair away, letting his fingers trickle along the nape of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But?” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want something else more than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? You gonna tel me what it is so I can get it for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe guesses right, because he takes me by the elbows and pul s my body up so our noses touch. His breath smel s like chocolate-chip cookies. My favorite. We kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal y.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wil you stay with me tonight?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’l stay as long as you’l let me.” Somehow, even with my sore knee, I manage to straddle his hips and weave my fingers through his curls. “But we have to sleep head-to-toe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t tonight. I heard you haven’t been washing your socks. In homage to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggle as he kisses my neck. “Don’t test me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So how do you feel about living in Michigan?” he says. “You can be my trophy girlfriend.” Before I can smack him, he pins my arms to my sides and rol s me over, holding me down. We laugh and kiss again and again. He’s a lot stronger than me now. He must be working out hard. I squeeze his biceps to get a taste. Rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What made you change your mind about us?” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I stopped being such a wimpy idiot and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I stopped being such a wimpy idiot and stopped being afraid of losing you, I realized I’d already lost you because of how stupid I’d been, but didn’t know if you’d give me another chance. I didn’t want to talk…’cause I was so scared you’d get mad or reject me for Ty. I didn’t know what to do. I’m so sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes are clenched shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss his forehead. “You are a wimpy idiot. But…I stil love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too, Woods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab a handful of his curls, yanking his face to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you ever leave me again, I’l fucking kil you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening his eyes, Henry laughs and rubs his jaw where I just punched him. “Understood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kiss some more, and his soft lips are making it hot in here, so I pul off my sweatshirt, revealing a tank top underneath, and Henry focuses on the plastic footbal charm, taking it in his fingers. I hesitate, then pul the chain off and drop it around Henry’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, thank God,” he says, kissing the charm. “I’ve missed this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More than you’ve missed me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh hel yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knock him off the bed again, and laughing, he climbs back up and kisses me. We make out for what seems like hours, pausing only for cookies and champagne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not one of your cheerleaders du jour,” I tel him when his fingers edge under my tank top. I bat his hand away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, lies back on the pil ow, and clasps his hands behind his head. “Admit it, you’re my number one fan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup. I’m having T-shirts made.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we crawl under the covers with me at the base of the bed and he at the head. He shoves his feet in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad told me that even if you’re meant to be with someone, that doesn’t mean you necessarily get to be with them. But sometimes? Maybe you do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess we’l find out. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/catching-jordan-hundred-oaks-1/page-38.html","bookId":1966,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:33 AM"}
