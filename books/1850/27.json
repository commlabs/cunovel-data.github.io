You already know too much and aren’t gonna know any more. Your father needs to know it all so I told him and he agrees with me about you and your stepmom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know where to start so I started in the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You told Dad everything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He asked questions, I answered, so… yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t sure how I felt about that. What I was sure about was that I couldn’t turn back time so I had to let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How was he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thumbs went away from my jaws as his hands slid down to rest where my neck met my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not happy but not surprised,” he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew how Dad felt because I felt the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you keep this from Meredith?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was cookin’, I asked for some time, your Dad took me into his den and I closed the doors. We got out and she didn’t ask. Their conversation, if they have one, can be private. She’s his woman, that’s his call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no verbal response to this but I felt gratitude. Hawk was right, Dad would want to know and he wouldn’t be happy not knowing. Hawk was also right, Meredith shouldn’t know unless Dad felt she could handle it and he should tell her himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I felt gratitude, I didn’t express it. Instead my eyes slid to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Babe,” Hawk called when they did and my eyes slid back. “What you said earlier –”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn no. We were not going to talk about earlier. I’d gladly walk barefoot on a bed of hot coals and at the end of that journey take a swan dive into the boiling lava at the mouth of a volcano before I talked about earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore instantly I tried to jerk my neck away and move out from in front of him but he moved faster, pushing in closer, pinning me to the car and his hands came up to cup my jaws, forcing my face tipped to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Babe,” he repeated when my eyes stared at his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuess I had to talk about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was making it up,” I lied to his ear. “Meredith is a romantic. I couldn’t tell her how we really are. Not then with Dad there, not privately, not ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Babe,” he said yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a big deal or at least it isn’t now. When you disappear, it will be then. Meredith will be sad but I’ll handle it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sweet Pea, look at me,” he ordered quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes slid to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I asked to be seated in that booth,” he informed me and I sucked in breath at what he might be saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I breathed it out on a, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clocked you before you clocked me, Gwen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at him, incapable of speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saw you through the windows as I was walkin’ up. Your friend was with you and you were laughin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head dipped closer and I watched as it did, holding my breath and feeling his eyes burning into mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still see you,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thumb swept my cheekbone then his fingers went back into my hair as his other hand slid down my neck, over my shoulder and around my back, his head came down and he kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis kiss was with tongue, lots of it, his and mine. It was wet, it was deep and it lasted a really long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual I was holding on when he lifted his head and my body was quivering in places he could feel and in better places only I could feel and my private places were way better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get to work, Sweet Pea,” he murmured against my mouth, pulled me gently away from his car, bleeped the locks, opened the door, folded in, fired up the Camaro and purred away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d long since lost sight of his tail lights but I was still standing there, a residual quiver dying away, my mind stuck on one thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could still see me laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquishiness\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the intense warmth of Hawk’s hand at the small of my back and my eyes opened. I’d been dead asleep and I felt confusion with a hint of excitement before his weight hit the bed and he turned me to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his arms closed around me, pressed my body the length of his and my confusion cleared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in my parents’ house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the shadow of his descending head hit its intended target, my hand shot up and covered his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” I hissed through a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand came up, fingers wrapping around my wrist and he pulled it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do I always do?” he asked back, also whispering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You broke in my parents’ house!” I was still whispering and hissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he replied like this was perfectly okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t have sex when my parents are practically right next door!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent, his body still, then he moved fast, his face disappearing in my neck as his arms got super tight and he rolled me to my back with his torso on mine and I heard his muffled laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hawk!” I snapped, my hands at his sleek-skin-over-hard-muscle bared shoulders, pushing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head came up and his weight came off me as he rested both forearms into the bed on either side of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me through the shadows. “Babe, not gonna f**k you,” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just said, ‘what do I always do?’ And we always have sex,” I returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, babe, but it starts with a kiss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. This was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at his shadowed head through the dark. “Then what are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?” I prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his hands came to my face and I felt his fingers glide along my hairline before they moved into the hair at the side of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last night, someone targeted you and got close enough to you, he freaked you out. When that happened, my boys were eight minutes away and I was an hour away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re telling me something I know, Hawk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not gonna happen again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had sounded amused, at first, then informative. His last sounded like a vow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach got squishy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resisted the squishiness and reminded him, “Dad’s right next door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a man who can take care of himself and you, Sweet Pea, but there are people out there who don’t know that. They see my ride sitting at the curb, they’ll think twice before they f**k with anyone in this house.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-man-dream-man-1/page-27.html","bookId":1850,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:39 PM"}
