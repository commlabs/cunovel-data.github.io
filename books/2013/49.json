Not one of these here holds to a cause that matters to me. They’re welcome to their grand ambitions. I was asked to lead them out, that’s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is Silchas Ruin’s war. And Fear Sengar’s. She looked over at Udinaas and found him studying her from where he sat, eyes glittering, as if presciently aware of her thoughts, the sordid tracks each converging on a single, pathetic con-elusion. Not my business. Errant take you, Indebted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMangled and misshapen, the K’risnan Ventrala reached up a scrawny, root-like forearm and wiped the sweat from his brow. Around him candles flickered, a forlorn invocation to Sister Shadow, but it seemed the ring of darkness in the small chamber was closing in on all sides, as inexorable as any tide, He had woken half a bell earlier, heart pounding and breath coming in gasps. The forest north of the fort was seething with orthen, a rock-dwelling scaled creature unique to this mountain pass-since his arrival at the fort he had seen perhaps a half-dozen, brought in by the maned Cats the Letherii locals kept. Those cats knew better than to attempt to eat the orthen, poison as they were, yet were not averse to playing with them until dead. Orthen avoided forest and soft ground. They dwelt among rocks. Yet now they swarmed the forest, and the K’risnan could feel some-thing palpable from their presence, a stirring that tasted of bloodlust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould he crouch here in his room, terrified of creatures he could crush underfoot? He needed to master this unseemly panic-listen! He could hear nothing from the fort lookouts. No alarms shouted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the damned orthen carpeted the forest floor up the pass, massing in unimaginable numbers, and that dread scaly flood was sweeping down, and Ventrala’s panic rose yet higher, threatening to erupt from his throat in shrieks. He struggled to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome kind of once in a decade migration, perhaps. Once In a century, even. A formless hunger. That and nothing more. The creatures would heave up against the walls, seethe for a time, then leave before the dawn. Or they’d flow around the fort, only to plunge from the numerous ledges and cliffs to either side of the approach. Some Creatures were driven to suicide-yes, that was it…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bloodlust suddenly burgeoned. The K’risnan’s head rocked back, as if he’d just been slapped. Chills swept through him. He heard himself begin gibbering, even as he awakened the sorcery within him. His body flinched as chaotic power blossomed like poison in his muscles and bones. Sister Shadow had nothing to do with this magic lacing through him, nothing at all, but he was past caring about such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as shouts rose from the wall, K’risnan Ventrala sensed another presence in the forest beyond, a focus to all | that bloodlust, a presence-and it was on its way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtri-Preda Hayenar awoke to distant shouts. An alarm was being raised, from the wall facing up-trail. And that, she realized as she quickly donned her uniform, made little sense. Then again, there wasn’t much about this damned assignment that did. Pursue, she’d been told, but avoid contact. And now, one of those disgusting K’risnan had arrived, escorted by twenty-five Merude warriors. Well, if there was any real trouble brewing, she would let them handle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir damned fugitives, after all. They could have them, with the Errant’s blessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later she was flung from her feet as a deafening concussion tore through the fort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK’risnan Ventrala screamed, skidding across the floor to slam up against the wall, as a vast cold power swept over him, plucking at him as would a crow a rotted corpse. His own sorcery had recoiled, contracted into a trembling core deep in his chest-it had probed towards that approaching presence, probed until some kind of contact was achieved. And then Ventrala-and all that churning power within him-had been rebuffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, the fort’s wall exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAtri-Preda Hayenar stumbled from the main house and found the compound a scene of devastation. The wall between the up-trail bastions had been breached, the impact spilling huge pieces of stone and masonry onto the muster area. And the rock was burning-a black, sizzling coruscation that seemed to devour the stone even as it flared wild, racing across the rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroken bodies were visible amidst the wreckage, and from the stables-where the building’s back wall leaned precariously inward-horses were screaming as if being devoured alive. Swarming over everything in sight were orthen, closing on fallen soldiers, and where they gathered, skin was chewed through and the tiny scaled creatures then burrowed in a frenzy into pulped meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the clouds of dust in the breach, came a tall figure with drawn swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite-skinned, crimson-eyed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-49.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
