Do any of you have a blowtorch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz perked up as if she were about to say that yea, she did have a blowtorch in the back of her closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid to know,\" I said, holding out my hand to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boy, they really want to keep us in, don\u0027t they?\" Macey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Bex shook her head and stared at me. \"They want to keep the Circle out.\" She waited a second, as the truth of the matter settled down on the three of us. \"This is dangerous. Too dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with Bex,\" Macey said. \"He\u0027s asking you to take a really big rick, Cam\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were right, but all I could think about was the way he\u0027d walking into the center of the very people who were scouring the world to find him. \"Maybe it\u0027s my turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Fine. Let\u0027s say it isn\u0027t true,\" Bex offered. \"Let\u0027s say Mr. Solomon is innocent and wrongly accused and that he didn\u0027t kill . . .\" She looked away, then back again. \"Let\u0027s say he is the man we know. Does the Mr. Solomon we know tell you to sneak out of the Gallagher Academy, go into town, and meet up with a know fugitive? Does Joe Solomon tell you to be stupid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was obvious. That was probably why none of us said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we go?\" Liz said, pointing to herself and Bex and Macey. \"See him. Get the message. Bring it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t explain it, guys,\" I said, shaking my head. \"I just know I\u0027ve got to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t mean you have to be stupid!\" Bex shot back, and I realized that Bex was being cautious. Bex had become the voice of reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t see it, Cammie,\" she went on. \"You didn\u0027t have to watch them drug you and drag you away like a doll. You were there, Cam, but you didn\u0027t have to watch your friend almost go away forever. You don\u0027t know how that feels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Macey said softly. \"She does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the girls I would trust with my life. Then I thought about my dad and the man he\u0027d probably trusted with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go,\" I said. \"It\u0027s my mission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s our mission,\" Bex countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we saying?\" Liz exclaimed. \"Cam, we don\u0027t have to sneak out. We don\u0027t even have to go by ourselves. I bet your mom -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, cutting her off. \"If she got caught helping Joe Solomon . . . No. We\u0027re on our own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Cam,\" Bex said, stopping me. \"I know. But if we do this with our backup -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if they\u0027re wrong, Bex?\" I pleaded. \"What if he\u0027 the only chance we\u0027ll ever have at finding out what happened to my dad? What if while everyone is chasing him, no one is trying to stop the Circle? What if he didn\u0027t do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex\u0027s voice was flat and calm and strong as she looked at me. \"What if he did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovert Operations Report\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Operatives utilized a basic Trojan horse scenario. If, instead of a horse, you substitute a 1987 Dodge Minivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it turns out that when one of the world\u0027s most dangerous and covert terrorist organizations is after one of your students, school officials care less about keeping in than they care about keeping people out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least that\u0027s what Bex and Macey and I told ourselves as we crawled beneath a tarp, a blanket, and about ten million physics notebooks, and lay as quietly as possible in the back of Liz\u0027s van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where to this evening?\" the guard at the front gate asked. I could picture him leaning against the driver\u0027s side window, chomping on his gum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to hold my breath as I waited for the soft, Southern voice that answered, \"Just a road check, Walter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s she up to now, Lizzie?\" the guard asked. In the light that crept in through the weave of the blanket, I saw that Bex was holding her breath too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost four hundred miles per gallon,\" Liz blurted. \"I mean three ninety-five to be specific - which I can be. Specific, that is. You know me, Walter. I\u0027m a very detail-oriented person. I\u0027m just going out to test it in stop-and-go driving. I\u0027m not hiding anything!\"she blurted, and Bex\u0027s eyes went wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePROS AND CONS OF BREAKING OUT OF SCHOOL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(A list by Operatives Morgan, McHenry, and Baxter)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: As Trojan horse operatives go, the back of a minivan isn\u0027t nearly as bad as it can get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: Rebecca Baxter, despite her many good qualities, is a cover hog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: There\u0027s nothing like a completely unsupervised, possibly illegal covert operation to take a girl\u0027s mind of the terrorist organization that is after her - not to mention her Culture\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026amp; Assimilation homework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: The girl really should have been doing her Culture \u0026amp; Assimilation homework.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRO: When you haven\u0027t had a real CoveOps lesson in months, you\u0027ll take any practical experience you can get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCON: When you haven\u0027t had a real CoveOps lesson in months, you can\u0027t help but feel really, really rusty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know the streets Roseville. I\u0027ve walked them with my classmates. I\u0027ve held hands on them with my first (and technically only) boyfriend. I\u0027ve seen them filled with football fans and parade spectators, with ladies selling cakes and candies for the church auxiliary, and kids out for a Saturday matinee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all-American as a town can possibly be, with its white gazebo and movie marquee and town square, but it seems different as I stood in the library bell tower, staring down at the square. There was nothing there but me and sky - no walls, no guards - and yet I felt stranded. Like the ravens, I know I couldn\u0027t fly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have good cover here,\" Bex told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear Macey through the comms unit in my ear, saying what I already knew: \"The square is clear.\" I could see Liz in the van, circling the block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liz is tracking you from the van,\" Bex said. \"We\u0027ve got back-up relays outside of town in case the van is compromised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex kept talking, but all I could think of was how the air was colder. The stars felt brighter. The breeze was softer as if blew against my check. It was as if all my senses were in overdrive, and I couldn\u0027t help but think most people feel like that sometimes -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen they\u0027re alone or in the dark. When they hear a noise in the closet or a creak on the floorboards, they sense it. It\u0027s not about being scared - it\u0027s about being alive. The nerves work harder, carrying messages to the brain, getting it ready for fight or flight, and that night, well, let\u0027s just say that night my nerves had their work cut out for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam?\" Bex asked as if I hadn\u0027t heard her. But she was wrong. That night I heard and saw and smelled everything. \"I\u0027m gonna get into position. Are you satisfied with this position?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scanned the square and nodded. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re safe here.\" She touched my arm almost as if she were trying to get my scent, as if she might soon be chasing me around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I watched her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding alone in the tower, I reminded myself of all the things in the world that I knew to be absolutely true: Rebecca Baxter was the best spy at the Gallagher Academy and the absolute last person who would lie about my safety. I had GPS trackers in my watch, my shoes, my ponytail holder, and my stomach (thanks to a new edible model Liz had been trying out).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy roommates and I all carried panic buttons that could summon an army within the blink of an eye. They could track me anywhere in the world (and ,Liz firmly believes, the moon).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that the square seemed smaller from where I stood, or maybe the world just felt bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held a pair of binoculars to my eyes and scanned the streets, telling myself that I was as safe as I could possibly be. I was prepared. I could handle anything. I ready for everything . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for the sight of a tall figure with broad shoulder, appearing as if from nowhere at the edge of the gazebo, and saying, \"Hello, Gallagher Girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerspective is a powerful thing. Seriously. I highly recommended it. There are things you just can\u0027t see unless you take a good step back and watch very, very closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, if I\u0027d been standing in the town square and not the bell tower, I might have heard the girl say, \"Well hello yourself,\" but I might have missed the way the boy stumbled backward as she turned. I might not have noticed the way his shoulders fell and his head jerked in the manner of someone who had not found what he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might never have realized that Zach was disappointed to find another girl in the gazebo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macey?\" Zach asked as if he couldn\u0027t believe his eyes, which was maybe the most flattering thing ever. Because no one has ever mistaken me for Macey McHenry. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was dark, and even without access to the world\u0027s greatest closet for deception and disguise, Macey was still the daughter of a cosmetics heiress. And in a wig and Zach\u0027s old jacket, she made for a good decoy, or at least good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Cammie?\" Zach asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look disappointed to see me, Zach,\" Macey teased. \"Don\u0027t you like my jacket?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she?\" Zach demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At school,\" Macey lied without missing a beat. \"Watching from a live video feed. \"She\u0027s safe.\" She inched closer, staring up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The jammers at the school wouldn\u0027t allow that, Macey. Now where is he?\" he turned. \"I know she\u0027s around here somewhere,\" he said, scanning the alleys and buildings that lined the square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s safe where she is, Zach.\" Bex stepped out of the darkened alcove by the movie theater and moved into place behind him. \"And we\u0027re going to keep it that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to talk to her,\" he told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So talk,\" Macey said. \"We\u0027ve got comms. She can hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming down,\" I blurted, desperate to be off the sidelines, but Bex\u0027s hand was on her ear. She was shouting at me. \"You stay where you are!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was already gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s lucky to have you,\" Zach said after a long time. \"She needs you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here, Zach?\" Macey asked, but Zach only shook his head. He looked down at the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s complicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So un-complicate it.\" Even as I said the words, I knew I might regret them. And soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Zach was bait and I was walking into a trap. Maybe Bex would save the Circle the trouble and kill me on the spot, but I couldn\u0027t stay away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re with him,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically, he\u0027s on an errand halfway around the world right now,\" Zach tried to joke, but my mind raced on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liz and Macey told me that just because you go to Blackthore doesn\u0027t mean . . .\" My voice caught. \"But you really are with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gallagher Girl, listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So . . . what happened, Zach? Did the Circle recruit you too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me for a long time before he lowered his head and whispered, \"Not exactly.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/only-the-good-spy-young-gallagher-girls-4/page-13.html","bookId":2749,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:51:06 PM"}
