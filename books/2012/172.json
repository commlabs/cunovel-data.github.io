Choices he’d put aside, futures he’d long ago surrendered. And looking at them left him feeling guilty. They were crimes of necessity, each time I turned away. Each time we all did. Whiskeyjack, remember once when we stood on the ramparts at Mock’s Hold? Laseen had just stepped out from … the shadows. There was a child, some son of some merchant. He was bold. You told him something, Whiskeyjack. Some advice. What was it? I can’t recall. I don’t even know why I’m remembering any of it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMothers were looking on from that column – their eyes were on their children, these young legacies, and would grip tight as talons if they could. But spaces now gape, and the children edge ever closer to them, to fill what has been lost. And the mothers tell themselves it will be enough, it must be enough .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I tell you now, Fallen One, whatever we manage to do, it will have to be enough. We will bring this book to an end, one way or another .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one more thing. Something I only realized today, when I chanced to glance across and see her, standing there, moments from signalling the beginning of this march. From the very first, we have lived the tale of the Adjunct. First it was Lorn, back in Darujhistan. And now it is Tavore Paran .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct never stands in the centre. She stands to one side. Always. The truth of that is right there, in her title – which she will not relinquish. So, what does it mean? Ah, Fallen One, it means this: she will do what she has to do, but your life is not in her hands .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see that now .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFallen One, your life is in the hands of a murderer of Malazan marines and heavies .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour life is in my hands .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd soon she will send us on our way .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that Malazan Book of the Fallen, the historians will write of our suffering, and they will speak of it as the suffering of those who served the Crippled God. As something … fitting. And for our seeming fanaticism they will dismiss all that we were, and think only of what we achieved. Or failed to achieve .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in so doing, they will miss the whole fucking point .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFallen One, we are all your children .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWELVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWord came, and in the ashes I finally straightened and looked upon those few of my children left standing. The Throne of Shadows was no more and out from the twilight flew dragons, filling the air with cries of rage and frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew then that he had done it. He had cheated them all, but at what cost? I looked at the heaps of corpses, a monstrous high water mark upon this cursed strand. Blood ran in streams down the slope to where crimson-streaked light cascaded, where all the wounds still gaped. Another wave was coming. We could not hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown from the forest, at that moment of deepest despair, came a trio of figures. I faced them, and from my ravaged soul there was born hope’s glimmer …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcerpt Book Eleven Throne, Sceptre and Crown Rise Harat (Coral Trove)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePITHY STAGGERED CLEAR, SHEATHED IN BLOOD. THE BLISTERING WHITE of the strand shocked her, tilting and rocking before her eyes. She fell to her knees, and then on to her side. She let go of her sword but the grip clung to her hand a moment longer, before sobbing loose. With her other hand she tugged off her helm. The blade cut was a slit scoring right through the dented iron. Strands of bloody hair and the tufted padding of her under-helm filled the gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let her head drop back, the terrible sounds of battle fading. Overhead the sky spun. Torn fragments of light drifted in the gloom. Ah, Brev. He warned us. In that way of his, he warned us. Back and forth he walked, drawing and sheathing and drawing that damned sword. Over and over again .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can think about what’s to come. You can try and picture it in your mind. What warriors did. What soldiers walked into. But none of it readies you. None of it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screaming seemed far away now. The surge and terrible clatter, the maw of the breach a mass of blades, spear and sword, knife and axe, and all that mouth did was chew people to bloody bits, those iron fangs clashing and grinding – there was no end to its appetite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo long as there’re more people to shove into it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body felt hot, the sweaty gambeson chafing under her arms. She could smell her own reek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we called ourselves captains, did we, Brev? Good at giving orders. Good at standing around looking important. There with the prince. With his knot of elite soldiers he now calls his Watch. Me and you, Brevity, we were officers .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an army of fools .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood ran warm to pool in her ears, first the one on the left, then the one on the right. Other sounds were drowned in the deluge. Is that the ocean I’m hearing? An ocean of blood? Is this, I wonder, the last thing we ever hear? Dear ocean, then, call my soul. I would swim the waters again. Let me swim the waters again . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-172.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
