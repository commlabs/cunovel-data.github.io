Sophie grinned. No one ever saw Tiff embarrassed, priceless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel smiled at Clara as Matthew approached the group, the boys shifting nervously as he got closer, his sheer physical size was pretty alarming up close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ya know, Caleb,\" Jonesy said in a nervous voice, \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 you better get elaborating. Speedy-like.\" He looked at the Band, all of them spreading out and encircling us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel watched the young Travelers with some amusement, little more than children. \"Let me assist in this Clara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel faced the one that was the puppeteer for the dead, his dark hair and eyes sitting in a face of keen intelligence. Daniel\u0027s eyes swept the young man\u0027s body, he was well-knit as well, not soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps he had known battle? He had that hard edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Daniel. Why are you here this day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, I\u0027m Caleb Hart. We\u0027ve come to repair the damage to the sphere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel\u0027s brows knit together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Clara and raised his voice for all the Band to hear, \"This one says that he and his comrades shall arrest the progression of damage caused by the pellets of salt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Band nodded but the one whose eyes never left me asked, \"Aye... so easily? The Master over the Dead seeks to reverse damage to a most modern and complicated structure,\" Matthew scoffed, \"I presume not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, so I guess we need to convince these guys.\" I turned to John. \"Can\u0027t you like, run interference or some crap? We need to get this party started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... I did take a medieval speech course last summer,\" John said with hesitation. \"But... it may be too ancient for the speech they use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit Terran?\" Bry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn sighed. \"Yeah, could you keep the swearing to a minimum? I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s offensive to these people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah moron, do an Ali, Nazi-out on their asses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Band frowned and moved closer to Jonesy. \"Kidding... kidding, big Dudes.\" He raised his palms in supplication and laughed nervously, gulping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonesy, shut up,\" Randi said, the men of the Band looking at her with curiosity. She, Sophie and Jonesy were getting the most scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do they say, Daniel?\" another male of the Band asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not entirely certain, I think they\u0027re bickering amongst themselves.\" Daniel shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They be infantile then?\" one of the males asked without rancor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall male with hair the same color as the Queen nodded, maybe around our age and a younger girl with blonde hair said, \"Are they nary our years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It appears as such, yet they act as if they are but ten years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Jonesy said, forgetting his promise to shut his trap. \"I think I\u0027m getting that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re saying we\u0027re babies or something,\" Tiff said, insulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn lifted his palm. \"Shut up, all of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn turned to Queen Clara, taking a deep breath. He let it out slowly then began, thinking that his medieval speech course was probably too ancient for their speech. He went for it anyway. \"We come in peace this day. To offer a solution that may rectify the degradation of your sphere, restore it wholly and halt the further progression of the salt compromise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked expectantly at the Queen of Ohio and she turned that radiant smile on him, the strobe of it hitting John between the eyes. He thought he might be in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was until Tiff snapped her fingers in front of his face. \"Shake it off, Terran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirked as I watched John fall under the charisma that was the Queen while Matthew frowned. John flicked his eyes to the huge man, weapons hanging off him head to toe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara answered, \"That would be most helpful, Traveler.\" Then she hesitated, \"There be another pair of Travelers who... took a piece of my flesh, we do not know why...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie gasped, forgetting caution and rushed to Clara. She grabbed the forearm that Clara had offered for perusal and turned it over, a star-shaped scar lay there and Sophie ran a finger over it. She slowly looked at Clara, who openly stared at Sophie\u0027s unusual coloring and manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it Soph?\" Jonesy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has the same scar that creeper did!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which creeper?\" I asked. Hell there were too many for me to keep track of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The AP attacker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would mean he was from here,\" John said slowly, thinking about everything that tied that together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, he was a helluva lot more than AP.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn turned to Clara, her arm still within the hold of Sophie\u0027s hand, the polished ivory of it directly contrasting with the light coffee of Sophie\u0027s skin and asked, \"What do you name the group who wander about?\" John asked, throwing his palm out to encompass the greater Outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fragment,\" one said in a flat voice, a warrior woman stood beside him, leaning against another for support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn got excited, punching his fist into his open palm and the Band tensed. He tried to rein it in with effort. \"Okay, so these fragment guys, some are criminals from our world. What\u0027s to say when the Graysheets need a disposable assassin they don\u0027t just use one of the fragment? They bite the big one in our world, then they remain unidentified forever?\" He threw his hands up like... duh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the beat up warrior princess that stood next to a dude with old-fashioned mail on. She had gills too, flaring slightly as she breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurreal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophie dropped Clara\u0027s arm and smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John, tell her what the plan is,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn smiled nervously, his lips pulling away from his teeth in the parody of a grimace. I narrowed my eyes on my best friend. \"You do have a plan, wise ass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn said, \"It\u0027s more of a theory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well get hot, the natives are restless,\" I said, using another Gramps-ism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded. \"Right.\" He turned to Jonesy. \"You ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell yeah, born ready, Terran! Bring it!\" Jonesy extolled, his dark face lighting up with typical enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" Clara said with a ringing command. John turned toward her and she phrased her next question carefully, years of royal diplomacy coming to her aid, \"Be most careful, young Traveler. For it is the only home my people have ever known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn swallowed. Damn, no pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Jonesy. \"Come on Jones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" he said, cocking his hand in a mock-salute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Js and I walked a short ways along the perimeter of the sphere, noting the door Archer had unlocked and Alex had opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, look at the degradation just since we\u0027ve been here last,\" John said, pushing against the sphere side, his handprint as he pulled away filling in again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long would it have been before it was...?\" Alex asked, walking up behind us, keeping one eye on the dudes with gills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone?\" John filled in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alex nodded John said, \"Maybe a month. That\u0027s how long a pulse-cycle would\u0027ve taken, so I\u0027m guessing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it beyond repair?\" I asked, eying up the one meter diameter holes peppering the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn shrugged. \"All we can do is attempt a fix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex?\" John called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the salt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, taking a bag made of leather. They hadn\u0027t known what would travel. The last time, the chick\u0027s jewelry had all been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t wanted to dwell too much on where that\u0027d gone off to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroubling thought process, that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex reached inside the bag and everything suddenly happened at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara screamed in a startled voice, \"Matthew, they possess salt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the big dude with eyes so blue they didn\u0027t look real had his hand wrapped on Alex\u0027s wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel violence contained, the very air trembled with it. Jade grabbed onto the back of my hoodie, feeling the tension in the atmosphere, her Empath skills triggered and on full alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew\u0027s face showed instant surprise, as did Alex\u0027s. He tried to wrench his arm free and Matthew grunted in restraint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit, they\u0027re as strong as Alex!\" Jonesy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTotally not the larger point, I thought. Like, hoping we didn\u0027t get our asses kicked would be the primary objective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew turned to the others of the Band, \"He is Band.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex let his hand drop, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel\u0027s brows rose to his hairline. \"You feel kinship recognition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Matthew nodded, studying Alex. Finally, after much scrutiny he grinned. It was so shocking on his stern face the group all responded with instant smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s Band?\" Alex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are the enforcers,\" Daniel replied in explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of what?\" Jade asked from behind me, walking around me until she could see Alex and the huge dude of the Band, Matthew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel gave her a curious look. \"The protection of females... and everything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the girls?\" Sophie asked and John rolled his eyes. I was certain he wanted to get the sphere nailed then be on our way. Each moment we spent here supposedly made it worse for the people here. That was the Theory of John anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel continued, \"There are very few.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn got curious despite his rush. \"What is the ratio?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel frowned. John thought of another way to phrase it. \"What be the count of males as compared to females?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniel had been raised fragment and they dealt very much in numbers. Thievery and trading wares made their prowess for math legendary. Daniel fashioned his answer so his group would also understand, \"There be fifteen males for every one that is female.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls sucked in their breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, no wonder it was so screwed up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn explained, \"We must use the salt which began the ruination of your sphere and combine it with the advances of my world to halt its destruction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara understood. \"I do apologize... however, I surmised you may be...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn held up his palm. \"It is fine. I do understand the trepidation over the same ingredient being used for repair that was the cause of the sphere\u0027s demise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go, Terran!\" Jonesy fist-pumped and John blushed a fine, clear red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can it, dumbass,\" Tiff said. \"He\u0027s getting\u0027 his mojo on.\" She gave a big grin to John and he gave a small smile back, pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara nodded as the Band studied Alex, who returned their stares with equal regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn grabbed the salt, and sprinkled a large portion over roughly a half meter area. Jonesy stepped forward and John nodded. Before Jonesy put his palm on the patch of salt that lay hissing where it made contact with the sphere wall, John said, \"Don\u0027t be stupid, Jonesy. This matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, Terran, keep your boxers on. I got this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, Jonesy laid his palm on the sizzling area. Instantly the spot began to glow and Jonesy straightened where he stood, his face going from his typical nonchalant expression to a shrieking intensity. The Band clustered around, watching the boy with skin so brown it was almost black, prove out a different kind of magic entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara watched as light like the bolts of lightning she remembered watching as a child from the safety of her chamber, wound their way like wily snakes, branching away from his dark hand. They formed a grid-like pattern that carried them like tendrils of perfect, symmetric brilliance to the offending holes, closing them in as water poured in a cup. They throbbed and contracted, the light pouring into the holes, which were once dim, now became solidly opaque, gradually deepening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter minutes that became long enough so twilight stole around them, Jonesy lifted his hand off the sphere wall. He turned to Clara and smiled, she gasped at how white his teeth were in the impending gloom. It was startling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell me,\" Jonesy said, hand to his chest, ready to bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff rolled her eyes but I said it, he\u0027d done okay. \"You\u0027re the greatest, Jones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I got that,\" Jonesy said with snark, but his face was tired and his body looked strained and wrung out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not every day that you light up a whole world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at the sphere, lit with a soft glow, whole again. The scars from the salt punishment were pinkish, but already moving toward the original milky incandescence of the sections that weren\u0027t compromised .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends were all grinning at the remarkable structure, us for different reasons than the people of Clara\u0027s world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy said, \"It can\u0027t be all bad... our abilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. \"Yeah, but the reason behind them sucked.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-15.html","bookId":2493,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM"}
