Judging by his own interpretation of the discovery our hero was not surprised that his captor should be incensed. He retraced his steps, and found himself once more in the subterranean chamber facing an angry man. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What took you in there?\" demanded Colonel Johnson.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Curiosity, I suppose,\" answered Grit composedly.

He was at a loss to know whether Grit really suspected the nature and meaning of his [Pg 275]discovery, or not. If not, he didn\u0027t wish to excite suspicion in the boy\u0027s mind.
