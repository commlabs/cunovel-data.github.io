Were they alive inside? Dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in between? He had come here first—not gone after the technology that the UNSC needed, risking everything for Team Katana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou never leave a fallen comrade behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was more to it than that: given a choice between alien technologies that might save all of humanity and these five Spartans… he had picked them first.

Organo- metallic appendages cradled each pod and radiated branches that connected to banks of two-meter cubes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn closer inspection, Kurt saw a faint light leaking from these cubes… and staring closer, he noticed they were not at all cubes—their edges distorted and radiated extra dimensions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe staggered back, hands reflectively grasping for his temples. Disorientation washed over him as he tasted the faint green light, inhaled the dusty odors of meaning from the symbols on the floor, and heard the bell-like tinkling of the organic electronics of the pods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sank to one knee and the tangled sensory input faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand back,\" Kurt warned the others. Over the COM he said, \"Will, escort Dr. Halsey up here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother wave of disorientation hit Kurt and his vision swam. When he again could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey knelt next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move him away from the machines,\" she told Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill dragged him back to the room\u0027s entrance, and Kurt\u0027s vision immediately cleared and the dizziness vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" he asked Dr. Halsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unshielded Slipspace field,\" she said. Her face was a mask of concentration, staring at the cubic machine housing. Frowning, she crossed to the pods. \"Linda,\" she said, \"your assistance please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda moved up to Dr. Halsey, her sniper rifle aimed at the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use your weapon\u0027s range finder; point at the interior of the pod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda nodded, raised her rifle, and aimed at the Spartan inside the pod. After a moment, she lowered the weapon, checked her Oracle scope\u0027s settings, and then repeated the procedure. She shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are reading an infinite range?\" Dr. Halsey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Linda replied, uncharacteristic annoyance in her tone. \"There must be something wrong with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dr. Halsey replied. \"I\u0027m afraid it is in perfect working order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to Kurt. \"I cannot revive your Spartans or the other three, Lieutenant Commander. They are not in cryogenic suspension.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt shook off the last traces of confusion. \"Explain,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are encased in a Slipspace field. The process to stabilize such a field in normal space is well beyond any technology we or the Covenant possess. Essentially these Spartans are here, but not, extruded into an alternate set of spatial coordinates and excluded from time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re right here,\" Linda said, and pointed at the pods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dr. Halsey said. \"You are merely seeing their afterimage. It\u0027s like looking at a mass accelerated past the event horizon of a black hole. Its image may linger there forever, but it is gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they\u0027re gone?\" Linda whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no,\" Dr. Halsey replied. \"They\u0027re right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt said, \"You just said they\u0027re gone. Which is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey considered a moment and then replied, \"Both. The quantum-mechanical implications do not translate to simple, nonparadoxical, classical terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s stick to practical terms,\" Kurt said, growing annoyed. \"Are they safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head, considering, and then replied, \"You could detonate a nuclear warhead on these pods and because the extruded Slipspace within is not in this dimension, there would be no effect to their contents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this reference to \"nuclear warhead,\" Ash shifted his pack, which held the two cut-down FENRIS bombs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we move them?\" Kurt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey walked to the end of one pod. She examined the trunk line attached there and uncoupled it. There was a hiss and the pod rose a half meter off the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It appears they were designed to be moved,\" she said, her last words trailing off into deep thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt motioned to the pods. \"Teams Saber, Blue, get them uncoupled. We\u0027ll take them with us to the core-room entrance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans detached the pods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Ash maneuvered one pod. Dr. Halsey held up a hand, indicating that he halt. She bent closer to the last pod and ran her fingers over the Forerunner icons along its side, translating as she did so: \" \u0027That which must be protected… behind the sharpened edge of the shield… beyond the reach of the swords… for the reclaimed.\u0027 No, that\u0027s not quite the correct meaning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reclaimed…\" Ash echoed. \"Maybe \u0027Reclaimers\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey looked up, startled, at him. \"Yes. A title. Specifically, an honorific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said, \"that\u0027s what the Sentinel called us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One spoke?\" Dr. Halsey asked. She pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose and moved to Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d forgotten it with everything else going on.\" Ash shook his head, embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What exactly did it say?\" she demanded. \"The precise wording. It may be important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh shifted foot to foot. \"… I don\u0027t remember, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Mendez came up and set a hand on Ash\u0027s shoulder. \"Take a deep breath.

Threw a rock at the thing. It chased me, got me pinned in a ravine.

But the Sentinel attenuated my COM signal, and transmitted it back to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slow it down,\" Chief Mendez whispered. \"Take your time.
