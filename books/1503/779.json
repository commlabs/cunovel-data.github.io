This child, he is no longer the young man that had just become his disciple those years ago! The playful exterior he usually had on could no longer hide the steady, profound and overpowering nature he had. Of course, this was a good thing for him. He had already grown up.

The three Blood Red Hell Heavenly Kings were by no means weak, and they had their own powerful Skills as well, especially with the Destruction Attribute. Facing the abrupt explosive attacks from Zhou Weiqing, they naturally blocked it in an instant. After all, the Hell’s Angel and the\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDemonic Dragon Lady were just summonings, not true existences.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn that moment, Meng Gui melded into the darkness. In truth, no one knew that Meng Gui was the real top assassin in the world.

However, his current level was naturally far more dangerous than he had been then.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMeng Gui did not have the Spatial Attribute, nor did he have any Skills like the Blink Skill.

As his body flickered, the pitch black devil claw spike swiped across the space he had just been. Where it passed, the air was split apart instantly.

As his ‘Hate Ground no Handle’ Legendary Set had already reached nine pieces, what kind of boost to his strength did that give? His physical strength had already reached a truly terrifying state. Let alone Meng Gui, even Long Shiya with his full ‘Hate Sky no Handle’ Legendary Set… in terms of just pure physical strength, he might not be comparable to Zhou Weiqing.

Furthermore, on the crying-face hammer of Zhou Weiqing’s, there was an extremely powerful suction ‘Devour’ power.

When he realised he had lost the clash, he changed strike to a push, using Zhou Weiqing’s power to fly back as best he could, trying to shift as much of the power from landing on his own body. However, Zhou Weiqing’s strength was just too terrifying, at least several hundred thousand jin in power. That hammer blow, no matter how high Meng Gui’s cultivation was, even if he used the Darkness Attribute energies in the atmosphere to protect himself, he was still at a massive disadvantage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe right devil claw spike had actually been shattered, along with his right arm.
