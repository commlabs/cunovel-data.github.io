{"id":44715,"no":49,"title":"7th December","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thank you for permission to visit Julia--I take it that silence\n\u003cbr\u003e means consent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Such a social whirl as we\u0027ve been having! The Founder\u0027s dance came\n\u003cbr\u003e last week--this was the first year that any of us could attend;\n\u003cbr\u003e only upper classmen being allowed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I invited Jimmie McBride, and Sallie invited his room-mate\n\u003cbr\u003e at Princeton, who visited them last summer at their camp--an awfully\n\u003cbr\u003e nice man with red hair--and Julia invited a man from New York,\n\u003cbr\u003e not very exciting, but socially irreproachable. He is connected\n\u003cbr\u003e with the De la Mater Chichesters. Perhaps that means something\n\u003cbr\u003e to you? It doesn\u0027t illuminate me to any extent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e However--our guests came Friday afternoon in time for tea in the\n\u003cbr\u003e senior corridor, and then dashed down to the hotel for dinner. \n\u003cbr\u003e The hotel was so full that they slept in rows on the billiard tables,\n\u003cbr\u003e they say. Jimmie McBride says that the next time he is bidden\n\u003cbr\u003e to a social event in this college, he is going to bring one of their\n\u003cbr\u003e Adirondack tents and pitch it on the campus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At seven-thirty they came back for the President\u0027s reception and dance. \n\u003cbr\u003e Our functions commence early! We had the men\u0027s cards all made out\n\u003cbr\u003e ahead of time, and after every dance, we\u0027d leave them in groups,\n\u003cbr\u003e under the letter that stood for their names, so that they could be\n\u003cbr\u003e readily found by their next partners. Jimmie McBride, for example,\n\u003cbr\u003e would stand patiently under `M\u0027 until he was claimed. (At least,\n\u003cbr\u003e he ought to have stood patiently, but he kept wandering off\n\u003cbr\u003e and getting mixed with `R\u0027s\u0027 and `S\u0027s\u0027 and all sorts of letters.)\n\u003cbr\u003e I found him a very difficult guest; he was sulky because he had\n\u003cbr\u003e only three dances with me. He said he was bashful about dancing\n\u003cbr\u003e with girls he didn\u0027t know!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next morning we had a glee club concert--and who do you think\n\u003cbr\u003e wrote the funny new song composed for the occasion? It\u0027s the truth. \n\u003cbr\u003e She did. Oh, I tell you, Daddy, your little foundling is getting\n\u003cbr\u003e to be quite a prominent person!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, our gay two days were great fun, and I think the men enjoyed it. \n\u003cbr\u003e Some of them were awfully perturbed at first at the prospect of\n\u003cbr\u003e facing one thousand girls; but they got acclimated very quickly. \n\u003cbr\u003e Our two Princeton men had a beautiful time--at least they politely\n\u003cbr\u003e said they had, and they\u0027ve invited us to their dance next spring. \n\u003cbr\u003e We\u0027ve accepted, so please don\u0027t object, Daddy dear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Julia and Sallie and I all had new dresses. Do you want to hear\n\u003cbr\u003e about them? Julia\u0027s was cream satin and gold embroidery and she\n\u003cbr\u003e wore purple orchids. It was a DREAM and came from Paris, and cost\n\u003cbr\u003e a million dollars.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie\u0027s was pale blue trimmed with Persian embroidery, and went\n\u003cbr\u003e beautifully with red hair. It didn\u0027t cost quite a million,\n\u003cbr\u003e but was just as effective as Julia\u0027s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mine was pale pink crepe de chine trimmed with ecru lace and rose satin. \n\u003cbr\u003e And I carried crimson roses which J. McB. sent (Sallie having told\n\u003cbr\u003e him what colour to get). And we all had satin slippers and silk\n\u003cbr\u003e stockings and chiffon scarfs to match.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You must be deeply impressed by these millinery details.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One can\u0027t help thinking, Daddy, what a colourless life a man is\n\u003cbr\u003e forced to lead, when one reflects that chiffon and Venetian point\n\u003cbr\u003e and hand embroidery and Irish crochet are to him mere empty words. \n\u003cbr\u003e Whereas a woman--whether she is interested in babies or microbes\n\u003cbr\u003e or husbands or poetry or servants or parallelograms or gardens or\n\u003cbr\u003e Plato or bridge--is fundamentally and always interested in clothes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s the one touch of nature that makes the whole world kin. \n\u003cbr\u003e (That isn\u0027t original. I got it out of one of Shakespeare\u0027s plays).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e However, to resume. Do you want me to tell you a secret that I\u0027ve\n\u003cbr\u003e lately discovered? And will you promise not to think me vain? \n\u003cbr\u003e Then listen:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m pretty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I am, really. I\u0027d be an awful idiot not to know it with three\n\u003cbr\u003e looking-glasses in the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e A Friend\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. This is one of those wicked anonymous letters you read about\n\u003cbr\u003e in novels.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59771.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
