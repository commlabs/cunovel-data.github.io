As he turned from watching the retreating figure of the wretch, his gaze fell upon the outstretched form of the dead Indian—the staring, lustreless eyes and powder-burned, blood-stained body presenting a horrid sight. Near by the brush and stones were thrown aside and the bones of Ichabod Nesbit were scattered all about.\n\u003cbr\u003e 135\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I see it all now,” came slowly and solemnly from the boy’s lips. “It is plain as anything ever was! It was the letter they wanted; and to think that those miserable cut-throats made poor Black Eagle come all this distance to show them where Ichabod Nesbit lay, only to shoot him down in such a manner, when they didn’t find it! What was it that Duff was saying, too? Ree will want to know every word: ‘It was the Quaker, blast him!’ that is what he said. ‘And you, you Indian dog, said nothing about him.’ Well! I wonder if Theodore Hatch wasn’t on his way here to find that letter, himself, and if Black Eagle didn’t direct him where to come. Poor Black Eagle! Ichabod Nesbit was the cause of your death at last.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So communing with himself in thoughts and frequent murmured words, John spent a half hour so deeply buried in his reflections concerning the murder of the unfortunate Indian, the likelihood that the murderer might be brought to the rope’s end as he so richly deserved, and the mystery of the letter describing the buried treasure, that he did not realize how swiftly time was passing.\n\u003cbr\u003e 136\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A loud whinny from Neb brought the pondering lad to the remembrance that he had much to do, and that already it was noon. Hurrying up the hill he obtained the shovel, fastened to Neb’s harness as a means of carrying it conveniently, and led the horse nearer the scene of his labors.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His first task would be to dig a grave; but a new problem appeared. Undoubtedly he must bury the body of Black Eagle as well as the bones of Nesbit. It seemed too dreadful to place them together—the remains of this white man who had killed the Indian’s son, and those of the Indian who had been revenged for the act, only to meet his own death after showing Palefaces, whom he believed to be friends, where the outlaw’s body lay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, there will have to be two graves,” John decided, and a glance at the sun told him he must work hard if he was to return to the cabin before another day.\n\u003cbr\u003e 137\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fortunately the earth was not frozen beneath its thick covering of leaves, and except for the many roots he encountered, the lonely young sexton of the wilderness made rapid progress. One trench of sufficient length and depth for the purpose, at the foot of a large ash tree, which could be made to serve as a headstone, he had completed when a rustling of the leaves caused him to look quickly up. Duff, Dexter, and Quilling stood before him, the last named grinning wolfishly over John’s surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who killed the Indian known as Black Eagle?” asked Duff, in cold accusing tone, pointing his finger at the boy, who had hastily thrown down his shovel and picked up his rifle, instead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s him,” chorused Dexter and Quilling, pointing their fingers also at John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who saw him do it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All three of us,” came the answer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You swear that this is true?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s what we do; we saw him shoot the Indian,” came the reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e 138\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now, boy,” Duff began, calmly sitting down on a log, his rifle in both hands, while his eyes never left the face of the lad he so monstrously accused, “you heard what was said. They’ve hanged men for killing peaceable Redskins before now, and will do it again. Just let us tell what we know at Fort Pitt, and you are pretty likely to stretch a rope. You killed Black Eagle; we saw you do it—never mind, now! Let me talk! I say we saw you shoot the Indian down. We can set all the Mingoes west of the Ohio against you, or we can have you hanged. We haven’t just decided which we’d rather do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why, you—you black liar, what are you talking about?” cried John, succeeding at last in getting a word in, as Duff paused. “Do you suppose—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Never you mind what I suppose; but we can make you a heap of trouble, because, you know, we saw you kill the Indian—shoot him down in cold blood.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 139\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And here a villainous smile flitted over the marked and loathsome face of the wretch; but he scarcely paused, and there was no suspicion of a smile in the cold harshness of his voice as he went on:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We can make you and the pompous young gentleman you call Kingdom sweat blood, or hang your scalps on the belts of the Mingoes, without the least trouble to ourselves. But we don’t propose to do that. We have nothing against you young shavers, and don’t want to have. All we want is the paper writing you got from the body of Ichabod Nesbit. Oh yes, we know you got it. What were you coming here to bury the bones for, if you didn’t?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As one who thinks he has asked a question which cannot be answered, Duff, squinting in a most horrid manner and shaking his finger viciously, paused for a reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John was thinking fast. He knew that the murderous trio who faced him would not hesitate to kill if they thought he had the missing half of the hidden fortune letter in his possession. He also knew from the words he had heard Duff use in speaking of Black Eagle, that he had at first believed the letter had fallen into the Quaker’s hands. Did he know where that gentleman then was? It was hardly likely.\n\u003cbr\u003e 140\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In infinitely less time than the telling of it requires, the alert young pioneer thought of these things and without even seeming to hesitate, he answered:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’ll have to tell me what you are trying to get at; and for the matter of that, what are you doing here? What reason had you for killing Black Eagle the way you did, and he without even a hatchet to defend himself? You can’t put that wicked, cold-blooded murder onto me by lying, any more than you can fly. What’s more, you can’t scare me by saying you’ll swear I killed the Indian! So I tell you right here, Mr. Duff, that I want no more to do with you. You guessed right in thinking I came here to bury all that’s left of Ichabod Nesbit. It is because my partner and I have civilized feelings. Anything else you want to know you can ask about at the next house. What was Ichabod Nesbit to you, anyway? If you ever had any friendship for him, why shouldn’t you turn in here and help with his grave?”\n\u003cbr\u003e 141\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With such rapidity did John speak, his voice growing in vehemence as he continued, that Duff was bothered to find an immediate answer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Didn’t you see no Quaker feller ’round here, an’ ain’t he got no letter like Duff said?” squeaked Dexter, over Duff’s shoulder, in his peculiar gasping tones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Shut up, you!” commanded Duff, turning to his companion savagely. “Who said anything about a Quaker?” And then to John in the same tones: “Now we have no time for foolishness, bub! We want information and, by heaven, we propose to have it!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As he spoke the hideous fellow leaped toward the boy as though to seize him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Stand back there!” the lad cried, clubbing his rifle, unwilling to shoot, much as he was inclined to do so, unless it were absolutely necessary.\n\u003cbr\u003e 142\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Grab him! Grab him, you blasted fools!” yelled Duff furiously, and Dexter and Quilling, who ran to their leader’s side, attempted to do so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dodging the fellows, John dealt a stunning blow on Duff’s head with the butt of his rifle, then, springing to one side, escaped the terrific lunge the brute made toward him, and in another second he had leaped upon Neb’s back, Dexter and Quilling being not five yards away. He seized the reins from the branch over which they were thrown, and a word was enough to set the horse off at a gallop.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A bullet whistled over John’s shoulder as he bent down to avoid the low limbs of the trees, and the terrible tones of Duff, as in the vilest language he cursed his companions for being too slow, rang in his ears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One other shot was fired but it went wide. For five minutes he gave Neb free rein, then knowing that he was, for the time being, safe, he stopped, nervous and excited, and doubting if his conduct had been either brave or wise.\n\u003cbr\u003e 143\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But it was three against one and those fellows would have tried to make me tell all I know about that letter, and Duff’s temper is so awful! He would have killed me, like as not, if I would not tell him anything,” John reasoned, persuading himself that he had done well to escape.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What was next to be done? That was the all-important question, after all. Its answer, John decided, depended entirely on what Duff and his agreeable companions meant to do, and he resolved to ascertain their intentions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Without further loss of time, therefore, the boy fastened Neb’s reins to a branch as he had done before, and with great caution hurried back along the trail. If he were being followed, he could soon find it out. If the murderers were gone, he might return and complete the task he had set out to perform.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Expecting to see Duff and the others coming toward him at any moment, John made haste slowly, and half an hour passed before he again came within sight of the little valley where the day’s terrible tragedy had been enacted. The three men were not there.\n\u003cbr\u003e 144\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where were they? To answer the question, the young man who asked it of himself continued on, going in the direction in which Quilling and Dexter had disappeared just after the murder of Black Eagle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They may have a camp near by,” John told himself as he hurried along, quietly as possible, though the leaves under his feet seemed to rustle loudly as though calling out that he was coming, adding to his fears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But he was right. Not much more than a quarter of a mile away was a great tree, uprooted by the wind; and partially concealed by the branches of its top upon the ground, he discovered Duff, Dexter and Quilling. They were for the most part hidden by the limbs of the fallen oak and had not John been very watchful he would not have discovered them without being seen himself. As it was, he doubted his ability to approach nearer without revealing his presence to the fellows. That they were talking he knew by their gestures, but not a word could he hear.\n\u003cbr\u003e 145\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Prudence prompted the boy to turn back and hurry home to tell Ree everything that had happened. Then he thought how anxious his chum would be to know what Duff’s plans were; and so, yielding to his own curiosity and a desire to obtain this information, he made a wide half-circle and approached the fallen tree, shielded from view by the mass of earth still clinging to its upturned roots. These very roots, however, which served him so well for the one purpose, entirely prevented his hearing what was being said by the men, though he was now quite near. With great care, then, he crept around to the trunk of the tree and keeping close beside it, on his hands and knees crawled forward. Now he could hear the conversation of the fellows, and under the protection of a great limb which projected from the trunk fifty feet from the tree’s base, he paused.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It don’t noway stand to reason that the Quaker ain’t got the letter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 146\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John knew that it was Dexter who was talking, though he could not see. The wheezy voice could be no other’s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But where is he? That’s the point I’m getting at. We could fix him in short order, if we only knew that.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These words, sharply spoken, were surely Duff’s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All I’ve got to say is, that I wish I was to home—I do, by gum!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was the landlord, tired, probably, of sleeping out at night, and working and walking by day. John knew his voice, also.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I wish to goodness you were!” came the voice of Duff, disgustedly, “but all the miserable, sneaking robbing of travelers’ clothes at night, that you ever did wouldn’t be a drop in the bucket beside this buried fortune if we can only get hold of it. No man knows better than me what a lot of wealth that chest has in it—unless it be that Quaker, blast him!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, we might go back to Fort Pitt for a spell, anyhow, an’ rest up,” suggested Quilling.\n\u003cbr\u003e 147\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not by a jugful!” Duff answered. “We’ll follow those blasted youngsters up, and find out what they know. Like as not they, and not the Quaker, have got that letter. They’re a blamed sight sharper than you give ’em credit for, and the next time you let one of ’em get away from you, I’ll boot you seven ways for Sunday, see if I don’t!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Duff’s tones were full of emphasis, and it was all very interesting to the boy concealed behind the tree trunk and the giant limb. But he heard no more; for with, “So, now, stir yourselves,” the chief of the conspirators walked out from the tree-top. He went toward a small beech in which John now noticed that the quarters of a deer had been hung, beyond the reach of wolves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fellow’s course took him within a few yards of the hidden boy, but he passed on, unconscious of the eyes which watched him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Knowing that in returning to the camp with the deer Duff would be almost certain to see him, John waited only till the man’s back was toward him, then leaped to his feet and ran.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2695/74087.html","bookId":1463,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:33:32 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:33:32 AM"}
