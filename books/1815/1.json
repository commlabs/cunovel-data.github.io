My condo on the Upper West Side had the level of soundproofing expected in a multimillion-dollar property, but still the sounds of the city filtered in—the rhythmic thumping of tires over the well-worn streets, the protests of weary air brakes, and the nonstop honking of taxi horns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stepped out of the corner café onto always-busy Broadway, the rush of the city washed over me. How had I ever lived without the cacophony of Manhattan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had I ever managed living without him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon Cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cupped his jaw in my hands, felt him nuzzle into my touch. That show of vulnerability and affection cut right through me. Just hours before I’d thought he might never change, that I would have to compromise too much to share my life with him. Now, I stood in the face of his courage and doubted my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I demanded more of him than I had of myself ? I was shamed by the possibility that I’d pushed him to evolve while I had remained obstinately the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood before me, so tall and strong. In jeans and a T-shirt, with a ball cap pulled low over his brow, he was unrecognizable as the global mogul the world thought it knew but still so innately compelling he affected everyone who walked by. In the corner of my eye, I noted how the people nearby glanced at him, then did a double take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether Gideon was dressed casually or in the bespoke three-piece suits he favored, the power of his leanly muscular body was unmistakable. The way he held himself, the authority he wielded with faultless control, made it impossible for him to ever fade into the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew York swallowed everything that came into it, while Gideon had the city on a gilded leash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was mine. Even with my ring on his finger, I still sometimes struggled to believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would never be just a man. He was ferocity sheathed in elegance, perfection veined with flaws. He was the nexus of my world, a nexus of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he’d just proven that he would bend and yield to the breaking point to be with me. Which left me with a renewed determination to prove I was worth the pain I’d forced him to face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround us, the shop fronts along Broadway were reopening. The flow of traffic on the street began to thicken, black cars and yellow cabs bouncing wildly over the uneven surface. Residents trickled onto the sidewalks, taking their dogs out or heading toward Central Park for an early-morning run, stealing what time they could before the workday kicked in with a vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Benz pulled up to the curb just as we reached it, Raúl a big shadowy figure at the wheel. Angus slid the Bentley into place behind it. My ride and Gideon’s, going to separate homes. How was that a marriage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFact was, it was our marriage, though neither of us wanted it that way. I’d had to draw a line when Gideon hired my boss away from the advertising agency I worked for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood my husband’s desire for me to join Cross Industries, but trying to force my hand by taking action behind my back? … I couldn’t allow it, not with a man like Gideon. Either we were together—making decisions together—or we were too far apart to make our relationship work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilting my head back, I looked up into his stunning face. There was remorse there, and relief. And love. So much love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was breathtaking how handsome he was. His eyes were the blue of the Caribbean, his hair a thick and glossy black mane that brushed his collar. An adoring hand had sculpted every plane and angle of his face into a level of flawlessness that mesmerized and made it hard to think rationally. I’d been captivated by the look of him from the moment I first saw him, and I still found my synapses frying at random moments. Gideon just dazzled me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was the man inside, his relentless energy and power, his sharp intelligence and ruthlessness coupled with a heart that could be so tender …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” My fingertips brushed over the dark slash of his brow, tingling as they always did when they touched his skin. “For calling me. For telling me about your dream. For meeting me here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d meet you anywhere.” The words were a vow, spoken fervently and fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone had demons. Gideon’s were caged by his iron will when he was awake. When he slept, they tormented him in violent, vicious nightmares that he’d resisted sharing with me. We had so much in common, but the abuse in our childhoods was a shared trauma that both drew us together and pushed us apart. It made me fight harder for Gideon and what we had together. Our abusers had taken too much away from us already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eva … You’re the only force on earth that can keep me away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for that, too,” I murmured, my chest tight. Our recent separation had been brutal for both of us. “I know it wasn’t easy for you to give me space, but we needed it. And I know I pushed you hard ….” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-1.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
