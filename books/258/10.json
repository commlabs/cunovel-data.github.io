It belongs to de Ruthven plantation. But when my ole massa—Heaben bless his spirit—sot me free, he gib me de right to use de boathouse so long as I pleased.

They don\u0027t seem to resemble each other very much.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, you see, da aint persackly brother an\u0027 sister.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No?\" and the surgeon raised his heavy eyebrows as if in surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, sah. Massah Jack is only de \u0027dopted son ob de late colonel.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, is that really so?

I have found the boy at last!\" he muttered to himself, as he began to walk the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What did you say, sah?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s quite like a romance, my man.

As he was lifting his things out he saw a man strolling near. The individual proved to be St. John Ruthven, who had come in that direction in hope of seeing Marion alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hullo, Ben!\" cried St. John. \"See anything of Marion to-day?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She dun went out in a boat, sah.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"With Jack?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sah.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What, after that experience in the storm?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sah.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should think they would be afraid.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Da aint so afraid as some folks is, Massah St. John.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you mean that as an insult to me, you good-for-nothing nigger?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, sah. I mean Miss Marion an\u0027 Massah Jack are wery stout-hearted.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My aunt is foolish to let Marion go out with that boy. Some day Marion will be drowned.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jack knows wot he is doin\u0027, I rackon, sah.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t know him. He is thoroughly reckless. I presume as a nobody his life isn\u0027t worth much, but——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I rackon his life is as sweet to him as yours is to yo\u0027, Massah St. John.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you take me out in a boat after them?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sorry, sah, but I\u0027se gwine to take dis gen\u0027man out, sah.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e St. John turned and saw Dr. Mackey standing near, the surgeon having come from the boathouse to listen in silence to the conversation which was taking place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had met the doctor at the Oldville tavern the evening before, and bowed stiffly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Ruthven,\" said the doctor; \"but I am curious to visit the old wreck on Hemlock Bluff rocks. Perhaps this man has another boat——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, it doesn\u0027t matter, Dr. Mackey,\" answered St. John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are evidently a cousin to Miss Marion Ruthven.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And a cousin to the lad named Jack.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is no cousin of mine—even though my aunt has foolishly treated him as her son.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why foolishly?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is a waif of the sea—cast up from that wreck; yet my aunt presents him to the world as a Ruthven—when he may be of very low birth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Evidently you are proud of your name.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am proud, sir, for there is no family in South Carolina which bears a better name. We are descended from St. George Ruthven, one of the knights of Queen Elizabeth\u0027s reign.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I congratulate you, sir, and I now understand how this matter grates upon you.

Strange things have happened in this world.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But he looks as if he came of low birth,\" responded St. John haughtily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There I must disagree with you, Mr. Ruthven.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dat\u0027s de talk!\" muttered Old Ben, as he eyed St. John darkly. \"Massah Jack\u0027s as good as dat coward any day!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As you please, doctor; but I shall hold to my opinion.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Mackey shrugged his shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have that right.

St. John walked up the shore, but presently turned to view the doctor from a distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He talks as if he knew a thing or two,\" muttered the spendthrift to himself. \"Can it be possible that he knows something of the past, and is going out to the wreck for a purpose?\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3023/83627.html","bookId":258,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:59:06 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:59:06 AM"}
