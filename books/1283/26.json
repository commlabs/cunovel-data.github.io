A taxi came and fetched her and brought her back. She said she needed some medicine.\n\u003cbr\u003e That night she made a special effort to be gay. She drank a lot and when they went upstairs, she led him into her bedroom and made passionate love to him. Bond\u0027s body responded, but afterwards she cried bitterly into her pillow and Bond went to his room in grim despair.\n\u003cbr\u003e He could hardly sleep and in the early hours he heard her door open softly. Some small sounds came from downstairs. He was sure she was in the telephone booth. Very soon he beard her door softly close and he guessed that again there had been no reply from Paris.\n\u003cbr\u003e This was Saturday.\n\u003cbr\u003e On Sunday the man with the black patch was back again. Bond knew it directly he looked up from his lunch and saw her face. He had told her all that the patron had told him, withholding only the man\u0027s statement that he might be back. He had thought it would worry her.\n\u003cbr\u003e He had also telephoned Mathis in Paris and checked on the Peugeot. It had been hired from a respectable firm two weeks before. The customer had had a Swiss triptyque. His name was Adolph Gettler. He had given a bank in Zurich as his address.\n\u003cbr\u003e Mathis had got on to the Swiss police. Yes, the bank had an account in this name. It was little used. Herr Gettler was understood to be connected with the watch industry. Inquiries could be pursued if there was a charge against him.\n\u003cbr\u003e Vesper had shrugged her shoulders at the information. This time when the man appeared she left her lunch in the middle and went straight up to her room.\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond made up his mind. When he had finished, he followed her. Both her doors were locked and when he made her let him in, he saw that she had been sitting in the shadows by the window, watching, he presumed.\n\u003cbr\u003e Her face was of cold stone. He led her to the bed and drew her down beside him. They sat stiffly, like people in a railway carriage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Vesper,\u0027 he said, holding her cold hands in his, \u0027we can\u0027t go on like this. We must finish with it. We are torturing each other and there is only one way of stopping it. Either you must tell me what all this is about or we must leave. At once.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e She said nothing and her hands were lifeless in his.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027My darling,\u0027 he said. \u0027Won\u0027t you tell me? Do you know, that first morning I was coming back to ask you to marry me. Can\u0027t we go back to the beginning again? What is this dreadful nightmare that is killing us?\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e At first she said nothing, then a tear rolled slowly down her cheek.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027You mean you would have married me?\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Oh my God,\u0027 she said. \u0027My God.\u0027 She turned and clutched him, pressing her face against his chest.\n\u003cbr\u003e He held her closely to him. \u0027Tell me, my love,\u0027 he said. \u0027Tell me what\u0027s hurting you.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e Her sobs became quieter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Leave me for a little,\u0027 she said and a new note had come into her voice. A note of resignation. \u0027Let me think for a little.\u0027 She kissed his face and held it between her hands. She looked at him with yearning. \u0027Darling, I\u0027m trying to do what\u0027s best for us. Please believe me. But it\u0027s terrible. I\u0027m in a frightful . . .\u0027 She wept again, clutching him like a child with nightmares.\n\u003cbr\u003e He soothed her, stroking the long black hair and kissing her softly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Go away now,\u0027 she said. \u0027I must have time to think. We\u0027ve got to do something.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e She took his handkerchief and dried her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e She led him to the door and there they held tightly to each other. Then he kissed her again and she shut the door behind him.\n\u003cbr\u003e That evening most of the gayness and intimacy of their first night came back. She was excited and some of her laughter sounded brittle, but Bond was determined to fall in with her new mood and it was only at the end of dinner that he made a passing remark which made her pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e She put her hand over his.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Don\u0027t talk about it now,\u0027 she said. \u0027Forget it now. It\u0027s all past. I\u0027ll tell you about it in the morning.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e She looked at him and suddenly her eyes were full of tears. She found a handkerchief in her bag and dabbed at them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Give me some more champagne,\u0027 she said. She gave a queer little laugh. \u0027I want a lot more. You drink much more than me. It\u0027s not fair.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e They sat and drank together until the bottle was finished. Then she got to her feet. She knocked against her chair and giggled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027I do believe I\u0027m tight,\u0027 she said, \u0027how disgraceful. Please, James, don\u0027t be ashamed of me. I did so want to be gay. And I am gay.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e She stood behind him and ran her fingers through his black hair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Come up quickly,\u0027 she said. \u0027I want you badly tonight.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e She blew a kiss at him and was gone.\n\u003cbr\u003e For two hours they made slow, sweet love in a mood of happy passion which the day before Bond would never have thought they could regain. The barriers of self-consciousness and mistrust seemed to have vanished and the words they spoke to each other were innocent and true again and there was no shadow between them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027You must go now,\u0027 said Vesper when Bond had slept for a while in her arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e As if to take back her words she held him more closely to her, murmuring endearments and pressing her body down the whole length of his.\n\u003cbr\u003e When he finally rose and bent to smooth back her hair and finally kiss her eyes and her mouth good night, she reached out and turned on the light.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Look at me,\u0027 she said, \u0027and let me look at you.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e He knelt beside her.\n\u003cbr\u003e She examined every line on his face as if she was seeing him for the first time. Then she reached up and put an arm round his neck. Her deep blue eyes were swimming with tears as she drew his head slowly towards her and kissed him gently on the lips. Then she let him go and turned off the light\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Good night, my dearest love,\u0027 she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e Bond bent and kissed her. He tasted the tears on her heck.\n\u003cbr\u003e He went to the door and looked back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027Sleep well, my darling,\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, everything\u0027s all right now.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e He closed the door softly and walked to his room with a full heart.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46105.html","bookId":1283,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:23:02 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:23:02 AM"}
