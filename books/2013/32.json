A few hundred at most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmperor Rhulad’s torment was not the product of a fevered imagination, nor born of a host of anxieties. What haunted him were the truths of his past. She was able to identify some of his mutterings, in particular the one that dominated his nightmares, for she had been there. In the throne room, witness to Rhulad’s non-death, weeping there on the floor all slick with his spilled blood, with a corpse on his throne and Rhulad’s own slayer lying half upright against the dais-stolen away by poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannan Mosag’s pathetic slither towards that throne had been halted by the demon that had appeared to collect the body of Brys Beddict, and the almost indifferent sword thrust that killed Rhulad as the apparition made its way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor’s awakening shriek had turned her heart into a frozen lump, a cry so brutally raw that she felt its fire in her own throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was what followed, a short time after his return, that stalked Rhulad with a thousand dripping blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo die, only to return, is to never escape. Never escaped… anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWounds closing, he had lifted himself up, onto his hand and knees, still gripping the cursed sword, the weapon that would not let go. Weeping, drawing in ragged breaths, h crawled towards the throne, sagging down once more whe: he reached the dais.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNisall had stepped out from where she had hidden moments earlier. Her mind was numb-the suicide of he king-her lover-and the Eunuch, Nifadas-the shocks one upon another in this terrible throne room, the deaths, tumbling like crowded gravestones in a flooded field Triban Gnol, ever the pragmatist, knelt before the new Emperor, pledging his service with the ease of an eel sliding under a new rock. The First Consort had been witness, well, but she could not see Turudal Brizad now, as Rhulad, hlood-wet coins gleaming, twisted round on the step and bared his teeth at Hannan Mosag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not yours,’ he said in a rasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Rhulad-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Emperor! And you, Hannan Mosag, are my Ceda… Warlock King no longer. My Ceda, yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your wife-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Dead. Yes.’ Rhulad lifted himself onto the dais, then lose, staring now at the dead Letherii king, Ezgara Diskanar. Then he reached out with his unburdened hand, grasped the front of the king’s brocaded tunic, and dragged the corpse from the throne, letting it fall to one side, head crunching on the tiled floor. A shiver seemed to rack through Rhulad. Then he sat on the throne and looked out, eyes settling once more on Hannan Mosag. ‘Ceda,’ he said, ‘in this, our chamber, you will ever approach us on your belly, as you do now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the shadows at the far end of the throne room there came a phlegmatic cackle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad flinched, then said, ‘Now you will leave us, Ceda. And take that hag Janall and her son with you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Emperor, please, you must understand-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Get out!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shriek jarred Nisall, and she hesitated, fighting the urge to flee, to get away from this place. From the court, from the city, from everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his free hand snapped out and without turning he said to her, ‘Not you, whore. You stay.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhore. ‘That term is inappropriate,’ she said, then stiffened in fear, surprised by her own temerity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fixed feverish eyes on her. Then, incongruously, he waved dismissively and spoke with sudden weariness. ‘Of course. We apologize. Imperial Concubine…’ His glittering fece twisted in a half-smile. ‘Your king should have taken you as well. He was being selfish, or perhaps his love for you was so dleep that he could not bear inviting you into death.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing, for, in truth, she had no answer to give him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, we see the doubt in your eyes. Concubine, you have our sympathy. Know that we will not use you cruelly.’ He fell silent then, as he watched Hannan Mosag drag himself back across the threshold of the chamber’s grand entrance-way. A half-dozen more Tiste Edur had appeared, tremulous in their furtive motions, their uncertainty at what they were witnessing. A hissed command from Hannan Mosag sent two into the room, each one drawing up the burlap over the mangled forms of Janall and Quillas, her son. The sound as they dragged the two flesh-filled sacks from the chamber was, to Nisall’s ears, more grisly than anything else she had yet heard on this fell day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘At the same time,’ the Emperor went on after a moment, ‘the title and its attendant privileges… remain, should you so desire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked, feeling as if she was standing on shifting sand. ‘You free me to choose, Emperor?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-32.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
