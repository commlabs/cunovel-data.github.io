A desperate rescue attempt succeeds, with Drizzt and Innovindil rescuing the latter\u0027s pegasus, which Obould had captured and chained as a trophy, and Drizzt is unexpectedly reunited with the Companions that he long thought dead. The only major plot line to be tied up in this novel is the question of what Drizzt will do about his relationship with Catti-brie. Other than that, The Two Swords resolves a few minor plot threads. Drizzt and the surface elf Innovindil bring their quest for the captured pegasus to a conclusion. A few more characters meet their demise in this novel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3.jpg","author":"R.A.
