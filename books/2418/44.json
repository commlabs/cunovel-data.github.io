She\u0027d changed into business clothes — blazer and skirt and immaculate white silk blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friend Deputy Gerson. That odd man, Mr. Diliberto. They\u0027re practicing on your target range.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since when does a line of beer cans constitute a target range?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAna checked her gun, straightened her blazer over it. \"You want me to call them back in? I need to get to town. I\u0027m already late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay. Good luck with Rey Feo\u0027s murderer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAna\u0027s eyebrows knit together. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hazy about how much I had told her the night before, or even if it was the night before when we\u0027d talked, so I recounted my conversation Saturday with the bartender at the Poco Mas. I told her that the old man had seen Hector Mara arguing several weeks ago with a heavyset, dark-haired Anglo, a man Hector had derisively referred to as Rey Feo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Del,\" I said. \"Zeta Sanchez had just gotten back into town. Del and Hector were meeting to figure out what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLeon looked at the Army Corps of Engineers\u0027 map of Sabinal above the mantel. She seemed to be tracing the elevation lines, trying to separate them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I\u0027m fine. It\u0027s just — something Kelsey told me once. It rang a bell there for a second...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother round of gunfire crackled in the fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful when you go back. Chich knew you had Del. He knew exactly what Del was telling you. Chich has somebody in the department feeding him information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAna was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelsey was vice,\" I said, unnecessarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tres, he\u0027s my partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as you got into Chich\u0027s life, Chich was on the phone to Kelsey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Kelsey may not be the best partner, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ana, just tell me you\u0027ll be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, then slowly reconstructed her smile. \"You\u0027re one to give advice. You sure you don\u0027t want me to get your friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let the boys have their fun with the beer cans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her eyes on me a few seconds longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. You\u0027re going to be okay, is all. I\u0027m glad for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make it sound like a good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLeon came over and gave me a swift kiss on the lips. Then she was gone. I listened to her car engine start, the sound of gravel pinging under her wheels as she drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes I sat up, waited for the black spots to clear, then tried to stand. I felt like I\u0027d just dismounted from an unfriendly bull. I looked down at the black socks and Wild Turkey T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made my way through the bedrooms until I found some spare clothes I\u0027d left on my last visit — jeans, a flannel shirt. After a year or two I managed to get dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked the cupboard for something easy on the stomach and found nothing except ammo boxes and rat poison. The refrigerator held Budweiser and some cow drugs, massive syringes half full and dirty with blood from their last use. I settled for a large glass of tap water. On second thought, I didn\u0027t drink that\u0026nbsp; either. After finding my boots, I opened the front door and did a quick duck underneath the wasp nest forming there. Harold was as good about keeping up the property as he was at stocking the larder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning gray had burned off. The air smelled of steamed grass and cow dung. A Mexican eagle circled over the trees that lined the creek in the center of the property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Navarre ranch isn\u0027t much of a spread by South Texas standards — 250 acres, about the size of a King Ranch bathroom. The usually dry Apache Creek snakes through its middle, with wheat fields to the north and west, grazing lands and deer-hunting woods to the south and east. Where the land isn\u0027t cultivated it\u0027s choked with white-brush and cactus, littered with limestone chunks, the topography around the creek gouged with sinkholes and gullies and washouts from years of unpredictable flooding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found Ozzie and Harold in a clearing where the mouth of the road dipped down into the trees between the creekbed and the man-made cow pond. Ozzie was dressed in civilian clothes — jeans, white-and-red Hawaiian shirt, boots, white Stetson. A side arm and several extra magazines were spread across a table made from an old door and two sawhorses. Harold Diliberto stood next to him with the Remington 700.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe usual line of beer cans was set up on a hay bale fifty yards downrange. Ozzie had also set out a professional target — a small metal disk designed to rock back on its base when hit and make a resounding ping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie grinned when he saw me walking up. \"Well — it\u0027s alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI accepted his congratulatory pounding on my back, which was marginally less painful than an electric nail driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarold Diliberto offered me a hit from his breakfast whiskey flask. I declined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just getting my aim back,\" Ozzie told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis side arm was a .357 semiautomatic that had seen a lot of use. The muzzle was scored as if it had once been fitted with the wrong end sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Ozzie aim at the metal target, then fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched at the sound, even though I knew it was coming. There is nothing quite so loud as a gun fired by someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no subsequent ping against the target. I kept my eyes on the gun. \"Used to be the recoil on this thing didn\u0027t bother me at all,\" Ozzie said. \"You get stiff in one arm, even if it\u0027s not your good arm, it completely fucks you up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive me that old rifle, Harold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarold looked from the rifle to Ozzie. \"You serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie took the Remington from Harold and clamped the stock under his bad shoulder, released the bolt with his good hand. The loading spring dangled uselessly underneath. It would be one shot at a time forevermore with the Remington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith some effort, Ozzie pushed a .243 bullet into the magazine, slid the bolt forward to chamber the round, locked the handle down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said with satisfaction. \"In the old days I could fire one of these with my good arm in a cast. Just prop it on a fence. I\u0027m getting old. So, Tres — feel good to be done with the Brandon family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down the reservoir road. Clouds of gnats floated over the little bridge of land between the creekbed and the water tank. I remembered a time in high school — coming out here with a half-dozen friends, getting together with some of the local kids who promised us dinner in exchange for beer. We\u0027d set up a barbecue pit on that road, cranked up the truck radio, and watched the local boys shoot ring-necked doves out of the sky one after another, gutting and cooking them for us on the spot. I remembered Lillian, the girl I\u0027d been with at the time, and what it was like trying to make out in the back of a truck with the constant fire of guns and dead birds falling all around us. I hadn\u0027t thought of that day in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t feel much of anything,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie nodded. \"They doped you up pretty good. I\u0027ll give you a ride back to town this afternoon, you want it. I\u0027m going to personally have a chat with Chich Gutierrez, let him know what\u0027s what. I\u0027m a civilian now. I\u0027m leaving town. I figure what the fuck — the bastard needs a talking-to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarold Diliberto sat back against the door-table and slurped his whiskey. Ozzie brought up his bad arm carefully, used his forearm as a platform to stabilize the barrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You figure Chich\u0027s men shot George Berton and Mara?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie sighted the target. A trickle of sweat wove its way down his cheek. His hatband was already stained brown as a coffee filter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The M.E. thought there was somebody else in George\u0027s house that night,\" I said. \"A single shooter who came in the back. Maybe the shooter got out of the house before Chicharron got inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie shot and missed. He lowered the barrel, his eyes full of cool amusement. \"The timing would be a pretty huge coincidence, kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if the shooter choreographed it that way. Not if he knew Chich would be watching the house, knew that any witnesses would most likely implicate the guys in the white van.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie turned the vertical knob on the telescopic sight. \"You ask Sandra Mara about that possibility?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who says I could find her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie laughed, turned to Diliberto. \"Dang, Harold. This five-by-thirty sighted for you? How you manage to hit anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you were right,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie smiled at me. \"Right about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe the thing to do is just wait and ask George.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie turned the horizontal knob. \"How\u0027s he doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erainya says he\u0027s still sedated. But he\u0027s beat the infection. He\u0027s going to make it. Maybe another three or four days and he\u0027ll be able to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie grinned. \"That\u0027s excellent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you and Audrey going? Cancun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie nodded, released the rifle bolt. The spent casing ejected, spiraling past Harold\u0027s ear. Harold Diliberto had finished his flask and was now looking for something else to do. He zeroed in on Ozzie\u0027s .357, picked it up, and began slowly, drunkenly, field-stripping it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie just looked over and laughed good-naturedly. Diliberto liked taking things apart. Sometimes he even got them back together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told Harold I\u0027d leave that old .357 at the ranch for him,\" Ozzie said. \"God knows he needs something better than this rifle. And yeah, kid. Cancun. If I was you, I\u0027d tell Sandra Mara to clear out. They haul her in, they won\u0027t go easy on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re probably right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chich Gutierrez is still looking for those lost two kilos of heroin,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sandra will be the one Chich holds accountable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie winced with effort as he reloaded the rifle. \"I ever tell you your dad was the first man I saw hunt with a handgun? That same .357 Harold\u0027s destroying right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarold looked up like he\u0027d just vaguely recognized his name. He had unloaded the .357\u0027s magazine and was now removing the chamber cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack and I were out there\" — Ozzie nodded toward the creek — \"looking at all the gravel in the riverbed. Your dad always talked about selling it for people\u0027s gardens, you remember? And this huge buck just appeared. I couldn\u0027t believe it. Your dad borrowed my side arm and shot it on the spot. Damnedest thing. We ate venison for months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought up his forearm for a brace, rested the Remington on it, and aimed. Harold looked up sleepily from the half-disassembled handgun. He was rubbing a finger over the irregular scoring on the muzzle. \"You been modifyin\u0027 for a silencer, Ozzie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOzzie fired. Metal pinged. He smiled and lowered the rifle. \"Naw. Bought me a new sight, tried to fit it on the barrel, turned out to be a bad match. You going to have anything left of that gun when you\u0027re through?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarold blushed. He started collecting the pieces of the .357 for reassembly. I was hit with another wave of nausea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, son.\" Ozzie quickly put the Remington on the table and caught my arm, guided me over to a flat piece of limestone to sit. \"You want us to walk you back to the house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be okay in a second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should take you back to town sooner than later.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-44.html","bookId":2418,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
