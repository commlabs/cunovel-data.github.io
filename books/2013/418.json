The lone sword in his right hand howled as he readied it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Step aside, Imass,’ he said. ‘The one behind you is mine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnrack shook his head. He is mine. Mine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear that the Tiste Andii saw Onrack’s refusal in the face of the Imass warrior, for he suddenly snarled-a sound of raw impatience-and lashed out with his left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorcery hammered-into Onrack. Lifting him from his feet, high into the air, then slamming him into a wall of stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he dropped down hard onto the floor, a single thought drifted through his mind before unconsciousness took him: Not again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull Sengar, lying helpless on the floor, cried out upon seeing Onrack engulfed in magic and then flung away. He struggled to regain his feet, but the leg was a dead weight now, and he was leaving a thick trail of blood as he dragged himself closer to Silchas Ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen someone was kneeling at his side. Hands soft on one shoulder-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stop,’ a woman’s voice murmured. ‘Stop, Trull Sengar. It is too late.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas struggled to breathe. Wither’s shadowy hands had crushed something in his throat. He felt himself weakening, darkness closing in on all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven knowing, he had failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the truth of ex-slaves, because even that word is a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlavery settles into the soul. My master now is naught but failure itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing himself to remain conscious, he lifted his head. Drag the breath in, dammit. Lift the head-fail if need be, but do not die. Not yet. Lift the head!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin sheathed his remaining sword, walked up to Ulshun Pral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd took him by the throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low woman’s voice spoke from his left. ‘Harm my son, Tiste Andii, and you will not leave here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to see a woman, an Imass, clothed in the skin of a panther. She was standing over the prone form of the warrior he had just flung aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That this one lives,’ she said, with a gesture down to the Imass at her bared feet, ‘is the only reason I have not already torn you to pieces.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Bonecaster, and the look in her feline eyes was a dark promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin loosened his hold on the Imass before him, then reached down and deftly plucked free a flint dagger. ‘This,’ he said, ‘is all I need.’ And as soon as he held the primitive weapon in his hand, he knew the truth of his claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping away, eyes holding the woman’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made no move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatisfied, Silchas Ruin turned about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren, kneeling beside Trull Sengar, watched the White Crow walk over to where Kettle sat on the stone floor. With his free hand he reached down to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fistful of tunic, a sudden lift, pulling the child into the air, then back down, hard, onto the flat of her back, her head cracking hard on the stone, even as he drove the flint knife into the centre of her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer small legs kicked, then went still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin slowly straightened. Stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas turned his head away, his vision filling with tears. Of course, the child had known, just as he had known. Kettle was, after all, the last desperate creation of an Azath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here, in this brutal place, she had been joined to a Finnest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Seren Pedac cry out. Looked once more, blinking to clear his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin had backed away, towards one of the gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere Kettle lay, the leather-wrapped handle of the flint knife jutting up from her chest, the air had begun to swirl, darkness condensing. And the small body was moving in fitful jerks, then a slow writhing of limbs as roots snaked out, sank tendrils into the very stone. Rock hissed, steamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin looked on for a moment longer, then he swung about, collected his second sword, sheathed it, and walked into a gate, vanishing from sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breathing less ragged, Udinaas twisted round, looked for Clip’s body-but the bastard was gone. A blood trail leading to one of the gates. It figures. But oh, I saw Trull Sengar ~ 1 saw him take you on, Clip. You, sneering at that paltry weapon, the lowly spear. 1 saw, Clip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark cloud surrounding Kettle’s body had burgeoned, grown. Stone foundations, black roots, the trickle of water spreading in a stain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Azath, to hold for ever the soul of Scabandari. Silchas Ruin, you have your vengeance. Your perfect exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, because he could not help himself, Udinaas lowered his head and began to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, Trull Sengar forced himself back onto his feet. Although without Seren Pedac at his side, taking much of his weight-and without the spear on which he leaned ~ she knew that that would have been impossible. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-418.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
