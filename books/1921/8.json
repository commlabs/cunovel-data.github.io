Too late for the freak-out warning. It had been going off since he’d drilled her into the sofa. He had no control with her. No cutoff switch or throttle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy leaned forward. “You can’t tell me that a woman assuming a sleepover when you’re in a wham-bam frame of mind doesn’t make things dicey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoving a bite of his food into his mouth, he chewed through his frustration. He didn’t want to analyze this…them. He’d rather stick with orgasmic ignorance. “I can tell you that as long as we’re both in the same place at the same time wanting the same thing, I really don’t give a shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy pushed back from the table. “All right. Excuse me a moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled at the sight of her half-eaten omelet, then glared at her retreating back. He’d give her five minutes to get her tight little ass back in her chair or he was going to drag her back in to finish eating…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned in a short white satin robe that revealed her bare legs and the lack of a bra. Jared forgot his aggravation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Darcy resumed eating with obvious relish, he leaned back in his chair, watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a town of this size, with only one fire station, how does the city council justify paying for two fire inspectors?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she looked up at him, her eyes were lit with amusement. “A combination of nepotism, being willing to work part time, and a good word from Jim.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim. He reined in his irritation with a long, slow exhale. “Who’s the family member?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My uncle. He moved several years ago, but memories are ageless in Lion’s Bay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the rest of your family is gone, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. Although my parents didn’t go far. They bought a place on Lake Horton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich wasn’t all that far from his place in Seattle. “Why do you stay? What’s here for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy pushed back from the table and picked up her plate. “Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her as she came toward him to collect his plate, too. “It doesn’t suit you,” he said. “The town. This house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding, he followed her to the sink. “I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I’m not as easy to read as you think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared backed off, noting the tension in her shoulders and the way she avoided his gaze. Coming up behind her, he pushed her ponytail aside and brushed his lips over her nape. He’d get the story out of her eventually. In the meantime, he wanted her soft and warm. He wanted to explore what it was about her that made him want to kiss her all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to face him. “Why did you join the Marshals Service?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped the counter on either side of her, trapping her in the cage of his arms. She smelled sweet and clean, and he was hyperaware of the fact that she was mostly naked beneath the thin wrap of white satin. “Because the military and I were done with each other and there’s nothing else I’m good at.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a good cook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands went to his hips, her fingers twining in his belt loops. “You’re seriously hot. You could be a calendar model. Or a Chippendales dancer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not flattering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re outrageously good in bed. Although monetizing that is illegal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like it on this side of the law,” he murmured, bending his head over her. “And I’m picky about who I go to bed with. I’d starve to death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s flattering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarcy was a confident woman; she knew the force of her sex appeal. Since it was highly doubtful she would’ve picked up that level of sensual sophistication around a town of this size, where the dating pool had to be painfully small, he was even more curious about the time she’d spent away from this place. And what had brought her back. Maybe she was licking her wounds after a bad breakup, swearing off men for a while and retreating to a place where she’d be left alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back. “Wanna watch TV?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes sparkled with silent laughter. She knew damn well he wanted another go at her, but he was going to hold off. He needed to be more careful or risk her burning out on him. He also needed to get a grip on himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Find something you like,” she urged. “I’ll join you after I load up the dishwasher.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went along with the suggestion only because he wanted to get a closer look at her place without making her nervous about it. Moving into the living room, Jared took notice of all the details he’d been too lust addled to appreciate earlier. His gaze went to the now infamous couch first. Its modern lines and extra deep cushions were very much in keeping with how he saw Darcy, as was the sixty-two-inch flat-screen TV hung over the fireplace. Both were out of place against dated wallpapered walls. The coffee and end tables were sturdy wood pieces as retro in style as the dining table, while the knickknacks around the room were contemporary pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePausing by the fireplace, he looked at the framed photos on the mantel. Some were of Darcy with her parents, some were of her sister. He could tell the two apart easily, a difference confirmed by pictures of the two sisters together. The set of Darcy’s shoulders and the cant of her chin were unique to her, displaying a self-possession and boldness that wasn’t as evident in her sister’s shy smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from the fireplace as she entered the room, his gaze hungry as it swept over her slender frame. He should be wrung out by the two explosive orgasms she’d already given him, and there was no denying she was sore. But that didn’t stop her from looking at him like she wanted to ride him ’til morning or him from seriously weighing the pros and cons of letting her. He’d experienced potent sexual attraction before, but this was inexorable. Feeling his cock stir, he shucked his jeans but left his boxer briefs on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t get excited,” he warned, when she caught her breath, “I’m just getting comfortable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching her lower lip between her teeth, she gave him a deliberately provocative look. She ran a finger down her throat to her cleavage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep it up,” he drawled, grabbing the remote before dropping into the corner of the couch where he’d had her pinned just hours before. He spread his legs and patted the spot between them. “Now be a good girl and lay here against me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came to him with a wry smile. “You don’t strike me as the type of man who likes good girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like you.” He wrapped an arm around her as she settled her back against his chest. “And I don’t expect you to behave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know me so well,” she teased, raking her short nails across his thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet, but he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun had barely risen when Jared finished poring over Darcy’s files. Finding his cell phone a poor substitute for the big screen of his laptop, he availed himself of Darcy’s office. He powered on her desktop, praying she didn’t have it password protected. Whether she always slept like the dead or he’d just worn her out, he figured she needed the sleep, considering the demands he’d be making of her over the length of his stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the computer screen flickered to life, he found himself looking at an image of Darcy and her sister, which served as the desktop wallpaper. They were children in the photo, not quite teenagers. Their hair was arranged in matching pigtails and they wore identical pale pink leotards. A reflection of their backs in a wall of mirrors was behind them, with a ballet bar that traversed the full width.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tucked the image away along with the other bits and pieces he was collecting in his mental file for her, then he got to work. He accessed the Merkerson case files, comparing the information with what he’d just acquired from Darcy’s. The similarities were irrefutable. In fact, they were nearly perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only anomaly he could pinpoint was the incendiary devices in relation to the rapidity of the timeline. Merkerson had started out with smaller devices, such as soda cans, but he’d been more intermittent. Months passed between arsons, until later in his rampage, when he advanced to using paint can–sized devices and striking every seven days. His illness had progressed to where he wanted the entire world to burn. Fire was his obsession and his mistress. This new combination of smaller devices and frequency melded his earlier work with his later freneticism, but whether that was evolution, devolution, or simply a poor fit to the pattern was debatable. And any of those options left the field wide open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared drafted a quick report to his superior, giving a rundown of his thoughts and impressions. She’d lived the case the first time around, which gave her insight worth tapping into. He also asked for an update on the anonymous 911 call that alerted the authorities to the second fire. Miller had ascertained that the call originated in Seattle and was placed via a burner phone. But the sheriff had stopped investigating at that point, leaving the thread dangling. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that question in mind, he powered down Darcy’s computer and checked the time. Seven thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeading back into the bedroom, he stopped by the nightstand and checked her alarm. It was set for eight, which gave him just about enough time. He looked down at her, finding her just as luscious while resting as he did when hit with the seething sensuality of the way she moved. She lay on her back with one arm bent around the top of her head and the other at her side. The sheet was loosely draped over her, exposing the upper swell of her tits and the bent knee of one leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pinched the sheet between his fingers and tugged it down, exposing her body in delicious increments. She slept on, innocently luring him to start the day with a bang…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDARCY AWOKE WITH a gasp, heat flaring across her skin in a molten wave. As her brain lurched into awareness, another heated lash across her clit had her moaning and instinctively closing her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they wouldn’t close. Strong hands held them down and spread for the next leisurely lick. Her heart raced with surprise and fear. Her eyes wrenched open, her hand thrusting downward to protect her intimate flesh. Her fingers sank into luxurious strands of thick hair, sliding through the mass to stroke over the scalp beneath. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-fire-shadow-stalkers-4/page-8.html","bookId":1921,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:18 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:18 AM"}
