A thousand. Two thousand. Three thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive thousand years had gone by in a flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter ten thousand years in which Meng Hao never appeared in public, his name had largely been forgotten by the successive generations of cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the older generation in the Mountain and Sea Realm had returned to the dust, and virtually no one now living had ever even heard of Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the ten thousand years, it wasn’t just people in the Mountain and Sea Realm who died. Cultivators passed away in other parts of the starry sky, such as in the Vast Expanse School, although the effects in those other places weren’t as pronounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the current starry sky of the Mountains and Seas, few people were aware that the starry sky even had a will of its own. People even stopped telling stories about the battle ten thousand years before, between Meng Hao and Allheaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a very, very small group of people who remembered, but most of them were Paragons. Because the Karma connecting them to Meng Hao wasn\u0027t very profound, and because of their incredible cultivation bases, the power of the curse didn\u0027t affect them in a significant way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several thousand years, Perfect’s longevity eventually ran out. Meng Hao collected her soul seed and sealed it in the ice mountain. That ice mountain contained all of the memories of Meng Hao’s entire life. Everyone he cared about, all of the good things, were there. That ice cave was also his weak spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spent most of his time sitting at the foot of the ice mountain, with only his memories to accompany him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally he would go out into the Mountain and Sea Realm. However, every time he did, things seemed unfamiliar. He almost felt as if he wasn’t even a part of the world any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he wasn’t aware of it, there was something building up within him, something that could only be described by a single word. Loneliness. And it was growing stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was the most powerful entity within the starry sky, but the feeling of loneliness only continued to grow. He never aged, and yet he felt more and more tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body was not growing older, but his heart was. And he could do nothing to change that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears marched along within the starry sky, faster and faster. Meng Hao felt as if those years were passing him by. All he could do was sit and watch them go. He looked at the living creatures that existed within the starry sky. He watched generations come and go. He saw gifted and talented individuals rise to glory. He saw people that others would call inhuman. He saw new powerful experts make names for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mountain and Sea Realm continued to prosper. Few people bore the mark of the curse any more. As people forgot Meng Hao, the Karma connecting them to him grew faint. Although many of them still had slightly limited longevity, their speed of cultivation was greatly enhanced because of living in the precious treasure that was the Mountain and Sea Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Nine Mountains and Seas, the natural laws were based on the nine great Hexing magics of the League of Demon Sealers. Because of that, it was much easier to reach the Dao Realm. In fact, throughout the ten thousand years which had passed, numerous outstanding cultivators had risen up. They created cultivation techniques unique to their generation, and also invented many, many new divine abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the millennia, the cultivators from the Mountain and Sea Realm were always considered to be one of the most powerful forces within the starry sky of the Mountains and Seas. Eventually, wild ambitions began to grow within the hearts of many cultivators. It was hard to say when exactly it began, but eventually they began to expand, and to subjugate one group of life forms after another within the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao watched it happen. He watched the wars being fought. He even strolled through battlefields sometimes, watching the Mountain and Sea cultivators die, watching the other living beings die. He watched the blood flow, and smelled the stench of gore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched it all, but did nothing. He didn’t help either side, and certainly didn’t fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the path the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm had chosen, and he wouldn’t interfere. As for exactly how it would all turn out, he wasn’t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Mountain and Sea Realm waged war, its people grew stronger. They encountered many critical situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Meng Hao, none of that was very important. The people he cared about were all gone, leaving him alone within Heaven and Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne year, when he went out into the Mountain and Sea Realm, he seemed like an old man. No one could detect his passage, not even the newly arisen Paragons of the realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis destination was Planet South Heaven, and the Violet Fate Sect. There were only a few things within the starry sky that Meng Hao cared about any more. One was the gradually weakening Patriarch Reliance. The other was in the Violet Fate Sect, where a woman rested in slumber, ever resistant to the idea of awakening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever Meng Hao thought about Chu Yuyan, his expression grew grimmer than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark clouds filled the sky above Planet South Heaven. Snow began to fall, and as the snowflakes accumulated on the various mortal kingdoms down below, the world turned white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown below on one of the public highways, a horse-drawn carriage sped along through the night. Within the carriage was a scholar, reading a book by the light of an oil lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao hovered up above, watching the snow fall, and watching the carriage speed along across the highway. He looked at the scholar, and couldn\u0027t help but think of that time he had traveled through a snowy night in the State of Zhao. [1.

Within that sect was a mountain that had once been called a Holy Land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat mountain had no peak, only a basin. It was a place that, throughout all the countless years which had passed, had come to be a restricted area. Not a single person from the Violet Fate Sect had ever set foot inside. The primary rule of the sect was that no one was allowed to go there. Many disciples of the Violet Fate Sect had speculated what was inside, and countless rumors existed about the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the stories were beautiful, and some were vile. Because of all the rumors, that mountain had become the most mysterious of places. For generation after generation, cultivators had stood guard around that mountain, although none of them knew exactly what they were guarding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey only knew that no one was allowed to climb to the top. If anyone tried to do so, they would reach a certain point halfway up where progress was impossible. Likewise, anyone who looked at the mountain from up above would only see rippling distortions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears ago, one of the most powerful Paragons of the Mountain and Sea Realm had come to the conclusion that an ancient precious treasure was buried there. He even gathered an army to go to the mountain and take away the treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, not even that Paragon was able to get more than half way up the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of that, the mountain came to be known, not as a Holy Land, but as a restricted area. It was also the most mysterious location in all of the Mountain and Sea Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao appeared at the bottom of the mountain, and looked up toward the top. This was not his first time coming here. After Xu Qing left, and after everyone else he knew had died, he had come to visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was actually his third time coming. He quietly took a step forward as he began to climb the mountain. No one saw him, and no one could detect his presence. He walked slowly, taking one step at a time as he headed toward the top.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-10-chapter-1592\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-10-chapter-1594\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-10-chapter-1593","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
