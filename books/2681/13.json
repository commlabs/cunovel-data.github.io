telephone exchange is destroyed.\" Paul had woken this morning with those words echoing in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a simple instruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he could fulfill it, he would have helped win the war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he failed, men would die-and he might spend the rest of his life reflecting that he had helped lose the war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to Baker Street early, but Percy Thwaite was already there, sitting in his office, puffing his pipe and staring at six boxes of files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed a typical military duffer, with his check jacket and toothbrush mustache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Paul with mild hostility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why Monty\u0027s put you in charge of this operation,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind that you\u0027re only a major, and I\u0027m a colonel-that\u0027s all stuff and nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you\u0027ve never run a clandestine operation, whereas I\u0027ve been doing it for three years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes it make sense to you?\" \"Yes,\" Paul said briskly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you want to make absolutely sure that a job gets done, you give it to someone you trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonty trusts me.\" \"But not me.\" \"He doesn\u0027t know you.\" \"I see,\" Percy said grumpily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul needed Percy\u0027s cooperation, so he decided to mollify him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking around the office, he saw a framed photograph of a young man in lieutenant\u0027s uniform and an older woman in a big hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy could have been Percy thirty years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your son?\" Paul guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy softened immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David\u0027s out in Cairo,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had some bad moments during the desert war, especially after Rommel reached Tobruk, but now, of course, he\u0027s well out of the line of fire, and I must say I\u0027m glad.\" The woman was dark-haired and dark-eyed, with a strong face, handsome rather than pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThwaite?\" \"Rosa Mann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe became famous as a suffragette, in the twenties, and she\u0027s always used her maiden name.\" \"Suffragette?\" \"Campaigner for votes for women.\" Percy liked formidable women, Paul concluded; that was why he was fond of Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, you\u0027re right about my shortcomings,\" he said candidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been at the sharp end of clandestine operations, but this will be my first time as an organizer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I\u0027ll be very grateful for your help.\" Percy nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I begin to see why you have a reputation for getting things done,\" he said with a hint of a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you\u0027ll hear a word of advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please.\" \"Be guided by Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one else has spent as much time under cover and survived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer knowledge and experience are matchless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may be in charge of her in theory, but what I do is give her the support she needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would never try to tell her what to do.\" Paul hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been given command by Monty, and he was not about to hand it over on anyone\u0027s advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bear that in mind,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy seemed satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gestured to the files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we get started?\" \"What are these?\" \"Records of people who were considered by us as possible agents, then rejected for some reason.\" Paul took off his jacket and rolled back his cuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spent the morning going through the files together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the candidates had not even been interviewed; others had been rejected after they had been seen; and many had failed some part of the SOE training course-baffled by codes, hopeless with guns, or frightened to the point of hysteria when asked to jump out of a plane with a parachute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were mostly in their early twenties, and they had only one other thing in common: they all spoke a foreign language with native fluency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a lot of files, but few suitable candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Percy and Paul had eliminated all the men, and the women whose language was something other than French, they were left with only three names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul was disheartened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had run into a major obstacle when they had hardly begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four is the minimum number we need, even assuming that Flick recruits the woman she has gone to see this morning.\" \"Diana Colefield.\" \"And none of these is either an explosives expert or a telephone engineer!\" Percy was more optimistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t when SOE interviewed them, but they might be now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen have learned to do all sorts of things.\" \"Well, let\u0027s find out.\" It took a while to track the three down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA further disappointment was that one was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two were in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby Romain, unfortunately, was in His Majesty\u0027s Prison for Women at Holloway, three miles north of Baker Street, awaiting trial for murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Maude Valentine, whose file said simply \"psychologically unsuitable,\" was a driver with the FANYs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down to two!\" Paul said despondently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the numbers but the quality that bothers me,\" Percy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We knew from the start we\u0027d be looking at rejects.\" Percy\u0027s tone became angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we can\u0027t risk Flick\u0027s life with people like these!\" Percy was desperate to protect Flick, Paul realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older man had been willing to hand over control of the operation but was not able to give up his role as Flick\u0027s guardian angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir argument was interrupted by a phone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Simon Fortescue, the pinstriped spook from M16 who had blamed SOE for the failure at Sainte-Cecile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you?\" Paul said guardedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortescue was not a man to trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I may be able to do something for you,\" Fortescue said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re going ahead with Major Clairet\u0027s plan.\" \"Who told you?\" Paul asked suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was supposed to be a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not go into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI naturally wish you success with your mission, even though I was against it, and I\u0027d like to help.\" Paul was angry that the mission was being talked about, but there was no point in pursuing that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know a female telephone engineer who speaks perfect French?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0027s someone you should see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name is Lady Denise Bowyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerribly nice girl, her father was the Marquess of Inverlocky.\" Paul was not interested in her pedigree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did she learn French?\" \"Brought up by her French stepmother, Lord Inverlocky\u0027s second wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s ever so keen to do her bit.\" Paul was suspicious of Fortescue, but he was desperate for suitable recruits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do I find her?\" \"She\u0027s with the RAF at Hendon.\" The word \"Hen-don\" meant nothing to Paul, but Fortescue explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an airfield in the north London suburbs.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Let me know how she gets on.\" Fortescue hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul explained the call to Percy, who said, \"Fortescue wants a spy in our camp.\" \"We can\u0027t afford to turn her down for that reason.\" \"Quite.\" They saw Maude Valentine first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy arranged for them to meet her at the Fenchurch Hotel, around the corner from SOE headquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangers were never brought to number sixty-four, he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we reject her, she may guess that she\u0027s been considered for secret work, but she won\u0027t know the name of the organization that interviewed her nor where its office is, so even if she blabs she can\u0027t do much harm.\" \"Very good.\" \"What\u0027s your mother\u0027s maiden name?\" Paul was mildly startled and had to think for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thomas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was Edith Thomas.\" \"So, you\u0027ll be Major Thomas and I\u0027ll be Colonel Cox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo point in giving our real names.\" Percy was not such a duffer, Paul reflected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met Maude in the hotel lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe piqued his interest right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a pretty girl with a flirtatious manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer uniform blouse was tight across the chest, and she wore her cap at a jaunty angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul spoke to her in French.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My colleague is waiting in a private room.\" She gave him an arch look and replied in the same language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t usually go to hotel rooms with strange men,\" she said pertly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But in your case, Major, I\u0027ll make an exception.\" He blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a meeting room, with a table and so on, not a bedroom.\" \"Oh, well, that\u0027s all right, then,\" she said, mocking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had noticed that she spoke with a south of France accent, so he said, \"Where are you from?\" \"I was born in Marseilles.\" \"And what do you do in the FANYs?\" \"I drive Monty.\" \"Do you?\" Paul was not supposed to give any information about himself, but he could not help saying, \"I worked for Monty for a while, but I don\u0027t recall seeing you.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s not always Monty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive all the top generals.\" \"Ah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, come this way, please.\" He took her to the room and poured her a cup of tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaude was enjoying the attention, Paul realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Percy asked questions, he studied the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was petite, though not as tiny as Flick, and she was cute: she had a rosebud mouth accentuated with red lipstick, and there was a beauty spot-which might even have been fake-on one cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dark hair was wavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My family came to London when I was ten years old,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My papa is a chef.\" \"And where does he work?\" \"He\u0027s the head pastry cook at Claridge\u0027s Hotel.\" \"Very impressive.\" Maude\u0027s file was on the table, and Percy discreetly moved it an inch closer to Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul\u0027s eye was caught by the slight movement, and his eye fell on a note made when Maude was first interviewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather: Armand Valentin, 39, kitchen porter at Claridge\u0027s, he read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they had finished, they asked her to wait outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She lives in a fantasy world,\" Percy said as soon as she was outside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s promoted her father to chef, and changed her name to Valentine.\" Paul nodded agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the lobby, she told me she was Monty\u0027s driver-which I know she\u0027s not.\" \"No doubt that was why she was rejected before.\" Paul thought Percy was getting ready to reject Maude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now we can\u0027t afford to be so particular,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy looked at him in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d be a menace on an undercover operation!\" Paul made a helpless gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have any choice.\" \"This is mad!\" Percy was half in love with Flick, Paul decided, but, being older and married, he expressed his love in a paternal, protective way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul liked him better for that, but realized at the same time that he would have to fight Percy\u0027s caution if he was going to get this job done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shouldn\u0027t eliminate Maude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick can make up her own mind when she meets her.\" \"I suppose you\u0027re right,\" Percy said reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the ability to invent stories can be useful under interrogation.\" \"All right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s get her on board.\" Paul called her back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like you to be part of a team I\u0027m setting up,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you feel about taking on something dangerous?\" \"Would we be going to Paris?\" Maude said eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an odd response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul hesitated, then said, \"Why do you ask?\" \"I\u0027d love to go to Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey say it\u0027s the most beautiful city in the world.\" \"Wherever you go, you won\u0027t have time for sightseeing,\" Percy said, letting his irritation show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaude did not seem to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shame,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d still like to go, though.\" \"How do you feel about the danger?\" Paul persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right,\" Maude said airily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not scared.\" Well, you should be, Paul thought, but he kept his mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY DROVE NORTH from Baker Street and passed through a working-class neighborhood that had suffered heavily from the bombing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn every street at least one house was a blackened shell or a pile of rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul was to meet Flick outside the prison and they would interview Ruby Romain together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy would go on to Hendon to see Lady Denise Bowyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy, at the wheel, confidently wound his way through the grimy streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul said, \"You know London well.\" \"I was born in this neighborhood,\" Percy replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul was intrigued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew it was unusual for a boy from a poor family to rise as high as colonel in the British army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did your father do for a living?\" \"Sold coal off the back of a horse-drawn cart.\" \"He had his own business?\" \"No, he worked for a coal merchant.\" \"Did you go to school around here?\" Percy smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he was being probed, but he did not seem to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The local vicar helped me get a scholarship to a good school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was where I lost my London accent.\" \"Intentionally?\" \"Not willingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll tell you something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the war, when I was involved in politics, people would sometimes say to me, \u0027How can you be a socialist, with an accent like that?\u0027 I explained that I was flogged in school for dropping my aitches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat silenced one or two smug bastards.\" Percy stopped the car on a tree-lined street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked out and saw a fantasy castle, with battlements and turrets and a high tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a jail?\" Percy made a gesture of helplessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victorian architecture.\" Flick was waiting at the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore her FANY uniform: a four-pocket tunic, a divided skirt, and a little cap with a turned-up brim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leather belt that was tightly cinched around her small waist emphasized her diminutive figure, and her fair curls spilled out from under the cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment she took Paul\u0027s breath away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s such a pretty girl,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s married,\" Percy remarked crisply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m being warned off, Paul thought with amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To whom?\" Percy hesitated, then said, \"You need to know this, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel is in the French Resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s the leader of the Bollinger circuit.\" \"Ah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks.\" Paul got out of the car and Percy drove on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if Flick would be angry that he and Percy had turned up so few prospects from the files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had met her only twice, and on both occasions she had yelled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, she seemed cheerful, and when he told her about Maude, she said, \"So we have three team members, including me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat means we\u0027re halfway there, and it\u0027s only two pip emma.\" Paul nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was one way of looking at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was worried, but there was nothing to be gained by saying so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entrance to Holloway was a medieval lodge with arrow slit windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t they go the whole way and build a portcullis and a drawbridge?\" said Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed through the lodge into a courtyard, where a few women in dark dresses were cultivating vegetables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery patch of waste ground in London was planted with vegetables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prison loomed up in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entrance was guarded by stone monsters, massive winged griffins holding keys and shackles in their claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main gate-house was flanked by four-story buildings, each story represented by a long row of narrow, pointed windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a place!\" said Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is where the suffragettes went on hunger strike,\" Flick told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Percy\u0027s wife was force-fed in here.\" \"My God.\" They went in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air smelled of strong bleach, as if the authorities hoped that disinfectant would kill the bacteria of crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul and Flick were shown to the office of Miss Lindleigh, a barrel-shaped assistant governor with a hard, fat face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why you wish to see Romain,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027With a note of resentment she added, \"Apparently I\u0027m not to be told.\" A scornful look came over Flick\u0027s face, and Paul could see that she was about to say something derisory, so he hastily intervened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize for the secrecy,\" he said with his most charming smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re just following orders.\" \"I suppose we all have to do that,\" said Miss Lindleigh, somewhat mollified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, I must warn you that Romain is a violent prisoner.\" \"I understand she\u0027s a killer.\" \"Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should be hanged, but the courts are too soft nowadays.\" \"They sure are,\" said Paul, although he did not really think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was in here originally for drunkenness; then she killed another prisoner in a fight in the exercise yard, so now she\u0027s awaiting trial for murder.\" \"A tough customer,\" Flick said with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Major.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe may seem reasonable at first, but don\u0027t be fooled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s easily riled and loses her temper faster than you can say knife.\" \"And deadly when she does,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got the picture.\" \"We\u0027re short of time,\" Flick said impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to see her now.\" Paul added hastily, \"If that\u0027s convenient to you, Miss Lindleigh.\" \"Very well.\" The assistant governor led them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hard floors and bare walls made the place echo like a cathedral, and there was a constant background accompaniment of distant shouts, slamming doors, and the clang of boots on iron catwalks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went via narrow corridors and steep stairs to an interview room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby Romain was already there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had nut-brown skin, straight dark hair, and fierce black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, she was not the traditional gypsy beauty: her nose was hooked and her chin curved up, giving her the look of a gnome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Lindleigh left them with a warder in the next room watching through a glazed door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick, Paul, and the prisoner sat around a cheap table with a dirty ashtray on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul had brought a pack of Lucky Strikes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put them on the table and said in French, \"Help your-sell\" Ruby took two, putting one in her mouth and the other behind her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul asked a few routine questions to break the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe replied clearly and politely but with a strong accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents are traveling folk,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was a girl, we went around France with a funfair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father had a rifle range and my mother sold hot pancakes with chocolate sauce.\" \"How did you come to England?\" \"When I was fourteen, I fell in love with an English sailor I met in Calais.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name was Freddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got married-I lied about my age, of course-and came to London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was killed two years ago, his ship was sunk by a U-boat in the Atlantic.\" She shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A cold grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Freddy.\" Flick was not interested in the family history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us why you\u0027re in here,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got myself a little brazier and sold pancakes in the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the police kept harassing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, I\u0027d had some cognac-a weakness of mine, I admit-and anyway, I got into a dispute.\" She switched to cockney-accented English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The copper told me to fuck off out of it, and I gave him a mouthful of abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved me and I knocked him down.\" Paul looked at her with a touch of amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was no more than average height, and wiry, but she had big hands and muscular legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could imagine her flattening a London policeman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick asked, \"What happened next?\" \"His two mates came around the corner, and I was a bit slow to leave, on account of the brandy, so they gave me a kicking and took me down the nick.\" Seeing Paul\u0027s frown of incomprehension, she added: \"The police station, that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the first copper was ashamed to do me for assault, didn\u0027t want to admit he\u0027d been floored by a girl, so I got fourteen days for drunk and disorderly.\" \"And then you got into another fight.\" She gave Flick an appraising look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if I can explain to someone of your sort what it\u0027s like in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf the girls are mad, and they\u0027ve all got weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can file the edge of a spoon to make a blade, or sharpen the end of a bit of wire for a stiletto, or twist threads together for a garotte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the warders never intervene in a fight between convicts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey like to watch us tear each other apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s why so many of the inmates have scars.\" Paul was shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never had contact with people in jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture painted by Ruby was horrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps she was exaggerating, but she seemed quietly sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not appear to care whether she was believed or not but recited the facts in the dry, unhurried manner of someone who is not greatly interested but has nothing better to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick said, \"What happened with the woman you killed?\" \"She stole something of mine.\" \"What?\" \"A cake of soap.\" My God, thought Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe killed her for a piece of soap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick said, \"What did you do?\" \"I took it back.\" \"And then?\" \"She went for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a chair leg that she\u0027d made into a club with a bit of plumber\u0027s lead fixed to the business end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hit me over the head with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought she was going to kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I had a knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d found a long, pointed sliver of glass, like a shard from a broken window pane, and I wrapped the broad end in a length of worn-out bicycle tire for a handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuck it in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she didn\u0027t get to hit me a second time.\" Flick suppressed a shudder and said, \"It sounds like self-defense.\" \"No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve got to prove you couldn\u0027t possibly have run away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027d premeditated the murder by making a knife out of a piece of glass.\" Paul stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait here with the guard for a moment, please,\" he said to Ruby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll just step outside.\" Ruby smiled at him, and for the first time she looked not quite pretty but pleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so polite,\" she said appreciatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the corridor, Paul said, \"What a dreadful story!\" \"Remember, everyone in here says they\u0027re innocent,\" Flick said guardedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the same, I think she might be more sinned against than sinning.\" \"1 doubt it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think she\u0027s a killer.\" \"So we reject her.\" \"On the contrary,\" said Flick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s exactly what I want.\" They went back into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick said to Ruby, \"If you could get out of here, would you be willing to do dangerous war work?\" She responded with another question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would we be going to France?\" Flick raised her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What leads you to ask that?\" \"You spoke French to me at the start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assume you were checking if I speak the language.\" \"Well, I can\u0027t tell you much about the job.\" \"I bet it involves sabotage behind enemy lines.\" Paul was startled: Ruby was very quick on the uptake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing his surprise, Ruby went on, \"Look, at first I thought you might want me to do a bit of translation for you, but there\u0027s nothing dangerous about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we must be going to France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what would the British Army do there except blow up bridges and railway lines?\" Paul said nothing, but he was impressed by her powers of deduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I can\u0027t figure out is why it\u0027s an all-woman team.\" Flick\u0027s eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think that?\" \"If you could use men, why would you be talking to me? You must be desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can\u0027t be that easy to get a murderess out of jail, even for vital war work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what\u0027s special about me? I\u0027m tough, but there must be hundreds of tough men who speak perfect French and would be gung-ho for a bit of cloak-and-dagger stuff The only reason for picking me rather than one of them is that I\u0027m female.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps women are less likely to be questioned by the Gestapo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eis that it?\" \"I can\u0027t say,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you want me, I\u0027ll do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan I have another one of those cigarettes?\" \"Sure,\" said Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick said, \"You do understand that the job is dangerous.\" \"Yeah,\" said Ruby, lighting a Lucky Strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not as dangerous as being in this fucking prison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT H E Y R E T U R N E D TO the assistant governor\u0027s office after leaving Ruby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need your help, Miss Lindleigh,\" Paul said, once again flattering her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what you would need in order to be able to release Ruby Romain.\" \"Release her! But she\u0027s a murderer!

lucky escape-quite the contrary.\" \"I see,\" she said, not entirely mollified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must have her out of here tonight,\" Paul went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t want to put you in any kind of awkward position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s why I need to know exactly what authorization you require.\" What he really wanted was to make sure she would have no excuse to be obstructive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t release her under any circumstances,\" said Miss Lindleigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has been remanded here by a magistrate\u0027s court, so only the court can free her.\" Paul was patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you think that would require?\" \"She would have to be taken, in police custody, before a magistrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe public prosecutor, or his representative, would have to tell the magistrate that all charges against Romain had been dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the magistrate would be obliged to say she was free to go.\" Paul frowned, looking ahead for snags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would have to sign her army joining-up papers before seeing the magistrate, so that she would be under military discipline as soon as the court released her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eotherwise she might just walk away.\" Miss Lindleigh was still incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would they drop the charges?\" \"This prosecutor is a government official?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then it won\u0027t be a problem.\" Paul stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be back here later this evening, with a magistrate, someone from the prosecutor\u0027s department, and an army driver to take Ruby

just as you do.\" \"Good.\" They took their leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they got outside, Paul stopped and looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been to a prison

station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick was thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very perceptive,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understood how to keep Miss

pussycat.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t want a woman like that to dislike me.\" Flick laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you told me something that I hadn\u0027t figured out about myself.\" Paul was pleased that he had impressed her, but he was already looking ahead to the next problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By midnight, we should have half a team at the training center in Hampshire.\" \"We call it the Finishing School,\" flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes: Diana Colefield, Maude Valentine, and Ruby Romain.\" Paul nodded grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An undisciplined aristocrat, a pretty flirt who can\u0027t tell fantasy from reality, and a murdering gypsy with a short temper.\" When he thought of the possibility that Flick could be hanged by the

had vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we still don\u0027t have an explosives expert or a telephone engineer.\" Flick glanced at her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still only four pip emma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe the RAF has taught Denise Bowyer how to blow up a telephone exchange.\" Paul grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflick\u0027s optimism was irresistible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the station and caught a train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could not talk about the mission because there were other passengers within earshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul said, \"I learned a little about Percy this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove through the neighborhood where he was brought up.\" \"He\u0027s
