Excitement made her heart race, or perhaps it was apprehension. Society on the lush Caribbean island—such as it was—had fewer preconceived notions about her, and the pace and structure of social interactions were more relaxed. She looked forward to enjoying moments of solitude after the past few months of well-intentioned suffocation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess watched as in quick succession her footmen carried her trunks up the gangplank to the main deck. The bright blue of Pennington livery was conspicuous among the less colorful attire of the seamen around them. Soon enough, there was no reason for her to delay in the carriage any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe alighted with the help of a footman, smoothed her pale lavender silk skirts, and then set off without looking back. As she gained the deck, she felt the rolling of the ship beneath her feet and took a moment to absorb the sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady Tarley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess turned her head and watched a portly, distinguished gentleman approach. Even before he spoke, his attire and bearing told her he was the captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain Smith,” he introduced himself, accepting the hand she offered him with a bow “A pleasure to ’ave you aboard, milady.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The pleasure is mine,” she demurred, returning the smile he offered from the depths of a coarse white beard. “You command an impressive ship, Captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, that she is.” He tipped up his hat to get a better look at her. “I would be ’onored to ’ave you join me for the evenin’ meals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would enjoy that very much, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent.” Smith gestured at a young seaman. “Miller ’ere will show you to yer cabin. If you ’ave any questions or concerns, ’e can see to them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m very much obliged.” As the captain went about the business of preparing to set sail, Jess turned to Miller, who she guessed was no more than ten and seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Milady.” He gestured ahead to an open companionway and stairs leading below deck. “This way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe followed him across the midship, fascinated by the courage of the men climbing the rigging like industrious little crabs. But as she descended the stairs, her admiration was redirected to the vessel’s impressive interior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paneled companion- and passageway gleamed with polish, as did the brass hardware that secured the doors and hung the flashlamps. She’d been uncertain of what to expect, but this attention to detail was a surprise and a delight. Miller paused before a door and knocked, which elicited a shouted permission to enter from Jess’s abigail, Beth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cabin Jess entered was small but well appointed; it held a narrow bed, a modestly sized rectangular window, and a wooden table with two chairs. On the sole by one of her trunks sat a crate of her favorite claret. Although it was the smallest space she’d ever occupied as a bedchamber, she found the limits of the cabin comforting. And she was deeply appreciative that, for the next few weeks at least, she would not have to anticipate how to respond to others in a manner that made them feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching up, she withdrew the pin securing her hat and handed both to Beth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller promised to return at six to take her to supper, then ducked back out to the passageway. After the door shut, Jess’s gaze met Beth’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe abigail bit her lower lip and spun in a quick circle. “This is a grand adventure, milady. I’ve missed Jamaica since we left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess exhaled to ease the knot in her stomach, then smiled. “And a certain young man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” the maid agreed. “ ’Im, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth had been a blessing the past few days, keeping Jess’s spirits high while everyone around her had been so disapproving of her plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An adventure,” Jess repeated. “I think it will be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the knock came at Jess’s cabin door shortly before six, she set aside the book she’d been reading and stood with some reluctance. Beth was mending a stocking on the opposite side of the small table, and the quiet companionship had been most welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting her work down, Beth went to answer the door. As the panel swung open, Miller’s young face was revealed. He smiled shyly, showing slightly crooked teeth. Jess dismissed Beth to enjoy her own meal, then followed the young crewman to the captain’s great cabin. As they neared the wide door marking the end of the passageway, the plaintive notes of a violin grew in volume. The instrument was consummately played, the tune sweet yet haunting. Enamored with the music, she quickened her step. Miller knocked once, then opened the door without waiting for a reply. He gestured her into the sizable cabin with a gallant sweep of his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe entered with a practiced smile, her gaze locating Captain Smith as he pushed to his feet at a long dining table, along with two other gentlemen who were introduced to her as the Chief Mate and ship’s surgeon. She exchanged the expected pleasantries, then turned her attention to the violin player. He stood with his back to her before the large gallery windows wrapping the stern. He was sans tailcoat, which caused her to glance hastily away. But when the captain approached to escort her to the table, she risked another furtive glance at the scandalously semi-dressed gentleman. Without tails to block her gaze, she was afforded a prime view of the man’s derriere, which was quite noteworthy. It was not a part of the male anatomy she’d had cause to study before. She found she quite enjoyed the ogling when the buttocks on display were so firm and well-shaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she conversed with the ship’s officers, Jess glanced frequently at the dark-haired musician who coaxed such beautiful notes from the violin. The fluid, practiced movement of his arm caused his back and shoulders to flex in a manner that had always fascinated her. The male body was so much larger and more powerful than a woman’s—capable of fierce aggression while also being sleek and graceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tune ended. The player pivoted to return the violin and bow to their case waiting on the chair beside him. Jess caught a quick glimpse of his profile. A frisson of awareness swept over her skin. He collected his jacket from the chair where it was draped, then shrugged into it. She hadn’t thought it possible that the act of putting clothes on could be as arousing as watching them come off, but this man made it so. The graceful economy of his movements was inherently sensual, which suited his air of unwavering confidence and command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And this,” the captain said, turning slightly to gesture at the gentleman, “is Mr. Alistair Caulfield, owner of this fine vessel and brilliant violinist, as you ’eard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess swore her heart ceased beating for a moment. Certainly, she stopped breathing. Caulfield faced her and sketched a perfectly executed, elegant bow. Yet his head never lowered and his gaze never left hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat were the odds that they would cross paths this way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was very little of the young man Jess had once known left in the man who faced her. Alistair Caulfield was no longer pretty. The planes of his face had sharpened, etching his features into a thoroughly masculine countenance. Darkly winged brows and thick lashes framed those infamous eyes of rich, deep blue. In the fading light of the setting sun and the flickering flames of the turpentine lamps, his coal-black hair gleamed with health and vitality. Previously his beauty had been striking, but now he was larger. More worldly and mature. Undeniably formidable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathtakingly male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady Tarley,” he greeted her, straightening. “It is a great pleasure to see you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was lower and deeper in pitch than she remembered. It had a soft, rumbling quality. Almost a purr. He walked with equal feline grace, his step light and surefooted despite his powerful build. His gaze was focused and intense, assessing. Challenging. As before, it seemed he looked right into the very heart of her and dared her to deny that he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sucked in a shaky breath and met him halfway, offering her hand. “Mr. Caulfield. It has been some time since we last met.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis look was so intimate she couldn’t help thinking of that night in the Pennington woods. A rush of heat swept up her arm from where their skin connected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on. “Please accept my condolences on your recent loss. Tarley was a good man. I admired him and liked him quite well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your thoughts are appreciated,” she managed in spite of a suddenly dry mouth. “I offer the same to you. I was deeply sorry to hear that your brother had passed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw tightened and he released her, sliding his hand away so that his fingertips stroked over the center of her palm. “Two of them,” he replied grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess caught her hand back and rubbed it discreetly against her thigh, to no avail. The tingle left by his touch was inerasable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shall we?” the captain said, tilting his head toward the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaulfield took a seat on the bench directly across from her. She was discomfited at first, but he seemed to forget her the moment the food was brought in. To ensure a steady flow of conversation, she took pains to direct the discussion to topics addressing the ship and seafaring, and the men easily followed. No doubt they were relieved not to have to focus on her life of limited scope, which was of little interest to men. What followed was a rather fantastic hour of food and conversation the likes of which she’d never been exposed to before. Gentlemen did not often discuss matters of business around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt quickly became clear that Alistair Caulfield was enjoying laudable financial success. He didn’t comment on it personally, but he participated in the discussion about the trade, making it clear he was very involved in the minutiae of his business endeavors. He was also expertly dressed. His coat was made with a gray-green velvet she thought quite lovely, and the stylishly short cut of the shoulders emphasized how fit he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you make the trip to Jamaica often, Captain?” Jess asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not as often as some of Mr. Caulfield’s other ships do.” He set his elbows on the table and toyed with his beard. “London is where we berth most often. The others dock in Liverpool or Bristol.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many ships are there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain looked at Caulfield. “ ’Ow many are there now? Five?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six,” Caulfield said, looking directly at Jess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his gaze with difficulty. She couldn’t explain why she felt as she did, but it was almost as if the intimacies she had witnessed that night in the woods had been between Caulfield and herself, not another woman. Something profound had transpired in the moment they’d first become aware of each other in the darkness. A connecting thread had been sewn between them, and she had no notion how to sever it. She knew things about the man she should not know, and there was no way for her to return to blissful ignorance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulations on your success,” she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can say the same to you.” He set one forearm on the table. The cuff of his coat was of fashionable length, covering his hand near to the knuckle. Still, the sight of his fingers reminded her of another time … a night when those hands had clung to a gazebo post to leverage the thrust of his hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drummed his fingertips onto the tablecloth-covered wood, breaking her reverie. “Oh?” she managed, after a fortifying swallow of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My ships also provide transport for Calypso goods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess was not surprised to learn that. “I should like to discuss that arrangement with you further, Mr. Caulfield.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows arched, and the other men grew quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you have time,” she qualified. “There is no urgency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have time now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recognized the hawklike precision of his gaze and understood she’d engaged his mind for business. A moment of disquiet affected her, but she prayed she hid it. By necessity, she’d come to recognize the type of men it was best not to cross, and Alistair Caulfield was certainly one of them. He flashed a bright, charming smile with ease, but it did not reach his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I appreciate your willingness to accommodate me,” she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess watched as he stood. Rounding the table quickly but without haste, he assisted her with extracting herself from the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the head of the table. “Thank you very much for a charming evening, Captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I ’ope you’ll join us every night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she deported herself without noticeable fault, she was achingly aware of Caulfield standing very close beside her. When they left the great cabin together, that awareness increased tenfold. The door shut behind them, and she felt the click of the brass latch vibrate across overly taut nerves. Tarley had gone to great lengths to make her feel secure and without stress, while Caulfield so easily skewed her prized equanimity. He had an indefinable quality that heightened her cognizance of everything that made her feminine and, therefore, vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shall we take a stroll on the deck?” he asked in a subdued tone that swirled in the enclosed space around her. He stood almost too near, his head bent to accommodate the moderate height of the deckhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent clinging to him was delicious, filling her nostrils with sandalwood, musk, and the barest hint of verbena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will need to fetch a shawl.” Her voice was huskier than she would have liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe escorted her to her cabin in silence, which allowed other sounds to dominate—the surefooted confidence of his steps, the accelerated rate of her breathing, the steady whoosh of the water against the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe entered her room in a breathless rush and shut the door with indecorous haste. Sucking in a gasping breath, she drew Beth’s widened eyes to her. The abigail dropped her darning on the table and stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord, but yer flushed,” Beth said in the calm, authoritative voice that made everything—including a journey to Jamaica—seem both possible and well in hand. She moved to the pitcher and basin by the bed to fetch a damp cloth. “Yer not falling ill, are you?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seven-years-to-sin-historical-1/page-4.html","bookId":2663,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:56 AM"}
