It was hours before morning, hours before I would be exhausted enough to sleep...but not so exhausted that I had to sleep. The medallion had removed the effects of sunlight, but not my natural - or unnatural - sleep patterns. My body still craved sleep during the day, happily doing so until sunrise if I would let it. Two kids and a full-time job, unfortunately, wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flew five hundred feet above the crashing surf. The beaches were empty. Correction...mostly empty. There was a lone man jogging with a little squirt of a dog. A little red dog. Yes, my eyes are that good at night and in this form. The man looked vaguely familiar. Tall and muscular. As I flew overhead, the little dog stopped and barked. At me. The little shit. The man, stopped, too, and looked up, but I was already gone. I smiled to myself, now recognizing the cocky son-of-a-bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ocean rippled and sparkled, reflecting whatever ambient light was around. Fang would never be the same. Our relationship would never be the same. Hanner had plans for him, I was sure. But she could shove her plans up her pale ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d see about her plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas Fang\u0027s and mine a true friendship? Perhaps, perhaps not. I liked to believe it was. I liked to believe he cared for me beyond what I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had not yet made a decision about what to do about Fang\u0027s request. Truth be known, I was afraid of what would happen once I did. I was afraid for our relationship, for him, for the world. Of course, Detective Hanner had made the decision for me, thus forcing mine and Fang\u0027s relationship to make that leap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang was no puppet. Hanner was in for a surprise. Unless, somehow, the two of them had made a pact. Perhaps he had sold his soul, so to speak, to become that which he most wanted. Perhaps I had doomed him by delaying my own decision. Perhaps had I honored his request, he would not be bound to Hanner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas Hanner so bad? I didn\u0027t know. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut one thing was sure: I would be there for Fang, for whatever reason, at any time. He had been there for me...and I suspected he was going to need my help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr perhaps not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, he had Hanner now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a heavy heart, I turned to starboard, dipping one wing and raising the other, and headed over the million-dollar homes and back toward Fullerton.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-34.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
