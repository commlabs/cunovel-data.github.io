I wish that every year could be as wonderful as this, Rubio Arzano thought. It has been a good year in more ways than one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, his marriage, and then, a year ago, the birth of the twins. Whoever dreamed a man could be this happy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was starting to rain. Rubio turned the tractor around and headed for the barn. He thought about the twins. The boy was going to be big and strapping. But his sister! She was going to be a handful. She\u0027s going to give her man a lot of trouble, Rubio grinned to himself. She takes after her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove the tractor into the barn and headed for the house, feeling the cool rain against his face.

On her desk, shining with a dazzling brightness, lay the gold cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was accepted as a miracle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-45.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
