He tossed his crown aside, and plucked a basket out of the sack. He took a deep breath, held the basket behind his back and turned to face Cinderella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Duchess Cinderella Lacreux, I must confess I have fallen deeply in love with you. If you would marry me, I would be the happiest of men—but there are some things that must be stated. I am in the Army, and while you will always have my love, I cannot guarantee I will always return to you whole, or alive,” Friedrich said, briefly shutting his eye. “Also, I am the prince of a troubled country. If you marry me, I fear you will be called to show love, kindness, and compassion beyond what a normal human could extend. I am confident my country will learn to love you and cherish you as deeply as I do, but I am aware you have already made great sacrifices… and I do not want to force more on you,” Friedrich said, kneeling at Cinderella’s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to marry you not because you have the strength of will to save my desperate country, but because you have stolen my heart for some months now, and I want to spend every second I can in your presence. If you choose to marry me, I will treasure your love and loyalty more than the Crown jewels, and I will do my best to make you happy and to make you smile and laugh for the rest of your life. I am from Erlauf, not Trieux, and most of my worth is based on my military position rather than my royal title. It’s not what you deserve, but I ask that you would consider it, consider me. Cinderella, will you marry me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriedrich’s eye shone with love, and perhaps a little fear. He was a man nearly impossible to read. The display of trust twisted Cinderella’s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella smiled through the tears in her eyes. “Cristoph Friedrich, before I answer, there are some things that must be stated,” she said, smiling. “Yesterday I officially refused Julien’s suit because I realized I was in love with another man—you—and I didn’t want to marry anyone else. Also, your country ceased to bother me months ago as you have taught me to look past heritage and study a person’s heart. As for your profession, I would be proud to call a soldier—a calling of bravery and courage that I am ashamed to say I previously did not value—my husband. Finally, I will gladly make personal sacrifices if it means I can marry you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, your answer…?” Friedrich asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!” Cinderella laughed before throwing her arms around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriedrich released the deep breath he’d been holding. “I am so glad,” he said. “I didn’t even have to use my bribe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother and Johann cannot wait to meet you. I think you will get on with mother—I hope you hate Johann. He’s a brat,” Friedrich savagely said, running his fingers through Cinderella’s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And your Father?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You already met him. You must have impressed him considerably. He said if I bungled this, he was going to demote me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did I meet your Father?” Cinderella frowned, pulling back from the hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“During the ball. He was the third man to dance with you. The middle-aged military chap,” Friedrich said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella’s eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How rude of me. I almost forgot,” Friedrich said before presenting Cinderella with the basket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the basket sat a glass slipper, and nestled in the shoe’s toe, a sparkling ring. “I made the basket myself,” Friedrich added, removing the ring from the shoe before sliding it over Cinderella’s finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn closer inspection, Cinderella gulped. The ring was a large ruby with the Erlauf insignia etched into the surface. It seemed very likely that it was a Crown Jewel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Cinderella looked up, Friedrich wore the same smug, smarmy smile he occasionally wore when he first started visiting her stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have been planning this for a long time, haven’t you?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea,” Friedrich said with his roguish grin. “About half of the concerns your market friends had for you were quite valid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come now, you are more honorable than they said you were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only just so,” Friedrich said, sliding his hand down Cinderella’s ankle before he slipped the glass slipper on her foot. “But it doesn’t matter. I have found my queen. Although… it does raise an important question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have both admitted we love each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we’re engaged.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“May I finally kiss you?” Friedrich said in a tone of long suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella laughed so hard Friedrich finally stood up rather than remain crouching on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you done?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why are you still laughing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, yes!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cinderella-and-the-colonel-timeless-fairy-tales-3/page-77.html","bookId":1806,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM"}
