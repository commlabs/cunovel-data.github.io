I put it away a revolutionary document; I took it out a quiet and rather obvious statement of generally accepted views. In reading the story, one should bear in mind that it was written before any of the \"literature of exposure\" had appeared; that its writer drew nothing from Mr. Steffens\u0027 probing of political corruption, nor from Miss Tarbell\u0027s analysis of the railroad rebate, nor from Mr. Lawson\u0027s expos√© of the inner life of \"Frenzied Finance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n U.S.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88271.html","bookId":688,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 8:14:51 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 8:14:51 PM"}
