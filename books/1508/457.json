It was impossible for him to single-handedly defeat 100 to 200 Xiantian masters and half-step Xiantian masters, not to mention that there were also still the Demon Region’s Big Three powerhouses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is Xuan Chang afraid?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He’s actually begging for mercy publicly?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is the Blood Demon that fearful?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What is going on here?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eViolet Rain glanced at Fire Ax and whispered, “Xuan Chang probably knows who Wild Halberd is…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Xuan Chang had first exchanged blows with Lin Ming, his expression had completely changed and he had begun to sweat from his forehead, as if he had discovered something terrible. The most reasonable explanation for this was that Xuan Chang had recognized just who Wild Halberd was, and there was something about him that caused Xuan Chang to be afraid.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Perhaps…” Fire Ax mumbled as he ruefully smiled.

Nightmare was an extremely formidable character that would cause any one of them to panic just by hearing his name. But now he was slumped silly on the floor, and this was all because of Wild Halberd. Wild Halberd’s cultivation was only at the late Houtian realm – this was simply unimaginable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was silent.

Refining a zombie guard required a great deal of resources and efforts. In the eyes of most here, a Xiantian rank zombie guard was much more valuable than a peak Houtian realm martial artist.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHaving the South Sea Demon Region explore the path forwards with their zombie guards could be considered a massive hemorrhage on their part.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSome of the Wartime Alliance martial artists were happy yet perplexed. When a good man turned evil, it would be easy to despise him.

Although the Wartime Alliance martial artists may not know what these meant, Xuan Chang was a talented disciple of the South Sea Demon Region and had most likely obtained information like this. It wouldn’t be strange if he was recognized.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXuan Chang felt his heart go cold. Lin Ming’s identity was simply too sensitive, Xuan Chang didn’t want to bring any trouble onto himself. The Western Faction’s Great Elder Xuan Wuji had been obsessed about this matter. If he was found to be withholding any information pertaining to Lin Ming, then he would surely suffer serious and fatal consequences back at the sect. Not just that, but a month or two later, Lin Ming’s strength might even make another breakthrough. At that time, Lin Ming might even think that it was a good idea to silence all witnesses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThinking of this, Xuan Chang foolishly mumbled, “I have recognized you, Young Hero should be Blood Demon!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s eyes narrowed. He didn’t believe Xuan Chang’s words, but investigating this matter was useless, he remained silent for now…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e…………..\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDark Moon Island, above the South Sea –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe massive black swirling vortex slowly spun around. A vast amount of seawater was swallowed up by the vortex without a single sound.

They will be from the demonic path, righteous path, South Horizon Region, Five Element Region, or even beyond. When that time comes, there will inevitably be a fierce battle here. Perhaps even this old man will perish here. Xuan Yuqie, do you really expect us old men to go all out even in this situation when we’re kept in the dark!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Xuan Yuqie he referred to was the Sovereign of the Demon Region Western Faction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough Xuan Yuqie was nearly 1000 years old, after a martial artist underwent their second Life Destruction, they would be reborn and their body remade. Their life would lengthen, and their appearance would remain young. With some secret make-up techniques, her appearance was still like a beautiful woman around 30 years of age, ardent and aphrodisiac.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha.” Xuan Yuqie smiled, but she didn’t immediately respond. She glanced at the feminine-looking man beside her; this person was Lei Mubai’s master and great grandfather – Xuan Wuji.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the two quickly exchanged true essence sound transmissions, the masked Elder quietly waited.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA moment later, Xuan Yuqie smiled and said with alluring flattering, “Elder Zhou may not believe me, but we were really planning on informing everyone of the situation within once the ancient battlefield was opened.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs long as there were people, there would be infighting. Even within the South Sea Demon Region, there were still struggles over power and interests; this was simply an inevitable facet of human nature.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Silent Demon Emperor City was destroyed, the remnants of the defeated armies fled to the South Sea.

Who didn’t want their juniors to soar into the sky and for their Elders to safely pass through the death door of Life Destruction? This also caused the relationship between the various clans to be rocky.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ancient Devil Tome and Demon Emperor’s letter were first obtained by the direct descendants of the Netherworld Great Emperor.

When the Demon Emperor flew up, he naturally carried off some of these rare and valuable medicines. But there were some medicines that hadn’t ripened, and there was no meaning for him to take them. He left them here to be nourished by the special rules of the broken world and allow them to grow.

Most of the plants in the Demon Emperor’s medicine garden should have already wilted away.

To cross through Life Destruction was to step over the gates of hell, walking the tightrope over the endless abyss.
