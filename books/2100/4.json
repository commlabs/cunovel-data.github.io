{"id":90870,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003eJenny felt as if a black riptide was trying to suck her underwater. It was him. The boy from the game store. Every detail of his face was reproduced perfectly, but it wasn\u0027t a photograph. It was a drawing, like the snake and the wolf. The boy\u0027s hair was colored silvery-white with blue shadows. The artist had even captured his dark eyelashes. The portrait was so lifelike it looked as if those eyes might blink at any minute, as if the lips might speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it radiated menace. Danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" Audrey was saying. Her face swam in and out of focus as Jenny looked up. Jenny\u0027s eyes fixed on the beauty mark just above Audrey\u0027s upper lip. Audrey\u0027s lips were moving, but it was a minute before Jenny could make sense of the words. \"What\u0027s wrong, Jenny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could Jenny say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know this guy. I saw him at the store. He\u0027s a real\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eperson, not some made-up character in a game. So...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what? That\u0027s what they would ask her. What difference did it make? So the game must have been invented by somebody who knew the guy, and the guy had modeled for the picture. That would explain why the box was blank: Maybe it wasn\u0027t even a real, mass-produced game at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe the guy was crazy, had a fixation with this particular game, and had bleached his hair and dressed up to look like the game character. Dungeons and Dragons, Jenny thought suddenly-people were supposed to get heavily into that, sometimes even go overboard. That\u0027s the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, it was the answer somebody here tonight would give. Tom, maybe, because Jenny could tell he wanted to play, and once Tom made up his mind on anything, he was immovable. Dee, because danger always kicked her. Zach, because the game involved art; or Summer, because she thought it was \"cute.\" They all wanted to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good hostess didn\u0027t get hysterical and ruin a party because she had shadows on the brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny forced a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" she said, letting go of Audrey\u0027s wrist. \"Sorry. I thought I recognized that picture. Silly, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You been drinking the cough syrup again?\" Michael inquired from the other side of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right, Thorny? Really?\" Tom asked seriously. His green-flecked eyes searched hers, and Jenny felt her smile become more stable. She nodded. \"Fine,\" she said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom got up and dimmed the track lighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" said Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need it dark,\" Dee told them, \"for this next part. The reading of the oath.\" She cut a glance at them, the whites of her eyes shining like smoky pearls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What oath?\" Michael said warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Oath of the Game,\" Tom said. His voice was sinister. \"It says here that we each have to swear that we\u0027re playing this game of our own free will, and that the game is real.\" Tom turned the lid of the box around for them to see. On the inside cover, above the printed instructions, was a large symbol. It was like a squared-off and inverted U, the two uneven horns of the letter pointing downward. It was deeply impressed in the cover and colored-as well as Jenny could tell in the dim light-rusty red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not ruin this party, I will not ruin this party, Jenny thought. I will not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom was reading from the instructions: \" \u0027There is a Shadow World, like our own but different, existing alongside ours but never touching. Some people call it the world of dreams, but it is as real as anything else\u0027... and then it says that entering the Shadow World can be dangerous, so you play at your own risk.\" He grinned around the group. \"Actually, it says that the game can be hazardous to your life. You have to swear you understand that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if I like this anymore,\" Summer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" said Dee. \"Live dangerously. Make it happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" Summer was taking this seriously. She pushed soft light curls off her forehead and frowned. \"Is it getting warm in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, swear, already,\" said Michael. \"Let\u0027s get this thing over with. I swear I understand that this game may kill me before I\u0027m old enough to get a McJob like my brother Dave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you.\" Dee stretched out a black-spandex-covered leg to nudge Zachary. \"Swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear,\" Zach said in bored tones, his thin face unreadable, his gray eyes cool as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer sighed, capitulating. \"Me, too, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey adjusted her houndstooth jacket. \"Me, three,\" she said. \"And what about you, Deirdre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just about to, Aud. I swear to have a great time and kick the Shadow Dude\u0027s ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom had gotten up and was lurking over Jenny. \"How about it, devil woman? I swear-do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally Jenny would have jabbed an elbow upward into his ribs. At the moment all she could manage was a colorless smile. They all wanted to do it. She was the hostess. They were her guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom wanted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear,\" she said and was embarrassed when her voice cracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom cheered and tossed the box lid in the air. Dee\u0027s foot flashed out, kicking it back toward him. It fell on the floor by Jenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou jerk, if you really cared about me, you\u0027d care about how I felt, Jenny thought in a rare moment of anger toward Tom. Then she squelched the thought. It was his birthday. He deserved to be indulged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about the box lid caught her eye. For just an instant the upside-down it looked as if it were printed in red foil. It had-flashed-Jenny thought. But of course it couldn\u0027t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was kneeling around the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" said Dee. \"All the little dollies in the parlor? Then somebody\u0027s got to turn a card. Who wants to be first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny, feeling that if she was going to do this she might as well do it thoroughly, reached out and took the top card. It was glossy white like the game box and felt slick between her fingers. She turned it over and read: \" \u0027You have gathered with your friends in this room to begin the Game.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. Then Summer giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of an anticlimax,\" Audrey murmured. \"Who\u0027s next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me,\" said Tom. He leaned over Jenny and took a card. He read, \" \u0027Each of you has a secret you would rather die than reveal.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny stirred uneasily. It was just coincidence, because these were pre-printed cards. But it did sound almost as if someone were answering the question she\u0027d thought of earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My turn,\" Summer said eagerly. She read, \" \u0027You hear the sound of footsteps from one of the rooms above.\u0027\" She frowned. \"But there aren\u0027t any rooms above. This is a one-story house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom chuckled. \"You\u0027re forgetting yourself. We\u0027re not in this house. We\u0027re in that house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer blinked, her large blue eyes traveling over the pastel, basket-adorned walls of the Thornton living room. Then she looked at the Victorian paper house, with the seven paper dolls neatly arranged in the parlor like a group of guests too polite to go home. \"Oh!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was just putting the card back when they all heard the noise from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick light patter, like a child running on a wooden floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer shrieked and looked in terror at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee jumped up, her dark eyes blazing. Audrey stiffened. Michael grabbed at her, and she smacked his hand away. Zach\u0027s face was turned up; even his ponytail seemed to be tense. But Tom burst into laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s squirrels,\" he got out finally. \"They run on the roof all the time, don\u0027t they, Jenny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s stomach was knotted. Her voice wavered slightly as she said, \"Yes, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But nothing. Somebody else take a card,\" Tom said. Nobody did. \"All right, I\u0027ll do it myself. This is for you, Mike.\" He flipped a card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027You go to the door to get some air, but it seems to be stuck,\u0027\" he read. He looked around at the group. \"Oh, come on. It\u0027s a game. Here, look.\" He stood up in a fluid motion and went to the sliding glass door that looked out on Jenny\u0027s backyard. Jenny saw his fingers moving, flipping the locks on the handle. A sense of dread overwhelmed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom, don\u0027t!\" she said. Before she knew what she was doing, she jumped up and took his arm. If he didn\u0027t try the door-if he didn\u0027t try it-the card couldn\u0027t come true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom was jerking at the handle, ignoring her. \"There\u0027s something wrong with it-there must be another lock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s stuck,\" Michael said. He ran a hand through his rumpled dark hair, an oddly helpless gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" Audrey snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s sloe eyes were glittering. Her hand darted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout and she took a card. \" \u0027None of the doors or windows in this house will open,\u0027\" she read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom went on yanking furiously at the door. It wouldn\u0027t budge. Jenny caught his arm again. She was trembling all over with a sense of danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take another card,\" Zach said softly. There was something strange about his thin face-it was almost trancelike. Zombied out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZachary was taking the card himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wo,\" said Jenny again. She had to stop this, but she couldn\u0027t let go of Tom. \"Zach, don\u0027t read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027You hear a clock strike nine,\u0027\" Zachary read softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny doesn\u0027t have any clocks that strike,\" Audrey said. She looked at Jenny sharply. \"Do you? Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny shook her head, her throat clogged. Every inch of her skin seemed to be raw, waiting. Listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClear and sweet, the chimes rang out. The chimes of the clock at the game store, the clock she couldn\u0027t see. It seemed to be coming from far above. It began to strike the hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne. Two. Three. Four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" Audrey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive. Six. Seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt nine, Jenny thought. See you later-at nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom,\" Jenny whispered. The muscles in his arm were hard under her hand. Now, too late, he turned toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the wind came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first Jenny thought the riptide had gotten her. Then she thought it must be an earthquake. But all the time she had the sensation of air rushing by her, as if a hurricane had come in through the closed sliding glass door. A black, roaring hurricane that burned even as it froze. It hurt her like a physical thing, shaking her body and blinding her. She lost track of the room. The only thing real was the fistful of Tom\u0027s shirt she held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she lost track of that, too. The pain stopped for a while, and she just drifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke up on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like the only other time she\u0027d ever fainted, when she and Joey had both been home sick with the flu. She\u0027d jumped out of bed suddenly to tell him to turn down that stupid cartoon-and the next thing she knew she was waking up with her head in a wastebasket. Lying on the carpeted floor of her room, then, she had known that time had passed, without being sure how she knew it. This was the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainfully Jenny lifted her head and blinked to bring the far wall into focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t work. Something was wrong. The wall itself, which should have been pastel-colored and hung with weavings and baskets, was wrong. It was paneled with some dark wood, and an Oriental screen stood in front of it. Heavy velvet curtains obscured a window. A brass candlestick was attached to the wall. Jenny had never seen any of the things before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere am I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oldest question in the book, the biggest cliche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she really didn\u0027t know. She didn\u0027t know where she was or how she had gotten there, but she knew that whatever was going on was all wrong. Was-beyond her experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings like this didn\u0027t happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had happened anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two ideas jostled in her mind. She was already disoriented, on the verge of panic. Now she began to shake, and she felt a swelling in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Start screaming now and you\u0027ll never stop, she told herself. Don\u0027t think about it. You don\u0027t have to deal with it. Just find Tom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom. For the first time Jenny looked at the floor. They were all lying there, Zach with his blond ponytail streaming out behind him (on a moss-green carpet worked with cabbage roses, but don\u0027t think about that, don\u0027t think about that now), Summer with her light curls cradled protectively in her small arms, Audrey with her French twist coming loose. Dee\u0027s long legs were sprawled near the window, and Michael\u0027s stocky body was curled in a ball beside her. Tom was lying against the wall-where the sliding glass door should have been. As Jenny got up unsteadily and began moving toward him, he stirred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom? Are you okay?\" She took his hand, and when his warm, strong fingers closed around hers, she felt better. He groaned and opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell of a headache,\" he muttered. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Jenny said in a small, precise voice. She was still close to having hysterics. She hung on to his hand hard enough to bruise. \"We\u0027re not in the living room anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just the truth, and she had to say it. She needed to share it with someone, the way Summer had needed to share about her dog being put to sleep. But Tom scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" he said, and Jenny felt the little needle stab she always did when he snapped at her. \"We can\u0027t be anywhere else. Everything\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll his good humor had vanished, along with the rakish charm of his smile. His neat brown hair was just slightly mussed, and his green-flecked eyes looked both dazed and angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s defensive, Jenny realized. Scared that it\u0027s his fault. She tried to squeeze his hand, but he was getting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo were the others. Dee was rubbing the back of her neck, looking around with quick, alert movements. She reached down and pulled a groaning Michael to his feet. Audrey was standing, too, her hands automatically going to fix the combs in her auburn hair even as she stared at the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer was cowering by the spindly-legged table that had taken the place of Jenny\u0027s mother\u0027s coffee table. Only Zach didn\u0027t seem frightened. He was standing and his clear gray eyes were open, but his lips moved soundlessly and he looked-entranced. As if he were moving in a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody said a word. They all looked around stupidly, trying to make sense of their surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were standing in a Victorian parlor, lushly carpeted, furnished with Gothic Revival tables and chairs. A green lamp with a silk fringe hung from the ceiling. It looked like the perfect place for a seance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny recognized it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d seen the pattern of the cabbage-rose carpet printed on tagboard. Zach had cut out the paneling with an X-Acto knife, and Audrey had put together that mahogany table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in the paper house. It had come alive around them. They were inside it....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s hands came slowly up to cover her mouth. Her heart had begun a deep, sick pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God,\" Summer whispered. Then, with gathering force, \"Oh, my God, oh, my God-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael began to giggle hysterically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" Audrey said, breathing hard. \"Both of you, shut up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee went to the wall and touched a candlestick, fingers dark against the bright brass. Then she reached up and stuck her fingers in the candle flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dee!\" Tom rapped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s real,\" Dee said, looking at her fingertips. \"It burns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s not real!\" Audrey said. \"This is all-some kind of illusion. Like virtual reality-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s eyes flashed. \"It is not virtual reality. My mom\u0027s a computer expert-she knows what real VR is. Not the Pac-Man kind you get with video games. Even they can\u0027t do anything like this. Besides, where\u0027s the computer? Where\u0027s our helmets?\" She smacked a flattened hand against the wall. \"No, this is real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael was feeling a chair, still half giggling. \"So maybe it was some of Audrey\u0027s mushrooms. What were they called? Shiitake? Maybe it\u0027s a judgment on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy, Mike,\" Tom said. He looked angry,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhich Jenny knew meant he was feeling uncertain. She watched him, all the while stroking the smooth mahogany of a tabletop. She felt the same compulsion that Dee and Michael obviously did-to touch things here. She kept expecting them to feel like cardboard, but they were real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Tom said, \"we\u0027re not in the living room. We\u0027ve been-moved somehow. Somebody\u0027s playing a joke on us. But we don\u0027t have to just stand around like idiots and take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you suggest we do?\" Audrey said acidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom strode over to the parlor doorway, which opened on a dim hall. \"The guys can come with me and scout around; you girls stay here and keep your eyes open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee threw him a scornful look, then turned narrowed eyes on \"the guys.\" Michael was tapping on the walls, muttering, and Zach was just staring, the skin of his face drawn tight over bones. Jenny wanted to go to him, but she couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck,\" Dee said to Tom. \"Hurry back to protect us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t anybody leave,\" Summer said, her blue eyes wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You protect Jenny,\" Tom snarled at Dee, thrusting his face close to hers. Jenny felt an instant of throbbing warmth, which was immediately swept away by coldness. How could anyone protect anyone here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee crossed the room and put an arm, hard as a boy\u0027s, around Jenny\u0027s shoulders. \"Right,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we should stay together,\" Michael said nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, what\u0027s the difference?\" Audrey said. \"It\u0027s not really happening anyway. We\u0027re not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what is it?\" Summer asked, on the verge of hysteria. \"Where are we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the Game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came from the corner of the room, from the shadow behind the Oriental screen. It was a voice that didn\u0027t belong to any of the group, but one that was familiar to Jenny. She\u0027d only heard it once before, but she couldn\u0027t mistake it. Like water over rock, it was full of elemental music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery head turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy stepped out of the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was just as beautiful as he had been in the store. But here, against the backdrop of this quaint and fussy room, he looked even more exotic. His hair shone in the dimness like white cat\u0027s fur or mountain snow. He was wearing a black vest that showed the smooth, hard muscles of his bare arms, and pants that looked like snakeskin. His eyes were heavy-lidded, shielded by long lashes. He was smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer gasped. \"The picture. The paper doll in the box. It\u0027s him- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Shadow Man,\" Michael said hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make me laugh,\" Tom said. Lip curled, he looked the apparition up and down. \"Who the hell are you? What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy in black took another step forward. Jenny could see the impossible daylight color of his eyes now, though he wasn\u0027t looking at her. His gaze swept over the others, and Jenny could see it affect them, like a wave of cold air that caused them to draw together. She could see each of them reacting as they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked into his face and saw-something there. Something that caused their eyes to go wide and suspicion to turn to fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you call me Julian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that your name?\" Tom said, much more quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s as good as anything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever you are, we\u0027re not scared of you,\" Dee said suddenly, letting go of Jenny and stepping forward. It sounded like the truth, as if Dee, anyway, was not afraid, and it seemed to encourage the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want to know what\u0027s going on,\" Tom said, loudly again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t done anything to you. Please just let us go home,\" Summer added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go home again,\" Zach murmured. It was the first time he\u0027d spoken. He was wearing a strange half smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bud, you\u0027re in worse shape than I am,\" Michael told him in a low voice. Zach didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Jenny stayed back, not moving, not speaking. Her sense of dread was getting stronger all the time. She was remembering a look like a starving tiger\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least tell us what we\u0027re doing here,\" Audrey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Playing the Game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You agreed to play. You read the rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-playing? What playing? You mean-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t talk to him about it, Mike,\" Tom interrupted. \"We\u0027re not going to play his stupid game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s so scared, Jenny thought. He still thinks this is all his fault. But it isn\u0027t, Tom, it isn\u0027t____\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean,\" the boy in black said to Michael, \"that you all swore you were playing of your own free will and that you knew the Game was real. You invoked the rune Uruz.\" He sketched a shape in the air with his finger, an inverted U. Jenny noticed that the snake tattoo she\u0027d seen on his wrist in the store had vanished. \"You pierced the veil between the worlds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey laughed, a sharp false sound like glass shattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael breathed, \"This is nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s expression said that she agreed. \"What\u0027s a rune?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey opened her mouth, then shut it again tightly, shaking her head. Julian\u0027s lip quirked and he lowered his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s magic,\" he said. \"A mystical letter from an ancient alphabet. In this case designed to let you walk between the worlds. If you don\u0027t understand it, you shouldn\u0027t be messing with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t mean to mess with anything,\" Summer whispered. \"It\u0027s all a mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear in the room had heightened. Jenny could sense it like a yellow aura enveloping them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No mistake. You chose to play the Game,\" the boy said again. \"Now you play until you win-or I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" Summer said, almost sobbing. \"What do you want from us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian smiled, then looked past her. Past all of them, to the one person who hadn\u0027t said a word since he\u0027d entered the room. To Jenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every game has a prize,\" he said. Jenny met the impossibly blue eyes and knew she\u0027d been right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood for a moment, looking at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian\u0027s smile deepened. Tom looked back and forth between them. Understanding slowly dawned on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ...\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every game has a prize,\" the boy repeated. \"Winner take all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Tom said and launched himself across the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom lunged at the boy in black-and drew up short. His eyes were fixed on something at his feet. Jenny couldn\u0027t understand it-it was as if he saw something terrifying there on the carpet. He turned to get away from it and stopped. It was behind him, too. Slowly he backed up against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was staring at him in dismay. It was like watching one of the mimes out at Venice Beach. A very good mime-Jenny could tell that the things Tom was facing were small, that they were trying to climb up his legs, and that he was terribly afraid of them. But there was nothing on the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom,\" she said in a thin voice and took a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t come near me! They\u0027ll get you, too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was awful. Tom, who was never afraid of anything, was cornered by empty air. His lips were drawn back from his teeth, his chest was heaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Summer whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were all staring in silence. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-hunter-the-forbidden-game-1/page-4.html","bookId":2100,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:47 PM"}
