I forget which hotel, but why is it something tells me it was the Hilton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why indeed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have reason to think our boy Will\u0027s a guy named Johnson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a name he may have been using.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No wonder the Hilton wouldn\u0027t tell you anything. You wouldn\u0027t have been the first caller trying to get something out of them. All the tabloids, guarding the public\u0027s right to know. The Omaha PD must have slammed the lid shut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be my guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how many detectives are working on Will? I can\u0027t tell you the number, but what I do know is I\u0027m not one of them. How do I justify sticking my nose in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe this doesn\u0027t have anything to do with Will,\" I said. \"Maybe it\u0027s a simple investigation of a robbery suspect who pulled a series of holdups in this precinct and may have fled to Omaha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where he\u0027s got relatives. But instead of staying with them we think he holed up at the Hilton. We know the dates, and the name he used. That\u0027s some story, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You probably won\u0027t have to tell it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a New York police detective with a question that\u0027s easy to answer. Why should they give you a hard time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People have never needed a reason in the past.\" He picked up the phone. \"Here\u0027s a question that\u0027s not easy to answer. Why the hell am I doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allen W. Johnson,\" he said. \"That\u0027s Allen with two L\u0027s and an E. I don\u0027t know what the W stands for. I don\u0027t suppose it stands for Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure it stands for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stayed two nights and paid cash. As a matter of fact, the Omaha cops checked on everybody staying at the hotel as part of their investigation of Berry\u0027s murder. Anybody paid cash, that was a red flag. So Mr. Allen Johnson definitely had their attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they have a chance to talk to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d already checked out. Never used the phone or charged anything to his room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose they\u0027ve got a description of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, they got a real useful one. He was a man and he was wearing a suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Narrows it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He checked out after Will got Berry with the coat hanger, but before the body was discovered. So why take a second look at him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He paid cash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Not when he checked in. He gave them a credit card and they ran a slip. Then when he checked out he gave them cash. Apparently that\u0027s common. The card simplifies checking in, but you\u0027ve got reasons for settling up in cash. Maybe the card\u0027s maxed out, or maybe you don\u0027t want the bill showing up at your house because you don\u0027t want your wife to know you were over at the Hilton humping your secretary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when you pay in cash-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They tear up the slip they took an imprint on. So nobody ever knows if the card\u0027s a phony, because they don\u0027t run it by the credit card company until you check out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we know he had a credit card,\" I said, \"whether or not it was a good one. And he had a piece of photo ID in the same name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I miss something? How do we know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had to show it to get on the plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he had the credit card for backup,\" he said, \"the other could be any damn thing long as it had his picture on it. One of those pieces of shit they print for you on Forty-second Street, says you\u0027re a student at the School of Hard Knox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said,\" TJ murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about this guy,\" Joe said. \"Since you got my attention. How\u0027d you get on to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the airline records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New York to Omaha?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philadelphia to Omaha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did Philadelphia come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the Quakers settled it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too complicated to go into,\" I said, \"but I was looking for someone who flew Philly to Omaha and back again. He fit the time frame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean he went out before Berry got killed and came back afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a little tighter fit than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. Who is he, you want to tell me that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a name,\" I said. \"And a face, if he showed photo ID, but I haven\u0027t seen the face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just a man in a suit, like the girl at the hotel remembered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me out here, Matt. What have you got that I should be passing on to somebody?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t got anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Will\u0027s out there running around, looking for fresh names for his list-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will\u0027s retired,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right. We got his word for that, don\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And nobody\u0027s heard a peep out of him since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which makes the department look pretty stupid, wasting manpower and resources chasing a perpetrator who no longer represents a danger to the community. How\u0027s this your business, anyway? Who\u0027s your client?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s confidential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on. Don\u0027t give me that shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a matter of fact, it\u0027s privileged. I\u0027m working for an attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, I\u0027m impressed. Wait a minute, it comes back to me. Weren\u0027t you working for the last vic? Whitfield?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. I wasn\u0027t doing much, I advised him on security and steered him to Wally Donn at Reliable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which did him a whole lot of good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they did what they could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whitfield hired me as an investigator,\" I said. \"Not that there was much for me to investigate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re still at it? That\u0027s the attorney you\u0027re working for? What are you, billing the estate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He paid me a retainer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it covers what you\u0027re doing now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you got, Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I\u0027ve got is Allen Johnson, and I told you how I got him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d you check those flights?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right. You know what I do when I get a hunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet a bunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I buy a lottery ticket,\" he said, \"and I\u0027ve never won yet, which shows how good my hunches are. You\u0027d think I\u0027d learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All it takes is a dollar and a dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s catchy,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll have to remember that. Now, if there\u0027s nothing else-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actuallyâ€¦\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This better be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just thinking,\" I said, \"that it would be interesting to know if Allen W. Johnson ever bought cyanide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for a long moment, thinking. Then he said, \"Somebody must have checked the records when Whitfield got killed. Especially after the autopsy showed he was terminal and there was all that speculation that he killed himself. But Will\u0027s last letter scotched that line of thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It proved he killed Whitfield.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. It even mentioned cyanide, if I remember correctly. The cyanide had to come from somewhere, didn\u0027t it? It smells like almonds, but you can\u0027t make it out of almonds, can you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you can extract minute quantities from peach pits,\" I said, \"but somehow I don\u0027t think that\u0027s how Will got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if he bought it where you had to sign for it, and had to show ID-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he signed in as Allen Johnson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought it over, straightened up in his seat. He said, \"You know what? I think you should find out who\u0027s in charge of the investigation into Will and his wacky ways and ask him to look it up for you. You\u0027re a nice fellow, make a good first impression, and a hundred years ago you used to be on the job yourself. I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll be happy to cooperate with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d just hate to keep you from getting the credit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Credit,\" he said heavily. \"Is that how you remember it from your days on the force? Is that what you used to get for butting into somebody else\u0027s case? Credit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a little different when the case is stalled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one? It can be stalled six different ways, it can have a dead battery and four flat tires, and it\u0027s still high-profile and high-priority. You see Marty McGraw this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last time I saw him was around the time of Will\u0027s last letter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean him, I mean his column. You read it today?\" I hadn\u0027t. \"He had a hair up his ass about something, and I can\u0027t even remember what it was. Last line of the column- \u0027Where\u0027s Will now that we need him?\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t write that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell he didn\u0027t. Hang on a minute, there must be a copy of the News around here somewhere.\" He returned with a paper. \"I didn\u0027t have it word for word, but that\u0027s how it adds up. Here, read it yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked where he was pointing and read the final paragraph aloud. \" \u0027You find yourself thinking of a certain anonymous letter writer of recent memory, and saying of him what some unfunny folks used to say of Lee Harvey Oswald. Where is he now that we need him?\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did I tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe he wrote that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? He wrote the first one, saying Richie Vollmer wasn\u0027t fit to live. Which, I have to say, was a hard position to find fault with. But it sure got Will\u0027s motor running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we got out of there TJ was hungry again, and I realized I hadn\u0027t had anything but coffee since breakfast. We found a pizza place with tables and I got us a couple of Sicilian slices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was at this one place,\" he said, \"they had pizza with fruit on it. You ever hear of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never tried it, though?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It never sounded like a good idea to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me either,\" he said. \"Had pineapple on it, an\u0027 somethin\u0027 else, but I disremember what. Wasn\u0027t peaches, though. Was that straight what you was sayin\u0027 before? Peach pits really got cyanide in them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Traces of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many of \u0027em you have to eat before you kill yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to eat any of them before you kill yourself. You just put a gun in your mouth and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I mean, Dean. You couldn\u0027t poison somebody with peach pits \u0027cause he\u0027d take one bite an\u0027 make a face an\u0027 spit it out. But could somebody lookin\u0027 to commit suicide choke down enough of them to do the job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea,\" I said. \"Of course if we had a computer I\u0027m sure you could find out in no time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You right, you know. All you gotta do is post the question on the Internet and some fool E-mail you the answer.
