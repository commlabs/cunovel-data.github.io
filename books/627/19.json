She was a very lucky girl. And she had two lovely, long brown pigtails that reached all the way down to her waist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Mrs. Jewls asked a question, Leslie could raise one of her hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Leslie was adding, she could count on her fingers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Paul pulled one of her pigtails, she could kick him with one foot while standing on the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e 71But Leslie had one problem. She didn\u0027t know what to do with her toes. She had ten adorable little toes and nothing to do with them. As far as she could tell, they served no useful purpose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Suck your toes. That\u0027s what I do,\" said Sharie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Leslie\u0027s foot wouldn\u0027t reach her mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, that\u0027s all toes are good for,\" said Sharie. She put her foot in her mouth and went to sleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" thought Leslie. \"They must be good for something. They just have to be.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During recess, she asked Dana. \"Dana, what do you do with your toes?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I scratch the back of my legs,\" said Dana. \"First I scratch my left leg with my right foot. Then I scratch my right leg with my left foot.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But my legs don\u0027t itch,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s good,\" said Dana. \"In that case you can scratch my legs. With your help I can scratch both legs at the same time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, never mind,\" said Leslie. She walked up behind Louis, the yard teacher, and hopped on his shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louis,\" said Leslie. \"I don\u0027t know what to do with my toes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis tugged her foot. \"Yes, that is a serious problem,\" he said, \"but I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll take them off your hands for you, or rather, your feet. Just cut them off and give them to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What?\" asked Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t want them, so I\u0027ll take them,\" said Louis. \"You won\u0027t have to worry about them ever again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e 72\"No,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll give them to Miss Mush,\" said Louis. \"She can make little hot dogs out of them.\" Miss Mush was the lunch teacher.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I\u0027m not going to give my toes away,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" said Louis. \"I\u0027ll give you a nickel apiece for them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, you can\u0027t have them,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why not?\" Louis asked. \"They\u0027re no good to you, anyhow. And think of all you can buy for fifty cents.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bell rang.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll think it over,\" said Leslie. She ran back to class.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Jewls,\" said Leslie, \"I don\u0027t see any reason for keeping my toes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Leslie, I\u0027m sure there are lots of good reasons,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I can\u0027t think of any. My legs don\u0027t itch, and I can\u0027t get my foot in my mouth. Louis offered me a nickel apiece for them, and it seems to me like a good deal. But I wanted to check with you first.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think Louis was pulling your leg,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Leslie, \"he was pulling my toes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What would he want with your toes?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Leslie, \"but if he\u0027s willing to give me five cents apiece for them, then I\u0027m going to take him up on it. That\u0027s fifty cents.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At lunch, Leslie walked up to Louis. \"Okay, Louis,\"she said, \"you can have my toes for a nickel apiece.\n\u003cbr\u003e 73That will be fifty cents.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not so fast,\" said Louis. \"Let me look at them first.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leslie took off her shoes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, yes,\" said Louis, \"the big ones are good, and the ones next to them, but the most I\u0027ll give you for the rest of your toes is three cents each.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leslie was furious. \"Three cents each! You told me five at recess.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll give you five cents for the big ones. But just look at that scrawny little runt of a toe on the end, there. You\u0027re lucky to be getting even three cents for it. I think you\u0027re getting a darn good deal.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I happen to like that toe,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fine, then,\" said Louis, \"keep it. I\u0027ll just take the two big toes, and we\u0027ll call it square.\" He reached in his pocket and pulled out a dime.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing doing,\" said Leslie. \"These toes are sold as a set. It\u0027s either all ten for fifty cents or no deal. What am I going to do with just eight toes?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then forget it,\" said Louis. \"I\u0027m not going to give you a nickel for those scrawny little end toes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fine,\" said Leslie, \"no deal. My toes will still be here if you change your mind.\" She turned and walked toward the hopscotch area.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wait a second,\" Louis called. \"I\u0027ll give you a dollar each for your pigtails.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leslie turned around and looked at him with fiery eyes. \"Cut my hair!\" she exclaimed. \"Are you crazy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e 7419: Miss Zarves\n\u003cbr\u003e There is no Miss Zarves. There is no nineteenth story.
