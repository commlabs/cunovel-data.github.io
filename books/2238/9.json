{"id":108302,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe next morning my best friend, Amina Day--now Amina Day Price--called me. I\u0027d just pulled on my blue jeans, and I lay across the bed on my stomach to grab the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, it\u0027s me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amina,\" I said happily, feeling my mouth break into a smile, \"how are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, I\u0027m pregnant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ohmigod!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! Really, really. The ring in the tube turned the right color this morning, and I lost my breakfast, too. So I\u0027m home lying down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amina, I can\u0027t believe it. What does Hugh say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just thrilled. He\u0027s ready to go out now and buy a car seat and a crib. I told him he better wait a while, my mother always told me it was bad luck to start getting ready too soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen a doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I have an appointment for next week with the obstetrician all the wives of Hugh\u0027s partners go to.\" Hugh is an up-and-coming lawyer in Houston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad for you,\" I told her honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked for a while. Or, rather, I listened while Amina talked to me about the baby and what she wanted and didn\u0027t want for this exceptional infant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s new with you?\" she asked finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... I\u0027m seeing someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the minister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not anymore. This man--Martin--he\u0027s the new plant manager at Pan-Am Agra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wo--wo. How old is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Older.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-to-do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, that doesn\u0027t make any difference anymore, since you inherited all that loot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but it\u0027s nice anyway. He likes having money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, his name is Martin Bartell, he\u0027s forty-five, he has white hair but his eyebrows are black ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sexy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, very ... he\u0027s tough, strong, intelligent, and ... ruthless. You wouldn\u0027t want to try to bullshit him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are not Boy Scout attributes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, you\u0027re right,\" I said thoughtfully. \"He\u0027s definitely not a Boy Scout type. More of a street fighter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope he\u0027s not too tough for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No matter what he is,\" I confessed, \"this is the worst I\u0027ve ever had it. I\u0027m scared to death. I couldn\u0027t stay away from him if he were on fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, wow. You do have it bad. I hope he\u0027s worthy of this. This sounds like a `love at first sight\u0027 thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the first time I\u0027ve ever experienced it. And, I hope, the last. It\u0027s awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never had it like that,\" Amina said. \"So what else is happening?\" It wasn\u0027t like Amina to change the subject. Could she be a bit envious?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I filled her in on Tonia Lee\u0027s murder and the resultant confusion. Then I told her about Susu Hunter\u0027s husband and his strange secret persona as the House Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m like that to a lesser extent,\" Amina said instantly. \"It\u0027s not so weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just like to look at houses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, don\u0027t you? I get a tingle at the base of my spine when I walk into a house that\u0027s not mine, that I can look at all I want. It\u0027s like stepping into someone else\u0027s life for a while. You can open the closets, and find out what they pay for electricity, and how many clothes they have, and how clean their furniture is ... I have had the best time since Hugh and I started looking for a house. I wish I could look at houses all the time. In fact, I thought about becoming a realtor instead of a legal secretary until I realized I\u0027d have to get out in all kinds of weather and deal with jerks who didn\u0027t know what they wanted ... you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s interesting, Amina,\" I said, and meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, now we\u0027re looking at bigger houses,\" she added, and we were back on her favorite topic of the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we hung up, I\u0027d agreed to be the baby\u0027s godmother and Amina had urged me to hurry and marry Martin if we were going to anyway, so she could be a matron of honor before her stomach got too big.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just laughed and said good-bye. It made me nervous to think of marriage and Martin in the same sentence, as if it were a jinx. I finished dressing, trying not to feel sorry for myself, only glad for Amina and Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself wondering if Jimmy Hunter had been Idella\u0027s lover. It would make perfect sense, given his househunting aberration, for him to pick a realtor as a lover. But how would that tie in with the things missing from houses listed with local realtors? Surely Jimmy hadn\u0027t been lifting them while he toured the houses? He just couldn\u0027t have, not without a realtor noticing. And it wasn\u0027t always Idella who\u0027d shown him around. Hadn\u0027t someone at the meeting at Select Realty said the Greenhouses had always made sure Tonia Lee escorted him? Had something in Tonia Lee\u0027s sharp nature punctured the balloon of Jimmy\u0027s fantasy life as a house hunter, something so upsetting he\u0027d killed her for it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy Hunter drove a blue Ford Escort, and so had Idella. Maybe it had been Jimmy\u0027s car Donnie Greenhouse had seen Wednesday night. Come to think of it, what had Donnie been doing out himself? It must have been after the presumed time of Tonia Lee\u0027s death, which must have taken place before the neighbors to the rear of the Anderton place had noticed her car had gone. About the time of Tonia Lee\u0027s death, Jimmy had been parked outside the Tae Kwon Doe studio waiting for his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head at myself while I peered in the mirror applying my makeup. I was just getting confused. I wasn\u0027t going to speculate about depressing things anymore. I was going shopping to buy a dress to wear tonight. I was going to find out if Emily Kaye had accepted my counteroffer on the house on Honor. It would be nice and tidy to have that little chapter of my life closed, Jane\u0027s house settled and all my things ready to put into a home I owned. And I thought of the Julius house again: the sun through the windows, the warm kitchen, the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d like it,\" I told Madeleine, who was squinting at me doubtfully in the one pool of sunshine in my bedroom. She rolled on her back to invite me to tickle her stomach, and I obliged. We went downstairs together to change her water and fill her food bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Mother\u0027s office before I set out for my petite dress shop in Atlanta. Eileen said that the police had given her the contract for my house, signed by Emily Kaye. It had been in Idella\u0027s car. The changes I had stipulated had been penciled in, and Emily herself had called that morning after she heard the news of Idella\u0027s death, to confirm that she had agreed to the price and to my wanting the washer and dryer. So on my way out of town, I stopped by the office and signed the contract, too. And Jane\u0027s house was on its way to becoming Emily Kaye\u0027s house, having never really been my house at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was willing to drive all the way into the city instead of going to Great Day, Amina\u0027s mom\u0027s store, because I wanted something that Amina called a \"Later, Baby\" dress. Amina had always been a dating specialist, one who picked her clothes with as much care as she picked her makeup. Your clothes always said something to your date, she claimed, and she had had such a long and varied and successful dating career that I figured she knew what she was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to be modest enough to where you could see your mom while you were in it without turning red,\" she had advised. \"But it has to kind of growl to your date, `Later, baby!\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a slow day at the petite shop, Short \u0027n Sweet (hey, I didn\u0027t name it), and the saleswoman who\u0027d helped me before was glad to see me. I was too embarrassed to spell out what I wanted, but I tracked it down eventually. It was a sweater dress, soft and beige and shapeless but clingy, with a big cowl collar-\u0027and you wore it almost off the shoulders. I had to buy a strapless bra to go under it, and then big gold earrings, and then some shoes, so I made the saleswoman\u0027s afternoon a happy one. Quite a switch for someone who had worn her college and high school clothes for ten years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ate lunch in the city and visited my favorite bookstore, so I came home to Lawrenceton fairly laden down with good things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tuned in to the local radio station as I left the interstate. It was time for the news. \"Police are questioning a suspect in the murder of a Lawrenceton realtor,\" said the newswoman chattily. \"Today a prominent local businessman was taken in for questioning regarding the death of Tonia Lee Greenhouse, who was found strangled in an empty home last week. Though police would not comment, an unnamed source says police will also question James Hunter in connection with the death of Idella Yates, whose body was found yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in my breath. Jimmy Hunter. Poor Susu! Poor kids! I wondered what new evidence Lynn had uncovered that had led to Jimmy\u0027s being taken to the police station. I thought perhaps the police had found some of the stolen things in Jimmy\u0027s possession. Or maybe ... but it was no use speculating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin was ten minutes early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took in the dress appreciatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just have to brush my hair,\" I said, my hands extended to hold him off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me,\" he suggested, and I could feel a blush that began at my toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll never get there if I do,\" I said with a smile, and scampered up the stairs before he could grab me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One kiss,\" he said as I came back down minutes later. He and Madeleine had been regarding one another warily. \"One,\" I said strictly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very sweet at first, but then it began to steam up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My glasses are fogging,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Okay, we\u0027ll go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t until a few minutes later that we got into his car. It didn\u0027t take long to get to the Carriage House, which had actually formerly been what its name implied. It was the only fancy restaurant in Lawrenceton, and had very good food and service. It was small, dark, and expensive, with a large added-on room at the back where local groups held dinners. We were shown a corner table and sat side by side on the L-shaped banquette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing so close to Martin was seriously interfering with my paying attention to anything else, but I was determined to get through a normal-date evening with him. We talked about what wine to order, and I selected my food; and he talked to the waiter, and the wine arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jimmy Hunter\u0027s being questioned about the death of the woman whose body we found,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard someone was. Do you know the man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I told Martin about Jimmy and Susu, and Jimmy\u0027s little quirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He likes to look at houses with female realtors? That\u0027s pretty--kinky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s never done anything to anybody,\" I pointed out fairly. \"And frankly, I hope the police have got something more on him than that, as I assume they must, because I find it very hard to believe that Jimmy did it.\" I hadn\u0027t known I felt that way until it came out of my mouth. \"And they haven\u0027t charged him in Tonia Lee\u0027s murder, or Idella\u0027s, and surely the same person killed them both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Martin hadn\u0027t heard about my finding Idella\u0027s body, and I had to tell him now, his light brown eyes fixed on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you had called me when you were upset,\" he said. I had an uneasy feeling that he might be a little angry with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought about you. Of course. It\u0027s just that--really--for all our emotions for each other, we really don\u0027t know each other that well. And you\u0027re the plant manager, you have all kinds of duties and responsibilities that I don\u0027t know anything about, Martin. Even on Sunday night, I just felt very hesitant about interrupting you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been able to picture all too clearly his exasperated face as he turned away from some important papers to answer a call from his one-night flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" he said intently. \"Don\u0027t. We haven\u0027t learned a lot about each other, but this is not just a bed thing. I hope. On my part, anyway, and I think for you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know, yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched my hair. \"If you need me, I\u0027ll come. That\u0027s all there is to it. We have time to get to know each other. But if anything bothers you or upsets you, you call me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said finally, with misgivings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur salads arrived and we began eating, very conscious of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Martin, you\u0027ll have to tell me about your company,\" I said. \"I have only the vaguest idea of what Pan-Am Agra does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We arrange for the exchange of good used farm machinery for the produce from some of the South American countries,\" he explained. \"Also, we manufacture some agricultural goods and food using raw materials from North and South America, which is what we do at the plant here. And we own land in South America where we\u0027re trying to use North American farming methods to produce better yields. Those are the main things Pan-Am Agra does, though there are a few other things, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of products does Pan-Am Agra make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some fruit blends, some products containing coffee, some fertilizer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have to travel to South America much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was at company headquarters in Chicago, I had to go often, at least once every month. Now I won\u0027t fly down as much. But I will have to visit the other plants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is the government very much involved in what you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a regulatory agency, yes, too much so. They\u0027re forever thinking we\u0027re smuggling drugs in or weapons out, knowingly or unknowingly, and our shipments are almost always searched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of searching fertilizer, or the raw materials thereof, and wrinkled my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" Martin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what is a pirate like you doing in an agricultural company?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the way you see me? A pirate?\" He laughed. \"What is a quiet, slightly shy, introverted librarian doing dating a pirate like me? Your life has changed a lot lately, if what you tell me and what other people tell me is true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed he hadn\u0027t answered my question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My life has changed a lot,\" I said thoughtfully. \"I\u0027m changing with it, I guess.\" Funny, I\u0027d never thought of myself changing, just my circumstances. \"I guess it started--oh, almost two years ago,\" I told him, \"when Mamie Wright was killed the night it was my turn to address Real Murders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe salads left, and the main course came while I was telling Martin about Real Murders and what had happened that spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certainly not going to think I\u0027m quiet after hearing all that,\" I said ruefully. \"You had better tell me about your growing up, Martin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to think about it much,\" he said after a moment. \"My father died in a farm accident when I was six ... a tractor overturned. My mother remarried when I was ten. He was a hard man. Still is. He didn\u0027t put up with any nonsense, and he had a broad definition of nonsense. I didn\u0027t mind him at first. But I couldn\u0027t stand him after a few years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was great,\" he said instantly, with the warmest smile I\u0027d seen. \"You could tell her just about anything. She cooked all the time, did things you just see mothers in old sitcoms doing now. She wore aprons, and she went to church, and she came to every game I played--baseball, basketball, football. She did the same for Barbara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you grew up in a small town, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. A few miles outside the town, actually. So I wasn\u0027t sorry to get the chance at this job here. I wanted to see what it would be like to be back in a small town again, though Lawrenceton is really on the edge of Atlanta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother isn\u0027t alive anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mom died when I was in high school. She had a brain aneurysm, and it happened very- -very suddenly. My stepfather is still alive, still on the farm, but I haven\u0027t seen him since I came home from the war. Barbara goes back to town every now and then, just to show off how far beyond that little place she is now, I think ... she doesn\u0027t see him, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a rift?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t sell the farm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think that answered my question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother left the farm to him for his lifetime, and left us a little cash. Of course, she didn\u0027t have much. But we\u0027re supposed to get a third of the proceeds if he ever sells it, or if he dies before selling it, we get the land. We wanted him to sell when she died so we could move into town. But he wouldn\u0027t sell, out of some damn stubbornness. Now the situation for small farms is even worse, as I\u0027m sure you\u0027re aware.\" I nodded soberly. \"So the farm\u0027s falling down, the barn has a hole in the roof, he hasn\u0027t made money in years, and the whole thing is rotting. He could sell anytime to our nearest neighbor, but out of sheer meanness he won\u0027t.\" Martin stabbed his steak with his fork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ate for a minute in silence. I thought over what he\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um--how many times have you been married?\" I asked apprehensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Divorced?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. We had been married for ten years ... we had a son, Barrett. He\u0027s twenty-three now ... he wants to be an actor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A chancy profession.\" I thought of my mystery-writer friend, Robin Crusoe, now in California writing a television movie script based on his latest book, and wondered how he was making out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I told him. Funny thing--he already knew it!\" Martin said wryly. \"But he wanted so much to try, I gave him the money to get started. If he doesn\u0027t make it, he at least needs to know he gave it his best shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound as though you didn\u0027t get the encouragement you needed at some point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked surprised for a moment. \"I guess that\u0027s right. Though it\u0027s hard to say what I really wanted to do. I don\u0027t know that I ever formulated it. Something big,\" and his hands made a circle in the air. We laughed. \"It had to be something I could leave my hometown for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never wanted to leave my hometown,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never had a reason to. I don\u0027t know.\" I tried to remember what it had been like when I went to college: not knowing anyone, not knowing where anything was, the first two weeks of uncertainty. The waiter came up at that moment to see if we needed anything. \"Will you be wanting any dessert tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin turned questioningly to me. I shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he told the waiter. \"We\u0027ll have ours later.\" He smiled at me, and I felt a quiver that went down to my shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin paid the bill, and I realized I hadn\u0027t said a word about it being my turn. Something about Martin discouraged such offers. We would have to talk about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were quite ready for dessert when we got to my place. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/three-bedrooms-one-corpse-aurora-teagarden-3/page-9.html","bookId":2238,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:41 PM"}
