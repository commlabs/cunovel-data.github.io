And stop staring at me like I’ve damaged you. I didn’t take enough to kill you. You’ve only been asleep for two days. Eat some chocolate and you’ll be back where you were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t sure I’d heard him right. Two days? That meant today was Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d lost two whole days. “You knocked me out for two days? That can’t be healthy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows lowered. “You could be dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood God, I wanted to hit him. “You fed off me, dude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t even categorize how messed up that is. That’s not okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll tell you what’s not okay, is you throwing shit at me.” Curiosity marked his expression. “Why did you throw something at me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I didn’t answer, a muscle popped in his jaw. “You’re not going to answer me? Or do I need to repeat myself for a third time? It’s okay. I like to hear myself talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a second, anger and irritation roared through me. Something about his cocky tone pissed me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo did my body’s reaction to him. Parts of me were all kinds of tingly, especially when I wiggled again and felt him twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get off me.” I tried to push him off, but that didn’t work. “Get off me now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or what?” He tilted his head down so that his mouth was inches from mine. “You going to pick up a picture frame next and wing it at my head?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I can’t let you up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him in disbelief and sputtered, “You can’t— Get off!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne single brow arched up. “I can’t get off? Oh, I most definitely can get off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flush increased until I felt like I was under the sweltering sun. Muscles in my stomach tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not what I meant and you know it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm, so you say…so you say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was— Oh my God, I was struck speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long minute passed as he stared down at me, and then he released my wrists, finger by finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen in one fluid, unbelievably quick motion, he rolled off and stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, the guy was part alien, part human, and part ninja.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up and almost toppled off the side of the bed. Peering through the mass of tangled hair, I got my first real good look at Hunter. I’d been caught off guard in the parking garage and too frightened in my apartment to really get a good look at him, and since he had all that very human flesh on display, I drank him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly hotness… Jeans hung low on narrow hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter’s stomach was perfection— each taut muscle tight and totally lickable. Not that I’d ever licked a man’s stomach before, but now I got why someone would want to. I was in six-pack heaven. He even had those dips beside the hip- bones… Oh God, I felt dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest was defined and cut like marble. I got hung up on staring at that for a few moments before I literally had to force myself to look at his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChecking him out couldn’t be right. What was wrong with me? “Look, I’m sorry about the whole throwing things at you and everything else—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t look very apologetic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. “Well, I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings are kind of… messed up. And you knocked me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you’re half naked—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you looked in the mirror?” he cut in. “You’re just as naked as I am. And I didn’t throw anything at your head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing down at myself, I cringed. Somehow I’d forgotten that I was in my shirt and undies. Flushing all over again, I wanted to dart behind something, but I folded my arms. “I didn’t throw anything at your head. I was—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you always overreact like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God, if he interrupted me one more time I was going to throw something at his head. “I woke up in a strange place, kidnapped by an alien. I can’t even believe I’m explaining why I overreacted. What were you doing in my room anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mimicked my stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correction: this is my house and therefore this is my room. Not that I need to explain myself, but I was checking to make sure everything was secure outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you did kidnap me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw up my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s all this? Where am I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“West Virginia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dropped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God, this couldn’t be happening. “I’m in a different time zone? Are you fuc—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter threw up his hand, silencing me. The tip of my tongue literally burned to lay into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell is that noise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could respond, he stalked past the bed and entered the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus! What are you trying to do in here?” His voice carried from the bathroom. “Giving the floor a bath?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched desperately for my jeans, but came up empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter returned, hands on his hips. Too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I forgot I turned the faucet on. Geez, you’re grumpy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re already turning out to be a huge pain in my thigh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, I’m really sorry about that. Okay? I’ve been through some really traumatic events here recently and, yes, I might have overreacted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled with my patience. “And I really would like to know where my pants are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your pants were folded on the corner of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou probably knocked them on the floor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to check, but I so wasn’t bending down in my panties in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And how did they get off me and folded on the bed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did it. Thought you’d be more comfortable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh geez, I had no idea what to think about that. A thank-you so wasn’t in order though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe undressed me while I was unconscious, for crying out loud. My entire body felt red-hot. “I’m not going to say thank you for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not like I’d expect that common courtesy from you,” he replied, his pale eyes dancing…with what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmusement?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After all, you never thanked me for saving your ass—a pretty ass at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I can add inconsiderate to your growing list of attributes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut that right next to: overreacts, acts first and then thinks, drama—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, go fu—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do not want to finish that sentence,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter warned, his voice low enough to send warning shivers down my spine. “The one thing I don’t do is fuck myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI doubted he needed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, he probably opened his mouth and ruined everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, this is not what I intended. I just need to know what’s going on and get my pants—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about you do this,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe said, stalking up to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a step back, hitting the bed. His gaze dropped from my face to my chest, his stare so intense it felt like he was touching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you put some more clothes on? You’re a little distracting right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped at him in disbelief. What the hell had I been trying to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick grin flashed across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot necessarily warm, but there was definitely something to it. Was he messing with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you’re done, you can join me downstairs,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe continued, strolling past me. “We have a few things we need to go over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around, hands curling into useless fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you put some clothes on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStopping at the door, he glanced over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I distract you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClamping my mouth shut, I glared daggers at him. He was distracting, but a zombie could eat my brains before I’d admit that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed the door shut in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever in my life had I been more frustrated. Go figure it wouldn’t be with a human but a freaking alien. At least I now knew that the male species were asses no matter what planet they hailed from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter digging my jeans out from underneath the bed and slipping them on, I sat on the edge of the bed and glared at the door. Be downstairs in five minutes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat insufferable, arrogant, and demanding ass was going to wait at least ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut damn, he was insanely hot for an…alien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroaning, I dropped my head into my hands. I didn’t feel right. The whole not knowing where I was, what was happening at home, and being so far out of what I knew was reality was driving me insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door suddenly swung open, causing me to jump. Hunter filled the doorway, still shirtless and eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five minutes have been up,” he said. “I don’t like to wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like to be bossed around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his head to the side. “Then we’re going to have a problem, Serena.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA part hidden deep inside responded to the sound of my name coming from his mouth, warming and turning liquid. The way it rolled off his tongue was sinful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnapping out of it, I climbed to my feet and grumbled the whole way past him. Hunter said nothing as we went downstairs. It was a few blissful moments of silence, which I used to admire what he had going on in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe entered a massive room with white, pristine sectional couches and sitting chairs. A large flat-screen TV hung from the wall. Vases decorated the end tables and took up the corners of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a faint smell of roses in the air. I was half afraid to touch anything, like I’d leave sticky fingerprints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him down a hallway and into a kitchen area. Bright sunlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, giving the room a warm, welcoming feeling, while the living room was sort of sterile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral bar stools surrounded the island and top-of-the-line appliances furnished the kitchen— stainless-steel double oven, side-by-side fridge, and a sink you could bathe in. Off to the left was a dining table and, beyond that, an entrance to a sunroom full of plants and chaise lounges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit,” he said, gesturing at one of the stools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI debated on ignoring him, but decided it wouldn’t get us anywhere. Sitting, I folded my hands in my lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like a drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe interrupted, heading toward the cabinet near the fridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brows rose. “Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be nice. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter glanced at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sound surprised.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t seem like the type who does civil things like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning back to the cabinet, he grabbed two glasses. “I have soda, milk, water—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Milk? I’m not ten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around, lips tipped up on one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And how old are you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNineteen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOffended, I leaned back on the stool. “I’m twenty- three, but I’ll try to take that as a compliment.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-9.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
