Now the soul can return to its natural form; its normal state. There is an incredible lightness; a sense of total freedom; a limitlessness. And an aware-ness of Oneness that is at once blissful and sublime.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is not possible for the soul to regret such a shift.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’re saying, then, that death is a happy experience?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor the soul that wishes it to be, yes, always.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, if the soul wants out of the body so bad, why doesn’t it just leave it?

The fact that you are joyful doing the second does not mean you were unhappy doing the first.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe soul is not unhappy being with the body. Quite to the contrary, the soul is pleased to be you in your present form.

You must do more than understand it. You must love it, even as you love life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour time with each person would be glorified if you thought it was your last time with that person. Your ex-perience of each moment would be enhanced beyond measure if you thought it was the last such moment. Your refusal to contemplate your own death leads to your refusal to contemplate your own life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou do not see it for what it is. You miss the moment, and all it holds for you. You look right past it instead of right through it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you look deeply at something, you see right through it. To contemplate a thing deeply is to see right through it. Then the illusion ceases to exist. Then you see a thing for what it really is. Only then can you truly enjoy it—that is, place joy into it. (To “en-joy” is to ren-der something joyful.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven the illusion you can then enjoy. For you will know it is an illusion, and that is half the enjoyment! It is the fact that you think it is real that causes you all the pain.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNothing is painful which you understand is not real. Let Me repeat that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNothing is painful which you understand is not real.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is like a movie, a drama, played out on the stage of your mind. You are creating the situation and the char-acters. You are writing the lines.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNothing is painful the moment you understand that nothing is real.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is as true of death as it is of life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you understand that death, too, is an illusion, then you can say, “0 death, where is thy sting?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou can even enjoy death! You can even enjoy someone else’s death.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDoes that seem strange? Does that seem a strange thing to say?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnly if you do not understand death—and life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDeath is never an end, but always a beginning. A death is a door opening, not a door closing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you understand that life is eternal, you un-derstand that death is your illusion, keeping you very concerned with, and therefore helping you believe that you are, your body. Yet you are not your body, and so the destruction of your body is of no concern to you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDeath should teach you that what is real is life. And life teaches you that what is unavoidable is not death, but impermanence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eImpermanence is the only truth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNothing is permanent. All is changing. In every in-stant. In every moment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWere anything permanent, it could not be. For even the very concept of permanence depends upon imper-manence to have any meaning. Therefore, even perma-nence is impermanent. Look at this deeply. Contem-plate this truth. Comprehend it, and you comprehend God.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is the Dharma, and this is the Buddha. This is the Buddha Dharma. This is the teaching and the teacher. This is the lesson and the master. This is the ob-ject and the observer, rolled into one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey never have been other than One. It is you who have unrolled them, so that your life may unroll before you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet as you watch your own life roll out before you, do not yourself become unraveled. Keep your Self to-gether! See the illusion! Enjoy it! But do not become it!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are not the illusion, but the creator of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are in this world, but not of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo use your illusion of death. Use it! Allow it to be the key that opens you to more of life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSee the flower as dying and you will see the flower sadly. Yet see the flower as part of a whole tree that is changing, and will soon bear fruit, and you see the flower’s true beauty. When you understand that the blossoming and the falling away of the flower is a sign that the tree is ready to bear fruit, then you understand life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLook at this carefully and you will see that life is its own metaphor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlways remember, you are not the flower, nor are you even the fruit. You are the tree. And your roots are deep, embedded in Me. I am the soil from which you have sprung, and both your blossoms and your fruit will return to Me, creating more rich soil. Thus, life begets life, and cannot know death, ever.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is so beautiful. That is so, so beautiful. Thank You. Will You speak to me now of something that is troubling me ? I need to talk about suicide. Why is there such a taboo against the ending of one’s life?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, why is there?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou mean it’s not wrong to kill yourself?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe question cannot be answered to your satisfac-tion, because the question\u0026nbsp; itself contains two false con-cepts; it is based on two false ~5Sumptions; it contains two errors.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe first false assumption is that there is such a thing as “right” and “wrong.” The second false assumption is that killing is possible. Your question itself, therefore, disintegrates the moment it is dissected.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Right” and “wrong” are philosophical polarities in a human value system which have nothing to do with ultimate reality—a point Which I have made repeatedly throughout this dialogue. They are, furthermore, not even constant constructs within your own system, but rather, values which keen shifting from time to time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are doing the shifting, changing your mind about these values as it suits you (which rightly you should, as evolving beings) yet insisting at each step along the way that you haven’t done this, and that it is your unchanging values Which form the core of your society’s integrity. You have ~ built your society on a paradox. You keep changing your values, all the while proclaiming that it is unchanging values which you ... well, value!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe answer to the problems presented by this para-dox is not to throw cold water 0n the sand in an attempt to make it concrete, but to celebrate the shifting of the sand. Celebrate its beauty while it holds itself in the shape of your castle, but then also celebrate the new form and shape it takes as the tide comes in.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCelebrate the shifting sands as they form the new mountains you would climb, and atop which—and with which—you will build your new castles. Yet un-derstand that these mountains and these castles are monuments to change, not to permanence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGlorify what you are today, yet do not condemn what you were yesterday, nor preclude what you could become tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUnderstand that “right” and “wrong” are figments of your imagination, and that “okay” and “not okay” are merely announcements of your latest preferences and imaginings.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor example, on the question of ending one’s life, it is the current imagining of the majority of people on your planet that it is “not okay” to do that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, many of you still insist that it is not okay to assist another who wishes to end his or her life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn both cases you say this should be “against the law.” You have come to this conclusion, presumably, because the ending of the life occurs relatively quickly. Actions which end a life over a somewhat longer period of time are not against the law, even though they achieve the same result.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus, if a person in your society kills himself with a gun, his family members lose insurance benefits. If he does so with cigarettes, they do not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf a doctor assists you in your suicide, it is called manslaughter, while if a tobacco company does, it is called commerce.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith you, it seems to be merely a question of time. The legality of self-destruction—the “rightness” or “wrongness” of it—seems to have much to do with how quickly the deed is done, as well as who is doing it. The faster the death, the more “wrong” it seems to be. The slower the death, the more it slips into “okayness.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, this is the exact opposite of what a truly humane society would conclude. By any reasonable definition of what you would call “humane,” the shorter the death, the better. Yet your society punishes those who would seek to do the humane thing, and re-wards those who would do the insane.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is insane to think that endless suffering is what God requires, and that a quick, humane end to the suf-fering is “wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Punish the humane, reward the insane.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is a motto which only a society of beings with limited understanding could embrace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo you poison your system by inhaling carcinogens, you poison your system by eating food treated with chemicals that over the long run kill you, and you poi-son your system by breathing air which you have con-tinually polluted. You poison your system in a hundred different ways over a thousand different moments, and you do this knowing these substances are no good for you. But because it takes a longer time for them to kill you, you commit suicide with impunity.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you poison yourself with something that works faster, you are said to have done something against moral law.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow I tell you this: It is no more immoral to kill your-self quickly than it is to kill yourself slowly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo a person who ends his own life is not punished by God?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI do not punish.

It is about her son, who ended his life when he was a teenager. So many people have found it helpful.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnne Puryear is a wonderful messenger.

It says more on this subject than we are saying here, and those who have deep hurts or lingering issues surrounding the experience of a loved one ending their life will be opened to healing through this book.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is sad that we even have such deep hurts or issues, but much of that, I think, is a result of what our society has “laid on ~ about suicide.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn your society, you often do not see the contradic-tions of your own moral constructions. The contradic-tion between doing things that you know full well are going to shorten your life, but doing them slowly, and doing things that will shorten your life quickly is one of the most glaring in the human experience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet it seems so obvious when You spell them out like this. Why can’t we see such obvious truths on our own?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause if you saw these truths, you would have to do something about them. This you do not wish to do. So you have no choice but to look right at something and not see it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut why would we not want to do something about these truths if we saw them?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause you believe that in order to do something about them, you would have to end your pleasures. And ending pleasures is something you have no desire to do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMost of the things which cause your slow deaths are things which bring you pleasure, or result from those things. And most of the things which bring you pleasure are things which satisfy the body. Indeed, this is what marks yours as a primitive society. Your lives are struc-tured largely around seeking and experiencing pleasures of the body.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, all beings everywhere seek to experi-ence pleasures. There is nothing primitive in that. In fact, it is the natural order of things. What differenti-ates societies, and beings within societies, is what they define as pleasurable.
