Through a gap in her curtains she could see the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egray light of dawn-just like Hana\u0027s gray dawn-and she thought she still might be in the nightmare. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen, slowly, objects in the room became clear. Her bookshelves, crammed with books and crowned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith one near-perfect trilobite fossil on a stand. Her dresser, its top piled with things that belonged in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother places. Her posters of Velociraptor and T. Rex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m me. I remember me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never been so happy to be herself, or to be awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that dream she\u0027d just had-that had happened to her. A long time ago, sure, but nothing like so long\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eago as, say, when the T. Rex had been alive. Not to mention the trilobite. A few thousand years was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyesterday to Mother Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was all real, she knew that now. She accepted it. She had fallen asleep and her subconscious had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epulled back the veil of the past and allowed her to see more of Hana\u0027s story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry, she thought. The people of Hana\u0027s clan tortured him. God knows for how long-I\u0027m just glad I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t have to watch more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it puts sort of a different twist on things, doesn\u0027t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still didn\u0027t know how the story ended. She wasn\u0027t sure she wanted to know. But it was hard to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblame him for whatever had happened afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn awful feeling was settling in Hannah\u0027s stomach. All those things I said to him-terrible things, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought. Why did I say all that? I was so angry-I lost control completely. I hated him and all I cared\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout was hurting him. I really thought he must be evil, pure evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him to go away forever. How could I have done that? He\u0027s my soulmate. There was a strange\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemptiness inside her, as if she\u0027d been hollowed out like a tree struck by lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the emptiness, a voice like a cool dark wind whispered, But you told Paul that he kept killing you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover and over. Is that justifiable? He\u0027s a vampire, a predator, and that makes him evil by nature. Maybe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe can\u0027t help being what he is, but there\u0027s no reason for you to be destroyed again because of it. Are you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing to let him kill you in this life, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was torn between pity for him and the deep instinct that he was dangerous. The cool wind voice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed to be the voice of reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo ahead and feel sorry for him, it said. Just keep him far away from you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt better having come to a decision, even if it was a decision that left her heart numb. She glanced\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound the room, focused on the clock by her bedside, and blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God-school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quarter to seven and it was a Friday. Sacaja-wea High seemed light-years away, like someplace\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe\u0027d visited in a past life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s not. It\u0027s your life, now, the only one that counts. You have to forget all that other stuff about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereincarnation and vampires and the Night World. You have to forget about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou sent him away and he\u0027s gone. So let\u0027s get on with living in the normal world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust thinking this way made her feel braced and icy, as if she\u0027d had a cold shower. She took a real\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshower, dressed in jeans and a denim shirt, and she had breakfast with her mother, who cast her several\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethoughtful glances but didn\u0027t ask any questions until they were almost finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she said, \"Did everything go all right at Dr. Winfield\u0027s yesterday evening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad it only been yesterday evening? It seemed like a week ago. Hannah chewed a bite of cornflakes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand finally said, \"Uh, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he called while you were in the shower. He seemed...\" Her mother stopped and searched\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor a word. \"Anxious. Worse than worried but not as bad as hysterical.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah looked at her mother\u0027s face, which was narrow, intelligent, and tanned by the Montana sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were more blue than Hannah\u0027s gray, but they were direct and discerning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to tell her mother the whole story- but when she had time to do it, and after she\u0027d had . time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto think it out. There was no urgency. It was all behind her now, and it wasn\u0027t as if she needed advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul\u0027s anxious a lot,\" she said judiciously, sticking to the clean edge of truth. \"I think that\u0027s why he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecame a psychologist. He tried a sort of hypnosis thing on me yesterday and it didn\u0027t exactly work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hypnosis?\" Her mother\u0027s eyebrows lifted. \"Hannah, I don\u0027t know if you should be getting into that-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry; I\u0027m not. It\u0027s over. We\u0027re not going to try it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Well, he said for you to call him to set up another appointment. I think he wants to see you soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached over suddenly and took Hannah\u0027s hand. \"Honey, are you feeling any better? Are you still\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehaving bad dreams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah looked away. \"Actually-I sort of had one last night. But I think I understand them better now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey don\u0027t scare me as much.\" She squeezed her mother\u0027s hand. \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m going to be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, but-\" Before her mother could finish the sentence a horn honked outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Chess. I\u0027d better run.\" Hannah gulped down the dregs of her orange juice and dashed into her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebedroom to grab her backpack. She hesitated a split second by the wastebasket, then shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. There was no reason to take the black rose ring with her. It was his, and she didn\u0027t want to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereminded of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slung the backpack over her shoulder, yelled goodbye to her mother, and hurried outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChess\u0027s car was parked in the driveway. As Hannah started toward it she had an odd impression. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed to see a figure standing behind the car-a tall figure, face turned toward her. But her eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edazzled by the sun and at that instant she involuntarily blinked. When she could see again, there was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enothing in that spot except a little swirl of dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re late,\" Chess said when Hannah got in the car. Chess, whose real name was Catherine Clovis,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas petite and pretty, with dark hair cut in a cap to frame her face. But just now her slanted green cat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes and Mona Lisa smile reminded Hannah too much of Ket. It was disconcerting; she had to glance\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown to make sure Chess wasn\u0027t wearing a deerskin outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Now Chess was looking at her with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Hannah sank back against the upholstery, blinking. \"I think I need to get my eyes checked,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethough.\" She glanced at the spot where the phantom figure had been-nothing. And Chess was just Chess:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmart, savvy, and faintly exotic, like an orchid blooming in the badlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you can do it when we go shopping this weekend,\" Chess said. She slanted Hannah a glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must go shopping. Next week\u0027s your birthday and I need something new to wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah grinned in spite of herself. \"Maybe a new necklace,\" she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\" I wonder what happened to Ket, she thought. Even if Hana died young, at least Ket must\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave grown up. I wonder if she married Ran, the guy who wanted to \"mate\" her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you\u0027re okay?\" Chess said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Sorry; I\u0027m a little brain-dead. I didn\u0027t sleep well last night.\" Her plan for Chess was exactly the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esame as for her mother. Tell her everything-in a little while. When she was less upset about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChess was putting an arm around her, steering skillfully with the other. \"Hey, we\u0027ve got to get you in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshape, kid. I mean, first it\u0027s your birthday, then graduation. Isn\u0027t that psychologist doing anything to help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah muttered, \"Maybe too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, she was restless again. The school day had passed uneventfully. Hannah and her mother had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad dinner peacefully. But after her mother went out to a meeting with some local rockhounds, Hannah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efound herself wandering around the house, too wound up to read or watch TV, too distracted to go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I need some air, she thought-and then she caught herself and gave a self-mocking grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure. Air. When what you\u0027re really thinking is that he just might be out there. Admit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe admitted it. Not that she thought Thierry was very likely to be hanging around her backyard,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econsidering what she\u0027d said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why should you want to talk to him? she demanded of herself. He may not be completely and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etotally and pointlessly evil, but he\u0027s still no boy scout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t shake a vague feeling of wanting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto go outside. At last she went out on the porch, telling herself that she\u0027d spend five minutes here and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen go back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was another beautiful night, but Hannah couldn\u0027t enjoy it. Everything reminded her too much of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel herself softening toward him, weakening. He had looked so stricken, so devastated, when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe told him to go away....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I interrupting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah started. She wheeled toward the voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding on the other side of the porch was a tall girl. She looked a year or so older than Hannah, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe had long hair, very long hair, so black that it seemed to reflect moonlight like a raven\u0027s wing. She was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eextraordinarily beautiful-and Hannah recognized her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s the one from my vision. That flash of a girl telling me that Thierry was cunning. She\u0027s the one who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewarned me about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she\u0027s the figure I saw behind Chess\u0027s car this morning. She must have been watching me then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry if I scared you,\" the girl said now, smiling. \"You looked so far away, and I didn\u0027t mean to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estartle you. But I\u0027d really like to talk to you if you have a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...\" Hannah felt strangely tongue-tied. Something about the girl made her uncomfortable, in a way that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewent beyond the dreamlike weirdness of recognizing somebody she\u0027d never seen in her present life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027s your friend, she told herself. She\u0027s helped you in the past; she probably wants to help you again\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow. You should be grateful to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Hannah said. \"We can talk.\" She added somewhat awkwardly, \"I remember you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful. Do you really? That makes everything so much easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah nodded. And told herself again that this girl was her friend, and nobody to be hostile to or wary\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" The girl glanced around the porch, where there was dearly no place to sit. \"Ah...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah was embarrassed, as if the girl had asked, \"Do you entertain all your visitors outside?\" She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned around and opened the back door. \"Come on in. We can sit down.\" \"Thank you,\" the girl said and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmiled. In the bright fluorescent lights of the kitchen, she was even more beautiful. Hauntingly beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExquisite features, skin like silk. Lips that made Hannah think of adjectives like full and ripe. And eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat were like nothing Hannah had ever seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were large, almond-shaped, heavy-lashed, and luminous. But it wasn\u0027t just that. Every time Hannah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked, they seemed to be a different color. They changed from honey to mahogany to jungle-leaf green\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto larkspur purple to misty blue. It was amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you remember me, then you must know what I\u0027m here about,\" the girl said. She rested an elbow on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe kitchen table and propped her chin on her fist. Hannah said one word. \"Thierry.\" \"Yes, From the way\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou say that, maybe you don\u0027t need my advice after all.\" The girl had an extraordinary voice as well; low\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand pleasant, with a faint husky throb in it. Hannah lifted her shoulders. \"Well, there\u0027s still a lot I don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow about him-but I don\u0027t need anybody to tell me that he\u0027s dangerous. And I\u0027ve already told him to go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you really? How remarkably brave of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah blinked. She hadn\u0027t thought of it as being so brave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, you do realize how powerful he is? He\u0027s a Lord of the Night World, the head of all the made\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampires. He could\"-the girl snapped her fingers- \"call out a hundred little vampires and werewolves. Not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto mention his connection with the witches in Las Vegas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you trying to say? That I shouldn\u0027t have told him to go away? I don\u0027t care how many monsters\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe can call out,\" Hannah said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Of course you don\u0027t. Like I said, you\u0027re brave.\" The girl regarded her with eyes the deep purple of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebittersweet nightshade. \"I just want you to realize what he\u0027s capable of. He could have this whole county\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewiped out. He can be very cruel and very childish-if he doesn\u0027t get what he wants he\u0027ll simply go into a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And does he do that a lot-go into rages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the time, unfortunately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t believe you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought came to Hannah suddenly. She didn\u0027t know where it came from, but she couldn\u0027t ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something about this girl that bothered her, something that felt like a greasy stone held\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetween the fingers. That felt like a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" she said directly. When the girl\u0027s eyes-now burnt sienna-lifted to hers this time, she held\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem. \"I mean, why are you so interested in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme? Why are you even here, in Montana, where I am? Is it just a coincidence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. I came because I knew that he was about to find you again. I\u0027m interested in you*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause-well, I\u0027ve known Thierry since his childhood, before he became a vampire, and I feel a certain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eobligation to stop him.\" She smiled, meeting Hannah\u0027s steady gaze easily. \"And my name ... is Maya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said the last words slowly, and she seemed to be watching Hannah for a reaction. But the name\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t mean anything to Hannah. And Hannah simply couldn\u0027t figure out whether this girl called Maya was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elying or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027ve warned me about Thierry before,\" she said, trying to gather her thoughts. \"But I don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremember anything about it except you telling me. I don\u0027t even know what you are-I mean, are you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomebody who\u0027s been reincarnated like me? Or are you... ?\" She left the question open-ended. As a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ematter of fact, she knew Maya wasn\u0027t human; no human was so eerily beautiful or supernaturally graceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Maya claimed she was, Hannah would know for sure it was a deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a vampire,\" Maya said calmly and without hesitation. \"I lived with Thierry\u0027s tribe in the days when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou lived with the Three Rivers clan. In fact, I\u0027m the one who actually made him into a vampire. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshouldn\u0027t have done it; I should have realized he was one of those people who couldn\u0027t handle it. But I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t know he\u0027d go crazy and become... what he is.\" She looked off into the distance. \"I suppose that\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhy I feel responsible for him,\" she finished\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esoftly. Then she looked back at Hannah. \"Any other questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hundreds,\" Hannah said. \"About the Night World, and about what\u0027s happened to me in past lives-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not going to be able to answer most of them. There are rules against talking about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe Night World-and anyway, it\u0027s safer for you not to know. As for your past lives, well, you don\u0027t really\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant to know what he\u0027s done to you each time, do you? It\u0027s too gruesome.\" She leaned forward, looking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat Hannah earnestly. \"What you should do now is put the past behind you and forget about all this. Try to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave a happy future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was exactly what Hannah had decided to do earlier. So why did she feel like bristling now? She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweighed different responses and finally said, \"If he wants to kill me so much, why didn\u0027t he just do it last\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enight? Instead of talking to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my dear child.\" The tone was slightly patronizing, but seemed genuinely pitying. \"He wants you to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elove him first, and then he kills you. I know, it\u0027s sick, it\u0027s twisted, but it\u0027s the way he is. He seems to think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit has to be that way, since it was that way the first time. He\u0027s obsessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah was silent. Nothing inside her stood up to say that this was a lie. And the idea that Thierry was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eobsessed certainly rang true. At last she said slowly, \"Thank you for coming to warn me. I do appreciate\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t,\" Maya said. \"I wouldn\u0027t either if someone came to tell me things I didn\u0027t want to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe someday you will thank me.\" She stood. \"I hope we won\u0027t have to meet again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah walked her to the back door and let her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the porch, Maya turned. \"He really is insane, you know!\" she said. \"You\u0027ll probably begin to have,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoubts again. But he\u0027s obsessive and unstable, just like any stalker; and he\u0027s really capable of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t be fooled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ever going to see him again,\" Hannah said, unreasonably annoyed. \"So it\u0027s going to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekind of hard to fool me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya smiled, nodded, then did the disappearing act. Just as Thierry had, she turned and simply melted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einto the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah stared out into the darkness for a minute or so. Then she went back into the kitchen and called\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Winfield\u0027s number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got his answering machine. \"Hi, this is Hannah, and I got your message about making another\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eappointment. I was wondering if we could maybe do it tomorrow-or anyway some time over the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweekend. And...\" She hesitated, wondering if it was something she should say in person, then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshrugged. Might as well give him time to prepare. \"And I\u0027d like to do another regression. There are some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethings I want to figure out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt better after she hung up. One way or another, she would get at the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe headed into her bedroom with a faint, grim smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd stopped dead on the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry was sitting on her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Hannah stood frozen. Then she said sharply, \"What are you doing here?\" At the same\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etime, she glanced around the room to see how he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad gotten in. The windows were shut and only opened from inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have walked in while I was in the kitchen talking with Maya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to see you,\" Thierry said. He looked- strange. His dark eyes seemed hot somehow, as if he were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eburning inside. His face was tense and grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you to keep away from me.\" Hannah kept fear out of her voice-but she was scared. There was a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esort of electricity in the air, but it wasn\u0027t a good electricity. It was purely dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you did, and I tried. But I can\u0027t stay away, Hannah. I just can\u0027t. It makes me ... crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, he stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s heart seemed to jump into her throat and stay there, pounding hard. She fought to keep her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eface calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s fast, a little voice in her head seemed to say, and with relief she recognized the dark wind voice, the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecool voice of reason. There\u0027s no point in running from him, because he can catch you in a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to understand,\" Thierry was saying. \"Please try to understand. I need you. We were meant to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe together. Without you, I\u0027m nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step toward her. His eyes were black and fathomless, and Hannah could almost feel their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheat. Obsessed, yes, she thought. Maya was right. He may jut on a good front, but underneath he\u0027s just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplain crazy. like any stalker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say you understand,\" Thierry said. He reached a pleading hand toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Hannah said grimly. \"And I still want you to go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. I have to make sure we\u0027ll be together, the way we were meant to be. And there\u0027s only one way\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something different about his mouth, Two delicate fangs were protruding, indenting .his lower\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt a cold fist dose over her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to join the Night World, Hannah. You have to become like me. I promise you, once it\u0027s over,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027ll be happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happy?\" A wave of sickening revulsion swept over Hannah. \"As a monster like you? I was happy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore you ever showed up. I\u0027d be happy if you\u0027d just keep out of my life forever. I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop talking! The cool wind voice was screaming at her, but Hannah was too overwrought to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re disgusting. I hate you. And nothing can j ever make me love you ag-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t get to finish. In one swift movement, he was in front of her. And then he grabbed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-8.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM"}
