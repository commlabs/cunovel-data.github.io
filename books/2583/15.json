Watch for the wind as it comes toward you, look into the distance and see how the foliage moves. The wind is like a wave rolling in. If you want to hide in its sound and movement, then time your movement so that you are starting to move as the wind reaches you. Don’t chase the wind—let it push you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t chase the wind, thought Chong. That was exactly what he was hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he caught a whiff of something. At first he recoiled, thinking that it was the rotting stench of a zom, but he shook his head and took another sniff at the odor on the breeze. It was similar to the spoiled-meat smell of cadaverine or putrescence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds were louder now. Whoever was sneaking through the woods was coming his way. Panic jumped in Chong’s chest, but he fought it down. He looked around and studied the woods for a couple of good choices for escape routes if the stranger came directly toward him. The best route was to his right, a stony path shaded by chokeberry and bitterbrush shrubs. He edged toward it, ready to bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man suddenly emerged from the woods twenty feet in front of Chong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was facing the other way. Chong froze and stared at the stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd strange he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was short and broad-shouldered, with huge biceps like soccer balls, a freakishly overdeveloped chest, and almost no neck at all. He wore the same black clothes as the people on the motorbikes, with red streamers fluttering in the sluggish breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man started to turn, and Chong slipped soundlessly behind a bush, certain that he hadn’t been spotted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of angel wings had been carefully embroidered on the man’s shirt, and around his neck was a chunky steel chain from which hung a slender silver whistle. Chong recognized it at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dog whistle. Benny was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat drew Chong’s eye, though, and sent a thrill of icy fear through him, was the thing the man carried in his massive fists. A long, twisted wooden handle from which a wicked blade curved like the fang of some great dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scythe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong remembered the word Riot had used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReapers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth went totally dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big man stood listening to the forest, much as Chong had done. His face was harsh and grim, but then a small smile formed on his thin-lipped mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No sense hiding,” said the reaper as he brought the scythe up and made a slow, deliberate cut through the afternoon air. “Hiding will only make it hurt more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHE DRIFTED IN DARKNESS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lost Girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what people called her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years the travelers in the Ruin believed that she was a myth. Or a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the towns, she was a campfire tale. Something used to frighten children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a dozen versions of the Lost Girl story, and in each one of them she died. Sometimes the zoms got her. Sometimes it was crazed loners. Sometimes it was her own bleak despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lost Girl died, though, in every version of the legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Benny, Nix, and Tom brought her to Mountainside and she learned about those stories, she laughed. They were stupid stories. Silly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA teenage girl, living alone? With no one to protect her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, they all said. Couldn’t happen. She would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lost Girl. Dead according to everyone who spun a tale about her. It was impossible for a girl to survive out in the Ruin alone. Everyone knew that. There were too many dangers. Zoms and wild animals and bounty hunters. There were crazed loners and cannibals and a thousand different kinds of disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid stories, she told herself. Except at night, when she thought about them in the private darkness of her bedroom, in the one place where she was safe enough to be weak. That was when she cried. That was when she believed that she was living on borrowed time—alive only because death had considered her too insignificant to pause long enough to collect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that death collected everyone. Death is like that. Relentlessly efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorrowed time is no place to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilah had often feared that they were right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was sure they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the only thought that would fit into her head as she lay suspended in darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered the boar. Feral, massive. Four hundred pounds at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth dead and deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut animals can’t become zoms. It doesn’t work like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless, somehow, it does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lost Girl should not be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless, somehow, she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like she was falling and yet not falling. Pinpricks of pain held her aloft, and for a long time she could not understand that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle points of pain all along her body. Except for her hands, which hung down into the black well of nothingness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove her, she heard the grunt of the boar and the scuff of its hoof on the edge of the rocky shelf. Then dirt and loose stones tumbled down, striking her face and chest and stomach and thighs. She heard a rustling sound as the debris fell past her. It sounded like foliage, like pine boughs and vine leaves being pelted by rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced one eye to open. It was smeared with blood, and what little she saw was filtered through red. She blinked and blinked until tears ran pink from the corners of her eyes. Above her—thirty feet at least—the snout of the dead boar protruded over the edge of the stone shelf. That meant that . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic flared in her heart, and it brought with it a fresh burst of adrenaline, and with adrenaline came clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was suspended in a tangle of dense trees and tall shrubs, caught in the midst of her fall. Temporarily held, as if fate was waiting for her to wake up and pay attention as death made his call to collect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilah tried to move, to lift her arms, and suddenly the whole assembly of branches shifted with her. Pinecones rained down on her. Angry birds fled the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow far down was the ground? The cleft was so choked with foliage that she had not been able to see the bottom. It could be six feet below her. It could be sixty. She wished she knew how badly she was hurt. Or where.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all the tales, in every variation, the Lost Girl died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilah closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chong,” she said hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr, she meant to say “Chong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she said was, “Tom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBENNY AND NIX MADE IT TO THE WOODS WITH NO TIME TO SPARE. THE motor noise roared as loud as thunder as they dove beneath the canopy of leaves and pine needles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix led the way, and Benny was a half step behind her. He cut a quick look over his shoulder and saw something that made him grab Nix’s arm and jerk her to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look!” he said in an urgent whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crouched down behind a thick bush and stared with slack-jawed amazement at something neither of them had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen people came tearing into the clearing, all of them dressed in black clothes tied with red streamers, all of them heavily armed . . . and each of them on four-wheeled motorized vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” breathed Nix, gripping Benny’s arm. “What—what—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe machines were not cars or trucks, and not quite motorcycles, either. Benny fished for the name and scraped up the initials ATV. He thought they stood for “all-terrain vehicle,” and that was probably right, because these machines roared easily over the uneven surface of the field. They each had four fat rubber tires and a kind of saddle for the driver. The machines were spattered with mud, but some colored metal shone through. Different colors for each—blue and green and other shades. A basket or duffel bag was lashed to the back of each, and the handles of swords and axes sprouted from many. The roar of the machines was unnaturally loud—and even in that moment of tension, it struck Benny how quiet his world was and how loud the old world of machines must have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe presence of these machines was like a punch to the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we seeing this?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she said in a fierce tone. She turned to him, her eyes alight. “First the jet and now this. Benny—the old world isn’t dead. Everything wasn’t destroyed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny nodded, but he studied the figures on the machines and didn’t like what he was seeing. He remembered the word Riot had used. Quads. This had to be what she was referring to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quads zoomed across the field and circled the big bristlecone tree. One rider stopped and dismounted, studying the ground. Looking for footprints, Benny realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nix,” he said, indicating the man who had dismounted, “look at them, look at his chest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked where he was pointing, and her mouth turned down into a frown of doubt. On the center of the man’s black shirt were angel wings, neatly embroidered in white thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angels with wings on their chests,” Nix murmured as she dumped the spent shells from her pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angels came and set fire to the trees,” Benny added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-oh,” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, much as I’d love to find out about those machines and where these people come from, somehow I don’t think now is the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she agreed. She checked all her pockets for bullets and found only two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it?” Benny asked, a note of panic in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The rest are in my backpack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thumbed the two shells into the gun and closed the cylinder. They both looked at the pistol for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hope we don’t need more than two shots,” said Benny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No kidding.” As she holstered the pistol, she glanced back the way they’d come, indecision stamped on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look,” Benny said, “Carter and those other people said they saw the jet. If we circle around to find Chong, we’ll probably find them. Even with everything that just happened on the field, I’d still rather talk to Eve’s folks than . . . these guys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Nix brushed a tangle of red hair away from her face. “Damn it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rose silently and moved deeper into the forest, going as fast as caution would allow and sticking to paths that were heavy with fallen branches or uneven ground. Benny did not believe that “all-terrain” could possibly mean that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith minds full of questions and hearts heavy with regrets, they fled from the angels and their impossible machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFROM NIX’S JOURNAL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom taught us that you can’t prepare for every emergency or every threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The trick isn’t to practice too many specific danger scenarios, but to learn the skills that are common to all. A smart warrior is always observant, always aware of his surroundings, always aware of his resources, and always ready to adapt to situations as they change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“NIX,” PUFFED BENNY AS HE SLOWED TO A WALK, “MAYBE WE’RE DOING this wrong. Maybe we should go back and try to talk to those people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face. “Really? That’s your plan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or is that what you think Tom would do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now wait a minute—” he began, but she shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she snapped, “don’t you have a clue as to how you’re behaving lately? You keep telling me and the others to back off so you can handle things. You were going to charge those lions and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does that have to do with Tom?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peered up at him, her green eyes surrounded by a sea of freckles and wild red curls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look,” she said, “I know you think that because you have Tom’s sword, you have to be the great warrior, but here’s a news flash, Benny: You’re not Tom. The sword doesn’t give you superpowers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny felt his face grow hot. “I never said—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed back toward the field. “You think Tom would have just waltzed in there and sorted this out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know he would. This is the sort of thing he was good at.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, he wasn’t,” snapped Nix. “He was never out this far. He doesn’t know these people. We stepped into the middle of something big and nasty that doesn’t concern us. It wouldn’t have concerned Tom, either. He’d have steered us around this and left these people to sort out their own troubles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny seethed for a moment before he tried to speak. “Tom would never have walked away from that little girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix’s eyes were as hard and cold as green glass. “Tom brought us out here to find that jet, not to solve the problems of everyone in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So . . . what? Are you saying we should just walk away from Eve?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s with her parents,” she said, “and here’s another news flash: Eve’s parents tried to kill us back there. I’m going out on a limb here, but I pretty much think that means they don’t want our help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because they were looking for her and were probably scared out of their minds, Nix.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doesn’t change anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And they thought we were reapers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix cocked her head to one side. “It’s that bald girl, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to go back and talk to that bald girl with the slingshot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, for—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreams tore through the air behind them. A male voice, but high and filled with terrible pain. The sound was cut off in a way that suggested the worst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was filled with screams and the roar of quad engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chong—?” Benny gasped. “We have to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that’s not Chong,” Nix said with a firm shake of her head. “Chong made it to the woods before we did. I never saw him run that fast before. He’ll be okay.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/flesh-and-bone-benny-imura-3/page-15.html","bookId":2583,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:35 PM"}
