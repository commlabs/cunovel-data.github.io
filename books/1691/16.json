{"id":64448,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u003cp\u003eSimon checked his depth gauge: the arrow lay just a hair to the far side of the 130 mark. Even at this depth he was comfortable in a 1.5-mm dive skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around. The light level was decent, typical for this depth, though the true colors of the fish and coral were washed out. Sunlight\u0027s spectrum got pretty well bleached out after struggling through 130 feet of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d hoped he\u0027d be diving the cavern through the bore hole, much like descending the limestone cenotes in the waters of the Yucatan, but the hole was too small and there was no hope of widening it any further. So he went hunting for the natural entrance to the cavern. He found it, a dark, narrow, anemone-fringed opening in the wall of a rift in the continental shelf. The wall was encrusted with sponges, guzzling the fringe of the Guyana Current as it swept nutrients up from Venezuela\u0027s Orinoco River.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon also found the missing diver, Abdul. A rock the size of a Porsche Boxster - loosened by the drilling, perhaps? - had slipped from the wall above the opening and crushed him. The crabs and yellowtails had been snacking on his exposed flesh, but his mask was still fastened around his head, sparing his wide-open, milky eyes. Their empty gaze brought back a few lines he\u0027d just read inThe Tempest :\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFull fathom five thy father lies;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf his bones are coral made;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose are pearls that were his eyes....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon shuddered and looked away. A sight like that could make you believe in the Obeahman. Empty sockets would have been better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone had also partially blocked the mouth of the entrance. The opening that remained might admit a child but never an adult, especially one of Simon\u0027s girth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich meant the stone had to be moved. And since the local labor pool consisted of himself and one curious green sea turtle, that meant it was up to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a thorough inspection, he found a spot where he could wedge himself between the rock and the rift wall. It meant disturbing some sponges and dislodging some of the smaller clinging sea life, something Simon loathed doing. The Caribbean reefs took enough abuse without his adding to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith knees bent almost to his chest, his flippers against the rock and his back against the wall, he took a deep breath and kicked out with everything he had. After half a minute of straining, he felt the rock move. Heartened, he found a little extra strength and increased his effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, moving a fraction of an inch at a time, the rock began to tilt away from him. Simon squeezed shut his eyes and, shouting into his regulator\u0027s mouthpiece, pushed even harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he stopped, gasping as a crushing weight slammed against his chest. He opened his eyes and wouldn\u0027t have been surprised to find that the rock had fallen back on him, pinning him to the wall. But no, the rock was falling away, tumbling end over end in slow motion toward the floor of the rift. The pain was coming from his heart. He could feel that battered old pump pounding out an irregular beat, thudding in his ears as his vision wavered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowed his lungs, taking deep, measured breaths, hoping his heart would follow suit, and cursing himself for being so careless as to have left behind his backup nitros, the fast-acting sublingual tablets for when his angina broke through the extended-release pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he prayed for the pain to ease, proving this wasn\u0027t the Big One, motion to his left caught his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbdul, free of the entrapping rock, was pulling away from the wall and gliding toward Simon. His face came closer, his dead wide eyes staring into Simon\u0027s as if to say,Join me...Join me ....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his face close enough to kiss, Abdul turned away. His bloated body began a slow ascent, belly first, arms and legs dangling behind, returning at last to the world of air and light it had departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as slowly, the crushing weight lifted from Simon\u0027s chest. His heart slowed. Just angina. A bad attack, but the 40 percent oxygen in his tanks had helped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed away from the wall and stared at the now wide-open passage into the cavern. No way. Not today. He didn\u0027t have the strength. He\u0027d make up an excuse for Frikkie, tell him about the stone, tell him he\u0027d used up too much daylight moving it, tell him he\u0027d finish the job tomorrow under the high morning sun, tell him anything except the truth about his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that his health would prompt Frik even to consider calling off the dive.A shark bit off your left leg? So? The right one still works. Get back down there and find me that fifth piece!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it was no one else\u0027s business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow. Tomorrow he\u0027d find Frik\u0027s damn doodad with no problems, no complications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now what he needed was a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeak, tired, and perhaps even a little depressed, Simon shot a bolus of air into his vest and began a controlled ascent. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-16.html","bookId":1691,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM"}
