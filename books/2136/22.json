The bottom corner of the phone\u0027s screen was already cracked from my last conversation with Danny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember,\" she said. \"He\u0027s a total pig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that,\" I said, getting up, \"is why I keep you around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep me around?\" said Allison, grabbing her plate of unfinished eggs and hurrying after me. \"Maybe it\u0027s the other way around. Maybe I keep you around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said, and picked up my pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the French door that led from the balcony into the magnificent kitchen. I looked back at her. \"We\u0027re looking for a killer, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think we found him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I said. \"Maybe not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got some investigator stuff to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what am I supposed to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI motioned to the others who were still sitting outside on the deck, enjoying what was, I suspected, rare sunshine. Indeed, storm clouds were already gathering on the far horizon. And if I wasn\u0027t mistaken, they looked even nastier than the ones from yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what you do best,\" I said. \"Talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gee, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mingle.

She pouted a moment or two, then stuck out her tongue and headed back out onto the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused in the kitchen, closed my eyes, and mentally searched the home again. I saw everyone, even Edwin asleep on his cot in the basement. One person was still noticeably absent: Tara. Perhaps she was out of my range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I zeroed in on the one person I was looking for, and headed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeeper into the massive home.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-22.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
