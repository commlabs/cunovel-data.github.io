I\u0027ve been working at Merlotte\u0027s Bar for four years now. For the first three, things were quiet. Then, one night, Bill the Vampire walked in, and my life changed forever. While we\u0027ve followed the familiar pattern (vampire meets girl, vampire gets girl, vampire loses girl), I have a feeling our association has more twists and turns yet to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first month I knew Bill, there was a serial killer in the area hunting down barmaids with vampire boyfriends - and the main suspect was my brother Jason (Dead Until Dark).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, at the beginning of fall, the vampires of Dallas asked the vampires of Shreveport if they could borrow me for a little investigation into a missing nestmate of theirs (Living Dead in Dallas). At the same time, the short-order cook at Merlotte\u0027s was murdered, and since I counted myself his friend, I felt I should do everything I could to solve the mystery of his death. Bill\u0027s boss, Eric, had a lot to do with my trip to Big D, and he developed an interest in me that hasn\u0027t flagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight before Christmas, I began to think Bill was engaged in some hanky-panky. He left town, and vanished in Mississippi. Eric talked me into going to Jackson to search for him. As my cover, I was escorted by the Werewolf Alcide Herveaux. While searching for Bill, I met some of the state\u0027s less reputable citizens at the supernatural hangout in Jackson, called Club Dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brings me up to the start of Dead to the World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now that I\u0027m pretty much mad at everyone, and Jason might be a Shifter at the next full moon, what\u0027s going to happen next?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way my life\u0027s been going since Bill Compton came into Merlotte\u0027s, there just no telling. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4/page-17.html","bookId":2194,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:56:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:56:18 PM"}
