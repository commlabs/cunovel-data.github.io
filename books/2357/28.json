The snows of February gave way to the brisk winds of March, and Jennifer knew that it was time to stop working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called a meeting of the office staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking a leave of absence,\" Jennifer announced. \"I\u0027ll be gone for the next five months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were murmurs of surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan Martin asked, \"We\u0027ll be able to reach you, won\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Dan. I\u0027ll be out of touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed Harris peered at her through his thick spectacles. \"Jennifer, you can\u0027t just - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be leaving at the end of this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a finality in her tone that brooked no further questions. The rest of the meeting was taken up with a discussion of pending cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen everyone else had left, Ken Bailey asked, \"Have you really thought this thing through?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no choice, Ken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her. \"I don\u0027t know who the son of a bitch is, but I hate him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer put her hand on his arm. \"Thank you. I\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to get rough, you know. Kids grow up. They ask questions. He\u0027ll want to know who his father is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" His tone softened. \"If there\u0027s anything I can do - anything - I\u0027ll always be around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her arms around him. \"Thank you, Ken. I - thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer stayed in her office long after everyone else had left, sitting alone in the dark, thinking. She would always love Adam. Nothing could ever change that, and she was sure that he still loved her. Somehow, Jennifer thought, it would be easier if he did not. It was an unbearable irony that they loved each other and could not be together, that their lives were going to move farther and farther apart. Adam\u0027s life would be in Washington now with Mary Beth and their child. Perhaps one day Adam would be in the White House. Jennifer thought of her own son growing up, wanting to know who his father was. She could never tell him, nor must Adam ever know that she had borne him a child, for it would destroy him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if anyone else ever learned about it, it would destroy Adam in a different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had decided to buy a house in the country, somewhere outside of Manhattan, where she and her son could live together in their own little world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found the house by sheer accident. She had been on her way to see a client on Long Island and had turned off the Long Island Expressway at Exit 36, then had taken a wrong turn and found herself in Sands Point. The streets were quiet and shaded with tall, graceful trees, and the houses were set back from the road, each in its private little domain. There was a For Sale sign in front of a white colonial house on Sands Point Road. The grounds were fenced in and there was a lovely wrought-iron gate in front of a sweeping driveway, with lamp posts lighting the way, and a large front lawn with a row of yews sheltering the house. From the outside it looked enchanting. Jennifer wrote down the name of the realtor and made an appointment to see the house the following afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real estate agent was a hearty, high-pressure type, the kind of salesman Jennifer hated. But she was not buying his personality, she was buying a house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was saying, \"It\u0027s a real beauty. Yessir, a real beauty. About a hundred years old. It\u0027s in tip-top condition. Absolutely tip-top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTip-top was certainly an exaggeration. The rooms were airy and spacious, but in need of repair. It would be fun, Jennifer thought, to fix up this house and decorate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs, across from the master suite, was a room that could be converted into a nursery. She would do it in blue and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like to walk around the grounds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the tree house that decided Jennifer. It was built on a platform high up in a sturdy oak tree. Her son\u0027s tree house. There were three acres, with the back lawn gently sloping down to the sound, where there was a dock. It would be a wonderful place for her son to grow up in, with plenty of room for him to run around. Later, he would have a small boat. There would be all the privacy here that they would need, for Jennifer was determined that this was going to be a world that belonged only to her and her child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bought the house the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had had no idea how painful it would be to leave the Manhattan apartment she and Adam had shared. His bathrobe and pajamas were still there, and his slippers and shaving kit. Every room held hundreds of memories of Adam, memories of a lovely, dead past. Jennifer packed her things as quickly as possible and got out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the new house, Jennifer kept herself busy from early morning until late at night, so that there would be no time to think about Adam. She went into the shops in Sands Point and Port Washington to order furniture and drapes. She bought Porthault linens, and silver and china. She hired local workmen to come in and repair the faulty plumbing and leaky roof and worn-out electrical equipment. From early morning until dusk, the house was filled with painters, carpenters, electricians and wallpaper hangers. Jennifer was everywhere, supervising everything. She wore herself out during the day, hoping she would be able to sleep at night, but the demons had returned, torturing her with unspeakable nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe haunted antique shops, buying lamps and tables and objets d\u0027art. She bought a fountain and statues for the garden, a Lipschitz, a Noguchi and a Miro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the house, everything was beginning to look beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob Clement was a California client of Jennifer\u0027s and the area rugs he had designed for the living room and the nursery made the rooms glow with subdued color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s abdomen was getting bigger, and she went into the village to buy maternity clothes. She had an unlisted telephone installed. It was there only for emergencies, and she gave no one the telephone number and expected no calls. The only person in the office who knew where she lived was Ken Bailey, and he was sworn to secrecy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove out to see Jennifer one afternoon, and she showed him around the house and grounds and took enormous pleasure in his delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s beautiful, Jennifer. Really beautiful. You\u0027ve done a hell of a job.\" He looked at her swollen abdomen. \"How long is it going to be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another two months.\" She put his hand against her belly and said, \"Feel this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a kick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s getting stronger every day,\" Jennifer said proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cooked dinner for Ken. He waited until they were having dessert before he brought up the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to pry,\" he said, \"but shouldn\u0027t whoever the proud papa is be doing something - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Subject closed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Sorry. The office misses you like hell. We have a new client who - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer held up a hand. \"I don\u0027t want to hear about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked until it was time for Ken to leave, and Jennifer hated to see him go. He was a dear man and a good friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer shut herself off from the world in every possible way. She stopped reading the newspapers and would not watch television or listen to the radio. Her universe was here within these four walls. This was her nest, her womb, the place where she was going to bring her son into the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read every book she could get her hands on about raising children, from Dr. Spock to Ames and Gesell and back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jennifer finished decorating the nursery, she filled it with toys. She visited a sporting goods shop and looked at footballs and baseball bats and a catcher\u0027s mitt. And she laughed at herself. This is ridiculous. He hasn\u0027t even been born yet. And she bought the baseball bat and the catcher\u0027s mitt The football tempted her, but she thought, That can wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was May, and then June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe workmen finished and the house became quiet and serene. Twice a week Jennifer would drive into the village and shop at the supermarket, and every two weeks she would visit Dr. Harvey, her obstetrician. Jennifer obediently drank more milk than she wanted, took vitamins and ate all the proper, healthy foods. She was getting large now and clumsy, and it was becoming difficult for her to move about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had always been active, and she had thought she would loathe getting heavy and awkward, having to move slowly; but somehow, she did not mind it. There was no reason to hurry anymore. The days became long and dreamy and peaceful. Some diurnal clock within her had slowed its tempo. It was as though she were reserving her energy, pouring it into the other body living inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning, Dr. Harvey examined her and said, \"Another two weeks, Mrs. Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so close now. Jennifer had thought she might be afraid. She had heard all the old wives\u0027 tales of the pain, the accidents, the malformed babies, but she felt no fear, only a longing to see her child, an impatience to get his birth over with so she could hold him in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey drove out to the house almost every day now, bringing with him The Little Engine That Could, Little Red Hen, Pat the Bunny, and a dozen Dr. Seuss books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll love these,\" Ken said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jennifer smiled, because he had said \"he.\" An omen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey strolled through the grounds and had a picnic lunch at the water\u0027s edge and sat in the sun. Jennifer was self-conscious about her looks. She thought, Why would he want to waste his time with the ugly fat lady from the circus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Ken was looking at Jennifer and thinking: She\u0027s the most beautiful woman I\u0027ve ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first pains came at three o\u0027clock in the morning. They were so sharp that Jennifer was left breathless. A few moments later they were repeated and Jennifer thought exultantly, It\u0027s happening!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to count the time between the pains, and when they were ten minutes apart she telephoned her obstetrician. Jennifer drove to the hospital, pulling over to the side of the road every time a contraction came. An attendant was standing outside waiting for her when she arrived, and a few minutes later Dr. Harvey was examining her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he finished, he said reassuringly, \"Well, this is going to be an easy delivery, Mrs. Parker. Just relax and we\u0027ll let nature take its course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not easy, but neither was it unbearable. Jennifer could stand the pain because out of it something wonderful was happening. She was in labor for almost eight hours, and at the end of that time, when her body was wracked and contorted with spasms and she thought that it was never going to stop, she felt a quick easing and then a rushing emptiness, and a sudden blessed peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a thin squeal and Dr. Harvey was holding up her baby, saying, \"Would you like to take a look at your son, Mrs. Parker?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s smile lit the room. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-28.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:27:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:27:16 PM"}
