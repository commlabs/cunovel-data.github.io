Just how long do all of those souls plan on hiding in there, Ben Adaephon Delat?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard eyed him, and, predictably, said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull Sengar stood at the very edge of the fire’s light, beyond the gathered Imass. The women’s song had sunk into a series of sounds that a mother might make to her babe, soft sounds of comfort, and Onrack had explained how this Eres’al song was in fact a kind of traverse, back into the roots of language, beginning with the bizarre yet clearly complex adult Eres language with its odd clicks and stops and all the gestures that provided punctuation, then working backward and growing ever more simplified even as it became more musical. The effect was eerie and strangely disturbing to the Tiste Edur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic and song among his people was a static thing, fixated within ritual. If the ancient tales were true, there had once been a plethora of instruments in use among the Tiste Edur, but most of diese were now unknown, beyond the names given them. Voice now stood in their stead and Trull began to sense that, perhaps, something had been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gestures among the women had transformed into dance, sinuous and swaying and now, suddenly, sexual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low voice beside him said, ‘Before the child, there is passion.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull glanced over and was surprised to see one of the T’lan, the clan chief, Hostille Rator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn array of calcified bones were knotted in the filthy long hair dangling from the warrior’s mottled, scarred pate. His brow ridge dominated the entire face, burying the eyes in darkness. Even clothed in the flesh of life, Hostille Rator seemed deathly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Passion begets the child, Tiste Edur. Do you see?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull nodded. ‘Yes. I think so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So it was, long ago, at the Ritual.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The child, alas,’ the clan chief continued, ‘grows up. And what was once passion is now…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHostille Rator resumed. ‘There was a Bonecaster here, among these clans. She saw, clearly, the illusion of this realm. And saw, too, that it was dying. She sought to halt the bleeding away, by sacrificing herself. But she is failing-her spirit and her will, they are failing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull frowned at Hostille Rator. ‘How did you come to know of this place?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She gave voice to her pain, her anguish.’ The T’lan was silent a moment, then he added, ‘It was our intention to answer the call of the Gathering-but the need in her voice was undeniable. We could not turn aside, even when what we surrendered was-possibly-our final rest.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So now you are here, Hostille Rator. Onrack believes you would usurp Ulshun Pral, but for Rud Elalle’s presence-the threat he poses you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glitter from the darkness beneath those brow ridges. ‘You do not even whisper these things, Edur. Would you see weapons drawn this night, even after the gift of the First Song?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. Yet, perhaps, better now than later.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull now saw that the two T’lan Bonecasters had moved up behind Hostille Rator. The singing from the women had ceased-had it been an abrupt end? Trull could not recall. In any case, it was clear that all those present were now listening to this conversation. He saw Onrack emerge from the crowd, saw his friend’s stone sword gripped in both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull addressed Hostille Rator once more, his tone even and calm. ‘You three have stood witness to all that you once were-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It will not survive,’ the clan chief cut in. ‘How can we embrace this illusion when, upon its fading, we must return to what we truly are?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the crowd Rud Elalle spoke, ‘No harm shall befall my people-not by your hand, Hostille Rator, nor that of your Bonecasters. Nor,’ he added, ‘that of those who are coming here. I intend to lead the clans away-to safety.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There is no safety,’ Hostille Rator said. ‘This realm dies, and so too will all that is within it. And there can be no escape. Rud Elalle, without this realm, your clans do not even exist.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnrack said, ‘I am T’lan, like you. Feel the flesh that now clothes you. The muscle, the heat of blood. Feel the breath in your lungs, Hostille Rator. I have looked into your eyes-each of you three-and I see what no doubt resides in mine. The wonder. The remembering.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We cannot permit it,’ said the Bonecaster named Til’aras Benok. ‘For when we leave this place, Onrack…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes,’ Trull’s friend whispered. ‘It will be… too much. To bear.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There was passion once,’ Hostille Rator said. ‘For us. It can never return. We are children no longer.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-374.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
