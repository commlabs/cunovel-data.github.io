She glanced around, hoping to find a place to hide. If she ducked behind the bushes beside the gates, she might be able to sneak through, unnoticed, when he returned, yet even as the thought crossed her mind, she knew it wouldn\u0027t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling pressure on her bladder, she glanced around the yard, wondering where the privy was. She didn\u0027t remember seeing one in the backyard, but surely in such a house as grand as this, some provision had been made! Putting Morgana down, she circled the house a second time until, unable to hold it any longer, she went behind a bush. Morgana followed, staring at her through wide yellow eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting her clothes to rights again, Brenna picked up the cat and made her way back to the front of the house. When she put Morgana down, the cat immediately ran off into the shadows, no doubt in search of prey. She was a fearless hunter, and the bane of the birds, mice, and rabbits back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morgana, come back here! Morgana!\" Brenna started after the cat and then, with a shrug, she went inside, leaving the front door open a little so the cat could get in when she was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith nothing else to do, Brenna explored the rooms on the first floor of the house. The place was like nothing she had ever seen before, and not just because it was such a large house, but because of all the strange things it held, things for which she had no name. Things she was reluctant to touch for fear Roshan might return and be angry at finding her wandering through his grand manor. Of course, if he didn\u0027t want her poking around, he shouldn\u0027t have brought her here in the first place, or left her to fend for herself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne room had numerous cupboards. There was a small round table and two chairs. It must be the kitchen, she thought, though it looked like no kitchen she had ever seen before. Feeling as though she was snooping, which she supposed she was, she opened the cupboards. All were bare. Perhaps, in this strange new world, people kept their food somewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peeked into several other rooms— a parlor, a library with bookshelves that lined three walls from floor to ceiling, a room that was empty save for more bookshelves. He had more books than she had ever dreamed existed. She wondered why he had so many. Surely he could not have read them all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she came upon the room she had seen in her scrying mirror. There, on a large desk, was the peculiar square window where she had seen her image. Only the window was black now. Was he a wizard, then? Did the strange dark glass act the same way as her scrying mirror? Moving closer, she peered at it intently, but she felt no power radiating from it, no whisper of magical energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking her way up the stairs, she moved from room to room. She assumed they were bedchambers, though it was hard to say since all were empty of anything except more floor-to-ceiling bookcases and large comfortable chairs. The only furnished bedroom was the one that was his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo. She had nowhere to go and no place to hide. No weapons with which to fight him save her magick. And that, she knew, would not be strong enough. How could she fight him if she couldn\u0027t even remove something as simple as a spell on a gate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning to his room, she turned the key in the lock, then climbed into the bed, fully clothed except for her shoes. She drew the covers up to her chin and closed her eyes, but as soon as she did so, her mind filled with images of men with torches surrounding her. Men from families she had known all her life. Their faces looked grotesque in the light cast by their torches as they set fire to the kindling at her feet. The smoke stung her nostrils. The flames licked her skin. If Roshan hadn\u0027t arrived when he had, she would have died in the flames…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes and the images faded from her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still awake when he returned to the house. Though she heard no sound, she knew the moment he entered the dwelling. Sitting up in the bed— his bed— she stared at the door. The door that she had locked against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door that now swung open, revealing Roshan standing in the corridor. He loomed in the doorway, a tall dark shape swathed in a long black cloak that fell to his ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClutching the blankets to her chest, she cringed against the headboard as he walked into the room. There was a ruddy glow to his skin that had not been there before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so,\" he said quietly. \"You are still here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at him. \"I would not be here if you had not locked the gate against me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe regarded her for a long moment. His steady gaze made her uncomfortable but she refused to look away. Silently defiant, she squared her shoulders and lifted her chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, his expression clearly telling her that he knew she was afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go home,\" she said. \"Back to my own time.\" It annoyed her that she sounded like a little girl frightened of the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that right? Anxious to go back to the stake, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered at the memory she had been visualizing only moments earlier. \"Of course not. I shall go somewhere else, to another town, someplace where no one knows who I am.\" She didn\u0027t want to stay here, where everything was strange. Didn\u0027t want to stay here, with him. He frightened her in ways she did not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recoiled when he sat down on the foot of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, stop that,\" he said irritably. \"I\u0027m not going to hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not believe you. Why did you seek me out? Why did you bring me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I want you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA maiden she might be, but she recognized the heat in his eyes, the longing in his voice. Ah, his voice, as dark as midnight, as deep as eternity. It reminded her of Granny O\u0027Connell\u0027s homemade whiskey, warming her from the inside out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saved my life,\" he said in that same whiskey smooth voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words startled her so that, for a moment, she forgot to be afraid. \"How did I do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was on the verge of ending my existence,\" he said. \"I felt I had nothing to live for, no reason to go on. And then I saw your picture… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that book you told me about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, thinking he would have to find that book and see what it said about Brenna now. \"I saw your picture and I wanted to know more about you. Learning about you gave me something to look forward to when I rose. And then I began to wonder if there wasn\u0027t a way for me to find you. I read dozens of books about traveling through time. I wondered if it was possible and then I decided to try it.\" He shook his head. \"I wasn\u0027t really sure it would work, but I pictured you in my mind and\"—he shrugged— \"suddenly I was in that field watching you dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a rush of warmth flood her cheeks. He had seen her dancing under the full moon, naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh!\" She blushed hotter as she remembered the words she had been chanting at the time. Light of night, hear my song, bring to me my love, ere long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had dreamed of this man, had been thinking of him that night as she cast her spell. Bring to me my love, ere long. Oh, my. Was it possible that her spell had conjured him, that he was, indeed, her true love?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. It couldn\u0027t be, yet how else to explain it? Somehow, across time and space, her magick had connected with his to bring the two of them together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" she asked, her voice little more than a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoshan leaned toward Brenna, his gaze holding hers. It was a question she had asked several times before, one he had refused to answer. \"Do you really want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, her hands clutching the covers so tightly her knuckles were white. He could hear the rapid beat of her heart, smell her fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath. No mortal who had learned his secret had ever lived long enough to tell the tale to another. Dare he trust her? He considered it a moment longer and then said, matter-of-factly, \"I\u0027m a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, all the color draining from her face. \"Granny O\u0027Connell was right,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right about what\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything. She was a witch. It was she who taught me my craft. When I was very little, she told me fairy tales. And when I said there were no such things as werewolves or trolls, she told me that if there could be witches, there could be elves and fairies and all manner of fey folk, as well. I guess she was right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to…?\" She lifted a trembling hand to her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed the movement of her hand, felt his hunger quicken at the sight of the pulse throbbing in the hollow of her throat. \"I don\u0027t know.\" He lifted one brow. \"Would you mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a foolish question. Her eyes widened, and although he would have said it was impossible, she recoiled from him still farther, her back pressed tight against the headboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna, listen to me. I won\u0027t hurt you. I won\u0027t do anything you don\u0027t want me to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He grinned. \"And now you\u0027re wondering if you can trust the word of a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, her deep green eyes filled with doubt and suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"If I wanted to kill you, why would I have bothered to save you from the flames? Or brought you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A midnight meal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her a moment, and then he laughed, genuinely amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fine idea,\" he agreed, \"but as I said, I won\u0027t do anything you don\u0027t want me to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considered that for several moments. Some of the fear faded from her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I prove it to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna shook her head vigorously. \"I will take your word for it. How long have you been a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hundred and eighty-six years.\" It was not a vast age, for a vampire. He knew of others who were far older. Still, compared to the few years of a mortal life span, it was a great age indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did it happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned faintly at the memory. \"A woman, of course. She was beautiful and beguiling, and I was ripe for the taking.\" He had still been mourning the death of his wife and child at the time. Even though three years had passed since Atiyana had died delivering their son, he had mourned her as if she had been dead for three days instead of three years. But he was still a man, with a man\u0027s needs and a man\u0027s desires. \"She seduced me late one night and then, before I knew what was happening, she worked the Dark Trick and when I woke the next night, I was a newly made vampire.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-kiss-children-of-the-night-1/page-9.html","bookId":2299,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:50 PM"}
