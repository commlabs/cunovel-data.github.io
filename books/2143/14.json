{"id":96015,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"I have a treat for you girls,\" my mom said as Becky and I climbed into her SUV the afternoon of prom. \"I scheduled two appointments for manicures for your big night tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yay!\" we both cried out in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you so much, Mrs. Madison,\" Becky gushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindi\u0027s, an ultra-swank conservative salon, with its signature bright black-and-white-striped awning, was located in Dullsville\u0027s main square, between Fancy Schmancy Gifts and Linda\u0027s Lingerie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we can go there, too,\" I whispered to a blushing Becky when we got out of the SUV, referring to the sexy intimate clothing store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I followed my mother into Mindi\u0027s chichi salon. The stylists were clad in crisp white tops and black rayon pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chairs were filled with Dullsville High prom-goers getting makeovers, haircuts, and pedicures. All heads-- being cut, blow- dried, and colored--turned toward me as if I (clad in tight black zippered shorts, black tights, Frankenstein boots, and a Gothique T- shirt) wasn\u0027t worthy of entering the salon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pick out your polish,\" my mother instructed, pointing Becky and me to a Lucite shelf hanging on the wall next to the hair section. A ton of products lined the white wooden shelves--snazzy accessories in a rainbow of colors and fabrics, combs (skinny and wide-toothed), and brushes (round, flat, and lamb\u0027s-bristled). Dozens of shampoos and conditioners for every type of hair-- frizzy, curly, straight, dry, oily, thick, and thin--were also displayed. I was amazed at what a bottle filled with soap and a few vitamins and minerals claimed to do. For the prices Mindi\u0027s was asking, I\u0027d think they were filled with champagne. Becky and I perused the nail polish selection while my mother checked us in. The shelves were filled with a spectrum of colors from pink to purple, red to clear. Becky quickly chose a bottle of Pink Persuasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scanned the polishes. Nothing resembled black, not even a deep purple or brown among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother joined us, buzzing like it was my wedding day. She was exhilarated, caught up in the prom spirit as if she were going herself. Since I had been an outcast for so long, she herself had never been included in the high school\u0027s events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what have you decided on, girls?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Becky picked a beautiful pink,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy best friend proudly showed my mother her selection of a pretty pastel nail color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lovely choice, Becky. Raven, what have you picked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re ready for you,\" a pixie-like girl with spiky short red hair said, her white shirt stretched tightly around her pregnant belly. \"I\u0027m Cami.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pick you up in half an hour,\" my mom said. \"Remember, when the girls have finished, don\u0027t touch anything! You don\u0027t want to smear your manicure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCami led Becky and me past a dozen hairstylists\u0027 chairs to the nail room or what I\u0027d call a vampire\u0027s nightmare. The walls were made of mirrors, and bright fluorescent lights filled the ten-by-ten- foot room. Alexander wouldn\u0027t last two seconds in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half-dozen white manicure tables--each with a black desk lamp, white hand towels, and pastel polishes-- faced the mirrored walls. A few pedicure bowls were sitting on the floor, all occupied by the feet of adolescent fashionistas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny Warren and her Prada shoe-snob friend, Heather Ryan, sat underneath foils with one foot in a spa bath and the other resting on a pedicurist\u0027s lap, their flawless model\u0027s toes being primped for their walk down Prom Princess Road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCami showed Becky to her seat, then directed me to the vacant chair next to hers. As I settled in, a middle-aged veteran manicurist nodded to me as she stood over her client, whose hands were drying underneath a heating lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I watched as Cami started removing Becky\u0027s nail polish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be Raven,\" my manicurist said, placing a plastic finger bowl filled with sudsy water on her table. \"I\u0027m Jean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to meet you,\" I responded with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over at Becky, who was engaged in conversation with Cami as if they\u0027d been friends for years. Cami looked like she\u0027d just graduated from beauty school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy manicurist, however, with her crazy colored bifocals, resembled my grandmother. Her own thick nails weren\u0027t painted and looked weathered. Who could blame her? By the end of the day, she was probably too exhausted to decorate her own nails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What color have you picked?\" she asked, looking at me above her bifocals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...I haven\u0027t decided yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean began removing my black polish with a cotton ball. It took her a few minutes to get it out of the nooks, the dark color imbedded in my nails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother said your dress was a dark red.\" \"Yes,\" I said, our conversation stilted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean opened her drawer and pulled out a bottle of red nail polish. \"How about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I prefer something darker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean placed my hands in the finger bowl filled with warm, bubbly water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This color is very popular.\" She held out a bottle of metallic pink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking of black.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about something more feminine,\" she said, ignoring my request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel Becky slink down in her chair next to me. Becky and Cami continued to talk but kept eyeballing Jean and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean rose and went to the front desk. In a moment, she returned with a few bottles of reds and pinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d want to look like Cinderella, not Frankenstein,\" she quipped, placing the colors on her manicure table and sitting down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d really like black.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we don\u0027t carry black,\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. I brought a bottle with me.\" I reached for my purse, accidentally dripping water on her desk as I lifted my hand out of the bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny and Heather giggled at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" Jean grumbled. \"Allow me.\" Jean mopped up my spills with a hand towel and threw it into a small white wicker laundry basket underneath her desk. She picked up my Corpse Bride purse, examined it as if it might bite her, then pulled out a half-filled bottle of Morbid Mayhem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean placed my polish on her desk as if she were holding a bottle of poison. She squeezed eucalyptus-scented lotion on my hand and vigorously massaged it into my skin. She filed, smoothed, and pushed back my cuticles and reluctantly began to paint my nails a morbid black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who are you going to prom with?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would I know him--or his family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t go to our school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he from out of town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s homeschooled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s interesting...What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was more like an inquisition than a manicure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander Sterling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the Sterlings on Benson Hill?\" she asked, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard about them. They moved into the Mansion a while ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His parents are never around. I was hoping his mother might come into the salon.\" \"They travel a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. And what is your boyfriend like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a lot like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wears black nail polish?\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes,\" I said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beginning to take a liking to ol\u0027 Jean, and I think she was warming a bit to me. Not only was she flip and sarcastic like me, but I had something she wanted--firsthand knowledge of new townsfolk I\u0027m sure had been gossiped about in her salon since the day the Munster-like family inhabited the Mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky rose and sat with her hands underneath the dryers, leaving me alone in the corner with Jean as she applied a clear top coat to my nails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a client come in yesterday to get a French manicure,\" she whispered. \"She said she met your boyfriend at a restaurant. She was spreading all sorts of gossip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean Mrs. Mitchell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to spread things around,\" she said seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my black lip to keep myself from laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After meeting you,\" she continued, \"I can\u0027t believe the talk of the town. You are such a dear, and I imagine your boyfriend has to be a gentleman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at Jean. \"She calls us vampires behind our backs just because we wear dark clothes and nail polish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She really needs to get a job, that woman.\" \"Well, I have to be honest, I\u0027d rather see you in red polish, but I think this black is quite striking. I\u0027d order some for the salon,\" she whispered again, \"but I\u0027m afraid you\u0027d be the only one to wear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it,\" I said as I sat next to Becky and placed my hands underneath the dryer. \"Next time Mrs. Mitchell comes in for a French manicure, make it a Romanian one, like mine.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dance-with-a-vampire-vampire-kisses-4/page-14.html","bookId":2143,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:14 PM"}
