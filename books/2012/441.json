So I stand here holding the reins of her horse, outside her tent. I am … gods, the word is pathetic. But what does it matter? I am also priest to a god about to die on him .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI once vowed that I would meet this day cold sober. What a miserable vow to make .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tent flap was drawn back and Captain Lostara Yil stepped outside, looked round until she saw Banaschar, and then gestured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led the beast forward by the reins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct stepped into view. Met his eyes and nodded. ‘Demidrek. You have stood here for some time, I should think – I was expecting one of my aides to attend to this, and they’re used to standing around and waiting. My apologies.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked. ‘Adjunct, you misunderstand. I drove the poor man away.’ He handed her the reins. ‘I am and always will be honoured, Tavore Paran.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If I could,’ she said, ‘I would order you away from here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But I am not one of your soldiers to be bullied around,’ he said, smiling. ‘So I will do as I damned well please, Adjunct.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied him, and then said, ‘I wonder.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Adjunct?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is this not the true purpose of a priest? To take faith from the one hand and place it into the next? To stand between a god and one such as myself?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath caught. ‘A few remain,’ he managed. ‘Most go through the motions, but see themselves as privileged … from both sides. Closer to their god than to their unordained flock.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But that is not you, is it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Adjunct, I am kneeling beside you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the flicker of something in her eyes, something raw swiftly suppressed, and then she was setting a boot in the stirrup and drawing herself into the saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanaschar stepped back. Looking away, he saw rank upon rank of soldiers turned, facing them, and now they slowly shifted as Tavore trotted her mount forward. She reached the southwest corner of the formation before wheeling inward to pass along the back line. She rode straight in her saddle, a figure in tattered chain, upon a starved, dying horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image seemed to sear itself in Banaschar’s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the far end, she swung round the corner – making her way up to face the front of the three, much-reduced, legions. She would speak to her soldiers now. And, much as he yearned to hear her words, he knew that they were not for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChest aching, the priest turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she rode towards the head of her forces, Tavore could see the dust cloud from the approaching army, and it was vast. Wheeling her horse, she walked the animal on a course parallel to the presented ranks, slowing the beast’s steps enough to move her gaze from one face to the next in the front line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Adjunct finally spoke, her voice carried firm on the wind. ‘Does anyone know you? You, who stood in the shadows of the heavies and the marines. Who are you? What is your tale? So many have seen you – marching past. Seen you, standing silent and unknown. Even now, your faces are almost lost beneath the rims of your helms.’ She was silent for a long moment, her eyes tracking each and every visage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she halted, gaze fixing upon one man. A Falari. ‘Corporal Grid Ffan, Third Squad, Eleventh Company. Bonehunter. You carried Sample – the soldier on your left – on your back. The last day in the desert. And, before the Blood for Water, the only thing that kept you – and her – alive was your love for her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man seemed to sway before her words. She nudged her horse forward. ‘Where stands Wreck-Eye?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Here!’ cried out a voice from a dozen ranks back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When Lostara Yil lost consciousness protecting my life on the day of the Nah’ruk, you led your squad to recover us. Myself. Henar Vygulf. Captain Yil. You lost a brother, and to this day you can find no tears for him. But be at ease. There are those in your squad who have wept in your stead. At night, when you sleep.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked her horse forward a few more steps, found another face. ‘Sergeant Ordinary Grey. When Sergeant Gaunt-Eye’s squad of marines broke and tried to murder him, you and Could Howl held them all off – you cut them down to save Gaunt-Eye. Because once, long ago on the Holy Desert of Raraku, he showed kindness to you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached the end of the ranks, turned her mount round and began retracing her route. ‘Who are you? I know who you are. What have you done? You have stayed with me since the very beginning. Soldiers, hear me! This day is already lost to history, and all that happens here shall remain for ever unknown. On this day, you are unwitnessed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-441.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
