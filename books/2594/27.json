It was far too dangerous for us to remain in Venice, and I knew that I could carry us to the shrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking one bundle of clothing with us, and as much of my gold as I could carry, I wrapped Bianca tightly against me and in less than half of one night, crossed the mountains, in bitter winds and snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now Bianca was accustomed to certain wonders, and to be set down in a snow-filled mountain pass did not alarm her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut within moments we were both painfully aware that I had made a desperate error in judgment. I was not strong enough in my present state to open the door of the shrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was I, of course, who had created this ironbound stone door to block any human assault, and after several pathetic attempts to open it, I had to confess that it was not within my power, and we must find some other shelter before dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca began to weep, and I became angry with her. I made another assault upon the door just to spite her, and then stood back and bid the door open with all the power of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no result, and the wind and the snow beat down hard against us, and Bianca\u0027s weeping infuriated me to where I spoke words that weren\u0027t true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made this door and I shall open it,\" I declared. \"Only give me time to determine what I must do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away from me, visibly hurt by my anger, and then in a miserable yet humble voice she asked me,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is inside this place? I can hear a dreadful sound from beyond the door, all too like the sound of a heartbeat. Why have we come here? Where shall we go if we cannot find shelter here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these questions angered me, but when I looked at Bianca, when I saw her sitting on the rock where I had placed her, the snow falling on her head and shoulders, her head bowed, her tears glistening and red as always, I felt ashamed that I had so used her in my weakness and that I needed so to be angry with her now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be still and I shall open it,\" I said to her. \"You have no knowledge of what lies within. But you will in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave a great sigh and stood back from the door, my burnt hand still tightened on the iron handle and with all my strength I pulled, but I could not make the door budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe absolute folly of it gripped me. I could gain no admittance! I was too weak, and for how long I would be too weak I didn\u0027t know. And yet I made one attempt after another, only so that Bianca would believe that I could protect her, that I could gain entry to this strange place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I turned my back on the Holy of Holies, and I went to her, and gathered her to me, and covered her head and tried to warm her as best I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very soon, I shall tell you all,\" I said, \"and I shall find us shelter this night. Don\u0027t doubt. For now, let me say only that this is a place which I built and which is known to me only and which I\u0027m too weak now to enter as you can see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me that I cried,\" she said gently. \"You won\u0027t see tears from me again. But what is the sound I hear? Can\u0027t humans hear it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they cannot,\" I answered. \"Please be still for now, my brave darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at that moment, that very single moment, another new and altogether different sound caught my ear, a sound which could have been heard by anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the sound of the stone door opening behind me. I knew the sound infallibly and I turned around, unbelieving and as fearful as I was amazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly I gathered Bianca to me, and we stood before the door as it opened wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart was racing. I could hardly fill my lungs with air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that only Akasha could have done this, and as the door fell all the way back, I perceived another miracle of equal kindness and beauty of which I\u0027d never dreamt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rich and abundant light poured forth from the door of the stone passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I was too stunned to move. Then pure happiness descended upon me as I gazed upon this flood of beautiful light. And it seemed I could not possibly fear it or doubt its meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come now, Bianca,\" I said to her, as I guided her forward at my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clutched her bundle to her chest as though she would die if she let go of it, and I held her as though without her to witness with me I would fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stepped into the stone passage and made our way slowly into the bright and flickering light of the chapel. All its many bronze lamps were aglow. Its one hundred candles blazed exquisitely. And no sooner had I taken note of these things, amid a subdued glory that filled me with joy, than the stone door was closed behind us with a crushing sound as rock sounded against rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself staring over the row of one hundred candles up into the faces of the Divine Mother and Father, seeing them as perhaps Bianca would see them, and certainly with refreshed and grateful eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt down, and Bianca knelt at my side. I was trembling. Indeed my shock was so great that I could not for a moment fill my lungs with air. There was no way that I could explain to Bianca the full import of what had taken place. I would only frighten her if I tried to do so. And careless words spoken before my Queen would be unforgivable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t speak,\" I finally said in a whisper. \"They are our Parents. They have opened the door, when I could not. They have lighted the lamps for us. They have lighted the candles. You cannot imagine the worth of this blessing. They have welcomed us inside. We can answer them only with prayers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca nodded. Her face was full of piety and wonder. Did it matter to Akasha that I had brought to her feet an exquisite blood drinker?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a low reverent voice I recounted the story of the Divine Parents but only in the simplest and grandest terms. I told Bianca how they had come to be the very first blood drinkers thousands of years ago in Egypt, and that now they no longer hungered for blood or even so much as spoke or moved. I was their keeper and their guardian and had been so for all of my life as a blood drinker and so it would always be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said these things so that nothing would alarm Bianca and she would feel no dread of the two still figures who stared forward in horrifying silence, and did not seem even to blink. And so it was that tender Bianca was initiated into these powerful mysteries with great care and thought them beautiful and nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was to this chapel,\" I explained, \"that I would come when I left Venice, and I would light the lamps for the King and the Queen, and bring fresh flowers. You see, there are none now. But I will bring them when I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, I realized that in spite of my enthusiasm and gratitude, I couldn\u0027t really make her know what a miracle it was that Akasha had opened the door for us, or lighted the lamps. Indeed, I didn\u0027t dare to do it, and now that I had finished this respectful recital, I closed my eyes, and in silence I thanked both Akasha and Enkil that they had admitted me to the sanctuary, and that they had greeted us with the gift of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver and over I offered my prayers, perhaps unable myself to grasp the fact that they had so welcomed me, and not too certain of what it really meant. Was I loved? Was I needed? It seemed I must accept without presumption. It seemed I must be grateful without imagining things that weren\u0027t so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt in quietude for a long time and Bianca must surely have observed me for she too was quiet, and then I could bear the thirst no longer. I stared at Akasha. I desired the Blood. I could think of nothing but the Blood. All my injuries were as so many open wounds in me. And my wounds bled for the Blood. I had to attempt to take the all-powerful Blood from the Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My beauty,\" I said, placing my gloved hand on Bianca\u0027s tender arm. \"I want you to go to the corner there and to sit quiet, and to say nothing of what you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what will happen?\" she whispered. For the first time she sounded afraid. She looked about herself at the shivering flames of the lamps, at the glowing candles, at the painted walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do as I tell you,\" I said. I had to say it, and she had to do it, for how was I ever to know whether the Queen would let me drink?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Bianca was in the corner with her heavy cloak wrapped around her and as far away as possible, for whatever good it would do, I prayed in silence for the Blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see me and what I am,\" I said silently, \"you know that I have been burnt. This is why you opened the door for me and admitted me, because I could not do it, and surely you see what a monster I have become. Have mercy on me and let me drink from you as you have done in the past. I need the Blood. I need it more than I have ever needed it. And so I come to you with respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI removed my leather mask and laid it aside. I was as hideous now as those old burnt gods whom Akasha had once crushed when they came to her. Would she refuse me in the same manner? Or had she known all along what had befallen me? Had she understood completely all things before the door was ever opened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose slowly until I knelt at her feet and I could put my hand upon her throat, all the while tensed for the threat of Enkil\u0027s arm, but it did not come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed her throat, feeling her plaited hair against me and looking at her white skin before me, and hearing only Bianca\u0027s soft tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t cry, Bianca,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I sank my teeth suddenly, viciously, as I had so often done, and the thick blood flooded into me, brilliant and hot as the lamplight and the light of the candles, pouring into me as if her heart were pumping it willingly into me, racing the beat of my own heart. My head grew light. My body grew light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar away Bianca wept. Why was she afraid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the garden. I saw the garden I had painted after I had fallen in love with Botticelli, and it was filled with his orange trees and with his flowers and yet it was my garden, the garden of my father\u0027s house outside Rome long long ago. How could I ever forget my own garden? How could I ever forget the garden where I had first played as a child?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn memory I went back to those days in Rome when I had been mortal, and there was my garden, the garden of the villa of my father, and I was walking in the soft grass and listening to the sound of the fountain, and then it seemed that all through time, the garden changed but never changed, and it was always there for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay down on the grass, and the branches of the trees moved above me. I heard a voice speaking to me, rapidly and sweetly, but I didn\u0027t know what it was saying, and then I knew that Amadeo was hurt, that he was in the hands of those who would bring pain and evil to him, and that I could not go to him now, I would only stumble into their snares if I did, and that I must stay here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was the Keeper of the King and the Queen as I had told Bianca, yes, the Keeper of the King and the Queen, and I must let Amadeo go in Time, and perhaps were I to do as I should, perhaps Pandora would be returned to me, Pandora who traveled the northern cities of Europe now, Pandora who had been seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garden was verdant and fragrant and I saw Pandora clearly. I saw her in her soft white dress, her hair loose as I had described it to Bianca. Pandora smiled. She walked towards me. She spoke to me. The Queen wants us to be together, she said. Her eyes were large and wondering and I knew she was very close to me, very close, so close that I could almost touch her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t be imagining this, no, I cannot, I thought. And there came back to me again vividly the sound of Pandora\u0027s voice, as she quarreled with me on our first night as bride and groom: Even as this new blood races through me still, eats at me and transforms me, I cling to neither reason nor superstition for my safety. I can walk through a myth and out of it! You fear me, because you don\u0027t know what I am. I look like a woman, I sound like a man, and your reason tells you the sum total is impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was looking into Pandora\u0027s eyes. She sat on the garden bench, pulling the flower petals out of her brown hair, a girl again in the Blood, a woman-girl forever, as Bianca would be a young woman forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached out on either side of me and felt the grass beneath my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I fell backwards, out of the dream garden, out of the illusion and found myself lying quite still on the floor of the chapel, between the high bank of perfect candles, and the steps of the dais where the enthroned couple kept their ancient place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing seemed changed about me. Even Bianca\u0027s crying came as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be quiet now, darling,\" I said to her. But my eyes were fastened to the face of Akasha above me, and to her breasts beneath the golden silk of her Egyptian dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed that Pandora had been with me, that she had been in the very chapel. And the beauty of Pandora seemed bound up with the beauty and presence of Akasha in some intimate way which I could not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are these portents?\" I whispered. I sat up and then rose to my knees. \"Tell me, my beloved Queen. What are these portents? Did you once bring Pandora to me because you wanted us to be together? Do you remember when Pandora spoke those words to me? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell silent. But my mind spoke to Akasha. My mind pleaded with her. Where is Pandora? Will you bring Pandora to me again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long interval passed and then I rose to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went round the bank of candles and found my precious companion quite distraught over the simple wonder she had beheld of me drinking from the immobile Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then you fell back, as though you were lifeless,\" she recounted. \"And I didn\u0027t dare to go to you, as you\u0027d said that I mustn\u0027t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI comforted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then finally you waked, and you spoke of Pandora, and I saw that you were so ... so much healed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was true. I was more robust all over, my arms and legs thicker, heavier, and my face had more of its natural contour. Indeed, I was still badly burnt, but a man of some stature and seeming strength now, and indeed I could feel more of the old strength in my limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was now only two hours from dawn, and being quite unable to open the door, and not in any mood to pray that Akasha workcommon miracles for anyone, I knew I had to give my blood to Bianca, and so this is what I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it offend the Queen, that I, having just drunk from her would offer this powerful blood to a child? There was nothing to do but find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t frighten Bianca with any warnings or doubts on the matter. I beckoned to her that she should come to me and lie in my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut my wrist for her and told her to drink. I heard her gasp with the shock of the powerful blood and her delicate fingers stiffened to make her two hands into claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last of her own volition she drew back and sat up slowly beside me, her eyes vague and full of reflected light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you see in the Blood, my beauty?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head as though she had no words for it, and then she laid her head on my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only serenity and peace in the chapel, and as we lay down to sleep together, the lamps slowly burnt out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last the candles were down to a few, and I could feel the dawn coming, and the chapel was warm as I had promised, and glittering with its riches, but above all with its solemn King and Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca had lost consciousness. I had perhaps three quarters of an hour before the day\u0027s slumber would come for me as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at Akasha, delighting in the last shimmer of the dying candles in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what a liar I am, don\u0027t you?\" I asked her. \"You know how wicked I have been. And you play my game with me, don\u0027t you, my Sovereign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I hear laughter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I was going mad. There had been enough pain for it and enough magic; there had been enough hunger, and enough blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at Bianca who rested so trustingly on my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have planted in her mind the image of Pandora, haven\u0027t I?\" I whispered, \"so that wherever she goes with me she will search. And from her angel mind, Pandora cannot fail to pluck my image. And so we may find each other, Pandora and I, through her. She doesn\u0027t dream of what I\u0027ve done. She thinks only to comfort me with her listening, and I, though loving her, take her North with me, into the lands where Raymond Gallant has told me that Pandora was last seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, very wicked, but what does it take to sustain life when life is bruised and burnt as badly as my life has been? For me it is this extravagant and slender ambition, and for it I abandon Amadeo whom I should rescue as soon as my strength is restored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sound in the chapel. What was it? The sound of the wax of the last candle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed a voice was speaking to me soundlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot rescue Amadeo. You are the keeper of the Mother and the Father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I grow sleepy,\" I whispered. I closed my eyes. \"I know such things, I have always known them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou go on, you seek Raymond Gallant, you must remember. Look at his face again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the Talamasca,\" I said. \"And the castle called Lorwich in East Anglia. The place he called the Motherhouse. Yes. I remember both sides of the golden coin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought dreamily of that supper when he had come upon me so stealthily and stared at me with such innocent and inquisitive eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of the music and the way Amadeo smiled at Bianca as they danced together. I thought of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then in my hand I saw the golden coin and the engraved image of the castle, and I thought, Am I not dreaming? But it seemed that Raymond Gallant was talking to me, talking very distinctly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me, Marius, remember me, Marius. We know of her, Marius. We watch and we are always here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, go North,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it seemed that the Queen of Silence said without a word that she was content. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-27.html","bookId":2594,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM"}
