Water splashed around us as we moved together, the small seat in the tub not designed for the purpose we were putting it to. Despite the pain in my thigh, my legs tightened around his hips as his mouth caressed my nape, licking me, nipping at my flesh as our bodies moved in an ageless rhythm. I scored his slick back as he nibbled my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo demanding. His voice was as soft as his hair. I took a handful of the damp, inky black mane and tugged on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo it now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave I told you how arousing I find it when you make demands of me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flexed my legs, thrusting my hips up to meet his as his hardness plunged into my eager flesh. I know how aroused you are; it\u0027s fairly evident how aroused you are. If you were any more aroused, you\u0027d be poking out my throat. Now... just... do... it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllegra, my Allegra, he sighed into my mind, his teeth teasing the tender spot beneath my ear as his fingers dug into my hips, pulling me tighter to him until there was no way to tell where his oil-slicked flesh ended and mine began. How could I live without you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat, sharp and sweet, swept down my neck as he claimed every part of me, taking life from me and returning it with a triumphant shout of my name as our bodies burned with a blinding light. I gave myself up to him, and received his exaltation in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weren\u0027t we supposed to be having a discussion in here?\" I asked later, once I could remember how to speak. We were lying together in the tub, our limbs entwined, the warm water lapping sensually against us. Discussion be damned. I tipped my head back and bit Christian\u0027s chin. \"You smell good. You smell like jasmine, and Christian, and just a hint of eau du after-sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened one eye, \"You have worn me out, Allegra. Instead of praising my prowess to the stars, instead of writing sonnets to my masculinity, instead of composing odes showering me with praise, you complain of the lingering scent of our lovemaking. I will make note of this aberration and ensure that any women who wish to apply for the position of my Beloved in the future are free from this prejudice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trailed a finger around his left nipple. \"You think you\u0027re so cute with all that \u0027other Beloved\u0027 talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eye closed. \"I know I am cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted and tweaked his nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I am very cute. You think me sexy, as well. I can read your thoughts, remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoisted myself up and slid across his body. You are conceited, arrogant, and domineering, everything I dislike in a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you are independent, stubborn, and heedless, everything I dislike in a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid my hands under his back and kissed his dampened lips. So why is it that I love you so much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled a smug, masculine little smile and captured my legs with his. Because I love you, and to be loved by a Dark One is enough for any woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pinched him in a particularly vulnerable spot and allowed him to kiss me with all the sexy arrogance he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are! Sheesh, I thought you guys would never show up! We\u0027ve been waiting forever for you! I would have thought you could have held on to your libidos for just a few minutes, just long enough for you to tell us what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roxy, stop being so obnoxious!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m never obnoxious; I\u0027m just concerned. You weren\u0027t here when they came home. Allie looked half-dead when Christian hauled her in the door, and all Noelle said was that she had to go examine the remains of the Trust house to make sure nothing bad was hanging around. What remains? What happened to the house? What sort of bad thing is she looking for? That\u0027s all I want to know, just a few simple answers to a few simple questions, and then I can get packed and go home to my husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a moment too soon,\" Raphael murmured into Joy\u0027s ear. She elbowed him gently, but leaned into him and twined her fingers through the hand he rested on her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around Christian\u0027s study, overwhelmed for a moment with sadness that had tears pricking behind my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it, Beloved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ghosts,\" I answered, swallowing hard. \"I miss the ghosts. They loved this room. They loved the TV. And now with the house destroyed - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian took my hand in his. \"We will search for them, Allegra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asmodeus probably turned them into phantoms,\" I said thickly, turning away from everyone so I could wipe my eyes. Christian pulled me to his chest and let me sob there while he quickly explained the events of day. His voice was soft, low, and true as it wrapped me in a blanket of comfort, but nothing could ease the pain when I thought of what I had asked from my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll be all right, Allie,\" Joy said thoughtfully. \"I doubt if this Asmo-whoever had time to do anything to them. It sounds like he was awfully focused on you and Christian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniveled a noncommittal answer into Christian\u0027s black sweater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and besides, they were smart ghosts,\" Roxy added. \"Well, that Jem character wasn\u0027t the brightest bulb in the pack, and that wrinkled up Welsh woman was not working on all six thrusters, but other than that, they were a pretty sharp bunch. They wouldn\u0027t let themselves be phantomized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffed and breathed in Christian\u0027s lovely scent. It made me feel better just knowing that even if I were guilty of the eternal damnation of six ghosts, at least he\u0027d suffer with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr something to that effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will go back to the house as soon as the sun is down,\" Christian said softly in my ear. \"We will search for any sign of your ghosts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and sniffed again and made an effort to pull myself together. Christian sat and tugged me down onto his lap as everyone asked questions, hashed over the events, and heaped huge quantities of praise on Christian and me for our quick thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was utterly miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hullo? Anyone home? Oh, hullo again, Joy, Roxy. You must be Raphael. Do you know that your eyes are yellow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amber, not yellow,\" Joy corrected Noelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" She tilted her head and examined Raphael. \"If you say so. Allie, I was checking through the remains of the house for any signs of demons and imps, and I found this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held out her hand, the shattered remains of her amulet scattered across her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Noelle, I\u0027m so sorry, I meant to tell you that I\u0027d lost it. It cracked under the strain of Asmodeus\u0027s power. I\u0027m sure it was a one-of-a-kind amulet, but I\u0027ll do everything I can to replace it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry; I have a drawerful of them. After all, it\u0027s not the amulet; it\u0027s what goes into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a watery smile. \"Have you met Christian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to get up so he could greet her, but he held on to me with one hand and offered her another. She said something about it being nice to finally meet him, then asked, \"What happened to the Dark One who was in the big bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned back against Christian and let myself drift along with his silken voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sebastian recovered from his ill treatment, a circumstance that leaves me profoundly grateful for your help. I understand you arranged for several units of blood to be fed to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We weren\u0027t sure if he\u0027d like it if it weren\u0027t on the hoof, so to speak, but he didn\u0027t seem to mind,\" Roxy said. \"In fact, he guzzled it all down pretty quickly. Made a world of difference in him, too, didn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It did,\" Joy agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He left me a note before he left, asking me to thank you for your kindness,\" Christian added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he\u0027s left already?\" Noelle asked, disappointment tinging her voice. I stopped wallowing in sorrow and took a good, long look at her. \"That\u0027s a shame. I\u0027ve never met a Dark One, present company excepted, and I was looking forward to interviewing him as to the nature of werefolk in Moravia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were what?\" Raphael asked suspiciously. Joy shushed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be happy to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you wouldn\u0027t,\" Joy said quickly, interrupting Christian. \"You have lots to do. You have Allie to get settled, and the Trust to dismantle, and all the other stuff. I\u0027m sure you won\u0027t have time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed myself forward on Christian\u0027s legs, bristling at the way she told him what he could do. \"If Christian wants to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t want to, though, do you, Christian?\" Joy said, her eyebrows wiggling meaningfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael groaned and pulled her back from where she had been leaning forward. \"No. I absolutely forbid it. One was enough. No more. We\u0027re going to have a quiet life from now on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course we are,\" Joy said, absently patting Raphael\u0027s leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Roxy. She grinned at me. I looked at Christian. He looked thoughtful. Noelle just looked confused. I knew how she felt; I was as confused as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it so that all women are born matchmakers? Christian said into my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked again at Noelle, an idea dawning in my mind, a slow smile curving my lips. \"I\u0027m afraid Joy is right, Noelle. Christian is going to be very busy for a long while. But I\u0027m sure any of his friends, his Moravian friends, would be happy to help you with your book.\" I turned to look at Christian. \"Didn\u0027t you tell me that Sebastian had gone to track down the other Trust houses and check them for victims? That means he\u0027ll be in the country for a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allegra...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored the warning note in Christian\u0027s voice and smiled again at Noelle. Roxy and Joy smiled with me. She backed up a step under the onslaught of so much smile wattage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure he\u0027d be delighted to talk to you when he returns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erm... yes, that\u0027s a possibility. Well, it\u0027s been lovely, but I must be on my way. Mummy has been called to a terrible Hecatoncheires outburst, and I promised I\u0027d help her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hecatoncheires?\" Roxy asked. \"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nasty little monster with fifty heads and one hundred hands. Ta, everyone! Oh, Allie.\" Noelle stopped at the door and turned back toward me, reaching into her pocket. \"Before I forget, I found these as well. I thought you might want them back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix filthy, stained, dust-, dirt-, and plaster-laden bobbles glowed softly in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ghosts!\" I leaped up from Christian\u0027s lap, scooping the bobbles gently into my hand. \"They bobbled themselves! They\u0027re all here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle smiled. \"I told you they would be helpful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And smart.\" Roxy nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the bobbles carefully in a blue-and-green Venetian glass bowl and called the names one after another. \"Esme, Antonio, Jem, Alis, Honoria, Mr. Woogums, I Summon you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all appeared, all their dear forms, even the petulant little Honoria looking relatively pleased at being called forth. Jem, the possessor of the sat-upon bobble, was a bit worse for wear, but at least he could talk again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Borrowed a tongue,\" he told me. I didn\u0027t want to know where he borrowed it from, so I just thanked him for his help, and told him how happy I was to see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was never in my life so frightened; you simply have no idea what it is to throw oneself willy-nilly at a demon lord!\" Esme told Roxy. \"I was vicious, though; I truly was. I berated him soundly for his cruel actions, and then I lectured him - yes, I did! - about the state he\u0027d let his hair and fingernails get into. \u0027Just because one is an inhabitant of hell does not mean one has to let oneself go,\u0027 I said to him. Well, that gave him something to think about, as you might well imagine!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio watched with sad puppy eyes as Christian, who had been listening to Jem tell how he had Asmodeus in a headlock, followed by a mangier move, strolled over to me and slid his arm around my waist. \"You \u0027ave given yourself to him, coraz¨®n. I was sure you would save yourself for me. We would \u0027ave found a way to be together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave my heart to Christian before I Summoned you, Antonio. You knew there could never be anything between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio\u0027s lower lip pouted for a moment, then sucked itself back in as he straightened up and smoothed down his doublet. \"You will have girl children. Lots of girl children. One of them will grow up and see me and know that she is mine, yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian started to protest, but I stopped him. \"I\u0027m sure any daughters we have would be smitten with you, but you can\u0027t mean to stay here, Antonio. I\u0027m positive I can Release you; it\u0027s just a matter of having the time to figure out the proper quantities of ginseng. Now that the threat of Asmodeus is taken care of, I can devote myself to working out the problems so I can Release you.\" I waved a hand to include the other ghosts. \"Release all of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Oh, my dear, you wouldn\u0027t do that to me! To us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will never leave you, coraz¨®n! You may grow tired of the dead one, and wish me to comfort you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t want t\u0027be Released. I want t\u0027see who\u0027ll be left on Survivor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlis said something incomprehensible. Esme nodded. \"She\u0027s absolutely right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Woogums piddled on the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian sighed in my ear. I am adding to my list the condition that future Beloveds not have any ghosts attached to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped firmly on his foot and looked at Honoria. \"Well? You\u0027ve heard the others; they refuse to go on. Do you want me to Release you or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around the room, skipping over Roxy, Joy, and Raphael, frowning at Antonio, ignoring Alis and Jem, wrinkling her nose at the ghostly puddle of cat piddle, finally settling her gaze on Esme. \"I want to stay with Esme. I want to watch more Buffy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buffy?\" Christian asked, stiffening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at everyone. \"Well, I guess that\u0027s settled, then. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll all find Christian\u0027s castle in the Moravian highlands more than roomy enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buffy as in, the vampire slayer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy snickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christian says the castle is haunted, so perhaps we\u0027ll get to meet some new friends!\" I added cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one who slays vampires? That Buffy?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael got to his feet and pulled Joy to hers. \"I believe this is our cue to leave. Come along Roxy; I\u0027ll help you pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trailed Joy and Raphael out the door, pausing to pat Christian on the shoulder. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027s too young yet to learn how to focus her energy. I mean, it must take a great amount of concentration for a ghost to be able to wield a hammer and stake, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed her out the door and closed it, then opened it and stuck my head out, saying, \"Thank you all for everything!\" before closing it behind me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio eyed Christian\u0027s chest, his fingers stroking his beard. \"A \u0027ammer and stake. Why \u0027ave I never thought of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be happy to give you something to think about,\" Christian warned as he started toward Antonio, who promptly drew out his sword. Alis wandered over to her favorite vase and started yelling at it. Esme held Mr. Woogums above the puddle he\u0027d left, and scolded him. Honoria and Jem squabbled over who got control of the TV remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed happily and leaned back against the door, my eyes catching Christian\u0027s as he withstood Antonio\u0027s rapier attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will have them forever, you know, Beloved. So long as we live, so shall they exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know. But somehow, with you standing next to me, I think I can bear just about anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio lunged with a particularly cruel thrust to Christian\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed in my head as he waved Antonio\u0027s image away. I would not tolerate this for any other woman, maly v¨¢le¨¨n¨ªk. Only for my Beloved will I sacrifice my peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and stepped forward into his waiting arms. \"We really are going to have to work on this arrogant attitude of yours.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-and-the-single-vampire-dark-ones-2/page-20.html","bookId":2203,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:00 PM"}
