Facing them, I will be like the one hare the eagle missed. I’m as likely to freeze as fill my breeches.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Abrastal’s eyes widened. ‘Warchief,’ she said in wonder, ‘you are frightened of them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grimaced, and then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe queen of the Bolkando abruptly rose, taking a deep breath, and Spax’s eyes could not help but fall to her swelling chest. ‘I will meet this Adjunct,’ Abrastal said with sudden vigour. Her eyes found the Barghast and pinned him in place. ‘If indeed we are to face more of the giant two-legged lizards with their terrible magic … Spax, what will you now claim of the courage of your people?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Courage, Highness? You will have that. But can we hope to do what those Khundryl said the Malazans did?’ He hesitated, and then shook his head. ‘Firehair, I too will look hard upon those soldiers, and I fear I already know what I will see. They have known the crucible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you do not wish to see that truth, do you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted. ‘Let’s just say it’s both a good and a bad thing your stores of rum are nearly done.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Was this our betrayal?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanakalian faced the question, and the eyes of the hard, iron woman who had just voiced it, for as long as he could before shying away. ‘Mortal Sword, you well know we simply could not reach them in time. As such, our failure was one of circumstance, not loyalty.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For once,’ she replied, ‘you speak wisely, sir. Tomorrow we ride out to the Bonehunter camp. Prepare an escort of fifty of our brothers and sisters – I want healers and our most senior veterans.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I understand, Mortal Sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at him, studied his face for a moment, and then returned her gaze to the jade-lit southeastern sky. ‘If you do not, sir, they will.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou hound me into a corner, Mortal Sword. You seem bent on forcing my hand. Is there only room for one on that pedestal of yours? What will you do when you stand face to face with the Adjunct? With Brys Beddict?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, more to the point, what do you know of this betrayal? I see a sword in our future. I see blood on its blade. I see the Perish standing alone, against impossible odds .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘At the parley,’ Krughava said, ‘you will keep our own counsel, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed. ‘As you wish.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She has been wounded,’ Krughava went on. ‘We will close about her with our utmost diligence to her protection.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Protection, sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In the manner of hunter whales, Shield Anvil, when one of their clan is unwell.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mortal Sword, this shall be a parley of comrades, more or less. Our clan, as you might call it, is unassailed. No sharks. No dhenrabi or gahrelit. Against whom do we protect her?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The darkness of her own doubts if nothing else. Though I cannot be certain, I fear she is one who would gnaw upon her own scars, eager to watch them bleed, thirsty for the taste of blood in her mouth.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mortal Sword, how can we defend her against herself?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrughava was silent for a time, and then she sighed. ‘Make stern your regard, banish all shadows from your mind, anneal in brightest silver your certainty. We return to the path, with all resolve. Can I make it any clearer, Shield Anvil?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Leave me now,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanakalian swung round and walked down from the rise. The even rows of cookfires flickered in the basin before him, painting the canvas tents with light and shadow. Five thousand paces to the west rose another glow – the Bolkando encampment. A parley of comrades, a clan. Or perhaps not. The Bolkando have no place in this scheme .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey said she was concussed, but now recovers. They said something impossible happened above her unconscious form, there on the field of battle. They said – with something burning fierce in their eyes – that the Bonehunters awakened that day, and its heart was there, before the Adjunct’s senseless body .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready a legend is taking birth, and yet we saw none of its making. We played no role. The name of the Perish Grey Helms is a gaping absence in this roll call of heroes .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe injustice of that haunted him. He was Shield Anvil, but his embrace remained empty, a gaping abyss between his arms. This will change. I will make it change. And all will see. Our time is coming .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood, blood on the sword. Gods, I can almost taste it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled hard on the leaf-wrapped stick, feeling every muscle in her jaw and neck bunch taut. Smoke streaming from her mouth and nose, she faced the darkness of the north plain. Others, when they walked out to the edge of the legion’s camp, would find themselves on the side that gave them a clear view of the Malazan encampment. They walked out and they stared, no different from pilgrims facing a holy shrine, an unexpected edifice on their path. She imagined that in their silence they struggled to fit into their world that dismal sprawl of dung-fires, the vague shapes moving about, the glint of banners like a small forest of storm-battered saplings. Finding a place for all that should have been easy. But it wasn’t. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-42.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
