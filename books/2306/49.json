He could smell the storm in the air, and even as the thought crossed his mind, he heard the first distant echo of thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, dressed in a heavy white sweater and a pair of faded blue jeans, he settled down to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t keep him waiting long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaylyn.\" He murmured her name as she swept into the parlor, looking every inch the goddess she had once pretended to be. A sleek black gown clung to her voluptuous body. Her hair fell over her shoulders and down her back in lush black waves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navarre.\" She paused inside the doorway. He could tell, by the rosy hue of her cheeks and the brightness of her eyes, that she had just fed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed the room and sat down beside him, one hand resting possessively on his right thigh. \"I\u0027ve missed you,mi amor ,\" she purred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran her hand up and down the length of his thigh. \"The centuries have been kind to you, Navarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to you.\" He met her gaze, his face impassive as her fingertips dug into his flesh. \"Why have you come here now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you. I missed you.\" Her hand glided along the inside of his thigh, her touch familiar, intimate. \"Haven\u0027t you missed me, even a little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have lied, Navarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you prefer that to the truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew her hand from his thigh, the movement tense and angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, tell me,\" she said curtly, \"what have you been doing with yourself since I saw you last?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavarre shrugged. \"Living one day at a time, like everyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer laugh was dry and bitter. \"But you\u0027re not like everyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you,\" she replied. \"I want to stay here for a while, and I want you to show me around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went on as if he hadn\u0027t spoken. \"I\u0027ve never spent much time in America. I thought you would show me the sights.\" She leaned toward him, her face filling his vision. \"I thought it was time to renew our acquaintance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced himself to remain seated, though he desperately wanted to put some space between them. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dare refuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to go, Shaylyn. There isn\u0027t room enough for the two of us here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what if I don\u0027t want to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the rules. I was here first. If you want to stay, you\u0027ll have to convince me to leave. Or destroy me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I won\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But I do know you hunted in my territory. And then, when you let the woman live, you didn\u0027t even bother to erase her memory of what happened. I can\u0027t afford mistakes like that in my terrain, Shaylyn. I don\u0027t hunt in Moreno Bay, and I don\u0027t want you hunting here, either. I don\u0027t want you here at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up, her dark eyes blazing with anger. \"How dare you speak to me like that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have every right, and you know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it wasn\u0027t for me, you would have rotted away centuries ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood to face her, hoping to intimidate her with his size and physical strength, even though he knew her powers were still superior to his. \"If it wasn\u0027t for you, I might have had a home and a family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A home!\" She spat the word. \"A family! I gave you immortality, and now I want a small part of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t give it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t, or won\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey glared at each other for stretched seconds, and then, as one, they whirled around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrianna!\" Navarre exclaimed softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to run to him, and then she saw the other woman. Saw her, and knew that she was a vampire. Lifting a hand to the recently purchased cross that rested beneath her blouse, Adrianna murmured a quiet prayer, hoping that the crucifix did, indeed, possess the power to thwart a vampire. And then she glanced at Navarre, wondering if he had invited the woman here, and if so, for what reason?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t care for the answer that came quickly to mind. Still, Adrianna couldn\u0027t help wondering if the other woman had been invited for dinner, and if she was intended to be the main course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a step backward, her gaze fixed on Navarre\u0027s face. \"Did I come at a bad time?\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Shaylyn remarked, \"this is the reason you have no time for an old friend.\" Her gaze moved over Adrianna in cool assessment. \"Does she know what you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensing Adrianna\u0027s inner distress, Navarre crossed the room and placed a protective arm around her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Aren\u0027t you going to introduce us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrianna, this is Shaylyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So nice to meet you, my dear,\" Shaylyn said, her voice laced with venom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna pressed closer to Navarre, every instinct, every sense of self-preservation urging her to run for home as fast as she could. She looked up at Navarre, her gaze pleading for assurance that he could protect her from the latent fury in the other woman\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you nothing to say?\" Shaylyn demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s... it\u0027s nice to meet you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m warning you, Shaylyn, leave her alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna cringed before the wrath in the other woman\u0027s gaze. Never had she seen such anger, such jealousy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send her home, Navarre. You may go back to her in a few days, after I\u0027m gone, but for now, I want your time. All of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re no longer a goddess, Shaylyn, and I\u0027m no longer your slave. I have my own life now, and you have no part in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d choose my words more carefully, if I were you,\" Shaylyn said sweetly, and before he could stop her, she fixed her gaze on Adrianna, her devil-black eyes narrowing with the intensity of her hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a gasp, Adrianna pressed her hands to her head as a terrible burning pain filled her skull. A low moan rose in her throat as the pain increased. Lights danced in front of her eyes; the strength went out of her legs and she would have fallen if Navarre hadn\u0027t caught her in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaylyn, stop it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce she was freed of the vampire woman\u0027s hold, the pain receded, leaving only a dull ache. Adrianna looked up at Navarre, her eyes filled with fear. She tried to tell him she wanted to go home, but the words wouldn\u0027t come. Panic engulfed her, and she raised a hand to her throat, her lips moving, though no sound emerged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Shaylyn, enough!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, very well.\" With a wave of her hand, Shaylyn broke the spell. \"Puny mortal. She has no resistance at all to the power of suggestion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor has she had thousands of years to learn to be cruel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, my fine fledgling, have lived long enough to know better than to speak to me like that. The day will come when you will regret those words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaylyn!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late. She was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna blinked in disbelief. One minute the woman had been standing not two feet away, and the next she was gone in a swirling iridescent black mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering an oath, Navarre swept Adrianna into his arms and carried her to the sofa where he sat down and cradled her against his chest. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does your head still hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Adrianna! Say something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she the vampire who made you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s very beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And very selfish. And cruel. And self-centered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She loves you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t know what love is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna shrugged. \"And she wants you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t argue with that. Shaylyn had sought him out from time to time through the centuries, but after the last time, he\u0027d thought himself free of her. He knew now that he had been wrong, that in Shaylyn\u0027s mind, at least, he would always be hers, subject to her beck and call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrianna, I want you to go away for a while. Take a vacation. Go see your parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavarre nodded. \"I\u0027m afraid for you, afraid of what she might do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna smiled wryly. \"You mean a woman scorned, and all that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laugh if you want, but Shaylyn has always been very possessive of those she\u0027s made. She\u0027s angry with me now, and I don\u0027t want you to be caught in the middle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to say I\u0027m not afraid, but I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be a fool if you weren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may be afraid, but I\u0027m not leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annie...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! I\u0027m not going to run away and let her have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annie, in spite of what I said, I belong to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s her blood in my veins, her lifeforce that made me what I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t mean she owns you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but she\u0027s a very powerful vampire. No one knows how old she is, or if she can even be destroyed. Some say that she no longer has to rest during the day, that she\u0027s immune to the deadly effects of sunlight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Navarre frowned. It had taken him almost two thousand years to be able to endure the sun for short periods of time. Shaylyn had existed longer than any vampire he knew. It was possible that she no longer needed to seek shelter during the light of day, which made her all the more dangerous to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna glanced over her shoulder, as if she expected to see Shaylyn hovering nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She isn\u0027t here,\" Navarre said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires can sense the presence of one of their kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrianna made a sound of disbelief. \"If she\u0027s immune to the sun, maybe she\u0027s also able to conceal her presence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavarre frowned. He, too, had thought of that, and it worried him. The only edge he had was being able to perceive when she was near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wouldn\u0027t hurt you, would she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t hurt me,\" he replied, \"at least not much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she could destroy you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNavarre nodded. There was no doubt of that, especially if she was able to move about when the sun was high in the sky. His only hope was to find a new place to rest until Shaylyn lost interest in him and left town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Navarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like being a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you go back to being a mortal, if you could?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if there were a cure? Would you use it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adrianna, what are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found an old book up in the attic at the store. It was calledThe Handbook of the Undead . There was a recipe for a cure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cure! Navarre stared at Adrianna, wondering if such a thing were conceivable. In two thousand years, he had never considered the possibility of being mortal again. And even as he considered it, he knew it held no appeal. He had no wish to grow old and die, no wish to give up the wondrous powers he possessed, especially now, when those powers seemed to be expanding, when he was able to see the sunrise and walk in the morning light. Who could say? Perhaps in another hundred years, it would no longer be necessary for him to hide away during the long hours of the afternoon. Perhaps he\u0027d even be able to overcome his need for blood and be able to partake of mortal food again, live a normal life...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormal. Never, since the day of his birth, had he been normal. Even before he was born, Fate had decreed that he would not live as others lived. He had been brought into the world for the sole purpose of being sacrificed to Shaylyn. It was a Fate he had avoided thus far; he had no desire to become her prey at this late date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet... He stroked Adrianna\u0027s cheek, thinking how wonderful it would be to spend his life at her side, to father her children and watch them grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was watching him, her eyes wide with apprehension and hope. \"You don\u0027t want it, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered a lie and opted for the edge of the truth. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could be so happy together if you were...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Human?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" she said quickly, though they both knew it was. \"It\u0027s just that we can\u0027t have a future together now - I mean, maybe you don\u0027t even want to have a future with me, but, oh, Navarre, I love you so much!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I love you. Never doubt that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I,\" he admitted softly. And he knew that, even if he wanted to, there was no way he could possibly try Adrianna\u0027s cure. Not now, when his strength as a vampire was all that stood between them and Shaylyn\u0027s wrath. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sunlight-moonlight/page-49.html","bookId":2306,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:52 PM"}
