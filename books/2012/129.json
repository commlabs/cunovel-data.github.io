She sighed. Her chest ached, but the bones had begun healing and the pain was fading to an itch. ‘They attacked me,’ she said. ‘I simply defended myself. Indeed,’ she added, cautiously approaching, ‘if I desired to kill them all, I would have done so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see five bodies over there—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As I said, I would have killed them all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman thrashing in the shallows was climbing unsteadily to her feet. Equity regarded her for a moment. ‘If she comes at me again, I will kill her.’ She faced the sorceress. ‘Make that plain to her – she belongs to you, does she not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe short, plump mage made a strange wiggle with the fingers of one hand. ‘I am hard pressed to keep her from carving your head from your rather bony shoulders. You certainly have a way with words, Inquisitor, but that will not work a second time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEquity narrowed her attention on the other woman in the group. She snorted. ‘It is said the Realm of Death is sundered. Do your kind now plague the world?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I carry no plague,’ the woman replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forkrul Assail frowned. Was she a simpleton? Often, she well knew, the brain decayed irreparably in such creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man standing beside the undead woman was now staring at her with his one working eye. ‘Did she say y’got the plague, Cap’n?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Pretty, she said you’re an idiot. Now be quiet – better yet, gather up the crew, now that they’ve scattered every which way, and detail a burial party, and all that other stuff. Go on.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, Cap’n.’ Then he hesitated, and said in a hoarse whisper that all could hear, ‘It’s just, this one, she looks like she’s got a plague, don’t she? All white and all those veins on her arms, and—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go, Kaban. Now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, the man limped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEquity watched the woman who’d attacked her set about retrieving her weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Inquisitor,’ said the sorceress, ‘we have no interest in suffering your … adjudication. Indeed, we proclaim you our enemy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is blind hatred your only recourse?’ Equity demanded. ‘You name me “Inquisitor”, telling me that you know certain details of local significance. Yet that title is a presumption. You assume that all Forkrul Assail are Inquisitors, and this is ignorant. Indeed, most of the Inquisitors we set upon the peoples of this land were Watered – as much human blood in their veins as Assail. We discovered a rather sweet irony in observing their zeal, by the way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nevertheless,’ the sorceress retorted, even as she made imperative gestures towards her servant, ‘we must view you as our enemy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You still do not understand, do you? Your enemies are the Elders among the Pures, who seek the utter destruction of you and your kind, not just on this continent, but across the entire world.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am sure you understood why we might object to such desires,’ the sorceress said, and now her servant arrived, delivering into the young woman’s plump hand a clay pipe. She puffed for a moment, and then continued, ‘And while you appear to be suggesting that you do not share the zeal of your Elder Pures, I cannot help but wonder what has brought you here, to me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have bargained with the Jaghut,’ said Equity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They share our aversion to your notions of justice.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Equity said, ‘I cannot understand what value the Jaghut see in you, a silly little girl playing at deadly magics, and beside you a lifeless abomination harbouring a parasite.’ She fixed her gaze upon the servant. ‘Is there a glamour about this one? If so, it is too subtle for me. Tell me, Sorceress, is she Jaghut?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My handmaid? Goodness, no!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEquity’s eyes settled upon the ship in the bay. ‘Is he there?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your ally – I would speak to him. Or her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoke billowed and streamed. ‘I’m sorry, what ally?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where hides the Jaghut?’ Equity demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, I see. You misapprehend. I struck no bargain with any particular Jaghut. I merely sacrificed some blood for the privilege of Omtose Phellack—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe undead captain turned on the sorceress. ‘You did what? Errant’s nudge – that storm! You can’t—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Necessity, Captain Elalle. Now please, cogitate in silence for the moment, will you?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-129.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
