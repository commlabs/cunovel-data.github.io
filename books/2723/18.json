I could feel my cheeks burning as I said, \"I\u0027m only two years younger than you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two and a quarter,\" he corrected automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay laughed, and I could smell his yeasty breath. \"Shit, my girlfriend was fifteen.\" Then he looked at me. \"Ex-girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled weakly. Inside, I was shrinking away from him and his breath. But the way Conrad was watching us, well, I liked it. I liked taking his friend away from him, even if it was just for five minutes. \"Isn\u0027t that, like, illegal?\" I asked Clay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again. \"You\u0027re cute, Belly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel myself blush. \"So, um, why did you break up?\" I asked, like I didn\u0027t already know. They broke up because Clay\u0027s a jerk, that was why. Clay had always been a jerk. He used to try to feed the seagulls Alka-Seltzer because he heard it made their stomachs blow up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay scratched the back of his neck. \"I don\u0027t know. She had to go to horse camp or something. Long distance relationships are BS.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it would just be for the summer,\" I protested. \"It\u0027s dumb to break up over a summer.\" I\u0027d nursed a crush on Conrad for whole school years. I could survive for months, years, on a crush. It was like food. It could sustain me. If Conrad was mine, there was no way I\u0027d break up with him over a summer--or a school year, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay looked at me with his heavy-lidded, sleepy eyes and said, \"Do you have a boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, and I couldn\u0027t help myself---I looked at Conrad when I said it. See, I was saying, I\u0027m not a stupid twelve-year-old girl with a crush anymore. I\u0027m a real person. With an actual boyfriend. Who cared if it wasn\u0027t true? Conrad\u0027s eyes flickered, but his face was the same, expressionless. Jeremiah, though, he looked surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belly, you have a boyfriend?\" He frowned. \"You never mentioned him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that serious.\" I picked at an unraveling thread on the seat cushion. I was already regretting making it up. \"In fact, we\u0027re really, really casual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See? Then what\u0027s the point of a relationship during summer? What if you meet people?\" Clay winked at me in a jokey way. \"Like right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve already met, Clay. Like, ten years ago.\" Not that he\u0027d ever actually paid me any attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nudged me with his knee. \"Nice to meet you. I\u0027m Clay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, even though it wasn\u0027t funny. It just felt like the right thing to do. \"Hi, I\u0027m Belly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Belly, are you gonna come to my bonfire tomorrow night?\" he asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, sure,\" I said, trying not to sound too excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad and Steven and Jeremiah went to the big Fourth of July bonfire every year. Clay had it at his house because there were a ton of fireworks on that end of the beach. His mom always put out stuff for s\u0027mores. I once made Jeremiah bring one back for me, and he did. It was rubbery and burnt, but I still ate it, and I was still grateful to Jeremiah for it. It was like a little piece of the party. They never let me go with them, and I never tried to make them. I watched the show from our back porch, in my pajamas, with Susannah and my mother. They drank champagne and I drank Martinelli\u0027s Sparkling Cider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you came down here to swim,\" Conrad said abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geez, give her a break, Con,\" Jeremiah said. \"If she wants to swim, she\u0027ll swim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe exchanged a look, our look that meant, Why is Conrad such a freaking dad? Conrad flicked his cigarette into his half-empty can. \"Do what you want,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" I said, sticking my tongue out at Conrad and standing up. I threw off my towel and dove into the water, a perfect swan dive. I stayed underwater for a minute. Then I started doing the backstroke so I could eavesdrop on their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a low voice I heard Clay say, \"Man, Cousins is starting to get old. I want to hurry up and get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, me too,\" Conrad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Conrad was ready to leave. Even though a little part of me knew that already, it still hurt. I wanted to say, Then leave already. If you don\u0027t want to be here, don\u0027t be here. Just leave. But I wasn\u0027t going to let Conrad bother me, not when things were finally looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last I was invited to Clay Bertolet\u0027s Fourth of July bonfire. I was one of the big kids now. Life was good. Or it was getting there, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about what I was going to wear all day. Since I\u0027d never been, I had no idea what to wear. Probably it would get cold, but who wanted to bundle up at a bonfire? Not for my first one. I also didn\u0027t want Conrad and Jeremiah to give me a hard time if I was too dressed up. I figured shorts, a tank top, and no shoes were the safe way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got there, I saw that I had chosen wrong. The other girls were wearing sundresses and little skirts and Uggs. If I\u0027d had girl friends at Cousins, I might have known that. \"You didn\u0027t tell me that girls got dressed up,\" I hissed at Jeremiah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look fine. Don\u0027t be dumb,\" he said, walking straight over to the keg. There was a keg. There were no graham crackers or marshmallows anywhere I could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d actually never seen a keg before in real life. Just in movies. I started to follow him, but Conrad grabbed my arm. \"Don\u0027t drink tonight,\" he warned. \"My mom will kill me if I let you drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook him off. \"You\u0027re not \u0027letting\u0027 me do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see,\" I said, walking away from him and toward the fire. I wasn\u0027t sure if I even wanted to drink. Even though I\u0027d seen Clay drinking the night before, I\u0027d still been expecting s\u0027mores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing to the bonfire was nice in theory, but actually being there was something else. Jeremiah was chatting up some girl in a red, white, and blue bikini top and a jean skirt, and Conrad was talking to Clay and some other guys I didn\u0027t recognize. I thought after the way Clay had been flirty last night, he might at least come over to say hi. But he didn\u0027t. He had his hand on some girl\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood by the fire alone and pretended to warm my hands even though they weren\u0027t cold. That\u0027s when I saw him. He was standing alone too, drinking a bottle of water. It didn\u0027t seem like he knew anybody either, since he was standing all by himself. He looked like he was my age. But there was something about him that seemed safe and comfortable, like he was younger than me even though he wasn\u0027t. It took me a few glances to figure out what it was. When I finally figured it out, it was like, Aha!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his eyelashes. They were so long they practically hit his cheekbones. Granted, his cheekbones were high, but still. Also, he had a slight underbite, and his skin was clear and smooth, the color of toasted coconut flakes, the kind you put on ice cream. I touched my cheek and Felt relieved that the sun had dried out the pimple from two days before. His skin was perfect. To my eyes, everything about him was pretty perfect. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-18.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
