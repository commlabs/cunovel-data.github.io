It will be too late to stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t rush into this.\" General Stephen Gossard turned to the head of the CIA. \"How hard is your information?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s difficult to say. We\u0027re fairly certain that Libya is buying a variety of weapons from Iran and China.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver turned to the secretary of state. \"Libya denies it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. So do China and Iran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver asked, \"What about the other Arab states?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CIA chief responded. \"From the information I have, Mr. President, if a serious attack is launched on Israel, I think it\u0027s going to be the excuse that all the other Arab states have been waiting for. They\u0027ll join in to wipe Israel out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all looking at Oliver expectantly. \"Do you have reliable assets in Libya?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want an update. Keep me informed. If there are signs of an attack, we have no choice but to move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting was adjourned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver\u0027s secretary\u0027s voice came over the intercom. \"Mr. Tager would like to see you, Mr. President.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have him come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did the meeting go?\" Peter Tager asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it was just your average meeting,\" Oliver said bitterly, \"about whether I want to start a war now or later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTager said sympathetically, \"It goes with the territory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something of interest has come up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Tager took a seat. \"What do you know about the United Arab Emirates?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a lot,\" Oliver said. \"Five or six Arab states got together twenty years ago or so and formed a coalition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven of them. They joined together in 1971. Abu Dhabi, Fujaira, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras al-Khaimah, Umm al-Qaiwan, and Ajman. When they started out, they weren\u0027t very strong, but the Emirates have been incredibly well run. Today they have one of the world\u0027s highest standards of living. Their gross domestic product last year was over thirty-nine billion dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver said impatiently, \"I assume there\u0027s a point to this, Peter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. The head of the council of the United Arab Emirates wants to meet with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I\u0027ll have the secretary of defense - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today. In private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious? I couldn\u0027t possibly - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oliver, the Majlis - their council - is one of the most important Arab influences in the world. It has the respect of every other Arab nation. This could be an important breakthrough. I know this is unorthodox, but I think you should meet with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"State would have a fit if I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make the arrangements.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. \"Where do they want to meet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have a yacht anchored in Chesapeake Bay, near Annapolis. I can get you there quietly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver sat there, studying the ceiling. Finally, he leaned forward and pressed down the intercom switch. \"Cancel my appointments for this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe yacht, a 212-foot Feadship, was moored at the dock. They were waiting for him. All the crew members were Arabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome, Mr. President.\" It was Ali al-Fulani, the secretary at one of the United Arab Emirates. \"Please come aboard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver stepped aboard and Ali al-Fulani signaled to one of the men. A few moments later, the yacht was underway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we go below?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Where I can be killed or kidnapped. This is the stupidest thing I have ever done, Oliver decided. Maybe they brought me here so they can begin their attack on Israel, and I won\u0027t be able to give orders to retaliate. Why the hell did I let Tager talk me into this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver followed Ali al-Fulani downstairs into the sumptuous main saloon, which was decorated in Middle Eastern style. There were four muscular Arabs standing on guard in the saloon. An imposing-looking man seated on the couch rose as Oliver came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAli al-Fulani said, \"Mr. President, His Majesty King Hamad of Ajman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men shook hands. \"Your Majesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for coming, Mr. President. Would you care for some tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you will find this visit well worth your while.\" King Hamad began to pace. \"Mr. President, over the centuries, it has been difficult, if not impossible, to bridge the problems that divide us - philosophical, linguistic, religious, cultural. Those are the reasons there have been so many wars in our part of the world. If Jews confiscate the land of Palestinians, no one in Omaha or Kansas is affected. Their lives go on the same. If a synagogue in Jerusalem is bombed, the Italians in Rome and Venice pay no attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver wondered where this was heading. Was it a warning of a coming war?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is only one part of the world that suffers from all the wars and bloodshed in the Middle East. And that is the Middle East.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down across from Oliver. \"It is time for us to put a stop to this madness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere it comes, Oliver thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The heads of the Arab states and the Majlis have authorized me to make you an offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of an offer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An offer of peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver blinked. \"Peace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want to make peace with your ally, Israel. Your embargoes against Iran and other Arab countries have cost us untold billions of dollars. We want to put an end to that. If the United States will act as a sponsor, the Arab countries - including Iran, Libya, and Syria - have agreed to sit down and negotiate a permanent peace treaty with Israel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver was stunned. When he found his voice, he said, \"You\u0027re doing this because - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assure you it is not out of love for the Israelis or for the Americans. It is in our own interests. Too many of our sons have been killed in this madness. We want it to end. It is enough. We want to be free to sell all our oil to the world again. We are prepared to go to war if necessary, but we would prefer peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver took a deep breath. \"I think I would like some tea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you had been there,\" Oliver said to Peter Tager. \"It was incredible. They\u0027re ready to go to war, but they don\u0027t want to. They\u0027re pragmatists. They want to sell their oil to the world, so they want peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fantastic,\" Tager said enthusiastically. \"When this gets out, you\u0027re going to be a hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I can do this on my own,\" Oliver told him. \"It doesn\u0027t have to go through Congress. I\u0027ll have a talk with the Prime Minister of Israel. We\u0027ll help him make a deal with the Arab countries.\" He looked at Tager and said ruefully, \"For a few minutes there, I thought I was going to be kidnapped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No chance,\" Peter Tager assured him. \"I had a boat and a helicopter following you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Senator Davis is here to see you, Mr. President. He has no appointment, but he says it\u0027s urgent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold up my next appointment and send the senator in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Todd Davis walked into the Oval Office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a nice surprise, Todd. Is everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenator Davis took a seat. \"Fine, Oliver. I just thought you and I should have a little chat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver smiled. \"I have a pretty full schedule today, but for you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will take only a few minutes. I ran into Peter Tager. He told me about your meeting with the Arabs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver grinned. \"Isn\u0027t that wonderful? It looks like we\u0027re finally going to have peace in the Middle East.\" He slammed a fist on the desk. \"After all these decades! That\u0027s what my administration is going to be remembered for, Todd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenator Davis asked quietly, \"Have you thought this through, Oliver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver frowned. \"What? What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peace is a simple word, but it has a lot of ramifications. Peace doesn\u0027t have any financial benefits. When there\u0027s a war, countries buy billions of dollars\u0027 worth of armaments that are made here in the United States. In peacetime, they don\u0027t need any. Because Iran can\u0027t sell its oil, oil prices are up, and the United States gets the benefit of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver was listening to him unbelievingly. \"Todd - this is the opportunity of a lifetime!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be naive, Oliver. If we had really wanted to make peace between Israel and the Arab countries, we could have done it long ago. Israel is a tiny country. Any one of the last half-dozen presidents could have forced them to make a deal with the Arabs, but they preferred to keep things as they were. Don\u0027t misunderstand me. Jews are fine people. I work with some of them in the Senate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe that you can - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe what you like, Oliver. A peace treaty now would not be in the best interest of this country. I don\u0027t want you to go ahead with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go ahead with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me what you have to do, Oliver.\" Senator Davis leaned forward. \"I\u0027ll tell you. Don\u0027t forget who put you in that chair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver said quietly, \"Todd, you may not respect me, but you must respect this office. Regardless of who put me here, I\u0027m the president.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenator Davis got to his feet. \"The president? You\u0027re a fucking blow-up toy! You\u0027re my dummy, Oliver. You take orders, you don\u0027t give them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver looked at him for a long moment. \"How many oil fields do you and your friends own, Todd?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s none of your goddam business. If you go through with this, you\u0027re finished. Do you hear me? I\u0027m giving you twenty-four hours to come to your senses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt dinner that evening, Jan said, \"Father asked me to talk to you, Oliver. He\u0027s very upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked across the table at his wife and thought, I\u0027m going to have to fight you, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told me what was happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She leaned across the table. \"And I think what you\u0027re going to do is wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for Oliver to understand. \"But your father\u0027s against it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. And he\u0027s wrong. If they\u0027re willing to make peace - you have to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver sat there listening to Jan\u0027s words, studying her. He thought about how well she had handled herself as the First Lady. She had become involved in important charities and had been an advocate for a half-dozen major causes. She was lovely and intelligent and caring and - it was as though Oliver were seeing her for the first time. Why have I been running around? Oliver thought. I have everything I need right here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will it be a long meeting tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Oliver said slowly. \"I\u0027m going to cancel it. I\u0027m staying home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat evening, Oliver made love to Jan for the first time in weeks, and it was wonderful. And in the morning, he thought, I\u0027m going to have Peter get rid of the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe note was on his desk the next morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want you to know that I am a real fan of yours, and I would not do anything to harm you. I was in the garage of the Monroe Arms on the 15th, and I was very surprised to see you there. The next day when I read about the murder of that young girl, I knew why you went back to wipe your fingerprints off the elevator buttons. I\u0027m sure that all the newspapers would be interested in my story and would pay me a lot of money. But like I said, I\u0027m a fan of yours. I certainly would not want to do anything to hurt you. I could use some financial help, and if you are interested, this will be just between us. I will get in touch with you in a few days while you think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSincerely,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA friend\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Sime Lombardo said softly. \"This is incredible. How was it delivered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was mailed,\" Peter Tager told him. \"Addressed to the president, \u0027Personal.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSime Lombardo said, \"It could be some nut who\u0027s just trying to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t take a chance, Sime. I don\u0027t believe for a minute that it\u0027s true, but if even a whisper of this gets out, it would destroy the president We must protect him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do we do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First, we have to find out who sent this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Tager was at the Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters at 10th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, talking to Special Agent Clay Jacobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it was urgent, Peter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Peter Tager opened a briefcase and took out a single sheet of paper. He slid it across the desk. Clay Jacobs picked it up and read it aloud:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027I want you to know that I\u0027m a real fan of yours...I will get in touch with you in a few days while you think about it.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in between had been whited out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacobs looked up. \"What is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It involves the highest security,\" Peter Tager said. \"The president asked me to try to find out who sent it. He would like you to check it for fingerprints.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay Jacobs studied the paper again, frowning. \"This is highly unusual, Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It just smells wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the president wants is for you to give him the name of the individual who wrote it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assuming his fingerprints are on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Tager nodded. \"Assuming his fingerprints are on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait here.\" Jacobs rose and left the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Tager sat there looking out the window, thinking about the letter and its possible terrible consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly seven minutes later, Clay Jacobs returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in luck,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Tager\u0027s heart began to race. \"You found something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Jacobs handed Tager a slip of paper. \"The man you\u0027re looking for was involved in a traffic accident about a year ago. His name is Carl Gorman. He works as a clerk at the Monroe Arms.\" He stood there a moment, studying Tager. \"Is there anything else you\u0027d like to tell me about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Peter Tager said sincerely. \"There isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frank Lonergan is on line three, Miss Stewart. He says it\u0027s urgent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take it.\" Leslie picked up the telephone and pressed a button. \"Frank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him take a deep breath. \"Okay. Here we go.\" He spoke for the next ten minutes without interruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeslie Stewart hurried into Matt Baker\u0027s office. \"We have to talk, Matt.\" She sat down across from his desk. \"What if I told you that Oliver Russell is involved in the murder of Chloe Houston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For openers, I\u0027d say you are paranoid and that you\u0027ve gone over the edge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frank Lonergan just phoned in. He talked to Governor Houston, who doesn\u0027t believe that Paul Yerby killed her daughter. He talked to Paul Yerby\u0027s parents. They don\u0027t believe it either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t expect them to,\" Matt Baker said. \"If that\u0027s the only - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just the beginning. Frank went down to the morgue and spoke to the coroner. She told him that the kid\u0027s belt was so tight that they had to cut it away from his throat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was listening more intently now. \"And - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frank went down to pick up Yerby\u0027s belongings. His belt was there. Intact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt Baker drew a deep breath. \"You\u0027re telling me that he was murdered in prison and that there was a cover-up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not telling you anything. I\u0027m just reporting the facts. Oliver Russell tried to get me to use Ecstasy once. When he was running for governor, a woman who was a legal secretary died from Ecstasy. While he was governor, his secretary was found in a park in an Ecstasy-induced coma. Lonergan learned that Oliver called the hospital and suggested they take her off life-support systems.\" Leslie leaned forward. \"There was a telephone call from the Imperial Suite to the White House the night Chloe Houston was murdered. Frank checked the hotel telephone records. The page for the fifteenth was missing. The president\u0027s appointments secretary told Lonergan that the president had a meeting with General Whitman that night. There was no meeting. Frank spoke to Governor Houston, and she said that Chloe was on a tour of the White House and that she had arranged for her daughter to meet the president.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. \"Where\u0027s Frank Lonergan now?\" Matt Baker asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s tracking down Carl Gorman, the hotel clerk who booked the Imperial Suite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Robinson was saying, \"I\u0027m sorry. We don\u0027t give out personal information about our employees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Lonergan said, \"All I\u0027m asking for is his home address so I can - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t do you any good. Mr. Gorman is on vacation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonergan sighed. \"That\u0027s too bad. I was hoping he could fill in a few blank spots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blank spots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. We\u0027re doing a big story on the death of Governor Houston\u0027s daughter in your hotel. Well, I\u0027ll just have to piece it together without Gorman.\" He took out a pad and a pen. \"How long has this hotel been here? I want to know all about its background, its clientele, its - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy Robinson frowned. \"Wait a minute! Surely that\u0027s not necessary. I mean - she could have died anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Lonergan said sympathetically, \"I know, but it happened here. Your hotel is going to become as famous as Watergate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lonergan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Lonergan, I would appreciate it if you could - I mean this kind of publicity is very bad. Isn\u0027t there some way - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonergan was thoughtful for a moment. \"Well, if I spoke to Mr. Gorman, I suppose I could find a different angle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would really appreciate that. Let me get you his address.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Lonergan was becoming nervous. As the outline of events began to take shape, it became clear that there was a murder conspiracy and a cover-up at the highest level. Before he went to see the hotel clerk, he decided to stop at his apartment house. His wife, Rita, was in the kitchen preparing dinner. She was a petite redhead with sparkling green eyes and a fair complexion. She turned in surprise as her husband walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frank, what are you doing home in the middle of the day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just thought I\u0027d drop in and say hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at his face. \"No. There\u0027s something going on. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"How long has it been since you\u0027ve seen your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw her last week. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you go visit her again, honey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is anything wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Wrong?\" He walked over to the mantel. \"You\u0027d better start dusting this off. We\u0027re going to put a Pulitzer Prize here and a Peabody Award here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on to something that\u0027s going to blow everybody away - and I mean people in high places. It\u0027s the most exciting story I\u0027ve ever been involved in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you want me to go see my mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"There\u0027s just an outside chance that this could get to be a little dangerous. There are some people who don\u0027t want this story to get out. I\u0027d feel better if you were away for a few days, just until this breaks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you\u0027re in danger - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not in any danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure nothing\u0027s going to happen to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Positive. Pack a few things, and I\u0027ll call you tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Rita said reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonergan looked at his watch. \"I\u0027ll drive you to the train station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hour later, Lonergan stopped in front of a modest brick house in the Wheaton area. He got out of the car, walked to the front door, and rang the bell. There was no answer. He rang again and waited. The door suddenly swung open and a heavyset middle-aged woman stood in the doorway, regarding him suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with the Internal Revenue Service,\" Lonergan said. He flashed a piece of identification. \"I want to see Carl Gorman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother\u0027s not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Too fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonergan nodded. \"That\u0027s a shame. Well, you might as well start packing up his things. I\u0027ll have the department send over the vans.\" Lonergan started back down the driveway toward his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute! What vans? What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonergan stopped and turned. \"Didn\u0027t your brother tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonergan took a few steps back toward the house. \"He\u0027s in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him anxiously. \"What kind of trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not at liberty to discuss it.\" He shook his head. \"He seems like a nice guy, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is,\" she said fervently. \"Carl is a wonderful person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonergan nodded. \"That was my feeling when we were questioning him down at the bureau.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was panicky. \"Questioning him about what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cheating on his income tax. It\u0027s too bad. I wanted to tell him about a loophole that could have helped him out, but - \" He shrugged. \"If he\u0027s not here...\" He turned to go again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! He\u0027s - he\u0027s at a fishing lodge. I - I\u0027m not supposed to tell anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"That\u0027s okay with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...but this is different. It\u0027s the Sunshine Fishing Lodge on the lake in Richmond, Virginia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027ll contact him there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be wonderful. You\u0027re sure he\u0027ll be all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" Lonergan said. \"I\u0027ll see that he\u0027s taken care of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonergan took 1-95, heading south. Richmond was a little over a hundred miles away. On a vacation, years ago, Lonergan had fished the lake, and he had been lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped he would be as lucky this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was drizzling, but Carl Gorman did not mind. That\u0027s when the fish were supposed to bite. He was fishing for striped bass, using large minnows on slip bobbers, far out behind the rowboat. The waves lapped against the small boat in the middle of the lake, and the bait drifted behind the boat, untouched. The fish were in no hurry. It did not matter. Neither was he. He had never been happier. He was going to be rich beyond his wildest dreams. It had been sheer luck. You have to be at the right place at the right time. He had returned to the Monroe Arms to pick up a jacket he had forgotten and was about to leave the garage when the private elevator door opened. When he saw who got out, he had sat in his car, stunned. He had watched the man return, wipe off his fingerprints, then drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not until he read about the murder the following day that he had put it all together. In a way, he felt sorry for the man. I really am a fan of his. The trouble is, when you\u0027re that famous, you can never hide. Wherever you go, the world knows you. He\u0027ll pay me to be quiet. He has no choice. I\u0027ll start with a hundred thousand. Once he pays that, he\u0027ll have to keep paying. Maybe I\u0027ll buy a chateau in France or a chalet in Switzerland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a tug at the end of his line and snapped the rod toward him. He could feel the fish trying to get away. You\u0027re not going anywhere. I\u0027ve got you hooked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, he heard a large speedboat approaching. They shouldn\u0027t allow power boats on the lake. They\u0027ll scare all the fish away. The speedboat was bearing down on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get too close,\" Carl shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speedboat seemed to be heading right toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Be careful. Watch where you\u0027re going. For God\u0027s sake - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speedboat plowed into the rowboat, cutting it in half, the water sucking Gorman under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn drunken fool! He was gasping for air. He managed to get his head above water. The speedboat had circled and was heading straight for him again. And the last thing Carl Gorman felt before the boat smashed into his skull was the tug of the fish on his line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Frank Lonergan arrived, the area was crowded with police cars, a fire engine, and an ambulance. The ambulance was just pulling away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Lonergan got out of his car and said to a bystander, \"What\u0027s all the excitement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some poor guy was in an accident on the lake. There\u0027s not much left of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Lonergan knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt midnight, Frank Lonergan was working at his computer, alone in his apartment, writing the story that was going to destroy the President of the United States. It was a story that would earn him a Pulitzer Prize. There was no doubt about it in his mind. This was going to make him more famous than Woodward and Bernstein. It was the story of the century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. He got up and walked over to the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A package from Leslie Stewart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s found some new information. He opened the door. There was a glint of metal, and an unbearable pain tore his chest apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen nothing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-best-laid-plans/page-19.html","bookId":2367,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:22 AM"}
