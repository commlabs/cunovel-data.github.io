Always wash the blood off before coming in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stood at the outdoor faucet, icy-cold water splashing over her hands. She was scrubbing- carefully-a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elong, slim dagger made of split bamboo, with a cutting edge as sharp as glass. When it was clean, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eslipped it into her right knee-high boot. Then she daubed water over several stains on her T-shirt and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejeans and scrubbed them with a fingernail. Finally she whipped out a pocket mirror and examined her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eface critically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl who looked back didn\u0027t much resemble the wild, laughing huntress who had leaped from tree to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etree in Muir Woods. Oh, the features were the same; the height of cheekbone, the curve of chin. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad even fined out a bit because she was a year older. The red flag of hair was the same, too, although\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow it was pulled back in an attempt to tame its fiery disorder. The difference was in the expression,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhich was sadder and wiser than Jez had ever imagined she could be, and in the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes weren\u0027t as silvery as they had been, not as dangerously beautiful. But that was only to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpected. She had discovered that she didn\u0027t need to drink blood as long as she didn\u0027t use her vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epowers. Human food kept her alive-and made her look more human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne other thing about the eyes. They were scarily vulnerable, even to Jez. No matter how she tried to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emake them hard and menacing, they had the wounded look of a deer that knows it\u0027s going to die and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaccepts it. Sometimes she wondered if that was an omen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell. No blood on her face. She shoved the mirror back in her pocket. She was mostly presentable, if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eextremely late for dinner. She turned the faucet off and headed for the back door of the low, sweeping\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eranch house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked up as she came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe family was in the kitchen, eating at the oak table with the white trim, under the bright fluorescent\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elight. The TV was blaring cheerfully from the family room. Uncle Jim, her mother\u0027s brother, was munching\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etacos and leafing through the mail. He had red hair darker than Jez\u0027s and a long face that looked almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas medieval as Jez\u0027s mother\u0027s had. He was usually off in a gentle, worried dream somewhere. Now he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewaved an envelope at Jez and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egazed at her reproachfully, but he couldn\u0027t say anything because his mouth was full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Nanami was on the phone, drinking a diet Coke. She was small, with dark shiny hair and eyes that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned to crescents when she smiled. She opened her mouth and frowned at Jez, but couldn\u0027t say\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanything, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicky, who was ten, had carroty hair and expressive eyebrows. He gave Jez a big smile that showed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echewed-up taco in his mouth and said, \"Hi!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez smiled back. No matter what she did, Ricky was there for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire, who was Jez\u0027s age, was sitting primly, eating bits of taco with her fork. She looked like a smaller\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eversion of Aunt Nan, but with a very sour expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been?\" she said. \"We waited dinner almost an hour for you and you never even\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecalled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Jez said, looking at all of them. It was such an incredibly normal family scene, so completely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etypical, and it struck her to the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was over a year since she had walked out of the Night World to find these people, her mother\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erelatives. It was eleven and a half months since Uncle Jim had taken her in, not knowing anything about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher except that she was his orphaned niece and that her father\u0027s family couldn\u0027t handle her anymore and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad given up on her. All these months, she had lived with the Goddard family- and she still didn\u0027t fit in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could look human, she could act human, but she couldn\u0027t be human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as Uncle Jim swallowed and got his mouth clear to speak to her, she said, \"I\u0027m not hungry. I think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll just go do my homework.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jim called, \"Wait a minute,\" after her, but it was Claire who slammed down her napkin and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eactually followed Jez through the hall to the other side of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, \u0027Sorry\u0027? You do this every day. You\u0027re always disappearing; half the time you stay\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout until after midnight, and then you don\u0027t even have an explanation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know, Claire.\" Jez answered without looking back. \"Illtry to do better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say that every time. And every time it\u0027s exactly the same. Don\u0027t you realize that my parents worry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout you? Don\u0027t you even care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I care, Claire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t act like it. You act like rules don\u0027t apply to you. And you say sorry, but you\u0027re just going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez had to keep herself from turning around and snapping at her cousin. She liked everyone else in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efamily, but Claire was a royal pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorse, she was a shrewd royal pain. And she was right; Jez was going to do it again, and there was no\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eway she could explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing was, vampire hunters have to keep weird hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0027re on the trail of a vampire-and-shapeshifter killing team, as Jez had been this evening, chasing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem through the slums ofOakland , trying to get them cornered in some crack house\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere there aren\u0027t little kids to get hurt, you don\u0027t think about missing dinner. You don\u0027t stop in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emiddle of staking the undead to phone home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I shouldn\u0027t have become a vampire hunter, Jez thought. But it\u0027s a little late to change now, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomebody\u0027s got to protect these stupid- these innocent humans from the Night World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d reached the door of her bedroom. Instead of yelling at her cousin, she simply half turned and said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you go work on your Web page, Claire?\" Then she opened the door and glanced inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer room, which she had left in military neatness, was a shambles. The window was wide open. Papers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand clothes were scattered across the floor. And there was a very large ghoul standing at the foot of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghoul opened its mouth menacingly at Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, very funny,\" Claire was saying, right behind her. \"Maybe I should help you with your homework. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehear you\u0027re not doing so great in chemistry-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez moved fast, stepping nimbly inside the door and slamming it in Claire\u0027s face, pressing the little knob in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe handle to lock it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Now Claire sounded really mad. \"That\u0027s rude!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, sorry, Claire!\" Jez faced the ghoul. What was it doing here? If it had followed her home, she was in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebad trouble. That meant the Night World\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknew where she was. \"You know, Claire, I think I really need to be alone for a little while-I can\u0027t talk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand do my homework.\" She took a step toward the creature, watching its reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhouls were semi-vampires. They were what happened to a human who was bled out but didn\u0027t get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equite enough vampire blood in exchange to become a true vampire. They were undead but rotting. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad very little mind, and only one idea in the world: to drink blood, which they usually did by eating as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuch of a human body as possible. They liked hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ghoul was a new one, about two weeks dead. It was male and looked as if it had been a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebody-builder, although by now it wasn\u0027t so much buff as puffed. Its body was swollen with the gas of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edecomposition. Its tongue and eyes were protruding, its cheeks were chipmunk-like, and bloody fluid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas leaking from its nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course it didn\u0027t smell good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jez edged closer, she suddenly realized that the ghoul wasn\u0027t alone. She could now see around the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efoot of the bed, and there was a boy lying on the carpet, apparently unconscious. The boy had light hair\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand rumpled clothes, but Jez couldn\u0027t see his face. The ghoul was stooping over him, reaching for him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith sausage-shaped fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" Jez told it softly. She could feel a dangerous smile settling on her face. She reached\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einto her right boot and pulled out the dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\" Claire shouted from the other side of the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, Claire. Just getting out my homework.\" Jez jumped onto the bed The ghoul was very big-she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneeded all the height she could get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghoul turned to face her, its lackluster bugeyes on the dagger. It made a little hissing sound around\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eits swollen tongue. Fortunately that was all the noise it could make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire was rattling the door. \"Did you lock this? What are you doing in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just studying, Claire. Go away.\" Jez snapped a foot toward the ghoul, catching it under the chin. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneeded to stun it and stake it fast Ghouls weren\u0027t smart, but like the Energizer Bunny they kept going and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing. This one could eat the entire Goddard family tonight and still be hungry at dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghoul hit the wall opposite the bed. Jez jumped down, putting herself between it and the boy on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efloor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that noise?\" Claire yelled. \"I dropped a book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghoul swung. Jez ducked. There were giant blisters on its arms, the brownish color of old blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt rushed her, trying to slam her against the chest of drawers. Jez flung herself backward, but she didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave much room to maneuver. It caught her in the stomach with an elbow, a jarring blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez wouldn\u0027t let herself double over. She twisted and helped the ghoul in the direction it was already\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing, giving it impetus with her foot. It smacked into the window seat, facedown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is going on in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just looking for something.\" Jez moved before the ghoul could recover, jumping to straddle its legs. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrabbed its hair-not a good idea; it came off in clumps in her hand. Kneeling on it to keep it still, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eraised the sum bamboo knife high and brought it down hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a puncturing sound and a terrible smell. The knife had penetrated just under the shoulder\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblade, six inches into the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghoul convulsed once and stopped moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire\u0027s voice came piercingly from behind the closed door. \"Mom! She\u0027s doing something in there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Aunt Nan\u0027s voice: \"Jez, are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stood, pulling her bamboo dagger out, wiping it on the ghoul\u0027s shirt. \"I\u0027m just having a little trouble\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efinding a ruler....\" The ghoul was in a perfect position. She put her arms around its waist, ignoring the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeeling of skin slipping loose under her fingers, and heaved it up onto the window seat. There weren\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emany human girls who could have picked up almost two hundred pounds of dead weight, and even Jez\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eended up a little breathless. She gave the ghoul a shove, rolling it over until it reached the open window,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen she stuffed and maneuvered it out. It fell heavily into a bed of impatiens, squashing the flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. She\u0027d haul it away later tonight and dispose of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez caught her breath, brushed off her hands, and closed the window. She drew the curtains shut, then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned. The fair-haired boy was lying perfectly still. Jez touched his back gently, saw that he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door rattled and Claire\u0027s voice rose hysterically. \"Mom, do you smell that smell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Nan called, \"Jez!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming!\" Jez glanced around the room. She needed something... there. The bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing a handful of material near the head of the bed, she flipped comforter, blankets and sheets over\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso they trailed off the foot, completely covering the boy. She tossed a couple of pillows on top of the pile\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor good measure, then grabbed a ruler off the desk. Then she opened the door, leaned against the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoorframe casually, and summoned her brightest smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about that,\" she said. \"What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire and Aunt Nan just stared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire looked like a rumpled, angry kitten. The fine dark hair that framed her face was ruffled; she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreathing hard, and her almond-shaped eyes were flashing sparks. Aunt Nan looked more worried and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edismayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" she said, leaning in slightly to try and get a look at Jez\u0027s room. \"We heard a lot of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enoise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you\u0027d have heard more earlier if you hadn\u0027t been watching TV. \"I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m great. You know how\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit is when you can\u0027t find something.\" Jez lifted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe ruler. Then she stepped back and opened the door farther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Nan\u0027s eyes widened as she took in the mess. \"Jez... this does not happen when you can\u0027t find a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eruler. This looks like Claire\u0027s room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire made a choked sound of indignation. \"It does not. My room\u0027s never been this bad. And what\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat smell?\" She slipped by Aunt Nan and advanced on Jez, who sidestepped to keep her from getting to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe pile of blankets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire stopped dead anyway, her face wrinkling. She put a hand to cover her nose and mouth. \"It\u0027s you,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said, pointing at Jez. \u0027You smell like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" It was true; what with all the contact she\u0027d had with the ghoul, and the dirty knife in her boot,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was pretty ripe. \"I think I stepped in something on the way home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t smell anything when you came in,\" Claire said suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s another thing,\" Aunt Nan said. She had been glancing around the room, but there was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enothing suspicious to see except the unusual clutter-the curtains hung motionless over the shut window;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe pile of bedding on the floor was still. Now she turned to face Jez again. \"You didn\u0027t call to say you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere going to miss dinner again. I need to know where you go after school, Jez. I need to know when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027re going to be out late. It\u0027s common courtesy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027ll remember next time. I really will.\" Jez said it as sincerely as possible, and in a tone she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehoped would close the subject. She needed to get rid of these people and look at the boy under the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblankets. He might be seriously hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Nan was nodding. \"You\u0027d better. And you\u0027d better take a shower before you do anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrow your clothes in the laundry room; I\u0027ll put them in the wash.\" She made as if to kiss Jez on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echeek, but stopped, wrinkled her nose, and then just nodded again at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s it? That\u0027s all?\" Claire was looking at her mother in disbelief. \"Mom, she\u0027s up to something,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan\u0027t you see that? She comes in late, smelling like dead skunk and sewage and I don\u0027t know what, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen she locks herself in and bangs around and lies, and all you\u0027re going to say is Don\u0027t do it again\u0027? She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egets away with everything around here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire, quit it. She said she was sorry. I\u0027m sure she won\u0027t let it happen again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I did something like that you\u0027d skin me, but, no, if Jez does it, it must be okay. Well, I\u0027ll tell you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething else. She cut school today. She left before sixth period.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that true, Jez?\" a new voice asked. Uncle Jim was standing in the doorway, pulling at his chin with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elong fingers. He looked sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. Jez had left early to set up a trap for the vampire and shapeshifter. She looked at her uncle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand made a regretful motion with her head and shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez, you just can\u0027t do that. I\u0027m trying to be reasonable, but this is only the second week of school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0027t start this kind of behavior again. It can\u0027t be like last year.\" He thought. \"From now on, you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleave your motorcycle at home. You drive to school and back with Claire, in the Audi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez nodded. \"Okay, Uncle Jim,\" she said out loud. Now go away, she added silently. Thin curls of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanxiety were churning in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" He smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" Claire jumped in, her voice hitting a note to shatter glass. \"This is just what I\u0027m talking about! You\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enever yell at her, either! Is it because you\u0027re afraid she\u0027ll run away, like she did from her dad\u0027s relatives?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo everybody has to walk on eggshells around her because otherwise she\u0027ll just take off-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, that\u0027s it. I\u0027m not listening to any more of this.\" Aunt Nan waved a hand at Claire, then turned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound to shoo Uncle Jim out of her path. Tm going to clean up the dinner table. If you two want to fight,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo it quietly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s better if they do their homework,\" Uncle Jim said, moving slowly. \"Both of you, do your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehomework, okay?\" He looked at Jez in a way that was probably meant to be commanding, but came out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewistful. \"And tomorrow come home on time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez nodded. Then both adults were gone, but Claire was staring after them. Jez couldn\u0027t be sure, but she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought there were tears in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez felt a pang. Of course, Claire was dead on about the leeway Aunt Nan and Uncle Jim gave her. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof course, it wasn\u0027t fair to Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should say something to her. Poor little thing. She really feels bad....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before she could open her mouth, Claire whirled around. The eyes that had been wet a moment ago\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere flashing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just wait,\" she said. \"They don\u0027t see through you, but I do. You\u0027re up to something, and I\u0027m going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto find out what it is. And don\u0027t think I can\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and stalked out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stood for an instant, speechless, then she blinked and closed the door. She locked it. And then for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe first time since she\u0027d seen the ghoul, she allowed herself to let out a long breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been close. And Claire was serious, which was going to be a problem. But Jez didn\u0027t have time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto think about it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned the clock radio on her nightstand to a rock station. A loud one. Then she flipped the covers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoff the foot of the bed and knelt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was lying facedown, with one arm stretched over his head. Jez couldn\u0027t see any blood. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etook his shoulder and carefully rolled him over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd stopped breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-4.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
