{"id":8441,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. ROBERT SUBDUES A HORSE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;ROBERT somehow had an objection to sending to Dr. Grey for money, though the money was his own. It seemed like a confession of failure, and he did not care to write what sort of an accident had befallen him, since it would involve long explanations. Therefore, though he had but a dollar and a half left, he decided to set out on his way home; that is, towards the East, trusting to luck to get along. Though this was, perhaps rash, it was not so rash in Robert\u0027s case as it would have been in the case of an average boy, for he had been accustomed to earn his own living and possessed some talents and accomplishments which he could turn to account. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took leave of his good friends, the Lathrops, without betraying to them his condition, or they would have insisted upon giving him substantial aid. As it was, Mrs. Lathrop insisted upon preparing,226 with her own hands, a substantial lunch, which in due time Robert found very acceptable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He set out on his journey on foot. His small capital would not allow him to travel in any other way. His clothes had been dried and pressed, and he presented a neat appearance, so that he was not likely to be taken for a tramp, though in his earlier days he had travelled in that character.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He walked in a leisurely way during the forenoon, and about noon sat down under a tree and ate his lunch. It was a plentiful one, but Robert, whose appetite had been sharpened by his walk, did full justice to it. In fact he ate it all.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s no particular hurry,\" he thought; \"I may as well lie here for awhile and rest during the heat of the day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was not quite 2 o\u0027clock when he was roused from a revery by hearing carriage wheels. He looked up and saw a lady in a four-wheel carriage, drawn by a horse who was inclined to be fractious. The lady driver was evidently anxious, for she pulled the reins frantically, and called out, \"Whoa! you sir! Why don\u0027t you behave? Oh dear, what shall I do?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The horse shook his head, pranced, backed,227 and was evidently prepared to make trouble, much to the discomfort and alarm of the lady.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, dear! I wish I hadn\u0027t come alone!\" she exclaimed. \"I didn\u0027t think Prince would behave so. It\u0027s lucky if I don\u0027t get my neck broken!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The horse was quite aware that he was master of the situation, and that his driver had lost her presence of mind, and, with a perversity which we sometimes see in horses, made up his mind to act as badly as possible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So occupied was the lady that she did not see the boy, who sat under a tree by the roadside, nor suspected that in him she was to find a deliverer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If there was any one accustomed to horses, and utterly without fear of them, it was Robert, as may be supposed from the nature of his training. He sprang to his feet when he perceived the situation, and, running forward, took off his hat, and asked politely, \"Can I be of any service to you, madam?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Can you drive horses?\" asked the lady, doubtfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert smiled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m used to them,\" he answered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 228\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then won\u0027t you get in and drive for me? Prince is acting very badly to-day.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert did not wait for the carriage to stop, but with his usual activity clambered in, and was at the lady\u0027s side in an instant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now,\" he said, \"let me take the reins.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you are sure that you can drive,\" said Miss Stafford, doubtfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You shall see for yourself,\" answered Robert, confidently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He held the reins with a firm hand. The horse, though immediately sensible that there was a new hand at the helm, if I may speak figuratively, wasn\u0027t quite ready to yield.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seeing that he was still fractious, Robert took the whip and brought it down smartly on the horse\u0027s flanks.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, what are you doing?\" asked the lady in alarm. \"Prince will run away with us!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let him try it,\" said Robert, his eyes flashing. \"If I can\u0027t subdue him, I\u0027ll sell out to some one that can!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was a boy\u0027s expression, but his confident manner served to reassure Miss Stafford, though Prince did really undertake to run. The road,229 however, was good, there were no carriages to encounter, and Robert gave him his head, holding the reins, however, in a strong, firm grasp.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I never rode so fast in my life!\" said Miss Stafford nervously, as they flew over the road. \"Don\u0027t let us tip over.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, ma\u0027am, I won\u0027t.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After a while Prince slackened his speed. It was rather a warm day, and he found that it was not quite so good fun running as he found it when he felt that his driver was frightened—now the least sign of fractiousness was instantly followed by a smart stroke of the whip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I believe you do understand horses,\" said Miss Stafford at length.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s my business to understand them,\" answered Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You ain\u0027t a—jockey, are you?\" asked the lady.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I have been a circus-rider.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t say so!\" ejaculated the lady. \"You can\u0027t jump through hoops and all them things, can you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are not with a circus now, are you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert explained that he had left circus life230 for a time, but had been thrown out of employment unexpectedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am going to a birthday party of a little niece of mine,\" said Miss Stafford. \"She is twelve years old to-day. There will be twenty or thirty boys and girls there. I wish you could do something to amuse them. It would make us all the more welcome.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am a little of a magician,\" said Robert. \"If you think they would like to see some tricks—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The very thing!\" exclaimed Miss Stafford, enthusiastically. \"They are all fond of tricks. Where did you learn?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Miss Stafford was informed that Robert had learned of a real magician, that is of a professor of magic, she was very much pleased.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will engage you, then,\" she said, \"for the afternoon and evening. When I say engage you, I mean I will pay you for your trouble.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I won\u0027t charge anything,\" said Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you must!\" said the lady positively. \"Louisa Stafford never allows any one to work for nothing. Besides you have perhaps prevented Prince here from breaking my neck. I certainly won\u0027t be mean enough to make you231 work for nothing. I warrant you are not over-provided with money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, no,\" answered Robert, smiling. \"I can\u0027t say I am. I have only a dollar and a half here, though I have some money in the hands of a friend at the East.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And how far are you expecting to travel?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To New York.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To New York—almost two thousand miles—on a dollar and a half! Goodness gracious, what a wild idea!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I expect to find something to do on the way, and if I don\u0027t I shall meet with good friends.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A dollar and a half! I never heard of such a thing!\" reiterated Miss Stafford.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Miss Louisa Stafford was a rich and kind-hearted maiden lady, who, unlike many of her class, was very fond of young people and a great favorite with them. No gathering of her nephews or nieces was considered complete without the presence of Aunt Louisa, who was sure in every way to promote the happiness of the young company. She was delighted to secure in Robert one who could so materially help her, and232 inwardly resolved to reward him well for his services.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They drove up to a large house with a broad lawn, shaded by fine trees, under which were assembled a merry crowd of young people. When Miss Stafford\u0027s carriage was espied there was a rush to greet her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How are you all, children?\" she said, heartily. \"Oh; I see you are looking at this young gentleman with me. Well, he has saved my life.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Saved your life!\" exclaimed the children in chorus.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Prince undertook to run away with and upset me, but Master Robert, here (she had inquired his name), subdued him, and here I am. I have taken the liberty to invite Professor Rudd to join our party.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Professor Rudd!\" repeated the children, bewildered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; this young gentleman is a professor of magic, and he will perform some tricks this evening. This afternoon I expect you to be polite to him, and invite him to join your games.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This all were very ready to do, for Robert was233 good-looking and gentlemanly in appearance, and soon made himself a general favorite.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Supper was served between five and six o\u0027clock, and early in the evening Robert appeared as a magician. He had quite a variety of tricks and illustrations, and this part of the programme gave great satisfaction.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next morning (for Miss Stafford and Robert also passed the night in the hospitable mansion) when our young hero was ready to start out on his journey, Miss Stafford, put in his hand a sealed envelope.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t open this,\" she said, \"till you have gone at least a mile.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83316.html","bookId":277,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:33:01 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:33:01 AM"}
