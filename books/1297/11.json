Diomed opposes this, and Nestor seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to be strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are to be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and Nestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in order to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice of, who are accompanied by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very moving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by Achilles, who notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake themselves to sleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night, which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene lies on the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.\n\u003cbr\u003e Thus joyful Troy maintain\u0027d the watch of night;\n\u003cbr\u003e While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,199\n\u003cbr\u003e And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,\n\u003cbr\u003e Sat on each face, and sadden\u0027d every heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,\n\u003cbr\u003e A double tempest of the west and north\n\u003cbr\u003e Swells o\u0027er the sea, from Thracia\u0027s frozen shore,\n\u003cbr\u003e Heaps waves on waves, and bids the ?gean roar:\n\u003cbr\u003e This way and that the boiling deeps are toss\u0027d:\n\u003cbr\u003e Such various passions urged the troubled host,\n\u003cbr\u003e Great Agamemnon grieved above the

But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,\n\u003cbr\u003e In solemn sadness and majestic grief.\n\u003cbr\u003e The king amidst the mournful circle rose:\n\u003cbr\u003e Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.\n\u003cbr\u003e [pg 160]\n\u003cbr\u003e So silent fountains, from a rock\u0027s tall head,\n\u003cbr\u003e In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.\n\u003cbr\u003e With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress\u0027d;\n\u003cbr\u003e Words, mix\u0027d with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader\u0027s

loud acclamations raise,\n\u003cbr\u003e And voice to voice resounds Tydides\u0027 praise.\n\u003cbr\u003e Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear\u0027d;\n\u003cbr\u003e He spoke: the host in still
