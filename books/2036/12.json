Elena and Meredith had been up all night, and now they were surrounded by scattered printouts, newspapers, and pictures from the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s already spread beyond Fell\u0027s Church,\" Meredith explained, pointing to an article in one of the papers. \"I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s following ley lines, or being controlled by Shinichi - or is just moving on its own, like any parasite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you try to contact Alaric?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith glanced at Bonnie\u0027s sleeping figure. She spoke softly, \"That\u0027s the good news. I\u0027d been trying to get him forever, and I finally managed. He\u0027ll be arriving in Fell\u0027s Church soon - he just has one more stop first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena drew her breath in. \"One more stop that\u0027s more important than what\u0027s going on in that town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I didn\u0027t tell Bonnie about him coming. Or Matt either. I knew they wouldn\u0027t understand. But - I\u0027ll give you one guess as to what kind of legends he\u0027s following up in the Far East.\" Meredith fixed dark eyes on Elena\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not...it is, isn\u0027t it? Kitsune?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and he\u0027s going to a very ancient place where they were supposed to have destroyed the town - just as Fell\u0027s Church is being destroyed. Nobody lives there now. That name - Unmei no Shima - means the Island of Doom. Maybe he\u0027ll find something important about fox spirits there. He\u0027s doing some kind of multicultural independent study with Sabrina Dell. She\u0027s Alaric\u0027s age, but she\u0027s already a famous forensic anthropologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re not jealous?\" Elena said awkwardly. Personal issues were difficult to talk about with Meredith. Asking her questions always felt like prying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well.\" Meredith tipped back her head. \"It isn\u0027t as if we have any formal engagement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you never told anybody about all this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith lowered her head and gave Elena a quick look. \"I have now,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment the girls sat together in silence. Then Elena said quietly, \"The Shi no Shi, the kitsune, Isobel Saitou, Alaric and his Island of Doom - they may not have anything to do with each other. But if they do, I\u0027m going to find out what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m going to help,\" Meredith said simply. \"But I had thought that after I graduated...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena couldn\u0027t stand it anymore. \"Meredith, I promise, as soon as we get Stefan back and the town calmed down, we\u0027ll pin Alaric down with Plans A through Z,\" she said. She leaned forward and kissed Meredith\u0027s cheek. \"That\u0027s a velociraptor sisterhood oath, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith blinked twice, swallowed once, and whispered, \"Okay.\" Then, abruptly, she was her old efficient self again. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"But cleaning up the town might not be such an easy job. It\u0027s already heading toward mass chaos there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Matt wanted to be in the middle of it all? Alone?\" Elena asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like we said, he and Mrs. Flowers are a solid team,\" Meredith said quietly. \"And it\u0027s what he\u0027s chosen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Elena said drily, \"he may turn out to have the better deal in the end, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went back to the scattered papers. Meredith picked up several pictures of kitsune guarding shrines in Japan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It says they\u0027re usually depicted with a \u0027jewel\u0027 or key.\" She held up a picture of a kitsune holding a key in its mouth at the main gate of the Fushimi Shrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aha,\" Elena said. \"Looks like the key\u0027s got two wings, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly what Bonnie and I thought. And the \u0027jewels\u0027...well, take a close look.\" Elena did and her stomach lurched. Yes, they were like the \"snow globe\" orbs that Shinichi had used to create unbreakable traps in the Old Wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We found they\u0027re called hoshi no tama,\" Meredith said. \"And that translates to \u0027star balls.\u0027 Each kitsune puts a measure of their power into one, along with other things, and destroying the ball is one of the only ways to kill them. If you find a kitsune\u0027s star ball, you can control the kitsune. That\u0027s what Bonnie and I want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how do you find it?\" Elena asked, excited by the idea of controlling Shinichi and Misao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sa...\" Meredith said, pronouncing the word \"sah\" like a sigh. Then she gave one of her rare brilliant smiles. \"In Japanese, that means: \u0027I wonder; hmm; wouldn\u0027t want to comment; my gosh, golly, I really couldn\u0027t say.\u0027 We could use a word like that in English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite herself, Elena giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, then, other stories say that kitsune can be killed by the Sin of Regret or by blessed weapons. I don\u0027t know what the Sin of Regret is, but - \" She rummaged in her luggage, and came up with an old-fashioned but serviceable-looking revolver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was my grandpa\u0027s - one of a pair. Matt\u0027s got the other one. They\u0027re loaded with bullets blessed by a priest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What priest would bless bullets, for God\u0027s sake?\" Elena demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith\u0027s smile turned bleak. \"One that\u0027s seen what\u0027s happening in Fell\u0027s Church. You remember how Caroline got Isobel Saitou possessed, and what Isobel did to herself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena nodded. \"I remember,\" she said tautly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, do you remember how we told you that Obaasan - Grandma Saitou - used to be a shrine maiden? That\u0027s a Japanese priestess. She blessed the bullets for us, all right, and specifically for killing kitsune. You should have seen how spooky the ritual was. Bonnie almost fainted again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know how Isobel is doing now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith shook her dark head slowly. \"Better but - I don\u0027t think she even knows about Jim yet. That\u0027s going to be very tough on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena tried to quell a shudder. There was nothing but tragedy in store for Isobel even when she got well. Jim Bryce, her boyfriend, had spent only one night with Caroline, but now had Lesch-Nye disease - or so the doctors said. In that same dreadful night that Isobel had pierced herself everywhere, and cut her tongue so that it forked, Jim, a handsome star basketball player, had eaten away his fingers and his lips. In Elena\u0027s opinion they were both possessed and their injuries were only more reasons why the kitsune twins had to be stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do it,\" she said aloud, realizing for the first time that Meredith was holding her hand as if Elena were Bonnie. Elena managed a faint but determined smile for Meredith. \"We\u0027ll get Stefan out and we\u0027ll stop Shinichi and Misao. We have to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time it was Meredith who nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more,\" she said at last. \"You want to hear it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to know everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, every single source I checked agrees that kitsune possess girls and then lead boys to destruction. What kind of destruction depends on where you look. It can be as simple as appearing as a will-o\u0027-the-wisp and leading you into a swamp or off a cliff, or as difficult as shapeshifting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes,\" Elena said tightly. \"I knew that from what happened to you and Bonnie. They can look exactly like someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but always with some small flaw if you have the wits to notice it. They can never make a perfect replicate. But they can have up to nine tails, and the more tails they have, the better at everything they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nine? Terrific. We\u0027ve never even seen a nine-tailed one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we may get to yet. They\u0027re supposed to be able to cross over freely from one world to another. Oh, yes. And they\u0027re specifically in charge of the \u0027Kimon\u0027 Gate between dimensions. Want to guess what that translates to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena stared at her. \"Oh, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why would Damon take us all the way across the country, just to get in through a Demon Gate that\u0027s run by fox spirits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sa...But when Matt told us you were headed to someplace near Sedona, that was really what decided Bonnie and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" Elena ran her hands through her hair and sighed. \"Anything else?\" she asked, feeling like a rubber band that had been stretched to its utmost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only this, which ought to really bake your cookies after all we\u0027ve been through. Some of them are good. Kitsune, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of them are good - good what? Good fighters? Good assassins? Good liars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really, Elena. Some of them are supposed to be like gods and goddesses who sort of test you, and if you pass the test they reward you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think we should count on finding one like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena dropped her head to the coffee table where Meredith\u0027s printouts were scattered. \"Meredith, seriously, how are we going to deal with them when we go through that Demon Gate? My Power is about as reliable as a low battery. And it\u0027s not just the kitsune; it\u0027s all the different demons and vampires - Old Ones, too! What are we going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her head and looked deeply into the eyes of her friend - those dark eyes that she had never been able to classify as this color or that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her surprise, Meredith instead of looking sober, tossed back the dregs of a Diet Coke and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No Plan A yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...maybe just an idea. Nothing definite yet. What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few that might qualify for Plans B and C. So what we\u0027re going to do is what we always do - try our best and fall all over ourselves and make mistakes until you do something brilliant and save us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry\" - Meredith blinked. Elena knew why - she hadn\u0027t used that diminutive for Meredith for more years than she could remember. None of the three girls liked pet names or used them. Elena went on very seriously, holding Meredith\u0027s eyes, \"There\u0027s nothing I want more than to save everybody - everybody - from these kitsune bastards. I\u0027d give my life for Stefan and all of you. But...this time it may be somebody else who takes the bullet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or the stake. I know. Bonnie knows. We talked about it while we were flying here. But we\u0027re still with you, Elena. You have to know that. We\u0027re all with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one way to reply to that. Elena gripped Meredith\u0027s hand in both of hers. Then she let out her breath, and, like probing an aching tooth, tried to get news on a sore subject. \"Does Matt - did he - well, how was Matt when you left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith glanced at her sideways. Not much got past Meredith. \"He seemed okay, but - distracted. He would go off into these fits where he\u0027d just stare at nothing, and he wouldn\u0027t hear you if you spoke to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he tell you why he left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...sort of. He said that Damon was hypnotizing you and that you weren\u0027t - weren\u0027t doing all you could to stop him. But he\u0027s a boy and boys get jealous - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he was right about what he saw. It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve - gotten to know Damon a little better. And Matt doesn\u0027t like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um-hm.\" Meredith was watching her from under lowered eyelids, barely breathing, as if Elena was a bird that mustn\u0027t be disturbed or she\u0027d fly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena laughed. \"It\u0027s nothing bad,\" she said. \"At least I don\u0027t think so. It\u0027s just that...in some ways Damon needs help even more than Stefan did when he first came to Fell\u0027s Church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith\u0027s eyebrows shot up, but all she said was, \"Um-hm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And...I think that really Damon\u0027s a lot more like Stefan than he lets on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith\u0027s eyebrows stayed up. Elena finally looked at her. She opened her mouth once or twice and then she just stared at Meredith. \"I\u0027m in trouble, aren\u0027t I?\" she said helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If all this comes from less than one week riding in a car with him...then, yes. But we have to remember that women are Damon\u0027s specialty. And he thinks he\u0027s in love with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he really is - \" Elena began, and then she caught her lower lip between her teeth. \"Oh, God, this is Damon we\u0027re talking about. I am in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just watch and see what happens,\" Meredith said sensibly. \"He\u0027s definitely changed, too. Before, he would have just told you that your friends couldn\u0027t come - and that was it. Today he stuck around and listened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I just have to - to be on my guard from now on,\" Elena said, a little unsteadily. How was she going to help the child inside Damon without getting closer to him? And how would she explain all she might need to do to Stefan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll probably be all right,\" Bonnie muttered sleepily. Meredith and Elena both turned to look at her and Elena felt a chill go up her spine. Bonnie was sitting propped up, but her eyes were shut and her voice was indistinct. \"The real question is: what will Stefan say about that night at the motel with Damon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Elena\u0027s voice was sharp and loud enough to awaken any sleeper. But Bonnie didn\u0027t stir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened what night at what motel?\" Meredith demanded. When Elena didn\u0027t answer immediately, she caught Elena\u0027s arm and swung her so that they were face-to-face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last Elena looked at her friend. But her eyes, she knew, gave away nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena, what\u0027s she talking about? What happened with Damon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena still kept her face perfectly expressionless, and used a word she\u0027d learned just that night. \"Sa...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena, you\u0027re impossible! You\u0027re not going to dump Stefan after you rescue him, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not!\" Elena was hurt. \"Stefan and I belong together - forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But still you spent a night with Damon where something happened between you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something...I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that something was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena smiled apologetically. \"Sa...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get it out of him! I\u0027ll put him on the defensive....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can make a Plan A and Plan B and all,\" Elena said. \"But it won\u0027t help. Shinichi took his memories away. Meredith, I\u0027m sorry - you don\u0027t know how sorry. But I swore that nobody would ever know.\" She looked up at the taller girl, feeling tears pool in her eyes. Can\u0027t you just - once - let me leave it that way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith sank bank. \"Elena Gilbert, the world is lucky there is only one of you. You are the...\" She paused, as if deciding whether to say the words or not. Then she said, \"It\u0027s time to get to bed. Dawn is going to come early and so is the Demon Gate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-shadow-souls-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-12.html","bookId":2036,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:30:13 PM"}
