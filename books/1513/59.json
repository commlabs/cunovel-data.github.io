In a secret chamber within the city lord\u0027s castle, the Viscount Jackson that Leylin saw today was talking to his subordinate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it confirmed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have detected the smell of a Mysterious Entity on his body. It has also been confirmed that he is extremely young!\" The person who replied was draped in black robes; tufts of yellow fur could be glimpsed growing on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is different from those befuddled acolytes. I do not think he will be retiring at such a young age. No matter if he is hiding from enemies or is concealing some other motive, his appearance is not good news for us!\" A worried expression flickered through Jackson\u0027s steely face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please pardon my forthrightness! Although we are able to deal with a Mysterious Entity right now, if we draw the ire of the rest of them, then whatever gains we achieve would not make up for the losses we may incur!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Half-Beast Man said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed!\" Jackson became quiet for some time before giving out an order, \"Do not incur the wrath of the other party, but never let him out of your sight!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand!\" The Half-Beast Man disappeared into the darkness....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since the ball, Leylin\u0027s agenda progressed extremely quickly. First, he borrowed 4500 gold coins from Murphy to buy the villa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, through the search done by Old Welker, Leylin chose a medicine shop that was about to close down but had a good geographic position. He took over it and obtained the shop permit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the unexpected enthusiastic help from the city lord\u0027s castle, many procedures were actually settled in a matter of days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Leylin discovered a few spies loitering around the medicine shop and the villa. However, these secretive parties exercised restraint against Leylin, and only made basic surveillance measures, not insinuating their influence onto Leylin\u0027s people. So, Leylin was not too bothered by their presence either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough Murphy, he hired a few pharmacists. Once the minimum standards for managing the medicine shop were met, he then completely handed over the reins to his core personnel and buried himself in his magic experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some renovation, the Knight\u0027s villa looked even newer than when it was brand new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, the Knight stayed in a three storey high, white-brick loft. Now, Leylin chose the few really big rooms for his private use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe largest of these was used as his bedroom while the rooms on both sides served as a study room and an experiment lab. After putting in place a few detection spells he had learned at Abyssal Bone Forest Academy as an early warning grid, he passed down strict orders to his subordinates that without his order, no one was access to these rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Greem and Fraser, they were posted near the master bedroom, as guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFayern and other mercenaries were all given guard duty that rotated between the villa and the medicine shop. Leylin also gave out notices that serious and hardworking people may purchase small tracts of land on his property in 3 years later, permanent residence being a possibility for qualified persons or families. This was a very strong motivation for normal mercenaries and farmers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally, Leylin looked through the windows and saw the serious hardworking serious mercenaries and farmers at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he always stayed at the villa, apart from the occasional visit to Murphy\u0027s place, he rarely even went to the medicine shop. The rumors that were slowly spreading outside gained Leylin the reputation of a benevolent yet lazy villa owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young Master! The people from the medicine shop are here!\" Anna\u0027s voice travelled through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let them drop off the items in the living room and get Greem to move them to the experiment lab!\" Leylin used his fingers to tap on the window pane, letting off a dull thudding noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wish is my command!\" The voice very soon was replaced with noises of things being moved about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen minutes later, Leylin came to the experiment lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, the originally spacious experiment was littered with crates and a few wooden long tables. There were no windows in the room, and only a chandelier hung from the ceiling emitting a dim glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young Master! According to your orders, the medicine shop has acquired for you every type of herb that can be found in the market.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna lifted her dress and curtseyed. She turned around and opened a red wooden crate revealing stacks of tied roots and stems, as well as many other herbs of indeterminate quantity and type. On the side of each stack or bundle was stuck a yellow paper note indicating the names of these herbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also, these are all the formulas that normal pharmacists own. They are only to normal humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna handed over yet another stack of dark yellow parchment notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin\u0027s eyes skimmed over these and placed the list on one of the long tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of you may leave! Anna, stay behind!\" Leylin waved towards Greem and his assistants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreem bowed and strode through the large heavy door, closing it behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a huge clang, the experiment lab\u0027s lighting turned even dimmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin\u0027s brows furrowed. He took out a white coloured rock from his sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then pressed his fingers lightly on the rock and a layer of bright white light radiated from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a Sunlight Rock. It is an item that magicians normally use during their travels. Slight radiation energy is contained in it that can let out a bright light for a prolonged period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this radiation was extremely small and could only be used for illumination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is much brighter than before!\" Leylin was very satisfied as he looked at his well-lit surroundings. He then said to Anna, \"Store the herbs well, and arrange them in an orderly fashion on the experiment table!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Anna hurried with her task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin casually picked up a purple coloured fruit. This fruit was the size of a thumb It had lost all the water contained on its surface, thus its wrinkly exterior. Its weight was extremely light too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the medicine books delivered yesterday, this is the Warter Fruit, a type of fruit that grows in swamps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin placed a finger on the surface of the fruit, \"A.I. Chip! Extract data and save it in your databanks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now he no longer had to ingest the herbs. He could determine their medicinal properties with a mere touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Beep! Data extraction in progress!]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Leylin\u0027s field of vision, the A.I. Chip overlaid a light blue screen, with many numbers and figures that changed constantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Name: Warter Fruit. The area produced: Swamps. Uses: Mild poisonous properties with a numbing effect. Data stored!]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A.I. Chip\u0027s voice intoned before a second had gone by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good. Again!\" Leylin picked up another dried stem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was one of the reasons why Leylin had opened a medicine shop. Through his years of being an apprentice under Kroft, he recorded almost all the herbs used by Potioneering Masters, storing it into the A.I. Chip\u0027s data banks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, those were special ingredients used by the Magi. As for herbs used by normal people, the A.I. Chip had no record of them. He now had to fill these missing bits of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, Leylin obtained two ancient potion formulas from his mentor and wanted to find substitutes for them. This could only be accomplished through innumerable experimentation and the consumption of huge amounts of precious and rare herbs. Even if Leylin had the A.I. Chip, he could not get around this step in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith such a vast undertaking, Leylin could see no end to the task at hand even if he expended all his magic crystals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if some ingredients could be substituted with herbs used by normal humans, he could economise by a huge margin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Although this might just be a daydream, the advantage was the potential savings a successful substitution promised. No matter how many experiments, it would still be considered a favorable exchange. Thus, by utilising the terrifying processing capabilities of the A.I. Chip, there is a glimmer of hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin\u0027s gaze was resolute, \"Anyway, no matter how many ingredients I consume, they are just ingredients used by normal humans. I only need to spend some gold coins to be able to buy them again. This is much better than spending magic crystals!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the investigation he commissioned, it had long since been tossed to the back of Leylin\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, there were still two odd years of time and as long as he fully carried it out within these two years his mission would be counted as accomplished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if the mission were to fail, because Kroft was his teacher, the worst punishment would be a fine a few magic crystals. Hence, Leylin was not the least bit worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime slowly passed, and the experiment lab became quiet. There were only the occasional scraping noises Anna made when placing herbs on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later, only Leylin remained in the lab. His face had a happy glow to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[3217 types of herbs successfully stored in the databank. Would you like to create a separate folder?]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe A.I. Chip\u0027s voice intoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Combine them with the earlier record we made of some normal ingredients, establish a folder using the name \"Compendium of ordinary ingredients\"! Leylin ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Folder created...transferring relevant simulation models into the databank]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alright, next will be an analysis of the various combinations of medicinal properties. This is a huge project, even with the simulation I must still carry out experiments to verify the actual data and increase the probability of getting the results I desire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young Master, it\u0027s time for dinner.\" Anna\u0027s muted voice sounded through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027m coming out.\" When it was time to work, he worked; and when it was time to rest, he rested. This was his principle for living. He would seldom do things like neglect food and rest to conduct more experiments, unlike other magicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo him, along the path of pursuing truth, appropriate rest was allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin smiled and tidied up the experiment table before leaving the lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I am conducting important experiments, I will hang a sign on the door. At that time, do not interrupt me no matter how many days I stay inside. Do you understand?\" Leylin told Anna who was serving him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do as you bid, Young Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s for dinner?\" Leylin walked towards one side of the room. Although many masters practiced eating some meals together with their subordinates, this did not fit the customs of the Magi. So Leylin ate alone most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral plates of food covered with hemispherical cloche tableware were arranged on a serving platter and placed on a small, round and white-colored table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s veal with purple vegetable soup and apple strawberry pie!\" Anna said lightly, lifted the cover. A strong appetising aroma permeated the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bad!\" Leylin nodded his head as he let Anna place a napkin around his neck. He picked up the knife and dinner fork and began to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also, remember to remind me tomorrow to set aside an hour of my time every day for Knight training!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin said to Anna, having suddenly recalled something. He had already ignited his internal life energy. As a Knight, he only needed to train some more to get his various stats above 3. Although Leylin planned to walk the path of a Magus, he had nothing to lose by increasing his stats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-58\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-60\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-59","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
