He and his two associates had dissolved into the web of shadows cast by the thick trees that rose across from the cathedral plaza. He\u0027d managed to slip out a side door and retreat just as the police stormed the main entrance. No one seemed to notice him. The authorities would, for the moment, be focused on Stephanie Nelle and Cotton Malone. It would be awhile before witnesses described other men with guns. He was familiar with these kinds of situations and knew how calm heads always prevailed. So he told himself to relax. His men must know that he was in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front of the brick cathedral was awash with strobing red and white light. More police arrived, and he marveled how a town of Roskilde\u0027s size possessed so much law enforcement. People were flooding over from the nearby main plaza. The whole scene was quickly turning chaotic. Which was perfect. He\u0027d always found tremendous freedom of movement within chaos, provided he controlled the chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faced the two who\u0027d been with him inside the church. \"Are you injured?\" he asked the one who\u0027d been shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man peeled back his jacket and showed him how the body armor had done its job. \"Just sore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the crowd he saw his remaining two acolytes emerge--the ones he\u0027d sent to the auction. They\u0027d reported through their radios that Stephanie Nelle had not prevailed in the bidding. So he\u0027d ordered them to send her his way. He\u0027d thought perhaps she could be intimidated, but the effort had failed. Worse, he\u0027d drawn a great deal of attention to his activities. But that was thanks to Cotton Malone. His men had spotted Malone at the auction, so he\u0027d instructed them to detain him while he spoke with Stephanie Nelle. Apparently, that effort had failed, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two approached and one of them said, \"We lost Malone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s resourceful. With nerve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that to be true. He\u0027d checked out Cotton Malone after learning Stephanie Nelle would be traveling to Denmark to visit with him. Since Malone could have well been a part of whatever she was planning, he\u0027d made a point to learn all he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis given name was Harold Earl Malone. He was forty-six years old, born in the American state of Georgia. His mother was a native Georgian, his father a career military man, an Annapolis graduate, who rose to the rank of navy commander before his submarine sank when Malone was ten years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe son followed in the father\u0027s footsteps, attending the Naval Academy and graduating in the top third of his class. He was admitted to flight school, eventually earning high enough marks to choose fighter pilot training. Then, interestingly, midway through, he abruptly sought reassignment and was admitted to Georgetown University Law School, earning his law degree while stationed at the Pentagon. After graduation he was transferred to the Judge Advocate General\u0027s corps, where he spent nine years as a staff lawyer. Thirteen years ago he was reassigned to the Justice Department and Stephanie Nelle\u0027s newly formed Magellan Billet. He remained there until last year, retiring out early as a full commander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the personal side, Malone was divorced and his fourteen-year-old son lived with his ex-wife in Georgia. Immediately upon retiring, Malone had left America and moved to Copenhagen. He was a confirmed bibliophile and born Catholic, but not noted as overly religious. He was reasonably fluent in several languages, possessed of no known addictions or phobias, and prone to extreme self-motivation and obsessive dedication. He also possessed an eidetic memory. All in all, just the kind of man de Roquefort would rather have in his employ than working against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the past few minutes had proven that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree-to-one odds had not seemed to bother Malone, especially when he thought Stephanie Nelle was in jeopardy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, de Roquefort\u0027s young associate had demonstrated loyalty and courage, too, though the man had acted in haste stealing Stephanie Nelle\u0027s bag. He should have waited until after her visit with Cotton Malone, when she was on the way back to her hotel, alone and vulnerable. Perhaps he\u0027d been trying to please, knowing the importance of their mission. Maybe it was simply impatience. But when cornered at the Round Tower, the young man had correctly chosen death over capture. A shame, but the learning process was like that. Those with brains and ability rose. Everyone else was eliminated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to one of his associates who\u0027d been inside the auction hall and asked, \"Did you learn who was the high bidder for the book?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man nodded. \"It cost a thousand kroner to bribe the attendant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t interested in the price of weakness. \"The name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henrik Thorvaldsen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone in his pocket vibrated. His second in command knew he was occupied, so the call had to be important. He flipped the unit open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The time is close,\" the voice said in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Within the next few hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unexpected bonus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a task for you,\" he said into the phone. \"There\u0027s a man. Henrik Thorvaldsen. A wealthy Dane, lives north of Copenhagen. I know some, but I need complete information on him within the hour. Call me back when you have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he clicked off the phone and turned to his subordinates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must return home. But first there are two more tasks we have to complete before dawn.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1/page-8.html","bookId":2232,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM"}
