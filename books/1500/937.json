She softly and quietly closed the office door, the sound of high-heeled shoes moving along the corridor. Morgan suddenly realized that she would pour away this cup of cold coffee, and then exchange it for a brand new cup. In the past, this wasn’t a big deal, but right now, when there was a shortage of everything, it became a hundred percent a luxury. This was completely inconsistent with what he was used to. However, after thinking about it, he still didn’t stop the secretary. This was partly because coffee was one of his few pleasures in this life, and partly because the young secretary needed this to prove the worth of her existence. Otherwise, she would become just like the abandoned Black Dragonriders, spending each day in anxiety.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“I’ve really grown old!” Josh Morgan sighed.

There was still a fire burning in the fireplace, but it couldn’t disperse this type of coldness at all. In fact, with Morgan’s ability, forget about this degree of coldness, even if it was a negative hundred degrees extreme cold, he could still resist it. As for why he felt cold, it could only mean that his heart was currently gloomy and overcast.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Winter is almost here again.
