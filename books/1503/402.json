(1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the user of the Time Reversal Skill, Zhou Weiqing could not move, but other living creatures within the zone were not affected in such a manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er heard Zhou Weiqing’s call, and back in the midst of extreme pain, she opened her eyes slowly and said softly: “En? Little Fatty, Little Fatty, are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feier, listen to me. You listen to me.” Zhou Weiqing said urgently. As the pain in his body grew towards its penultimate, he was afraid that in moments, he would no longer be able to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fei’er, you must listen to me. My current condition is because my body is in the midst of breaking through, it is a part of my cultivation method, and it will not have any permanent damage to me. However, if you keep holding on to me, it will cause my bloodline to be blocked. I have used the Time Reversal Skill, returning things back to what they were earlier. We only have a chance now. Later, as our bodies return to the state before the time reversal, you must leave my body instantly. Do not try to touch me at all, but do not leave ten metres of my body either. All that happened will be reversed and resume again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahh? What are you talking about?” Shangguan Fei’er exclaimed as she stared him slackjawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing shouted harshly: “You must follow my instructions, otherwise both of us will die. Remember that!” As he spoke up to the point, the intense pain and violent shuddering of his body caused his voice to turn hoarse, and it grew too hard for him to continue speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zhou Weiqing had spoken too quickly, Shangguan Fei’er was still in shock. However, she could sense from her body that Zhou Weiqing’s words were indeed true, as her body was rapidly recovering, and the vanished Life Force and Heavenly Energy was welling back into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery quickly, under the control of the Time Reversal, they returned to the time when Shangguan Fei’er had just touched down on the ground with him, right before she pounced onto him. At this instant, time seemed to settle and freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er stared around her in shock. This Time Attribute Skill gave her an unbelievable earthshaking shock. \u003ci\u003eWas this Little Fatty’s power?!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer beautiful long hair fell before her… the green locks had returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at that moment, the Time Reversal Skill ended abruptly, and time resumed its normal flow. However, everything around would happen again as it had previously. For Zhou Weiqing himself, he would not be able to change anything happening to himself. That was to say… in this time reversal, anything else could affect changes to what would happen next, but he could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost subconsciously, Shangguan Fei’er nearly jumped onto Zhou Weiqing once more. Seeing his body shuddering violently, she struggled with her heart and his instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eTime Reversal… He actually had such a Skill. Wait… he has to be lying to me. If by holding him previously I affected him, how could he possibly use such a Skill?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing up in the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, her knowledge was not to be underestimated. With just a look, she could see how much Heavenly Energy such a terrifying Skill would consume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhy would he lie to me? Am I thinking too much? Is this really due to his own cultivation technique?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only at this point that Shangguan Fei’er’s mind and consciousness really woke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the other side, Zhou Weiqing could sense that Shangguan Fei’er had listened to him and not embraced him this time, and he was overjoyed in his heart. He knew that every second that passed meant Shangguan Fei’er would be safer, as everything else would follow its previous path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty, you are lying to me right? Previously, when I embraced you… I don’t remember anything else after that. I… I… died? Or… was severely injured? You were afraid of me dying so you used the Time Reversal to let everything revert back right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing wanted to cry at this time… alas, he could no longer speak. If he could speak, he just wanted to say one line to Shangguan Fei’er. “Big sis, can you not turn so smart so suddenly?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er’s emotions were at least much more stable than previously, and she said: “Little Fatty, will you really be okay? But… you seem to be in such pain, and the energy reverberations in your body are just so violent. I… I’m so afraid that you will leave me. I don’t want to die, I want to accompany you. But… if… if you die, what am I to do? Did my previous actions save you? If not, at least give me some reaction!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the reversal of time, Shangguan Fei’er’s clothes had been restored, but Zhou Weiqing was still naked as his clothes had been lost before that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s heart was filled with terror. He was truly afraid that Shangguan Fei’er would embrace him once again. However, how could he react to her words, he could not even move an inch, or even speak. How could he prove anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden, Zhou Weiqing thought of a solution that was well… not exactly a solution. In his mind, he started thinking back to earlier when Shangguan Fei’er was naked. He could not change anything, but such an innate physiological reaction was just still at the edge, outside that restriction. As such… Shangguan Fei’er suddenly saw his ‘reaction’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You… you shameless!” Shangguan Fei’er saw that straight, tall, evil looking pink mushroom, and she quickly closed her eyes in embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth had proven itself, and Zhou Weiqing’s efforts had indeed paid off. At that point, Shangguan Fei’er was thinking to herself: \u003ci\u003eSince he can still do that, he should be fine hmph! \u003c/i\u003e“Little Fatty, if you really die, I will accompany you in death, so you better stay alive.” In the end, Shangguan Fei’er followed his instructions and dismissed the thought of embracing him to help him. She sat down beside him, circulating her Heavenly Energy to heal her injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything else carried on as history repeated itself. When Zhou Weiqing forcefully broke through his Death Acupuncture Point, Shangguan Fei’er paled in shock, finally embracing him once more. Luckily, at that point, the two bloodline powers within Zhou Weiqing had stopped fighting and the terrifying power no longer attacked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCirculating her Heavenly Energy into Zhou Weiqing’s body, Shangguan Fei’er could sense that the danger was slowly receding for him, and she heaved a sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter successfully breaking through his Death Acupuncture Point once more, the warping of the air around them disappeared. Zhou Weiqing once again broke through the seventeenth stage, and the originally dead Shangguan Fei’er lay there in his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the other difference was that Zhou Weiqing was no longer at full energy. After the Time Reversal, his Heavenly Energy had been totally drained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening his eyes, when Zhou Weiqing saw Shangguan Fei’er’s eyes on him, filled concern, tears streamed down uncontrollably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly after one had gone through loss would one know about cherishing, losing someone and finding her again, that agitated his emotions to the maximum. Black suddenly overcame him in a flash, as the combination of exhaustion with having his Heavenly Energy drained totally and the emotional roller coaster, he fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er was given a big fright, but she was currently in contact with Zhou Weiqing’s body, and she could immediately sense that it was just a normal unconsciousness, not anything serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery soon, her eyes grew dazed as she looked at him, especially the streaks of tears from his eyes, and she felt her heart beating quicker. \u003ci\u003eDid he cry because of me? What happened before that Time Reversal? Did I die?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty… how am I supposed to treat you?! I actually fell for my little sister’s man? I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like that, she stared at Zhou Weiqing while regulating her breathing, circulating her Heavenly Energy to recover herself, while also sending a strand of gentle Heavenly Energy into Zhou Weiqing to help him recover, stimulating his energy whirlwinds to resume spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime passed, minute after minute. The two of them had left the Peerless Battalion Camp before the sky had darkened, as Zhou Weiqing had planned to use the time after the army had eaten dinner and their guard was more relaxed to sneak past. However, by now, after having gone through so much, it was already deep into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, because they were facing death, although Shangguan Fei’er had seen Zhou Weiqing naked, she had not thought anything about now. However, now that all danger was over and they were quiet and alone, her heart could no longer be quiet in front of his nudity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s skin was not white, but a healthy bronze. Although it was dark at night, with Shangguan Fei’er’s cultivation level and sight, how could she not be able to see clearly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders were broad, the muscled lines clear, thick and solid, giving a very reassuring, safe feeling. His arms were thick, his muscled ‘wings’ clear. All in all, it was a package of strength and grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter looking for a while, Shangguan Fei’er’s beautiful face turned red, and she quickly retrieved a spare piece of clothes from her Spatial Ring to cover him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, she was after all the Little Demon Girl of the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, and her character had always been bold and mischievous. After a moment of her heart racing, her curiosity acted up once again. Previously, she had been staring at his chest muscles, and had not looked downwards. A man’s body… what difference was there from a woman...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, after waging war with herself for a while, Shangguan Fei’er reached out with her trembling little hand, gingerly lifting up the clothes as she peeked beneath with a thumping heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eJust one look, I’ll just have a quick look. There’s no harm in that right? \u003c/i\u003eNow that Zhou Weiqing was safe and sound, she was in a good mood, and she didn’t know for sure what had actually happened to her in that ‘alternate future’. As such, her Little Demon Girl personality and curiosity reared its head, and she started peeking at a man’s body. Amongst the three Shangguan sisters, only she would be so bold to do such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fei’er--!” Zhou Weiqing suddenly yelled loudly, sitting up abruptly. As his Heavenly Energy had started recovering, he had finally roused from his unconscious stupor. When he gained consciousness, the first thing he thought of was Shangguan Fei’er’s safety. He was afraid that what had happened was just a dream, and the vision of her dead body crossed his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er had not expected that Zhou Weiqing would suddenly sit up, and that loud shout of his startled her so much that she froze in place. At that point, she had been in the midst of lifting up the clothes and staring at the ‘difference between men and women’. Being startled by Zhou Weiqing so suddenly, her mind blanked, and she froze in that awkward position just like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eI’m dead… I’m dead… \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-16-chapter-131-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-16-chapter-132-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-16-chapter-132-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
