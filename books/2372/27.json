SHUFFLING OUT TO the mailbox in her pajamas, she did not return her neighbors\u0027 cheery waves on this glorious, sunny September morning. Behind Felicity stood the idyllic white clapboard house where she and her husband, David, had lived happily and harmoniously throughout twenty years of marriage. Until last month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst rule of a happy marriage: Get Your Husband Out of the House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since David quit his job at Templeton, he\u0027d been moping around at home like a bear with a sore head, getting under Felicity\u0027s feet. For reasons Felicity did not understand, they had apparently lost a lot of money. David was even talking about selling the house and moving somewhere more modest. Perhaps even leaving Westchester County.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver my dead body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning mail did not lift Felicity\u0027s spirits. Bills, bills and more bills. There was only one white envelope among the brown and red. (Red bills! The shame of it!) Felicity would have liked to open it, but David got terribly prickly when she opened his mail. Then again, David got terribly prickly about everything at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" Back in the kitchen, she handed him the letter, along with the bills. \"For you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid Tennant opened the envelope without interest. Since Templeton folded, it was as if a black cloud had descended over his life. Nothing seemed to matter anymore. Inside the envelope was a note and a check. David Tennant read both. Twice. Felicity noticed that his hands had started to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed her the note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear David, I am sorry this has taken so long. And I\u0027m sorry I was not able to be more open with you. I hope this check will go some way toward restoring your faith in me. Your friend, Lexi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humph.\" Felicity Tennant was unimpressed. \"Guilty conscience got the better of her, has it? It\u0027s about time. Your friend, indeed! After the way Her Ladyship has treated us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently, David Tennant passed his wife the check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Mary and Joseph!\" Felicity Tennant clutched the kitchen table for support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe check was for $15 million.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to be a good day after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYasmin Ross smiled at her boss when he walked into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning Mr. M. The mail\u0027s on your desk, next to the latte and skinny blueberry muffin. I moved the morning meeting to a quarter after so you\u0027d have time to eat something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe smiled back gratefully\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yaz, you\u0027re an angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor man. Yasmin watched him go into his office, shoulders slumped, head down. Gabe\u0027s smiles didn\u0027t fool her, or anybody else at the charity offices. Ever since he\u0027d broken things off with Lexi Templeton, the joy seemed to have drained out of him like air from a punctured tire. Lexi must be crazy, letting him slip through her fingers. I wouldn\u0027t kick Gabe McGregor out of my bed, not for any money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting at his desk, Gabe picked at his muffin. He knew his assistant was worried about him, and her concern touched him. He hadn\u0027t been eating well lately. Or sleeping, for that matter. Sighing, he turned his attention to the mail. Every day Gabe received scores of begging letters, asking for gifts from his foundation. Saying no was the part of his work he liked least, but it had to be done. If they spread themselves too thin, they\u0027d achieve nothing. There was still so much work to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently Gabe had been saying no even more than usual, thanks to the hole in the charity\u0027s funds made by Lexi. Legally, Gabe was obliged to report the theft to the police. But he hadn\u0027t been able to bring himself to do it. Not yet, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw the handwriting on the plain white envelope, he choked on his coffee, spraying brown liquid right across the desk. Gabe hadn\u0027t heard a word from Lexi since that awful day in the Hamptons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could she want? A reconciliation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that what I want, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the letter. Except there was no letter. Only a check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was for exactly three times the amount Lexi had stolen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust Sandford was suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Jim. Who else is going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim Barnet was the head - ex-head - of Kruger-Brent\u0027s manufacturing division. Along with a select group of other divisional heads, Jim had been summoned to a meeting by the firm\u0027s receivers. Apparently, a potential cash buyer had come forward, interested in bidding for some of Kruger-Brent\u0027s more profitable businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, Mickey. Alan Dawes, I think. Tabitha Crewe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tabitha? They want mining?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently. And real estate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And nobody has any idea who this mystery benefactor is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. But come on, man. It\u0027s not like we\u0027re exactly inundated with offers. Most of the market still seems to think we\u0027re toxic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust hung up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was that, darling?\" Leticia, his mistress, rolled over in bed, pressing her soft breasts against his chest. Since Kruger-Brent went bust, August\u0027s performance as a lover had dropped off a cliff. It was like there was an invisible thread connecting his dick to his net worth. When one shriveled, so did the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jim Barnet. Some cash-rich buyer wants to talk to us apparently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching beneath the Frette sheets, Leticia gently ran her fingers over August\u0027s balls. He used to love that in the old days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" August felt the first stirrings of an erection. A good sign? \"I hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandrake \u0026amp; Connors was one of the largest, most respected accounting firms on Wall Street. In Kruger-Brent\u0027s glory days, it\u0027d made a fortune acting for the firm. Now, in an ironic twist of fate, it found itself handling its bankruptcy. Unraveling the accounts of such a vastly complex network of businesses was expected to take months, if not years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust Sandford sat with five of his former colleagues in one of Mandrake \u0026amp; Connors\u0027s conference rooms. A month before, the six Kruger-Brent board members would have called the shots at such a meeting. Today, Whit Barclay, the accountant, was in charge. He was loving every minute of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all know why you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhit Barclay was a small man with a weak chin, receding hairline and permanently wet lips. A drone who had made it to the top of his anthill full of drones by the simple expedient of staying in the same job for thirty-two years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It goes without saying that everything that is discussed within these four walls today remains strictly confidential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kruger-Brenters murmured their assent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A company known as Cedar International has approached us, expressing an interest in a number of Kruger-Brent\u0027s more profitable business areas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And mining,\" muttered August Sandford. Tabitha Crewe shot him a venomous look. Everybody knew that Tabitha\u0027s division, which had been responsible for Kruger-Brent\u0027s gold and diamond mines, was a lame duck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" Whit Barclay averred. \"In any event, Cedar International - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust Sandford interrupted again. \"Who are these guys? I\u0027m sorry to piss on everybody\u0027s picnic. But has anyone heard of this company?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, Mr. Sandford. There\u0027s no need for coarse language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t,\" said Jim Barnet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me neither.\" Mickey Robertson and Alan Dawes agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do we know they\u0027re for real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhit Barclay flushed with anger. He was supposed to be chairing this meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can assure you, Cedar International is a legitimate, highly capitalized firm with - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but who are they? What do they do? They\u0027re not active in any of our business areas or we would have heard of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the conference room opened. Everybody turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhit Barclay said stiffly: \"Allow me to introduce the CEO of Cedar International.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust Sandford\u0027s jaw almost hit the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, August. Everybody.\" Lexi smiled sweetly. \"It\u0027s been a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi had done her homework. She knew exactly which of Kruger-Brent\u0027s businesses were viable and which had become dangerous drains on the firm\u0027s resources. She could afford to pick and choose, buying up the cream of the crop at bargain-basement prices. The only area where she\u0027d let her heart rule her head was in mining. Jamie McGregor had built Kruger-Brent on diamonds. Kruger-Brent without a mining division would be like Microsoft without Windows. Besides, she was convinced she could turn the business around, once she\u0027d fired Tabitha Crewe and the rest of the lazy yes-men whom Max had allowed to bleed the company dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce word got out that Lexi Templeton had bought the Kruger-Brent name and was rebuilding the firm, the press went wild for the story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBLACKWELL BEAUTY BUYS BACK BUSINESS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKRUGER-BRENT RISES FROM ASHES\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLEXI CLINCHES LAST-MINUTE DEAL\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe American public didn\u0027t think to question where Lexi had found the money for her epic business-buying spree. She was a Blackwell. Of course she was rich. Those closer to her were more suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d you do? Rob a bank?\" asked Robbie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi was coy. \"Ask me no questions and I\u0027ll tell you no lies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust, who had some idea how much money Lexi ought to have lost when her Kruger-Brent stock got wiped out, was even more perplexed. But he didn\u0027t dare bring up the subject. Lexi had thrown him a lifeline. He was in no hurry to start cutting the rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night in October, August and Lexi were working late, going through their European property portfolio. The smaller, leaner Kruger-Brent now operated out of Templeton\u0027s old offices. They were a lot less grand, but half the price, a proposition that worked for August. Sitting on the floor of Lexi\u0027s office amid a sea of paperwork - the new furniture had yet to arrive - they were both starting to get tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Italy.\" August yawned, rubbing his eyes. \"I say we keep the commercial stuff and ditch the residential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed.\" Lexi put her hand over her mouth. \"Oh God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe staggered to her feet. \"I think I\u0027m gonna throw up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came back from the bathroom a few minutes later looking white as a sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine. I think I\u0027m a little exhausted. Stress. Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust remembered his conversation with Max Webster the day their shares started crashing. I\u0027m fine. These Blackwells wouldn\u0027t know \"fine\" if it bit them in the ass. No one had seen Max since the firm went under. Rumors were rife that he\u0027d had a complete mental breakdown. August Sandford could well believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should see a doctor,\" he told Lexi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\" She picked up the next bulging file. \"Romania. Are we in or out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out. You should see a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi rolled her eyes. \"If I still feel bad on Monday, I\u0027ll go, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi had no intention of seeing a doctor. For one thing, she didn\u0027t have time. For another, medical science had yet to come up with a cure for heartbreak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning Kruger-Brent was all Lexi had ever wanted. She\u0027d risked everything to beat Max, and she\u0027d done it. She\u0027d won. But without Gabe to share it, her victory felt joyless and empty: a beautifully wrapped birthday present with nothing inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleep, that\u0027s what I need. And a vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the stress. Stress made people sick all the time, right? If anyone found out that she and Carl had deliberately manipulated Kruger-Brent\u0027s share price, they could both be looking at a decade in jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what\u0027s making me nauseous. Not Gabriel stupid McGregor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge and Edward Webster found their mother in the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mommy,\" said George. \"Daddy\u0027s got a tummy ache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he needs some pink medicine,\" added Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabel put down her gardening shears. Gardening was her therapy, her escape. Since Kruger-Brent\u0027s collapse, she\u0027d retreated to her rose beds more and more frequently, unable to bear watching Max tear himself apart with guilt. It was Eve\u0027s disappointment that haunted him most. Tortured by the idea that he\u0027d let his mother down, Max longed for her forgiveness. But of course, the crazy old bitch hadn\u0027t called or returned a single one of Max\u0027s calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you doing in Daddy\u0027s room? I told you not to go in there. Your father needs to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge said indignantly: \"We didn\u0027t go in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was lying on the floor in the hallway,\" Edward explained. \"We had to step over him to get our boots. Didn\u0027t we, George?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabel wasn\u0027t listening. Running across the yard to the house, her face and hands smeared with soil, she found Max curled up in a fetal position on the floor, groaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darling! Max. What did you do? Have you taken something? MAX!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook him hard. Max mumbled incoherently in response. Annabel could only catch a few words. \"Eve...Keith...she made me do it...\" Frantically, Annabel searched Max\u0027s pockets for pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, honey. Tell me what you\u0027ve taken.\" But it was no good. Leaving him clutching his stomach and moaning into the carpet, she dialed 911.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The good news is there\u0027s nothing physically wrong with him, Mrs. Webster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabel tried to focus on the psychiatrist\u0027s words. She was sitting in an office on the ground floor of a private sanatorium. It was a calming room, painted a restful sky-blue, with a large window overlooking the gardens. The psychiatrist, Dr. Granville, was about Annabel\u0027s age, blond-haired and handsome in a preppy, unthreatening sort of way. He seemed kind. At the general hospital, the staff had been too busy to reassure her. All their focus had been on Max. Understandably. By the time Annabel got him to the ER, he\u0027d started having seizures, frothing at the mouth like a rabid dog. He had to be sedated before the doctors could examine him. It was awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no overdose. No attempt at self-harm. That\u0027s good, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. It\u0027s all good. It\u0027s all completely fabulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what is wrong with him?\" Annabel wrung her hands despairingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to think of his body as an electrical circuit, with the brain as its center. Your husband\u0027s circuit simply overheated. All the fuses blew at once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nervous breakdown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Granville grimaced. \"I don\u0027t like that term. I wouldn\u0027t describe your husband\u0027s symptoms as a nervous condition. He is deeply depressed. I believe he may have lived with untreated schizophrenia for many years. There appear to be repressed memories - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabel interrupted. \"What can you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchizophrenia...depression...these were just useless labels. She wanted to know that Max was going to get better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Granville was sympathetic. \"I know it\u0027s very difficult. You want answers, and I don\u0027t have them for you. Eventually we will put him on drug treatment and into therapy. With the right combination of medication, symptoms can often be effectively managed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not cured?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Granville looked at the beautiful, exhausted woman in front of him and wished with all his heart he had the magic wand she needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one can be cured of being who they are, Mrs. Webster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next two weeks, there was no change in Max\u0027s condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnabel begged Eve to come and visit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asks for you constantly. For God\u0027s sake, Eve, he\u0027s your son! Whatever he\u0027s done, or not done, whatever happened at Kruger-Brent, can\u0027t you forgive him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the old woman\u0027s brain was as addled as her son\u0027s. Max was her husband, Keith. Max was her sister\u0027s husband, George Mellis. Max had raped her, disfigured her, stolen Kruger-Brent from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t speak his name to me!\" Eve screeched at Annabel on the phone. \"He\u0027s dead, dead and gone, and I hope he burns in hell!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStripping off his pajamas, Max felt peaceful. He was going to see his mother at last. Everything would be all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made rips in the sleeves and pant legs with a loose bedspring and began to tear. He should never have slept with Lexi. That was when the poison got into his system. He\u0027d been unfaithful to his mother. That\u0027s why Kruger-Brent had been taken from him. He was no longer clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalmly, methodically, he tied the strips of fabric together using a true lover\u0027s knot, a camping knot that his father had taught him in South Africa when he was a little boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome here, Max. Let me show you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to remember to teach the knot to Edward and George. They\u0027d go camping next summer. It\u0027d be a blast. Now that he wasn\u0027t working, he\u0027d have more time for the family. My darling boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding on the bed on tiptoes, naked, Max threw the knotted fabric over the ceiling beam. The noose felt wonderful against his neck, caressing his skin like a lover\u0027s fingers. He closed his eyes and let his mind drift back. His eighth birthday.
