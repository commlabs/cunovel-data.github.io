With the six team members divided between two Jeeps and a rented van, they\u0027d arrived in town with time to spare. They\u0027d left the Jeeps in the lot of an autobody shop and headed for Cannon\u0027s house in the van. The plan was to ditch the van at the shop lot after the op and make it back to SimGen in the Jeeps. But now...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, the house was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca had had his first premonition the moment they\u0027d pulled up in front: the lights were on. Upstairs and down. At four in the morning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d crept up to the windows - no one moving about inside. They\u0027d slammed through the rear door\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- no alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps pounded down the stairs behind him. Luca turned and saw a helmeted figure approaching, recognized him as Lowery when he lifted his visor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three bedrooms upstairs. The reports on her say she lives alone, but all three have slept-in beds. They\u0027re not warm, but I\u0027d guess they haven\u0027t been cold too long. Looks like they left in a big hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca felt as if he were turning to ice. \"You\u0027re saying they might have been tipped?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowery shrugged. \"Who\u0027d tip them? You and me were the only ones who knew where we were going. Maybe they got spooked. Maybe they spotted us watching the place and decided to take off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca turned away and ground his teeth. He should have kept someone here until the raid, but without Snyder and Grimes he was short-handed. What did he do now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said into his helmet mike. \"Everybody back to the van. We\u0027re outta here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d return to the other cars, but not to SimGen. Not yet. He was staying in this area. Maybe he\u0027d split up the team and send them looking for Cannon\u0027s Volvo. Slim chance there, but better than doing nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeeded time to think. No question now that Cannon and the sim were together. Find the doc and he\u0027d have the sim, and Cadman and Sullivan too, no doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButwhere? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-95.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
