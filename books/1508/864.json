This was a standard service weapon of Timeworn Phoenix City. Although it was only a middle-grade heaven-step weapon, in terms of toughness, it actually surpassed a high-grade heaven-step treasure. And with Lin Ming’s silver battle spirit attached to it, it was able to abruptly resist the Great Desolate Blood Halberd without breaking.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hahh!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming erupted with a shout and the muscles of his arms suddenly bulged outwards, the blue veins twisting about. He exhausted all of his strength to suddenly push forwards, restoring the red spear to its straight form. Situ Yaoyue felt an unstoppable potential rush towards her as she flew backwards. She tumbled in the air for several miles, the blood in her body tumbling, her insides hurting like all her organs were being twisted around.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter resisting the Great Desolate Blood Halberd’s attack, she had been easily struck backwards by Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat!?!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue didn’t dare to believe this was real. If Lin Ming had used a martial skill to attack her, then Situ Yaoyue would not be afraid. The Great Desolate Blood Halberd had the attribute of breaking apart all with absolute strength. She could depend on its powerful potential to shatter all energy based attacks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, something she never thought possible had happened. Lin Ming had frontally confronted her and blocked her attack! Where did this strength come from? Was he even human?! It was like he was an ancient dragon!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt had to be known that Situ Yaoyue was the wielder of the Great Desolate Blood Halberd. Even though she lacked the physical strength to move it, she could still drive it with her energy and use it to smash her opponents.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut Lin Ming was her enemy. It was impossible for him to pour any energy into the Great Desolate Blood Halberd. That meant that he could only rely on his own physical strength to block the Great Desolate Blood Halberd!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNormally, a martial artist would only undergo six phases of body transformation – Strength Training, Flesh Training, Viscera Training, Altering Muscle, Bone Forging and Pulse Condensation. During this time, one’s bodily strength would soar again and again. But after crossing Pulse Condensation, one’s strength would only slowly grow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn addition, one’s strength would increase again during the marrow washing of the Xiantian realm and also when the body was reformed during Life Destruction. A monstrous genius would have 50,000-60,000 jins of strength, and even someone with inborn divine strength wouldn’t surpass 70,000-80,000 jins of strength. After all, a martial artist simply wouldn’t use this strength fight. A Life Destruction martial artist could use heaven and earth origin energy to create sword lights and easily slice apart a mountain, so why would they care about a mere several tens of thousands of jins of strength?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, Lin Ming had completely subverted all of Situ Yaoyue’s understandings!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt wasn’t just Situ Yaoyue, but even the other martial artists watching were dumbfounded. This included even the Divine Sea Supreme Elders!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLooking at Lin Ming’s handsome and slender appearance, he didn’t seem like someone that could erupt with such terrifying strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSuch supernatural strength; could this also be a type of divine body?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithin the central region of the Sky Spill Continent, divine bodies, divine bloodlines, and dantian variations were all ideas deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. To them, anything that could greatly increase one’s martial talent or strength would be called a divine body. For instance, Lin Ming’s Ancient Phoenix bloodline.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Maybe it’s not a divine body, but rather a special body strength enhancing technique that relies on true essence.” On a spirit boat, a blue-clothed old man commended. His name was Shang Yuetian and his cultivation was at the early Divine Sea realm. He was the Highest Elder of the Shang Family Clan Holy Land. The Shang Family Clan was a part of the Sublime Smelting Divine Kingdom, and all of their previous generations had been on good terms with the Sublime Smelting Divine Kingdom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I also think so. Otherwise, to have two simultaneous kinds of divine body is far too terrifying!” Beside Shang Yuetian, a black-haired middle-aged man commented. His cultivation was also at the Divine Sea realm, and he was even at the middle Divine Sea realm. He was a subordinate of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough these two Divine Sea Supreme Elders had a great deal of experience, they had never heard of body transformation techniques like the Eight Inner Hidden Gates or Nine Stars of the Dao Palace, that could give someone millions or even billions of jins of strength. That simply exceeded everything they knew. Let alone now, but even 100,000 years ago, there were almost no body transformation technique martial artists left over on the Sky Spill Continent. This was because the Sky Spill Continent simply didn’t have enough resources for them to freely spend.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This secret technique is rarely seen… but no matter how powerful one’s bodily strength is, only a limited amount can be transformed into striking power…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShang Yuetian thought out loud. The martial artists of the Sky Spill Continent had never placed bodily strength in high regard. This was just like how mortals who used gunpowder weapons would then look down on sabers and swords.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue calmed down after a brief period of shock. She believed that Lin Ming must have forcefully enhanced his strength through the use of some arcane technique. However, this sort of technique inevitably had limits; it was impossible to maintain for extended periods of time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let me see how many of my moves you can block!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue gave a cold shout and rushed forwards once more. She raised the Great Desolate Blood Halberd in her hands and pounded it towards Lin Ming again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eClang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Great Desolate Blood Halberd brutally collided with Lin Ming’s red spear once more!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn every collision, the red spear in Lin Ming’s hand would violently deform. It would become a crescent moon or like a bent bow. Lin Ming’s two arms contained a terrifying divine strength. After bending, the red spear would return like a whip, every movement enough to shake mountains. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eClang!

Wherever they fought, mountains would shatter. Every casual step Lin Ming took was enough to collapse the ground, causing a storm of crushed stone to fly into the air!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSuch a method of fighting left all the present martial artists’ scalps tingling with fear and their souls shivering. This didn’t even seem like a fight between martial artists.

She used the Great Desolate Blood Halberd to catch the ground and slow herself down, causing a massive fissure to appear in the ground. Situ Yaoyue stood up with difficulty. Her blood tumbled within her and her creamy white chest fiercely heaved up and down in exhaustion. Her hands had already become numb!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this point, Situ Yaoyue wasn’t able to steadily hold onto the Great Desolate Blood Halberd. Her two lotus root-like arms trembled, as if she were an old woman at the end of her life!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe watched Lin Ming approach her from not too far away, and a look of panic and dread finally appeared on her beautiful face. Lin Ming simply didn’t seem as if he knew what exhaustion was. His strength continued to grow, becoming more and more fierce as the battle dragged on. This caused her to feel a blossoming fear in her heart. She was fast approaching her limit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough the two of them had clashed their weapons several times, they still hadn’t directly wounded each other. But, under the support of one million jins of strength, every single collision was like the impact of a falling meteor, a massive shaking impact that spread outwards. Even with their weapons as buffers, this shaking force still passed into their organs. If this damage accumulated, it would cause one’s blood to surge within them. If it was enough, then even their organs would break apart from the shock and bleed!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter those several dozen strikes, Situ Yaoyue nearly felt her bones break.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for Lin Ming, the more he fought, the more ferocious he became!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Situ Yaoyue spoke, blood began to flow out from the corners of her lips.

Situ Yaoyue’s body shook, and her clear jade-like arms became covered with blood. Several of her bones had also fractured. She vomited a mouthful of blood as an immense impact force rushed out from her body, causing countless stones to shoot into the air. With Situ Yaoyue as the center, the surrounding area in a several hundred foot wide radius nearly completely collapsed. As for Situ Yaoyue, originally just her legs had been nailed into the rock, but now her entire waist and stomach were buried too!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You!!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue’s face burned with shame and anger.

The bones in her two arms were shattered to pieces and blood began pouring out from her head. In that moment, she felt the world flip upside down as her mind went dizzy and thunder roared in her ears. The broken stones around her body had been completely crushed into powder by the tremendous impact force, causing sand and smoke to shoot into the skies.
