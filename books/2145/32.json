I held Alexander, who was anxious, around the waist. I wasn\u0027t able to calm him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gentle rain began to fall, and within a few minutes a trickle turned into a shower, but Alexander and I stayed put.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. and Mrs. Sterling descended the front steps of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was lovely meeting you, Raven. We hope to see you again soon\" Mrs . Sterling said, offering me her hand. \"Welcome to the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of taking her hand, I leaned in and hugged her hard. It was as if I were breaking the rules and hugging the queen ofEngland , but I didn\u0027t care. This woman meant the world to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander, darling, you know I love you,\" she said with a strain in her lyrical voice. She was trying to mask her emotion. She kissed her son good-bye on both cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood back as Mr. Sterling extended his hand to mine. \"It was a pleasure to have met you, Raven. We are all happier for it.\" He gave me polite kisses, one on each side of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will not be such strangers anymore,\" he said to Alexander. \"I\u0027ll await your next round of paintings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander\u0027s eyes lit up as he shook his father\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Dad,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men were surprised by his sudden affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we must be off,\" his father finally said. But there was something missing from Mrs. Sterling\u0027s wardrobe as we all stood in the downpour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is your parasol?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who needs an umbrella in the rain?\" she said, and stepped into the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continued to stand there as the car slowly pulled away and drove down the Mansion\u0027s drive, past the gate, and into the street. Mrs. Sterling didn\u0027t look back. Perhaps if she did, she would never have been able to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sad, for Alexander and for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears welled in my eyes, and I couldn\u0027t help but frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you crying?

As the car disappeared, he put his arm around me and led me back inside my second home-theSterlingMansion on Benson Hill. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-32.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
