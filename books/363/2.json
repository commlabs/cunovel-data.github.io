{"id":35478,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn the outer office, talking to Page, stood Anderton\u0027s slim and attractive young wife, Lisa. She was engaged in a sharp, animated discussion of policy, and barely glanced up as Witwer and her husband entered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, darling,\" Anderton said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWitwer remained silent. But his pale eyes flickered slightly as they rested on the brown-haired woman in her trim police uniform. Lisa was now an executive official of Precrime but once, Witwer knew, she had been Anderton\u0027s secretary.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNoticing the interest on Witwer\u0027s face Anderton paused and reflected. To plant the card in the machines would require an accomplice on the inside—someone who was closely connected with Precrime and had access to the analytical equipment. Lisa was an improbable element. But the possibility did exist.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the conspiracy could be large-scale and elaborate, involving far more than a \"rigged\" card inserted somewhere along the line. The original data itself might have been tampered with. Actually, there was no telling how far back the alteration went. A cold fear touched him as he began to see the possibilities. His original impulse—to tear open the machines and remove all the data—was uselessly primitive. Probably the tapes agreed with the card: He would only incriminate himself further.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe had approximately twenty-four hours. Then, the Army people would check over their cards and discover the discrepancy. They would find in their files a duplicate of the card he had appropriated. He had only one of two copies, which meant that the folded card in his pocket might just as well be lying on Page\u0027s desk in plain view of everyone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom outside the building came the drone of police cars starting out on their routine round-ups. How many hours would elapse before one of them pulled up in front of his house?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, darling?\" Lisa asked him uneasily. \"You look as if you\u0027ve just seen a ghost. Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" he assured her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLisa suddenly seemed to become aware of Ed Witwer\u0027s admiring scrutiny. \"Is this gentleman your new co-worker, darling?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWarily, Anderton introduced his new associate. Lisa smiled in friendly greeting. Did a covert awareness pass between them? He couldn\u0027t tell. God, he was beginning to suspect everybody—not only his wife and Witwer, but a dozen members of his staff.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you from New York?\" Lisa asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Witwer replied. \"I\u0027ve lived most of my life in Chicago. I\u0027m staying at a hotel—one of the big downtown hotels. Wait—I have the name written on a card somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhile he self-consciously searched his pockets, Lisa suggested: \"Perhaps you\u0027d like to have dinner with us. We\u0027ll be working in close cooperation, and I really think we ought to get better acquainted.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStartled, Anderton backed off. What were the chances of his wife\u0027s friendliness being benign, accidental? Witwer would be present the balance of the evening, and would now have an excuse to trail along to Anderton\u0027s private residence. Profoundly disturbed, he turned impulsively, and moved toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" Lisa asked, astonished.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Back to the monkey block,\" he told her. \"I want to check over some rather puzzling data tapes before the Army sees them.\" He was out in the corridor before she could think of a plausible reason for detaining him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRapidly, he made his way to the ramp at its far end. He was striding down the outside stairs toward the public sidewalk, when Lisa appeared breathlessly behind him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What on earth has come over you?\" Catching hold of his arm, she moved quickly in front of him. \"I knew you were leaving,\" she exclaimed, blocking his way. \"What\u0027s wrong with you? Everybody thinks you\u0027re—\" She checked herself. \"I mean, you\u0027re acting so erratically.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePeople surged by them—the usual afternoon crowd. Ignoring them, Anderton pried his wife\u0027s fingers from his arm. \"I\u0027m getting out,\" he told her. \"While there\u0027s still time.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But—why?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m being framed—deliberately and maliciously. This creature is out to get my job. The Senate is getting at me through him.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLisa gazed up at him, bewildered. \"But he seems like such a nice young man.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice as a water moccasin.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLisa\u0027s dismay turned to disbelief. \"I don\u0027t believe it. Darling, all this strain you\u0027ve been under—\" Smiling uncertainly, she faltered: \"It\u0027s not really credible that Ed Witwer is trying to frame you. How could he, even if he wanted to? Surely Ed wouldn\u0027t—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Ed?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s his name, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHer brown eyes flashed in startled, wildly incredulous protest. \"Good heavens, you\u0027re suspicious of everybody. You actually believe I\u0027m mixed up with it in some way, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe considered. \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe drew closer to him, her eyes accusing. \"That\u0027s not true. You really believe it. Maybe you ought to go away for a few weeks. You desperately need a rest. All this tension and trauma, a younger man coming in. You\u0027re acting paranoiac. Can\u0027t you see that? People plotting against you. Tell me, do you have any actual proof?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnderton removed his wallet and took out the folded card. \"Examine this carefully,\" he said, handing it to her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe color drained out of her face, and she gave a little harsh, dry gasp.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The set-up is fairly obvious,\" Anderton told her, as levelly as he could. \"This will give Witwer a legal pretext to remove me right now. He won\u0027t have to wait until I resign.\" Grimly, he added: \"They know I\u0027m good for a few years yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It will end the check and balance system. Precrime will no longer be an independent agency. The Senate will control the police, and after that—\" His lips tightened. \"They\u0027ll absorb the Army too. Well, it\u0027s outwardly logical enough. Of course I feel hostility and resentment toward Witwer—of course I have a motive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody likes to be replaced by a younger man, and find himself turned out to pasture. It\u0027s all really quite plausible—except that I haven\u0027t the remotest intention of killing Witwer. But I can\u0027t prove that. So what can I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMutely, her face very white, Lisa shook her head. \"I—I don\u0027t know. Darling, if only—\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now,\" Anderton said abruptly, \"I\u0027m going home to pack my things. That\u0027s about as far ahead as I can plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re really going to—to try to hide out?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. As far as the Centaurian-colony planets, if necessary. It\u0027s been done successfully before, and I have a twenty-four-hour start.\" He turned resolutely. \"Go back inside. There\u0027s no point in your coming with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you imagine I would?\" Lisa asked huskily.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStartled, Anderton stared at her. \"Wouldn\u0027t you?\" Then with amazement, he murmured: \"No, I can see you don\u0027t believe me. You still think I\u0027m imagining all this.\" He jabbed savagely at the card. \"Even with that evidence you still aren\u0027t convinced.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Lisa agreed quickly, \"I\u0027m not. You didn\u0027t look at it closely enough, darling. Ed Witwer\u0027s name isn\u0027t on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIncredulous, Anderton took the card from her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody says you\u0027re going to kill Ed Witwer,\" Lisa continued rapidly, in a thin, brittle voice. \"The card must be genuine, understand? And it has nothing to do with Ed. He\u0027s not plotting against you and neither is anybody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eToo confused to reply, Anderton stood studying the card. She was right. Ed Witwer was not listed as his victim. On line five, the machine had neatly stamped another name.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLEOPOLD KAPLAN\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNumbly, he pocketed the card. He had never heard of the man in his life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/265/412.html","bookId":363,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:26:42 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:26:42 AM"}
