And they pay for it very simply; by the lives they lead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of kids in my class argued the validity of that quote, probably because they thought taking the high road was the right answer, what Herr Silverman wanted, the response that would score you the most points on the SAT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know Herr Silverman wasn’t saying the Nazis who fled should be forgiven and given a fresh start. He was trying to make us think about how life is hard and people suffer in all sorts of ways without our adding to their suffering to satisfy our sense of vengeance, but I sort of don’t think that the quote holds up in the real world where literature and schooling and philosophy and morality don’t exist, because Asher and Linda and so many other culpable people seem to be fine—functioning exceptionally well within the world even—while I’m under a disgusting bridge about to put a hole in my skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this is how the Jewish Nazi hunters felt back in the fifties—like they were still living in Troll City even after they had been liberated from the Nazi death camps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe this is justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I’ve allowed myself to become this fucked-up, depressed, misunderstood person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this is all my fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I should have killed Asher Beal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, I was so angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsher definitely deserved to die.67\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe I should have tried to save Asher back when all the bad shit began—before he turned full-on evil?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was just a kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were just kids, and maybe we still are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can’t expect kids to save themselves, can you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve got the gun to my temple now and I’m rubbing the side of my head into the metal O.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels sort of nice—almost like a massage—as I push the P-38’s mouth harder and deeper into the soft spot of my skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like the P-38 is an old skeleton key I’m trying to fit into an old padlock and when I make that connection I’ll hear a click and a door will open and I’ll walk through and be saved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make that lock click, Leonard,” I whisper to myself. “You just have to squeeze your index finger and everything will be okay.
