He wondered why he felt nothing for her, when the native girl aroused in him such an unreasonable longing. It would be a good deal more convenient to fall for Jeannette.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He couldn\u0027t afford to get mixed up with his maid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Remembering her, he suddenly felt his body trembling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All right, he told himself, so she\u0027s an ignorant, backward native on a planet nobody ever heard of.
