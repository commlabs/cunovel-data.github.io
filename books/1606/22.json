There is a driving need to touch every drawer and every item, as if one might tell me it\u0027s the thing I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach the bottom drawer and still no answers. The plan I had, depended on light still being in the room or Bernie being with me… or both. I close my eyes, not that it makes a difference, and take a breath. I am defeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawl along the floor to his bedside. I drag my hands up the frame of the bed, clutching to the bedding and then to him. I lean my head against the cold railing and sob. I don’t have anything else. I have no Leo, Anna, Meg, Star, Bernie, or anyone to make a difference. Don’t even have Jake to just be there. It\u0027s just like before. I\u0027m ten years old and totally alone in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip to his arm, holding tight. If I let go, he\u0027s gone forever. I press my lips against his hand and let the tears wash over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy footsteps are clumsy on the stairs. My hand squeals along the metal railing as I slip a little. I\u0027m out of bullets and I don’t know if the door at the bottom is open or not. I just walk down the stairs. Something gleams off of the railing when I round a corner. There is light at the bottom of the stairs somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" a small voice shouts up into the stairwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see the stairs ever so slightly in the light that seems as if it\u0027s fading in and out. I round the corner to see the door open at the bottom of the stairs. A woman holding a torch smiles at me, \"Are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to cry and tell her I am dead inside, but I don’t. I shake my head and stumble down the last couple steps. She backs away so I can leave the stairwell. A man\u0027s leg sticks out the bottom, keeping the door ajar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe points behind her, \"I can\u0027t seem to get the main door open.\" Her words are desperate and edgy. I look at the main door in the torchlight and shake my head, \"You won\u0027t get that one open. We need a window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallows and nods, \"Okay. I know where a window is. What section did you come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sniffles, \"I don’t understand what\u0027s happened. Even the emergency lights have shut off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the window?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes the torch and points to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lead the way and I\u0027ll break the window.\" I need to get to Anna. She must be freaking out by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk through a dark, wide hallway, I can tell we are in the nicer part of the labs, where the general public gets to see everything. God knows what\u0027s in the black lab, besides my dead friend and my trapped father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t think about it all, I just can\u0027t. The coward in me is strong. She was trained well. She pushes me on, to get me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lady opens a door with no scanners and light floods us both. I see her better now. She\u0027s Michael\u0027s age and fragile. Her bones would break faster than a chicken\u0027s. She has dark hair and dark eyes with a worried look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe window looks over an alleyway between the buildings at ground level. It’s tinted to make it hard to see in. The light of the rising sun is just hitting the buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the window, examining it. There is no latch to open it. I look at the huge chair to the right. It\u0027s an office of sorts. There are metal cabinets and glass desktops with maps underneath. I grab the huge chair and drag it to the window. I lift it up and swing as hard as I can. The window bends almost and then cracks slightly. I swing the chair again, this time I use everything that\u0027s left. The window cracks but doesn’t fall out. I drag the chair back, pick it up and run at the window with it. The chair almost pushes me back, but the window buckles and the glass falls out, taking the chair with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand there and breathe as the fresh air hits me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want the freedom that is there in the fresh air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want the man that\u0027s dead upstairs and the other one in the basement. I can\u0027t face her without them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman has dropped the torch, leaving it to burn the carpet. I almost put it out, but then I remember where I am and what\u0027s left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow her out the window, not looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets are filled with people. Scared people, who have never lived with the nothingness the rest of us faced. Their city is worthless. It\u0027s now no different than any other corner of this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know that we made the right choice but I know we made the only one we had. The breeder farms are done, the work camps are for nothing, and the rebellion doesn’t matter anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet almost slap against the street as I make my way to the apartment we left Anna at. I almost don’t recognize the building when I get close to it. In the light it looks magical and not old at all, but she\u0027s there on the steps. She\u0027s sitting, waiting for me… us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sees me, sees the truth instantly. She doesn’t jump up. She stays seated on the front steps, avoiding the truth I bring with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes are bright blue, wide and glistening when I get close enough to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop, I can\u0027t do it. I drop to my knees, in the crowded street with the lost strangers surrounding us both, and sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer slim fingers lift to her face, covering her mouth. We stare at one another, tears streaming our faces. I shake my head subtly. It\u0027s the only time I will ever tell her this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cries harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down and let the shame of my failure cloak me in guilt, so heavy I will never be free of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and wait for my father to show up, or the infected, or something worse—God only knows what that could be. Instead, her skinny arms wrap around me and hold me. I am not worthy of her love and forgiveness, but I am grateful she is there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes my hand and we start the long walk out of the city. The people we pass are starting to panic; no one has answers. They fear war and starvation. They huddle and fight, and feel all of the things we all felt a decade ago. All of the things they got to avoid because they were apart of the chosen ones. The ones who got to live in the city and be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna grips my fingers, almost pulling me along. When we get to the gate, there is no one. We walk along the bridge over the river to the borderlands, not speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"EMMA!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it is. There is the man who will not die because I won\u0027t let him. He deserves to live. I turn back to see him standing there, wild-eyed and savage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna and I stop walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael storms towards me, out of breath and crazed looking. He points, \"YOU LITTLE BITCH! YOU THINK WE CAN\u0027T REBUILD THIS? YOU THINK THIS IS THE END?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell by the wild look on his face, it is. He can\u0027t rebuild, not this. Not without the power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"YOU THINK YOU CAN STOP ME? YOU\u0027RE LENNY\u0027S DAUGHTER, THROUGH AND THROUGH! CHICKEN SHIT LENNY!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn away from him, dragging Anna with me. He\u0027s trying to get me to kill him and let him off easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"DON’T YOU TURN YOUR BACK ON ME!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don’t look back. The world is fair and even, and everyone is the same, including him. I want to kill him but that would spare him the filth and disgusting things I have had to endure to live. I want him to know about the mess he made, the real version. Not the one he\u0027s been living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"EMMAAAAAAA!\" His screams become pathetic. He isn’t scary anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at Anna and smile, \"I am Lenny\u0027s daughter, through and through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles back through her tears, \"Yeah, you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to know how,\" she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at her from my log and sigh, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna shakes her head, \"I just do. We might die out here in the woods, and I don’t want to die and not know how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a bite of rabbit and stare at the campfire. My voice is hollow when I speak, \"Will was just had no more life support. The machines didn’t breathe for him, so he didn’t breathe anymore. He just stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear the tears I won\u0027t look at, \"Did you kiss him goodbye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"I couldn’t. I just left.\" I pick at the meat, \"Bernie was a gunshot to the back. He was shot once but still managed to send the missile. Then he got shot again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sobs silently, except for the sniffles. Sometimes she makes her wheeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want anymore to eat, but I know I have to. I\u0027m sick, with myself and the whole circumstance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her, \"We\u0027re lost, you know that right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, wiping away the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverywhere we\u0027ve walked I\u0027ve whistled for him, but he hasn\u0027t come. I\u0027m terrified they didn’t make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fall asleep that night next to her on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I\u0027d dreamt when I wake up; at least then I could have seen his face or listened to him singing that song with the Hey Ho. Instead, I wake to the feel of cool wind on my face. I haven’t felt cool wind in a long time. The hot summer feels like it\u0027s never going to end, the same way the cold winter does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open an eye and see Anna setting some fruit on a leaf for me. She\u0027s used my knife from my boot to cut the apples she has. I grimace. She sneers and whispers harshly, \"I washed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a cold wind,\" I mutter as I stand up, stretching my back and picking the ant off of my tank top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and passes me the broad leaf. I eat an apple slice and savor the flavor. \"Where did you find the apples?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe points. I never noticed in the dark that we\u0027re beside a farmhouse. The orchard has been overrun but the fruit trees are covered. My mouth drops, \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her a curious look, \"You check out the farmhouse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, \"Empty.\" Sometimes she doesn’t even say the words, just mouths them. I\u0027m getting better at reading her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe points at a hill to the left, \"That’s where Bernie\u0027s house is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over, \"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and takes a big bite of apple. \"Bernie always said he would go to the farm a few miles over and eat apples. He worried they might be radioactive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at my bite in the apple and grimace. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-22.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
