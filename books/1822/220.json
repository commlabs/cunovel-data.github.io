His gaze wandered to the mountains rising in the centre of the island. ‘Well, in that case, I think we\u0027ll have a look at this mine. I would like to meet a few of these ghosts.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can I have another chocolate croissant, first?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mr Linton!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Coming, Sir! I’m coming!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine and Yours\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took me one look over the bush to be certain we were in the right place. Quickly, I ducked down again and whispered: ‘That’s it! Lord Dalgliesh is here!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How do you know?’ Mr Ambrose enquired, not looking at me, but staring through a gap in the foliage at the man standing at the entrance to the abandoned mine. ‘That’s not Dalgliesh! I don\u0027t see him anywhere.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, but the guard at the entrance…!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’s wearing a French uniform. He’s not one of Dalgliesh’s men.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh yes, he is! That’s just it! I recognized him the moment I saw him. He was one of the men on the ship, one of those who were on deck when I climbed aboard.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, Mr Ambrose’s eyes turned sharper, more focused. They seemed to drill into the man who was standing at the entrance to the old mine, right in front of a worm-eaten old sign that said: Danger! Ne pas entrer!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hm. Well, if I can forge a uniform, then so can Dalgliesh. He might not even need to. Maybe he is actually in league with the French. They cannot like the idea of a canal at Suez under the control of an Englishman any more than he does.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You… you actually think he’d consider treason?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It wouldn’t be the first time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a moment of silence while I tried to digest that piece of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right,’ his voice finally cut through the silence, cold and controlled. ‘There are two possibilities. Either this guard is genuine, in which case he will turn us back with a few polite “Pardon, Messieurs”…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I told you he isn’t genuine!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘…or you are right and he is in Dalgliesh’s pay, in which case he should take us for soldiers of the Presidency Armies and let us pass.’ He shot me a dark look. ‘But in that case, there is no return. Once we’re out in the open, we have to keep going, down into the mine. Do you understand, Mr Linton?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated - then nodded. ‘Yes, Sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I assume it would be of no avail trying to convince you to stay behind?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised an eyebrow. ‘After I’ve come this far, you want me to stay here and miss all the fun? Are you mad?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have a strange definition of “fun”, Mr Linton.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you don\u0027t have one at all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mr Linton?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Be quiet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Sir!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethodically, he took his watch out of his pocket and fiddled around with the dials. I wanted to ask what he was doing, but that would have been rather incompatible with staying quiet. Finally, he seemed to be content, and put his watch away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mr Linton?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you ready?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Sir, I am, Sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then follow me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he rose to his full height. Stepping out from behind the bush, he advanced on the guard in French uniform, his stride perfectly confident, as if nothing in the world could turn him back. I followed close at his heels. The guard turned his head, and spotted us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugger! Please don’t shoot us, don’t shoot us, don’t shoot us…!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t make a move. Was he just too startled to react? For one moment, I questioned my own memory. Was he really one of Dalgliesh’s men? His French uniform looked perfect to the last button. He could have come from a parade on the Champs-Élysées. But if he was Dalgliesh’s man, and saw through our disguise…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached into his pocket. Oh God! What was he going for? His gun?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out a pipe and lit it. We were only ten yards away now. His eyes followed us closely. Seven yards. Six. Five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease don’t get suspicious! Please don’t! Please!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the pipe out of his mouth. Three yards. Two. One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were past. He hadn’t stopped us, hadn’t acted as if we were there at all. The tunnel swallowed us, and we continued on, down into the darkness. I had been right. This was Lord Dalgliesh’s lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know how long we wandered down the gloomy tunnel. In the half-light, interrupted only by the occasional burst of brightness from an opening in the ceiling, time seemed to stand still. Or at least, to me it did. To Mr Ambrose, as the quiet ticking of his pocket watch reminded me, time was always running, and he had to catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point, rusty rails began appearing on the ground beside us, and we saw one or two mine carts lying keeled over on the ground. Spiderwebs hung from the rusted iron and from the low, vaulted ceiling over our heads. Ahead, a point of light appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What is that?’ I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That,’ came Mr Ambrose’s reply, his voice as dark and cold as the tunnel around us, ‘is where Lord Dalgliesh is.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pace quickened. I almost had to run to keep up with him. The light in front of us grew larger and brighter, until the tunnel finally opened up spat us out. My mouth dropped open. And this time not because of seeing women display their knees on the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were standing at the edge of a huge natural cave. The ceiling high above our heads was a monster’s jaw, armed with stalactites as tusks and teeth. Torches hung from iron brackets on the walls, their smoke disappearing through a dark hole in the ceiling. With the view thus not obscured by smoke, as it usually would have been in any mine, I could clearly see the figures that stood and marched all around the giant cavern: soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo French uniforms here. These were all soldiers of the Presidency Armies, proudly proclaiming their allegiance in colours of blood-red and blue. They rolled crates around on mine carts, patrolled along the walls, or carried messages. All was a buzz of activity. And over the heads of the busy little underground kingdom hung the sign of their king: the two golden lions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’s not very concerned about concealing who is behind this, is he?’ I asked, staring up at the huge banner. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-220.html","bookId":1822,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:20:34 PM"}
