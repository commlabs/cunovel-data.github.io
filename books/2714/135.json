Don’t you love it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around to find him leaning against the kitchen entrance now, his eyes narrowed as he watched me pull glasses from his cupboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since when did you two become such good friends?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to tell him that was none of his damn business but Shakespeare said, “Since I helped him with his resume a few weeks ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed both hands to my heart and grinned as annoyingly as I could. “We bonded. It was beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGamble contorted his face into an expression of supreme confusion. Then he glanced at his wife. “He didn’t hit on you, did he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed and rolled her eyes. “Noel. Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Noel,” I echoed. “Really? I was a perfectly respectable gentleman.” Then I winked at Shakespeare. “After we put our clothes back on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGam’s face turned dark red. “You motherfucker!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God, Noel!” Shakespeare grabbed his arm and started laughing. “He was joking. It was a joke.” She sent me a wide-eyed, cut-it-out look. “I don’t think he thought that was so funny, Ten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged and snagged a chip from a bowl on the table. “Well, it sure amused the hell out of me, which is all that counts. Some people,” I arched my eyebrows at Gam, “just take things way too fucking seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is everyone?” Aspen asked, desperate to change the conversation. “Colton! Brandt! Caroline! Supper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColton came torpedoing into the room first with Brandt right on his heels. They both skidded to a stop when they saw me. Their eyes went wide as if they were sure I was going to call them out for what they’d done earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I simply sent them a big grin. “Hey, guys. Long time, no see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt cleared his throat, ducked his face and hurried to a chair. Colton followed with similar meekness. I waited until they were both seated before I took the chair between them and slid down. They grew even more restless, and I almost busted a gut laughing. But damn, I loved fucking with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I was settling in, a breathless Caroline swept into the room, only to jerk to a halt when she met my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn’t stop gawking, so I sent her a cringe and pointed to myself. “I’m sorry, did I steal your chair?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” She blinked and glanced around at the places. “No,” she started, only to shake her head. “Well, actually yes, but you’re fine. It’s fine.” She sent her older brother a puzzled glance. “Uh...I guess we’re having a guest for supper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He invited himself,” Gam intoned dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline shook herself again and finally took the last free chair available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so began our supper together as one big, happy family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was halfway through my second taco when Gamble frowned suspiciously at me and leaned across the table, squinting. I shrank away from him, hoping I wasn’t sporting a hickey or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a new black eye?” he finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI totally wasn’t expecting that question, so I said, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt started choking on a tortilla chip. While I patted him on the back, Gamble turned his attention to his middle brother. “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt couldn’t look him in the eye while he nodded. “Mmm hmm. Fine. Great. Wonderful. Splendorific.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGamble glanced at his wife. “Why’s he acting so weird?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Shakespeare shrugged, honestly clueless, Caroline answered, “Probably because he’s a dork.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “I’ll second that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline glanced at me, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “All in favor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and I both raised our hands. When no one else seemed to catch on that we were voting on Brandt’s dorkhood, I grabbed Colton’s arm and lifted it for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three against two,” I said. “It’s official. Brandt’s a dork.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Brandt cried, “Hey, that’s not fair,” Caroline and I grinned across the table at each other...until her smile fell. “Oh my God, you really do have a new bruise. Right around your left eye. The one Zoey gave you was around your right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See, I thought so.” Gamble pointed victoriously. Then he snickered. “Who’d you piss off this time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt’s head snapped up, his eyes huge. He must’ve thought I was going to rat him out. But I just shrugged. “It’s hard to tell. I’ve gotten so many lately, it’s impossible to keep track without, like, a spreadsheet or something. Honestly, I think they’re starting to spawn and have babies together.” Colton giggled at that. So I kept going, pointing at my throbbing eye. “I swear this one’s the great-grandkid of the one you gave me last year, Gam.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-135.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
