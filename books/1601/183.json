The entrance to the valley was now fortified with a series of chest-high earthen bulwarks. Those would be excellent for crossbowmen to use as cover, if Ituralde’s pike formations were ever pushed back too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, Ituralde had split his army into groups of around three thousand men each, then organized them into square formations of pikes, billhooks and crossbows. He used mounted crossbowmen as skirmishers in the front and on the flanks, and had formed up a vanguard—about six ranks deep—of pikemen. Big pikes, twenty feet long. He’d learned from Maradon that you wanted to keep your distance from the Trollocs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikes worked wonderfully. Ituralde’s pike squares could pivot and fight in all directions in case they were surrounded. Trollocs could be forced to fight in ranks, but these squares—properly applied—could break up their lines. Once the Trolloc ranks were shattered, the Aiel could kill with abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind ranks of pikemen he positioned foot soldiers carrying billhooks and halberds. Sometimes Trollocs fought their way through the pikes, pushing the weapons aside or pulling them down with the weight of corpses. The billhookmen then moved up—slipping between the pikemen—and hamstrung the leading Trollocs. This gave the leading foot soldiers time to pull back and regroup while the next wave of soldiers—more foot, with pikes moved up to engage the Trollocs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was working, so far. He had a dozen such squares of troops facing the Trollocs in the night. They fought defensively, doing whatever they could to break the surging tide. The Trollocs threw themselves at the pikemen, trying to crack them, but each square operated independently. Ituralde didn’t worry about the Trollocs that made it through the gauntlet, because they would be handled by the Aiel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIturalde had to keep his hands clasped behind his back to conceal their shaking. Nothing had been the same after Maradon. He’d learned, but he’d paid dearly for that education.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurn these headaches, he thought. And burn those Trollocs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree times, he had nearly given the order to send his armies in with a direct assault, abandoning the square formations. He could imagine them slaughtering, killing. No more delaying. He wanted blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach time, he’d stopped himself. They weren’t here for blood, they were here to hold. To give that man the time he needed in the cavern. That was what it was all about . . . wasn’t it? Why did he have so much trouble remembering that lately?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother wave of Trolloc arrows dropped onto Ituralde’s men. The Fades had some of them stationed on the tops of the slopes above the pass, in places that Ituralde’s own archers had once held. Getting them up there must have been quite an undertaking; the walls of the pass were very steep. How many would have dropped to their deaths making the attempt? Regardless, Trollocs weren’t good shots with bows, but they didn’t need to be, when firing at armies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe halberdiers raised shields. They couldn’t fight while holding those, but they kept them strapped to their backs for need. The falling arrows increased, plummeting through the lightly foggy night air. The storm rumbled overhead, but the Windfinders were at their task again, keeping it away. They claimed that at several moments, the army had been mere breaths away from an all-out storm of destruction. At one point, hail the size of a man’s fist had fallen for about a minute before they’d wrested control of the weather again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that was what awaited them if the Windfinders weren’t using their bowl, Ituralde was more than happy to leave them at their task. The Dark One wouldn’t care how many Trollocs he destroyed while sending a blizzard, twister or hurricane to kill the humans they fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They’re gathering for another surge at the mouth of the pass!\" someone yelled in the night air, followed by other calls confirming it. Ituralde peered through the mist, aided by light from the bonfires. The Trollocs were indeed regrouping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Withdraw the seventh and ninth infantry squads\", Ituralde said. \"They’ve been at it too long. Pull the fourth and fifth out of reserve and have them take flanking positions. Prepare for more arrows. And . . \". He trailed off, frowning. What were those Trollocs doing? They’d pulled back farther than he’d have expected, drawing into the darkness of the pass. They couldn’t be retreating, could they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark wave slid out of the mouth of the pass. Myrddraal. Hundreds upon hundreds of them. Black cloaks that did not move, in defiance of the breeze. Faces with no eyes, lips that sneered, black swords. The creatures moved like eels, sinuous and sleek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey gave no time for orders, no time for response. They flowed into the squares of defenders, sliding between pikes, whipping deadly swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aiel!\" Ituralde bellowed. \"Bring in the Aiel! All of them, and channelers! Everyone except for those who guard at the Pit of Doom itself! Move, move!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMessengers scrambled away. Ituralde watched in horror. An army of Myrddraal. Light, it was as bad as his nightmares!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seventh infantry collapsed before the attack, square formation shattering. Ituralde opened his mouth to order the primary reserve—the one defending his position—to give support. He needed the cavalry to ride out and draw pressure off the infantry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t have much cavalry; he’d agreed that most of the horsemen would be needed on other fronts. But he did have some. They’d be essential here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed his eyes shut. Light, but he was exhausted. He had trouble thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePull back before the attack, a voice seemed to be saying to him. Pull back to the Aiel, then make a stand there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pull back . \". he whispered. \"Pull . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething felt very, very wrong about doing that. Why was his mind insisting upon it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Tihera, Ituralde tried to whisper. You have command. It wouldn’t come out. Something physical seemed to be holding his mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear men screaming. What was happening? Dozens of men could die fighting a single Myrddraal. At Maradon, he’d lost an entire company of archers—one hundred men—to two Fades who had slipped into the city at night. His defensive squads were built to deal with Trollocs, to hamstring them, to drop them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fades would crack those pike squares open like eggs. Nobody was doing what needed to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord Ituralde?\" Captain Tihera said. \"My Lord, what was it you said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they retreated, the Trollocs would surround them.
