I can\u0027t believe she let you. Or did you first play with her mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did what I had to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I marked her as mine,\" Grigori replied coldly. \"And for this very reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey frowned, confused. \"But she\u0027s not like Antoinette.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I would not steal her mind, her will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Alexi could do it, couldn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori nodded. The older vampyre could make her a revenant, or force the Dark Gift upon her. Either one would negate Grigori\u0027s power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey stared at him, his anger slowly fading. \"So where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexi has taken her to a small vineyard about three miles from here. It used to belong to my uncle Pietro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three miles! That\u0027s a heck of a walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori arched one brow. \"We aren\u0027t going to walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are we standing here for? Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All in good time.\" Grigori looked over at Antoinette. She was sitting on the sofa, her hands folded in her lap. A puppet waiting for someone to pull the strings. It grieved him to see her so, she who had always had a mind of her own, who had been vibrant and alive. He thought of the high-spirited arguments they had had, the way her eyes had flashed at him when he had roused her temper, the delight of making up afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing the floor, he knelt before her. Lifting one hand, he stroked her cheek, let his fingers trail through her hair. \"Antoinette, close your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, trusting as a puppy, and then her eyelids fluttered down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\" Edward asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Free her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Wait a minute, you don\u0027t mean to\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to bring her over.\" Grigori stared at Edward over Antoinette\u0027s head. \"Have you ever seen anyone made Vampyre, Ramsey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to stay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward hesitated a moment, and then nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori took a deep breath and then he sat down on the sofa beside Antoinette. Enfolding her in his arms, he bent her back and kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey stood where he was, unable to move, as he watched the vampire tilt Antoinette\u0027s head to the side, gently brush the hair away from her neck. He sensed an energy in the air, a gathering of preternatural power, as Grigori bent over his wife\u0027s neck. Chills ran down Edward\u0027s spine as he imagined the vampire\u0027s fangs piercing the tender skin at the side of Antoinette\u0027s neck, and then, with revulsion, he imagined Grigori\u0027s fangs at his own throat, drinking his life\u0027s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward wiped the cold sweat from his brow. There was no sound in the room save the rasp of his own breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the vampire and the woman, his hand clutching his cross, the stake shoved into the waistband of his trousers feeling suddenly heavy. This was the perfect time to destroy Chiavari and the woman... to free the woman\u0027s soul from Chiavari\u0027s evil influence and send the vampire to hell where he belonged. But Edward couldn\u0027t move, could hardly breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChiavari seemed to loom over the woman like a great black bird of prey, yet he had not changed shape. Antoinette had gone limp in the vampire\u0027s embrace. Her face was turned toward Edward. She looked deathly pale; he couldn\u0027t tell if she was breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep sigh rose from Grigori\u0027s throat. He drew back and Edward caught a glimpse of hell-red eyes and fangs stained with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized he was holding his breath, that his hand ached from holding the cross so tightly. He felt the bile rise in his throat as the vampire bit his own wrist, and then pressed the bleeding wound to Antoinette\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink, Antoinette,\" Grigori urged softly. \"You must drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver of repugnance slithered down Ramsey\u0027s spine as he watched the woman drink the vampire\u0027s blood. He watched in morbid fascination as the color returned to her cheeks. Her hands clutched the vampire\u0027s arm, holding his wrist to her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is done!\" Grigori wrenched his arm from Antoinette and stood up. He ran his tongue over the wound in his wrist, licked the blood, hers and his, from his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward Ramsey swore under his breath as Antoinette stood up, her cheeks rosy with life, her eyes filled with awareness and intelligence. And confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at Grigori uncertainly, and then smiled. \"Mi amore,\" she murmured. \"I have missed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori nodded. \"And I have missed you.\" He stood there, waiting for her memory to return, and it would, all of it, everything that had happened. He wondered if she would hate him for what he\u0027d just done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel so strange,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew the moment her memory returned. He saw it in the horror in her eyes, heard it in the hoarse cry that was torn from her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antonio,\" she whispered. \"Martina.\" She ran out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori followed her into the bedroom. She was standing in the doorway of the room their children had shared, tears streaming down her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He killed them,\" she said. \"And I shall kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her hands clench, heard the steel in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she turned to face him. \"What have you done to me, Grigori?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have made you what I am,\" he replied. \"What he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" he replied quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, and he saw the knowledge grow within her. Would she accept the Dark Gift? Or would it drive her to madness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted one hand and studied it carefully. And then, slowly, her fingers curled into a fist. \"I shall tear out his heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at him then. \"Thank you, Grigori, for freeing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t hate me, then, cara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could never hate you. But tell me, how did you become Vampyre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe related the story quickly, and then told her everything that had happened since Alexi had escaped the carnival. \"And now he\u0027s brought Marisa here,\" he said in conclusion, \"and I\u0027ve got to find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComprehension flickered in Antoinette\u0027s eyes. \"You love her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had not wanted to admit it, not even to himself, but he couldn\u0027t lie to Antoinette. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe accepted it with a nod of her head. \"What do you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are three to his one,\" Antoinette said with determination. \"He shall not escape us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t underestimate his power,\" Grigori warned. \"My strength is not equal to his, and yours is less than mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not afraid of him,\" Antoinette replied with a toss of her head. \"I will not rest until I have avenged the deaths of my children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall ask one thing of you, Grigori, and you must promise me you will do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stillness rose within him as he waited for her to go on. He knew what she would ask. Knew he could not do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he is dead, when our children have been avenged, you will destroy me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was what he had been expecting. \"Cara, do not ask this of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Grigori, I do not want to live in darkness. I cannot live on the lives of others. Promise me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated a moment before he said, \"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long look passed between them, and then she smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s at old Pietro\u0027s winery, and Marisa is with him,\" Grigori said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy?\" Ramsey exclaimed. \"It\u0027s a trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think I know that?\" Grigori asked, his voice sharp. \"But I can\u0027t leave her there. You know what he\u0027ll do if I don\u0027t come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll do it anyway!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps, but I told you once before, we\u0027ll never catch him until he lets us. This may be our only chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need a plan,\" Ramsey said, his agitation rising. He clutched his cross, rubbing it between his palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I plan to kill him,\" Grigori said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are wasting time,\" Antoinette said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, as always, cara,\" Grigori replied with a wry grin. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa woke to darkness. When she tried to move, she discovered that her hands were bound behind her back. Fighting down the fear that threatened to choke her, she sat up and glanced around. Nothing but blackness met her eyes. She struggled against the ropes that bound her wrists, but to no avail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Alexi?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Grigori?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a vague recollection of waking in a small house, of lying on a bed while Alexi prowled through the rooms. Was this the same house?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an effort, she gained her feet and then, one shoulder against the wall, she began to walk slowly around the room, searching for a door. She cried out when her knee struck something. Turning around, she felt the obstruction with her hands. It was a staircase. Moving carefully, she climbed up, grunting when she hit her head. She was in a cellar. She could see a sliver of dark blue sky through the crack in the heavy double doors above her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello? Is anyone there?\" She heard the edge of panic in her voice. \"Hello! Help me! Someone, please help me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone is coming, Marisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe low voice startled her. She whirled around, her foot slipping on the stair. With a shriek, she tumbled down the steps to land in a heap on the earthen floor. The sound of soft laughter filled her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grigori will come for you,\" Alexi said. \"And then we will end the game. I will drain his life, and that of the vampyre hunter, as well, and then I shall make you mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, Marisa. Do not doubt it.\" He cocked his head to the side, and smiled. \"Listen! They come!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori stood at the entrance to the cellar, his senses probing the darkness. Marisa was here, and so was Alexi. He glanced at Antoinette, standing serenely beside him, then at Ramsey. Tension flowed from Ramsey in waves, but he had his fear well in hand. Moonlight gleamed off the cross around his neck. He held a hawthorne stake in one hand, a hammer in the other. A bottle of holy water was tucked into his coat pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori blew out a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing to be said. They would rescue Marisa and kill Alexi, or they would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed Antoinette, and then he turned, took hold of the cellar doors, and ripped them off the hinges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa was lying on the floor at the foot of the stairs. Blood oozed from her cheek, her arm, her leg. The scent inflamed his senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexi!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am here, Chiavari.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, find me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, come, Chiavari, play the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roar, Grigori launched himself down the stairs. Scooping Marisa into his arms, he carried her out of the cellar and thrust her into Ramsey\u0027s arms. \"Get her out of here! Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t wait for an answer, but flew back into the cellar, his gaze piercing the darkness, his nostrils flaring, his fangs bared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here,\" Alexi said, and before Grigori could locate the voice, Alexi was on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori fell back under the other vampyre\u0027s onslaught. Alexi had fed recently, and the scent of blood teased Grigori\u0027s senses. Alexi clawed at his face and chest, his nails and teeth tearing through skin and flesh and muscle. Rage flowed through Grigori. His fangs lengthened, his own hands became claws, slashing through the air. The sound of Alexi\u0027s mocking laughter rang in his ears. The scent of his own blood filled his nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the vampyre\u0027s teeth savage his neck, tearing at his throat. The thought of the vampyre drinking his blood filled him with fury, and he flung Alexi away from him, heard a satisfying thud as the vampyre slammed into the wall. Almost immediately, Alexi was back, his eyes glowing blood-red in the darkness, his lips stained with crimson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood. It was everywhere. Marisa\u0027s. His own. Alexi\u0027s. The air was thick with the warm, sweet scent of it. Hunger rose up within Grigori like a bright crimson flame, blinding him to everything but the awful need that overshadowed everything else. He felt Alexi\u0027s fingernails tear at his throat again, slashing through his flesh, severing his jugular, and he fell back, his strength gushing out of him in a dark red torrent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shrill scream filled the air as Antoinette lunged toward Alexi. Grigori sat up in time to see her drive a fat wooden stake into Alexi\u0027s back. With a roar of pain and rage, Alexi whirled around to face her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a feral growl, Antoinette hurled herself at Alexi. All trace of humanity was gone from her eyes as she flung herself at the creature who had killed her children. Her arms and legs curled around him, holding on with iron tenacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexi reeled backward, his eyes blazing with pain, the wooden stake protruding from his back. He tried to shake her off, but somehow she managed to hold on. Her fangs sank deep into his neck. Her nails gouged his cheeks, his eyes....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori watched, helpless, as Antoinette and Alexi struggled. Even though Alexi was bleeding, even though she had driven a stake into his body, her strength, that of a newly made vampyre, was as nothing compared to Kristov\u0027s. A low growl rumbled in Alexi\u0027s chest as he sank his teeth into her jugular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Gathering what little strength he had left, Grigori gained his feet and grabbed Alexi\u0027s arm, but the vampyre shook him off. Grigori stumbled backward, his head striking the edge of the stairs. He felt the skin split, felt a rush of hot blood flow down his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not over, Chiavari,\" Alexi declared, and clutching Antoinette\u0027s limp body in one arm, he vanished into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrigori tried to stand up, but he had no strength left. Blood soaked his clothing, the ground beneath him. He glanced at the sky, judging the time, and knew he had to find a place to hide before the sun found him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his hands and knees, he dragged himself up the stairs and across the damp ground, searching for shelter. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shades-of-gray-vampire-trilogy-1/page-18.html","bookId":2296,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:06 PM"}
