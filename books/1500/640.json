The three breeding rooms had nearly identical layouts, but Su didn’t obtain too much useful information. The two breeding rooms were still extremely messy; it seemed like the researchers weren’t given much time when the order to gather in Passage 54 was issued. The true classified information should all be stored in the central host computer, and the managers of these two breeding rooms clearly didn’t have a fondness for writing things down like Chinola.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn breeding room number one where the biological body escaped, Su searched especially carefully, but he ended up with nothing. The breeding tanks didn’t have a single bit of malfunction or trace of damage, and unlike the main breeding hall, the breeding tanks here had all been washed. Due to too much time passing, there was no way of differentiating the culture fluid’s original contents, and it was even more difficult to find out what these so-called ranked experimental subjects were.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter inspecting these three identical breeding rooms, the uncomfortable feeling in Su’s mind already decreased quite a bit. In addition, from Chinola’s notes, the ranked experimental bodies weren’t artificially created, but were rather obtained from some creature’s cells, very likely of that ‘one’ Rochester brought away.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRegardless, perhaps, he wasn’t alone, still having others of the same species. Even if he truly grew up here, it wasn’t that big of a deal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu suddenly felt his mind relaxing quite a bit, even though his intuition told him that a meeting with similar species wouldn’t be all that joyful. As for that woman in the depths of the base, there were still some minute yet key differences. She was quite similar to him, but they weren’t of the same species.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter leaving the first breeding room, Su continued along the dark and deep passage, no idea where the other end of this passage led to or what was awaiting him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOn the other end of the underground base was a mysterious lounge, the dark haze inside so thick it almost had substance. This appeared as an expanse of darkness even in Su’s perception, completely unable to see anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe instruments and equipment in the lounge had long been moved away, the four snow-white walls full of mural paintings. He called them paintings, but they were actually just countless chunks of messy colors pieced together. Not even an influential figure with great artistic attainments in modern abstract art could recognize what exactly was painted on these walls.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAbility users with sharp perception would see that energy was currently flowing about between the chunks of color in an orderly manner. Even if it was an ordinary person, they would feel dizzy after staring at it long enough. Moreover, during this process, due to their internal organs being incapable of adapting to what they were seeing, they would also receive serious internal injuries and pass away soon after.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe floor of this lounge had chunks of color painted in a similar style. Energy flowed between the chunks of color, ultimately converging into a breeding tank at the very center. The breeding tank had clearly experienced remodeling, now equipped with many installations that were definitely not human style, the dark red chunks covering the gauges continuously flickering. No electrical leads could be seen from the exterior, nor could any energy source ports be found. In addition, Perception Domain ability users could see that the energy gathering from the four walls and floor all directly landed on several receiver-like plates, thus absorbed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWireless energy transmission technology!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eUpon seeing this scene, perhaps any scientist would cry out with fear. If they could fully understand these instruments, the power of human civilization would take another huge leap. The meaning and significance of this was too great, even greater than the exploitation of nuclear energy, second only to the production of abilities!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe breeding tank was filled with light green nutrient fluid. The nutrient fluid was slowly moving, strings of fine bubbles released from the bottom of the breeding tank from time to time. This five meter tall equipment was the human race’s most advanced biological cultivating system, the culture fluid composition self-adjusting, moreover completely self-regulated. If it was just to ensure the survival of a creature, as long as the energy source was maintained, it could continue to operate without maintenance for 30 years. Now that large amounts of extremely advanced installations and equipment were set up, it was already unknown just how many times better this breeding tank became.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eInside the breeding tank’s nutrient fluid floated a naked male. Even though he was sleeping, his chest that slowly rose and fell indicated that the body still carried life. He looked thirty or so in age, his figure large and tall, face resolute, the muscle lines around his body clear, full of masculine aesthetics. However, he was floating in this nutrient fluid, no reactions at all aside from the most basic life signs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn front of the breeding tank knelt a young woman, her hands crossed before her chest, currently praying in a quiet voice. Only after a moment had passed did she raise her head and look at the man in the breeding tank, her face full of deep longing and endless desire.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Jason, my love, are you still unwilling to wake? Actually, after all these years, if you wanted to wake up, you would have definitely woken up a long time ago. Back then, I didn’t understand your way of thinking, not understanding why you would rather perish than abandon others of your species. They only thought about running with their own lives, even to the extent where they would push you towards me.
