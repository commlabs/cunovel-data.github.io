However, everyone knew that this was only the calm before the true storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storm was nigh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final, decisive battle was coming!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to where the location of the final battle would be, many opinions were voiced by various Southern Domain cultivators. Some people had their minds set on the Blood Demon Sect. With the spell formations that were already in place, much time could be saved. Furthermore, the majority of the battle-ready cultivators in the Southern Domain were already congregated in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany others felt that the best location was the point where the Northern Reaches cultivators actually entered the Southern Domain. Doing so would prevent the Northern Reaches cultivators from razing and pillaging the rest of the Southern Domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, Pill Demon, Patriarch Song, and Patriarch Golden Frost all agreed that time was the most valuable commodity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, the Blood Demon Sect was selected. It was far from the Milky Way Sea, but relatively close to the Black Lands, and could be considered to be on the border of the Southern Domain. Although this would cede a large amount of territory, every day that they continued to survive was another day that the Northern Reaches would not be able to completely conquer the Southern Domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the Northern Reaches cultivators would have to travel all the way to the Blood Demon Sect, which meant that the Southern Domain cultivators would have more time to prepare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the decision was made by Pill Demon, Patriarch Song, and Patriarch Golden Frost, all the battle-ready cultivators of the Southern Domain were marshaled. There were approximately 200,000 of them, and they were divided into multiple defensive fronts, with the Blood Demon Sect at the center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Pill Demon and the others personally went around the Southern Domain to the remaining sects and clans to collect vast quantities of supplies and treasures. They also set up enormous spell formations, ten in total, which caused shocking pressure to weigh down around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe atmosphere was tense. All of the Southern Domain cultivators were focused on healing and recovering their energy. Every area on the final battleground was filled with silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final battle would determine victory or defeat. If the Southern Domain was victorious, they would be able to welcome in a new era of peace. After a period of rest and reorganization, they would be able to once again bloom like a beautiful flower, even more resplendent than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if they were defeated….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Southern Domain would essentially become part of the Northern Reaches. Their core Daoist teachings and doctrines would be wrenched away. Their cultivators would be exterminated and the foundation of the Southern Domain would be lost. They would be ruled by the Northern Reaches, and years later… perhaps no one would even remember the formerly glorious Southern Domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the battle for everything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would live or die. There was no option for surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days earlier, Meng Hao had returned to the Blood Demon Sect, where the final battle would soon take place. He went back to the same location where he had held Xu Qing and watched the sunrises and sunsets. Except now, there weren’t two shadows falling on the ground. There was only his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis white hair fluttered in the wind, and his blood-red robe swayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was pale white, morbid and seemingly devoid of blood. It was a sharp contrast to the redness of his robe. However, his eyes radiated darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who looked at him could sense a pulsing feeling, as if his body contained a terrifying qi and blood power. Also barely visible were over 100,000 shrieking souls that swirled around him. They seemed to spread out endlessly, and their howls were astonishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, these were the people Meng Hao had consumed and destroyed. They were shackled to him for all eternity, unable to enter the cycle of reincarnation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Qing’er,” he murmured, “are you doing well…?” His eyes were cold, and contained a trace of loneliness that made his aura seem even more desolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who looked at Blood Prince Gorge would feel that it was filled with blood and mysteries. The news had long since spread that Meng Hao had consumed the qi, blood, cultivation bases and souls of the enemy cultivators. Virtually all of the cultivators in the entire Southern Domain knew about it, and in fact, most had witnessed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep in their hearts, the veneration they felt toward Meng Hao was now coupled with dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Southern Domain was finally rested, and their spell formations were prepared. Five days passed….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNear the border of the Southern Domain, where it touched the Milky Way Sea, the sea water roared. Massive waves surged across the surface of the water. It almost seemed as if the Southern Domain would be drowned. Up above, shockingly bright lights could be seen on the Resurrection Lily bridge; apparently, teleportation portals were in continuous use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, people began to appear. Soon they packed the bridge, seemingly without end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Resurrection Lily bridge trembled as two mountain-like giants appeared. These giants were different than the ones from the second wave. They were more powerful, and wore suits of golden armor. The pressure they exuded was astonishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShockingly, these giants were not comparable to the Spirit Severing stage, but rather, Dao Seeking!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only early Dao Seeking, but considering their enormous frames, they could clearly crush any cultivator within the same stage. Furthermore, they wore armor, and had enormous greatswords strapped to their backs, making them even more fearsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the two giants was a monstrous, sinister death aura that took the form of an emerald-colored mist. In the region near the mist, numerous dead sea creatures could be seen floating on the surface of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside of the mist were three 10,000-year-old wraiths!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wraiths all emanated an air similar to Dao Seeking as they swirled about within the mist, shrieking and howling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to these, there were hundreds of thousands of Northern Reaches cultivators that composed the main military force. They were packed in tight formation atop the Resurrection Lily bridge, and anyone who saw them would surely gasp in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, what was most eye-catching was what could be seen in the very rear position of the army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a gigantic iron cage, fully three hundred meters tall. It was being pulled forward by countless iron chains, and sitting inside was a monkey that had bright red eyes. It was covered with numerous magical symbols, and sat motionless in the cage, breathing heavily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the vanguard position of the army were three people that emanated shocking auras. They hovered in midair, looking coldly out at the Southern Domain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center position among the three was an old man with red hair and a ruddy face. He wore a white robe, and a mysterious pressure emanated off of him. He was surrounded by countless bolts of lightning that formed together to make what appeared to be… true dragons!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you continued to watch, you would see the true dragons swirl together to form something entirely different… a miniature cauldron!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere Meng Hao here… he would instantly be able to tell that this cauldron closely resembled his own Lightning Cauldron. However, on this cauldron was engraved… a dragon with lightning bolts curling around it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man hovered there, clearly emanating the power of peak Dao Seeking. And yet, the feeling of his aura was somewhat similar to that of Meng Hao’s false Immortal puppet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet again, further examination would reveal that his aura was even more ancient and archaic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to possess an aura that was somewhere between a true Immortal and a false Immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis old man was the most powerful person in the entire Northern Reaches, the Clan Chief of the Imperial Bloodline Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn either side of him stood a man and a woman. The man was gentle and effeminate, with phoenix-like eyes and a frame as lithe as the wind. However, within his eyes could be seen what appeared to be the cross-legged image of two Immortal Divinities, reciting scriptures. A mere glance at the man would show that he was completely beyond the ordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was also at the peak of Dao Seeking, with a strange air similar and yet different to that of a false Immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman, on the other hand, was by no means beautiful. She had a black birthmark on a face that was twisted and uncouth. Furthermore, her body was neither elegant nor appealing and she was extremely obese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapped around her neck was a crimson snake that occasionally flicked its forked tongue out. Its eyes were grim, and if you looked closely, you would see that the snake did not actually have a physical body; shockingly, it was actually composed of countless discarnate souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the third wave army of cultivators from the Northern Reaches, the final wave, and also the most powerful!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as they arrived at the border of the Southern Domain, three beams of light emanating the power of peak Dao Seeking shot toward them. They were the three Northern Reaches Patriarchs that had been frightened off by Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they joined the force, it increased the number of peak Dao Seeking experts in the third wave to six!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, there were the two giants and three wraiths. This army of Northern Reaches cultivators was incredibly powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three newcomers did not say anything. They produced jade slips which they tossed out to the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief and the others, who examined them closely for a few moments. Although their expressions did not change, serious looks could be seen in their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe six cultivators exchanged glances and then began to transmit a conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve already received your earlier reports about him. It seems this Meng Hao… is the greatest hindrance to our Northern Reaches’ invasion of the Southern Domain!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has a peak Dao Seeking clone, and his true self can absorb life force, qi, blood, cultivation bases and souls….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We must eliminate him. Without him, the Southern Domain is ripe for the picking!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, their flickering gazes came to rest on the Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightning danced around him, and his closed eyes suddenly snapped open. He spoke for the first time, and his hoarse voice was filled with strange power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To deal with him, I approve the use of the ancestral statuary!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other five nodded in response. There was no further discussion. Moments later, the third wave army marched off of the Resurrection Lily bridge and into the Southern Domain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, the killing intent of the Northern Reaches cultivators exploded out. The sky darkened as they shot through the air like a black cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Imperial Bloodline Clan Chief looked off into the distance. Lightning danced around him as he snorted coldly and then stretched his hand out and pointed upward. Immediately, a bolt of lightning shot up into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air distorted, and then a fist-sized, translucent eyeball appeared up above. The lightning smashed into it, blasting it to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Southern Domain knows we’ve arrived,” said the old man. “Push forward at top speed. We will finish this war in one swift blow!” In response, the Northern Reaches cultivators roared and surged forward at incredible speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColors flashed in the sky, and the wind screamed. Down below, the earth quaked under their killing intent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the Blood Demon Sect, Patriarch Song’s face flickered as he opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ve arrived!” he said. “There is an old man with lightning surrounding him, most likely the most powerful person in the Northern Reaches, the Clan Chief of the Imperial Bloodline Clan. His cultivation base is astonishing. He noticed my Arcane Scrying Eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They will be here in three days at the latest!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePill Demon and Patriarch Golden Frost exchanged glances. Seeing the profound gleam in each other’s eyes, they suppressed their anxiety and rose to their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spread the word. The final battle is about to begin!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Chia-Wen Chang, Tanawut Pitchayaboonwong, Richard Nilsen Karlsen, and Grant Petry\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-783\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-785\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-784","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
