{"id":96039,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eMore than a few months ago I`d waved good-bye to my mother at Dullsville`s Greyhound bus stop and boarded the Hipsterville-bound bus to visit my ultraconservative father`s hippie sister, Aunt Libby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I was on a Prozac high, minus the Prozac, ecstatic to return to the funky town of Hipsterville--home to unique coffee shops, with handmade coffee mugs and fresh scones (not the overincorporated cutout kinds with focus-group canned-in music), goth and hipster boutiques, and the perfectly morbid Coffin Club. I was excited to see Aunt Libby again, but even more important, I was only a few hours away from being reunited, or so I hoped, with my number-one vampire-mate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI passed the bus ride doodling in my Olivia Outcast journal, imagining my reunion with Alexander. We`d meet inside the Coffin Club, where pale mannequins with bat wings hung from the ceiling and ghostlike fog permeated the air. Alexander would be waiting for me in the middle of the packed dance floor, with a single black rose. I`d run into his arms and he`d envelop me in them like a gothic Juliet. He`d lean into me and greet me with a long, seductive kiss, sending chills from my head to my combat boots. We`d dance the night away to the twisted sounds of the Skeletons until my legs could no longer hold me up. Alexander and I would venture off into a tiny church`s graveyard, and we`d climb into a vacant crypt, where an empty coffin would be awaiting us. He`d close the lid on our night as dawn approached, and we`d snuggle together in darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was halfway through an episode of The Munsters on Billy Boy`s borrowed (or rather bribed) iPod when I noticed the two-mile exit sign for Hipsterville.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast time I arrived in Hipsterville, sunny skies and puffy blue clouds hung over the town. This time I was met with ominous clouds and a fierce downpour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered myself with my skull-and-crossbones hoodie as the driver, undeterred by the pouring rain, unloaded suitcases from the bus`s cargo hold. Finally I saw my suitcase, grabbed it, and huddled underneath the bus-stop shelter along with a crowd of other passengers. One thing hadn`t changed--Aunt Libby was nowhere to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as each traveler was picked up by their party until I was the only traveler left waiting at the stop. When tapping my boots in the rising puddles grew boring, I headed for the convenience store a few yards away. I checked the aisles for any hippie chicks with the scent of potpourri or women wearing Nairobi sandals and tie-dyed skirts. Unfortunately, all I saw were a few truckers and the hungry bus driver. I grew more excited to see my hipster Aunt Libby again. She and I were outsiders among the Madison clan. My aunt lived an unconventional lifestyle, working as a waitress in a vegan restaurant to support her acting career. She was a free spirit, and Hipsterville was a funky town where she could be her organic-eating, hemp-wearing, liberal self. Though we had different tastes, I always felt bonded with her in that we shared a passion for being different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, Aunt Libby was still nowhere to be found. Perhaps she was stuck in a rehearsal or filling up the saltshakers at the restaurant. I could feel the glare of the tattooed cashier. I didn`t want to appear to be loitering, which I was, or stealing, which I wasn`t. My stomach started to growl. I hovered over the candy aisle, debating which sugary cavity-forming candy to buy, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around. A beautiful lady wearing pressed pants, a Happy Homes real estate jacket, and my dad`s smile was standing in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Libby? I asked, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaven! It`s great to see you! She gave me a hard squeeze and I could feel her rain- stained face against my own dampened one. I hope I wasn`t too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just got here, I fibbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bet you`re starved. We can stop and grab a bite. I took the rest of the day off. She lifted my suitcase and we hurried into her vintage Beetle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn`t help but stare at my aunt, who had traded her waitress outfit for a real estate one, as we buckled in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprised to see me in a suit? she asked, obviously reading my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don`t think I`ve ever seen you without sandals and a flower in your hair, I teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured it was time to get a real job, she confessed. I didn`t bother telling your father. I haven`t been working that long and I`ve already taken a half day. She laughed. So who knows how much longer it will last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started the car and the engine putt-putted as she motored through the historic downtown area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Libby was such an independent spirit, I felt disappointed and sad that she was giving up her dream. I didn`t want her to change, nor did I ever want to change. I wondered, if Aunt Libby had to give up her passions, would I have to, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you given up acting? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it`s in my blood, she said. In fact, I`m doing a one-woman show. You can take the girl out of acting but not the acting out of the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt relieved. A one-woman show...That`s great. Soon enough you`ll have your own Oscar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Libby chuckled, then turned serious. Raindrops pelted the windshield and the rustic wipers struggled to clear them as we headed toward her apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething felt strange as I gazed out the window. An eerie shadow blanketed the town as we drove through it. I thought I saw a few bats hovering over a church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow...Those look like...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBats?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a nest of them in one of the houses we have on the market. You would have loved it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you would have loved this house we just rented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally? Is it spooky? Completely. It was a half-dead manor house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA manor house? I asked. It couldn`t have been the one Alexander and Jameson had occupied last time I was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, my aunt replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, there must be a lot in this town, I hinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot too many. And not one like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been abandoned for years. The back lawn was completely overgrown, and I think the floors needed to be rehabbed, but the new renter didn`t seem to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it the one on Lennox Hill Road?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. How would you know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh...I remember seeing pictures of it in the paper the last time I was here, I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt does seem like a house you would love to live in. I wouldn`t be surprised if it was haunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf someone had rented the manor house, then where were Alexander and Jameson staying? And how would I ever find them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you still have the key? Maybe they can give me a tour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, the man who is renting it has the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does he look like?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy aunt appeared puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just wondering what kind of a man would rent a manor house. Perhaps a prince or a big-time executive, I prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis man wasn`t a prince but more of a gentleman. He did look creepy--in the ghoulish sense of the word. I guess that`s why he liked the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJameson! I blurted out at the same time Aunt Libby tapped her horn and hit the brakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sparrow quickly flew off in front of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brake for birds, she said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered why Jameson would rent the manor house. Did they plan on staying indefinitely? My heart sank. Then I remembered Alexander`s reassuring words: I will return soon. But what was keeping my boyfriend here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turned onto Aunt Libby`s tree-lined urban street and she confidently, or foolishly, squeezed her Beetle into an anorexically small space between a truck and an orange scooter. Aunt Libby attached a lock to her steering wheel. She opened the entrance door to the 1940s row house apartment building, unlocked her mailbox, followed by her apartment door. Aunt Libby had as many keys as Dullsville High`s janitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of lavender incense bled through the cracks of Aunt Libby`s apartment door before we entered. Once inside, a waft of floral scents hit me as if I`d just stepped into a flower conservatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Aunt Libby`s attire had changed, her apartment decor hadn`t. Besides a few stacks of real estate manuals sitting on her coffee table, the sixties and seventies still ruled the one-bedroom apartment. Beaded curtains hung from the frame of her bedroom door and half- melted candles lined every inch of available space, from the mantel to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I shed my rain-soaked clothes for dry ones in Aunt Libby`s dinky bathroom, I imagined what my life would be like on my own if I`d never met Alexander. Who would I grow up to become? Dullsville was way too dull for a girl like me. I`d probably end up in Hipsterville in an apartment similar to my aunt`s, only it would have dripping wax candelabras, black lace curtains, and a gargoyle headboard on my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what would it mean if I couldn`t share it with Alexander? Living on my own and working perhaps as a bartender at the Coffin Club night after night. I felt a pang of loneliness for my aunt--she had eaten, slept, lived by herself for as many years as I could remember. Instead of being dragged down by her independent lifestyle, Aunt Libby seemed to thrive on it. She serial dated and had a wide circle of friends from her theater community. Aunt Libby was gorgeous. Someone as hip and cool as she could get any man she wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reapplied my chocolate eye shadow and liner and towel dried my damp hair. I smelled teriyaki sauce and found Aunt Libby--the one I`d always known, wearing embroidered jeans and jeweled flip-flops, a halter top underneath a linen jacket--stir-frying in her wok.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, relieved that my aunt had returned to her inner Deadhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Libby served our healthy entrees. We sat down at her coffee table, on oversized mismatched fluffy pillows, surrounded by candles, incense, and a spicy Asian meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I`m getting married! she suddenly announced. I`ve been dying to tell you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are? I asked, surprised. Congrats! Dad didn`t mention...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, okay, it`s not official or anything. In fact, we haven`t officially gone out yet. I just met him last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Libby`s face flushed bright red. She grabbed a brown hobo purse that was sitting on her paisley futon and pulled out a rainbow-colored beaded wallet. She opened it and presented me with a Renegades paper napkin. It had a man`s name and phone number written on it. He has beautiful handwriting, doesn`t he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevon. That`s a cool name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can`t wait to tell you all about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has pool-colored eyes and salt-and-pepper hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounds dreamy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed him in the audience when I was onstage. I almost couldn`t see him because he was just outside the glare of the spotlight. He has the most piercing blue eyes I`ve ever seen. Our eyes locked and I forgot my lines. I stood there, frozen, for what seemed like hours. He had this hypnotic stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. Aunt Libby was like a sixteen-year-old girl who had fallen in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the show was over, he was waiting for me. We had this intense connection I`ve never felt before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know exactly what you mean. That`s how I feel about Alexander. That`s why I had to come here....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome here? she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh...yes, for girl time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what you mean. I`m bursting at the seams to talk about him, but there`s not much I know--besides how handsome he is!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI`m sure I`ll be calling him Uncle Devon within a matter of days. Can I wear black to your wedding?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn`t want it any other way. We have a date in the next few days and you have to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are going out on your first date with him and you`re going to show up with me? Your vampire-obsessed niece? Even I don`t think that`s a good idea. You have to come. I can`t wait for you to see him...and I can`t leave you here alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course you can. But we can talk about it tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had just placed the dishes in the sink when Aunt Libby noticed the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a drumming class tonight. I was hoping you`d join me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell...I...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don`t have to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I don`t want you to miss it on account of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt`s a master class tonight. Otherwise I wouldn`t think about going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease go. I`ll be fine. I wouldn`t be able to run across town and try to make contact with Alexander if I were stuck in a drumming class all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about it while I get ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Aunt Libby prepared for class, I stretched my legs out on her futon and turned on the nineteen-inch TV with a leaning cactus on it. Her TV received only local channels and the color faded in and out at will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you live without cable? I asked, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI switched on the local news. Normally I would have turned the set off quickly and kept myself busy text-messaging Becky about my arrival. But something caught my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHi, I`m Anne Ramirez, reporting to you live. I`m standing with Fred Sears, a farm owner who discovered a crop circle in his wheat field. This is the second one reported in this county in less than a month, this one being a little more intricate than the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera panned to the wheat field, where stalks had been crushed against the ground in the shape of a fifty-foot circle, with several smaller circles in the center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe petite woman stood next to the black-haired farmer, who was three times her size. When did you notice this? she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I woke up. It just cropped up,` he joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes as I watched two preteens running around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw bats hovering over the area last night, said one boy, almost breathless, to the reporter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were crows, stupid, the other admonished. Flying away from the alien spacecraft that landed here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were bats! the boy insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything interesting? my aunt called from her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a crop circle with hovering bats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls at the agency were talking about that at lunch. They are convinced it`s all for publicity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe video switched to an aerial shot from WBEZ`s helicopter. The circle was impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the camera was back on the reporter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpacecraft or just spaced out? You decide. Back to you, Jay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat`s so bogus..., I called to my aunt. I saw a report on TV once where kids confessed to creating them. They demonstrated to the reporter how in the middle of the night they used a stake, a rope, and wooden boards to press down the stalks and form a giant circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy aunt came back into the living room dressed in an off-the-shoulder cotton top and pea green yoga pants. I believe we aren`t the only ones in the solar system. They could be aliens. No one has disproved their existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you kidding? You really believe in aliens?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you really believe in vampires? She had a point. Yes, but they are real, I blurted out without thinking. Uh...I mean, no one has disproved their existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI`m just saying, Aunt Libby argued as she added some final touches to her hair, it could be the markings of an alien aircraft--or a signal for other aliens. Aren`t crop circles meant to be viewed from the air?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy on the news swore he saw bats last night. Maybe it could be vampires signaling other vampires, I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmmm. I like your theory better. Aliens are kind of odd-looking and have green heads. Vampires are sexier. I`d prefer to see them invade our town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave my thought pause as the anchor turned the focus to weather. Our five-day forecast calls for rain and fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity getting the best of me, I couldn`t shake the farm boy`s claim. After all, who better to go undetected in the night than vampires? They could easily see the circles as they fly in bat form over the horizon. There was no way to confirm my theory by sitting in my aunt`s apartment, and it wasn`t like me to not poke around for some clues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you mind if I check my e-mail? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure. The computer is already on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched the Internet on my aunt`s iMac for vampires and crop circles. I scrolled past various movie and book sites until I came to a small website that specialized in paranormal sightings in North America. All the entries detailed unearthly bright lights, alien abductions, and hoaxes. Just as I began to click out of one such site, I spotted something of interest. Instead of green-headed monsters, one blogger claimed that the night before he spotted a crop circle, he`d seen a swarm of hovering bats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I`d stumbled onto something big. The entry had to be posted by a Harvard scholar, a scientist, or a Nobel Peace Prize winner. Instead it was signed Bob from Utah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob could have been a crackpot like any other, a bored kid in study hall posting erroneous entries on websites, or, like me, a vampire-obsessed mortal with an overactive imagination. But I took his single entry as a sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one way to investigate my theory further. I had an advantage that Bob in Utah didn`t--I was dating a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you sure you don`t want to come with me? my aunt asked as she picked up an African drum lying next to the fireplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI`m beat--no pun intended, I teased, shutting down the computer. Do you mind if I just crash?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if I wasn`t preoccupied about reuniting with Alexander, the thought of amateur drummers learning how to bang on instruments for two hours was enough to make me mental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere`s plenty of tofu patties in the fridge and soy pudding in the cabinet. I`ll call you on your cell at break to check in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks, Aunt Libby, I said, giving my dad`s sister a hug. I really appreciate your letting me visit you again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you kidding? I love having a roommate. Just bolt the door behind me and don`t buzz anyone in. And please, don`t get abducted by aliens. Your father would kill me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-coffin-club-vampire-kisses-5/page-2.html","bookId":2144,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:37 PM"}
