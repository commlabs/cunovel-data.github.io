He closed his eyes, tilted his head back, and seemed to fall within himself. A moment later, Drizzt noticed that Guenhwyvar\u0027s ears came up suddenly, and the drow understood that this strange human was somehow making a telepathic link to the panther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good cat, too,\" the old man said a moment later. Guenhwyvar walked out from around the outcropping - sending the owl flapping away in a frenzy - and casually stalked past the old man, moving to stand beside Drizzt. Apparently, the panther had relinquished all concerns that the old man was an enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt considered Guenhwyvar\u0027s actions curious, viewing them in the same manner as he had his own empathic agreement with the bear in the cave a season ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good cat,\" the old man said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt leaned back against the stone and relaxed his grip on the spear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Montolio,\" the old man explained proudly, as though the name should carry some weight with the drow. \"Montolio DeBrouchee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well met and fare well,\" Drizzt said flatly. \"If we are done with our meeting, then we may go our own ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We may,\" Montolio agreed, \"if we both choose to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I to be your... prisoner... once more?\" Drizzt asked with a bit of sarcasm in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sincerity of Montolio\u0027s ensuing laughter brought a smile to the drow\u0027s face despite his cynicism. \"Mine?\" the old man asked incredulously. \"No, no, I believe we have settled that issue. But you have killed some minions of Graul this day, a deed that the orc king will want punished. Let me offer you a room at my castle. The orcs will not approach the place.\" He showed a wry smile and bent over toward Drizzt to whisper, as if to keep his next words a secret between them. \"They will not come near me, you know.\" Montolio pointed to his strange eyes. \"They believe me to be bad magic because of my... \" Montolio struggled for the word that would convey the thought, but the guttural language was limited and he soon grew frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt silently recounted the course of the battle, then his jaw drooped open in undeniable amazement as he realized the truth of what had transpired. The old man was indeed blind! The owl, circling over enemies and hooting, had led his shots. Drizzt looked around at the slain giant and orc and his jaw did not close; the old man hadn\u0027t missed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you come?\" Montolio asked. \"I would like to gain the\" - Again he had to search for an appropriate term - \"purposes... a dark elf would have to live a winter in a cave with Bluster the bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontolio cringed at his own inability to converse with the drow, but from the context, Drizzt could pretty much understand what the old man meant, even figuring out unfamiliar terms such as \"winter\" and \"bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orc king Graul has ten hundred more fighters to send against you,\" Montolio remarked, sensing that the drow was having a difficult time considering the offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not come with you,\" Drizzt declared at length. The drow truly wanted to go, wanted to learn a few things about this remarkable man, but too many tragedies had befallen those who had crossed Drizzt\u0027s path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuenhwyvar\u0027s low growl told Drizzt that the panther did not approve of his decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bring trouble,\" Drizzt tried to explain to the old man, to the panther, and to himself. \"You would be better served, Montolio DeBrouchee, to keep away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a threat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A warning,\" Drizzt replied. \"If you take me in, if you even allow me to remain near to you, then you will be doomed, as were the farmers in the village.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontolio perked his ears up at the mention of the distant farming village. He had heard that one family in Maldobar had been brutally killed and that a ranger, Dove Falconhand, had been called in to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not fear doom,\" Montolio said, forcing a smile. \"I have lived through many... fights, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. I have fought in a dozen bloody wars and spent an entire winter trapped on the side of a mountain with a broken leg. I have killed a giant with only a dagger and... befriended... every animal for five thousand steps in any direction. Do not fear for me.\" Again came that wry, knowing smile. \"But, then,\" Montolio said slowly, \"It is not for me that you fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt felt confused and a bit insulted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fear for yourself,\" Montolio continued, undaunted. \"Self-pity? It does not fit one of your prowess. Dismiss it and come along with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Montolio had seen Drizzt\u0027s scowl, he would have guessed the forthcoming answer. Guenhwyvar did notice it, and the panther bumped hard into Drizzt\u0027s leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Guenhwyvar\u0027s reaction, Montolio understood the drow\u0027s intent. \"The cat wants you to come along,\" he remarked. \"It\u0027ll be better than a cave,\" he promised, \"and better food than half-cooked fish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt looked down at Guenhwyvar and again the panther bumped him, this time voicing a louder and more insistent growl with the action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt remained adamant, reminding himself pointedly by conjuring an image of carnage in a farmhouse far away. \"I will not come,\" he said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I must name you as an enemy, and a prisoner!\" Montolio roared, snapping his bow back to a ready position. \"Your cat will not aid you this time, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden!\" Montolio leaned in and flashed his smile and whispered, \"The cat agrees with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too much for Drizzt. He knew that the old man wouldn\u0027t shoot him, but Montolio\u0027s flaky charm soon wore away the drow\u0027s mental defenses, considerable though they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Montolio had described as a castle turned out to be a series of wooden caves dug around the roots of huge and tightly packed evergreens. Lean-tos of woven sticks furthered the protection and somewhat linked the caves together, and a low wall of stacked rocks ringed the whole complex. As Drizzt neared the place, he noticed several rope-and-wood bridges crossing from tree to tree at various heights, with rope ladders leading up to them from the ground level and with crossbows securely mounted at fairly regular intervals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow didn\u0027t complain that the castle was of wood and dirt, though. Drizzt had spent three decades in Menzoberranzan living in a wondrous castle of stone and surrounded by many more breathtakingly beautiful structures, but none of them seemed as welcoming as Montolio\u0027s home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirds chittered their welcome at the old ranger\u0027s approach. Squirrels, even a raccoon, hopped excitedly among the tree branches to get near him - though they kept their distance when they noticed that a huge panther accompanied Montolio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have many rooms,\" Montolio explained to Drizzt. \"Many blankets and much food.\" Montolio hated the limited goblin tongue. He had so many things he wanted to say to the drow, and so many things he wanted to learn from the drow. This seemed impossible, if not overly tedious, in a language so base and negative in nature, not designed for complex thoughts or notions. The goblin tongue sported more than a hundred words for killing and for hatred, but not a one for higher emotions such as compassion. The goblin word for friendship could be translated to mean either a temporary military alliance or servitude to a stronger goblin, and neither definition fit Montolio\u0027s intentions toward the lone dark elf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first task then, the ranger decided, was to teach this drow the common tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We cannot speak\" - There was no word for \"properly\" in Goblin, so Montolio had to improvise - \"...well... in this language,\" he explained to Drizzt, \"but it will serve us as I teach you the tongue of humans - if you wish to learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt remained tentative in his acceptance. When he had walked away from the farming village, he had decided that his lot in life would be as a hermit, and thus far he had done pretty well - better than he had expected. The offer was tempting, though, and on a practical level, Drizzt knew that knowing the common language of the region might keep him out of trouble. Montolio\u0027s smile nearly took in the ranger\u0027s ears when the drow accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooter, the owl, however, seemed not so pleased. With the drow - or, more particularly, with the drow\u0027s panther - about, the owl would be spending less time in the comforts of the evergreens\u0027 lower boughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cousin, Montolio DeBrouchee has taken the drow in!\" an elf cried excitedly to Kellindil. All the group had been out searching for Drizzt\u0027s trail since the winter had broken. With the drow gone from Dead Orc Pass, the elves, particularly Kellindil, had feared trouble, had feared that the drow had perhaps taken in with Graul and his orc minions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKellindil jumped to his feet, hardly able to grasp the startling news. He knew of Montolio, the legendary if somewhat eccentric ranger, and he knew, too, that Montolio, with all of his animal contacts, could judge intruders quite accurately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When? How?\" Kellindil asked, barely knowing where to begin. If the drow had confused him through the previous months, the surface elf was thoroughly flustered now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A week ago,\" the other elf answered. \"I know not how it came about, but the drow now walks in Montolio\u0027s grove, openly and with his panther beside him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Montolio... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other elf interrupted Kellindil, seeing where his line of concern was heading. \"Montolio is unharmed and in control,\" he assured Kellindil. \"He has taken in the drow of his own accord, it would seem, and now it appears that the old ranger is teaching the dark elf the common tongue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amazing,\" was all that Kellindil could reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could set a watch over Montolio\u0027s grove,\" the other elf offered. \"If you fear for the old ranger\u0027s safety - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Kellindil replied. \"No, the drow once again has proven himself no enemy. I have suspected his friendly intentions since I encountered him near Maldobar. Now I am satisfied. Let us get on with our business and leave the drow and the ranger to theirs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other elf nodded his agreement, but a diminutive creature listening outside Kellindil\u0027s tent was not so certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTephanis came into the elven camp nightly, to steal food and other items that would make him more comfortable. The sprite had heard of the dark elf a few days earlier, when the elves had resumed their search for Drizzt, and he had taken great pains to listen to their conversation ever since, as curious as any about the whereabouts of the one who had destroyed Ulgulu and Kempfana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTephanis shook his floppy-eared head violently. \"Drat-the-day-that-that-one-returned!\" he whispered, sounding somewhat like an excited bumblebee. Then he ran off, his little feet barely touching the ground. Tephanis had made another connection in the months since Ulgulu\u0027s demise, another powerful ally that he did not want to lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin minutes he found Caroak, the great, silver-haired winter wolf, on the high peak that they called their home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The-drow-is-with-the-ranger,\" Tephanis spouted, and the canine beast seemed to understand. \"Beware-of-that-one-I-say! It-was-he-who-killed-my-former-masters. Dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroak looked down the wide expanse to the mountain that held Montolio\u0027s grove. The winter wolf knew that place well, and he knew well enough to stay away from it. Montolio DeBrouchee was friends with all sorts of animals, but winter wolves were more monster than animal, and no friend of rangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTephanis, too, looked Montolio\u0027s way, worried that he might again have to face the sneaky drow. The mere thought of encountering that one again made the little sprite\u0027s head ache (and the bruise from the plowshare had never completely gone away).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs winter eased into spring over the next few weeks, so did Drizzt and Montolio ease into their friendship. The common tongue of the region was not so very different from the goblin tongue, more a shift of inflection than an alteration of complete words, and Drizzt caught on to it quickly, even learning how to read and write. Montolio proved a fine teacher, and by the third week, he spoke to Drizzt exclusively in the common tongue and scowled impatiently every time Drizzt reverted to using goblin to get a point across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Drizzt, this was a fun time, a time of easy living and shared pleasures. Montolio\u0027s collection of books was extensive, and the drow found himself absorbed in adventures of the imagination, in dragon lore, and accounts of epic battles. Any doubts Drizzt might have had were long gone, as were his doubts about Montolio. The shelter in the evergreens was indeed a castle, and the old man as fine a host as Drizzt had ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt learned many other things from Montolio during those first weeks, practical lessons that would aid him for the rest of his life. Montolio confirmed Drizzt\u0027s suspicions about a seasonal weather change, and he even taught Drizzt how to anticipate the weather from day to day by watching the animals, the sky, and the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this, too, Drizzt caught on quickly, as Montolio had suspected he would. Montolio never would have believed it until he had witnessed it personally, but this unusual drow possessed the demeanor of a surface elf, perhaps even the heart of a ranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you calm the bear?\" Montolio asked one day, a question that had nagged at him since the very first day he had learned that Drizzt and Bluster were sharing a cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt honestly did not know how to answer, for he still did not understand what had transpired in that meeting. \"The same way you calmed Guenhwyvar when first we met,\" the drow offered at length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontolio\u0027s grin told Drizzt that the old man understood better than he. \"Heart of a ranger,\" Montolio whispered as he turned away. With his exceptional ears, Drizzt heard the comment, but he didn\u0027t fully comprehend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s lessons came faster as the days rolled along. Now Montolio concentrated on the life around them, the animals and the plants. He showed Drizzt how to forage and how to understand the emotions of an animal simply by watching its movements. The first real test came soon after, when Drizzt, shifting the outward branches of a berry bush, found the entrance to a small den and was promptly confronted by an angry badger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooter, in the sky above, issued a series of cries to alert Montolio, and the ranger\u0027s first instinct was to go and help his drow friend. Badgers were possibly the meanest creatures in the region, even above the orcs, quicker to anger than Bluster the bear and quite willing to take the offensive against any opponent, no matter how large. Montolio stayed back, though, listening to Hooter\u0027s continuing descriptions of the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s first instinct sent his hand flashing to his dagger. The badger reared and showed its wicked teeth and claws, hissing and sputtering a thousand complaints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt eased back, even put his dagger back in its sheath. Suddenly, he viewed the encounter from the badger\u0027s point of view, knew that the animal felt overly threatened. Somehow, Drizzt then further realized that the badger had chosen this den as a place to raise its soon-coming litter of pups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe badger seemed confused by the drow\u0027s deliberate motions. Late in term, the expectant mother did not want a fight, and as Drizzt carefully slipped the berry bush back in place to conceal the den, the badger eased down to all fours, sniffed the air so that it could remember the dark elf\u0027s scent, and went back into its hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Drizzt turned around, he found Montolio smiling and clapping. \"Even a ranger would be hard put to calm a riled badger,\" the old man explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The badger was with pups,\" Drizzt replied. \"She wanted to fight less than I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\" Montolio asked, though he did not doubt the drow\u0027s perceptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt started to answer, then realized that he could not. He looked back to the berry bush, then to Montolio helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontolio laughed loudly and returned to his work. He, who had followed the ways of the goddess Mielikki for so many years, knew what was happening, even if Drizzt did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The badger could have ripped you, you do know,\" the ranger said wryly when Drizzt moved beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was with pups,\" Drizzt reminded him, \"and not so large a foe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontolio\u0027s laughter mocked him. \"Not so large?\" the ranger echoed. \"Trust me, Drizzt, you would rather tangle with Bluster than with a mother badger!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt only shrugged in response, having no arguments for the more experienced man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really believe that puny knife would have been any defense against her?\" Montolio asked, now wanting to take the discussion in a different direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt regarded the dagger, the one he had taken from the sprite. Again he could not argue; the knife was indeed puny. He laughed both to and at himself. \"It is all that I have, I fear,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall see about that,\" the ranger promised, then said no more about it. Montolio, for all his calm and confidence, knew well the dangers of the wild, mountainous region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger had come to trust in Drizzt without reservations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontolio roused Drizzt shortly before sunset and led the drow to a wide tree in the northern end of the grove. A large hole, almost a cave, lay at the base of the tree, cunningly concealed by shrubs and a blanket colored to resemble the tree trunk. As soon as Montolio pushed this aside, Drizzt understood the secrecy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An armory?\" the drow asked in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fancy the scimitar,\" Montolio replied, remembering the weapon Drizzt had broken on the stone giant. \"I have a good one, too.\" He crawled inside and fished about for a while, then returned with a fine, curving blade. Drizzt moved in to the hole to survey the marvelous display of weapons as the ranger exited. Montolio possessed a huge variety of weapons, from ornamental daggers to great bardiche axes to crossbows, light and heavy, all polished and cared for meticulously. Set against the back of the inner tree trunk, running right up into the tree, were a variety of spears, including one metal-shafted ranseur, a ten-foot-long pike with a long and pointed head and two smaller barbs sticking out to the sides near the tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you prefer a shield, or perhaps a dirk, for your other hand?\" Montolio asked when the drow, muttering to himself in sincere admiration, reappeared. \"You may have any but those bearing the taloned owl. That shield, sword, and helmet are my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt hesitated a moment, trying to imagine the blind ranger so outfitted for close melee. \"A sword,\" he said at length, \"or another scimitar if you have one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontolio looked at him curiously. \"Two long blades for fighting,\" he remarked. \"You would likely tangle yourself up in them, I would guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not so uncommon a fighting style among the drow,\" Drizzt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMontolio shrugged, not doubting, and went back in. \"This one is more for show, I fear,\" he said as he returned, bearing an overly ornamented blade. \"You may use it if you choose, or take a sword. I\u0027ve a number of those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt took the scimitar to measure its balance. It was a bit too light and perhaps a bit too fragile. The drow decided to keep it, though, thinking its curving blade a better compliment to his other scimitar than a straight and cumbersome sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will care for these as well as you have,\" Drizzt promised, realizing how great a gift the human had given him. \"And I will use them,\" he added, knowing what Montolio truly wanted to hear, \"only when I must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then pray that you may never need them, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" Montolio replied. \"I have seen peace and I have seen war, and I can tell you that I prefer the former! Come now, friend. There are so many more things I wish to show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt regarded the scimitars one final time, then slipped them into the sheaths on his belt and followed Montolio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith summer fast approaching and with such fine and exciting companionship, both the teacher and his unusual student were in high spirits, anticipating a season of valuable lessons and wondrous events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow diminished their smiles would have been if they had known that a certain orc king, angered at the loss of ten soldiers, two worgs, and a valued giant ally, had its yellow, bloodshot eyes scanning the region, searching for the drow. The big orc was beginning to wonder if Drizzt had gone back to the Underdark or had taken in with some other group, perhaps with the small elven bands known to be in the region, or with the damnable blind ranger, Montolio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the drow was still in the area, Graul meant to find him. The orc chieftain took no chances, and the mere presence of the drow constituted a risk. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-elf-trilogy-sojourn-the-dark-elf-trilogy-3/page-14.html","bookId":2106,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:15 PM"}
