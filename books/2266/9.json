The sun was strong, the air warm, and there was a slight breeze off the river. The world seemed calm, normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned to the hospital, thinking that Heidi was probably ready to wring her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Heidi wasn\u0027t irate in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sleeping in the chair by the bed when Lauren arrived. She didn\u0027t wake up until Lauren touched her, and then she flushed and stretched, and seemed disoriented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how\u0027s she doing? Has anyone said anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi seemed a little flustered when she replied. \"Um...yes, actually. The last nurse who came in here said that her vital signs are strong and that she\u0027s doing well. She hasn\u0027t come to yet, but she seems to be resting comfortably and I guess the doctors are pleased with her progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to be gone so long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you gone long?\" Heidi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But the new place is gorgeous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So was the old place,\" Heidi pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll love Montresse House. I promise,\" Lauren assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi shrugged. \"It\u0027s what you wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for humoring me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some slave you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi frowned for a moment. \"There\u0027s still a cop in the hall, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think we could go to lunch together? We missed breakfast, and I\u0027m starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren hesitated. It was broad daylight, she reminded herself. Deanna was in a hospital, with a cop right outside her door. \"Want to grab something in the hospital cafeteria?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really, but okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hallway, Lauren saw that the officer on duty was about fifty and appeared to be of French or Hispanic descent. He had a trustworthy face, a little haggard, but gentle and reassuring. When she told him they were going to grab a bite to eat together, he said, \"Good idea. I\u0027ll sit inside with your friend. You take your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren thanked him, noticing a heavy gold chain around his neck. \"Crucifix?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-yeah, actually.\" He drew it out from beneath his collar. \"A gift from my missus. I always wear it. I like yours, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you are wearing Mark\u0027s cross,\" Heidi teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren offered her a vague smile and thanked the officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the cafeteria, they discovered that the hospital offered a pretty decent salad bar. They filled their plates, then sat down at a table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really am sorry that your party has gone south. Mostly, I\u0027m worried about Deanna, though,\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t worry. I think that not being able to party hearty has been a good thing. I\u0027ve had time to think about what I\u0027m doing,\" Heidi said lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Lauren asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi shrugged. \"I\u0027ve been rethinking the entire marriage thing,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren, with a small wedge of lettuce halfway to her lips, froze. \"What?\" she said in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heidi, your wedding is two weeks away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Heidi, unconcerned, adjusted her napkin on her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heidi, you love Barry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course, I love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve just been thinking. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you were so certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go. Things change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you talked to him? Did you two get into an argument or something?\" Lauren asked, perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I wouldn\u0027t dream of fighting with him over the phone, and anyway, we don\u0027t have fights. Disagreements now and then, but no big fights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you talked to him at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not since yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just not sure I\u0027m really ready for marriage.\" She flushed, staring at Lauren. \"If you must know, it\u0027s occurred to me that I\u0027m not entirely positive I\u0027m ready for a sexually monogamous life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren just stared at her blankly. \"Uh...well....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t need to discuss it,\" Heidi snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi set her fork down. \"I\u0027m not really hungry after all. Since you\u0027re here now, I think I\u0027ll head out. I\u0027ll go and make sure that we didn\u0027t leave anything at the old place and check out the new one. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeidi wasn\u0027t really asking; she was leaving. That was that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren wasn\u0027t sure that Heidi even heard her. She was already walking out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren discovered that she wasn\u0027t hungry herself and felt a sudden urge to get back to Deanna as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rushed back upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe friendly officer was still in the room. He blushed when she caught him reading Heidi\u0027s bridal magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some really pretty pictures in there,\" he said. \"My wife and I eloped to Vegas. Sometimes I think I cheated her out of a real wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you been married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-six years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess she was happy with what she got, then,\" Lauren assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. A happy man. Feeling that maybe the world would be all right, Lauren took a seat at the foot of Deanna\u0027s bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer remained with her, and she never even noticed herself dozing off, but. the next she knew, he was nudging her and telling her that the shift was changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke, blinked and realized it was twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren wasn\u0027t sure if she would really have left Heidi alone at the hospital all night in her determination to find the fortune teller, but luckily she didn\u0027t have to worry about it, because Heidi reappeared in time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren\u0027s head was still reeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeanna was holding her own, but Heidi\u0027s behavior was beyond peculiar. She had returned to the hospital in a very pleasant if somewhat...fey mood. Not a word Lauren usually used, but it was one that seemed to describe the way Heidi was acting. She had mentioned avoiding several calls from Barry, and said blithely that Deanna was going to be just fine and she would be happy as a little lark to stay with her and watch television or read for the evening. When Lauren promised that she would return as soon as she could, Heidi told her not to worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren couldn\u0027t help but feel a little uneasy about leaving Heidi in charge, so to speak, then told herself that she was being ridiculous. There was a cop on constant duty at the door, and he was certainly capable of protecting both women if there should be any need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving the hospital, Lauren found the nicest taxi driver in the world and asked him to take her to Montresse House, because she\u0027d decided to pick up a light jacket before hitting Jackson Square. The driver was a native of the area and sympathized with her for having a friend being in the hospital. Healso believed in the occult and told her that she should buy herself some serious mojo to protest against evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thanked him while privately thinking there was no need to get carried away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, as nice as he was, he wasn\u0027t able to get her all the way to Montresse House or even to Bourbon Street. There had been an accident, and the streets were blocked off. He apologized profusely but suggested she get out a few blocks away and walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren did, though she wasn\u0027t sure exactly where she was. There were people around, and there were lights, and she wasn\u0027t particularly worried. As she walked, she kept going over everything they\u0027d done since arriving in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill seemed to wrap itself around her suddenly, and she stopped walking. Frowning, she paused, looking around. The street was lined with old residences, with only a few storefronts here and there, and most of them were cafes that only served by day. Magnificent houses sat behind high walls, with bushes lining the sidewalk for added privacy,, and it seemed they had all begun to rustle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quickened her pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had stepped out from behind a high brick wall. Someone who was tall and formed a dark silhouette against the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear the distant sound of traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood dead still. A breeze wafted by, strangely cool. She became aware that she was alone on the street. Doors and gates were closed. She wasn\u0027t far from Bourbon Street, but she might as well have been at the end of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silhouette wasn\u0027t moving, exactly, or at least not in any way she could identify, yet it seemed to be coming closer to her, almost floating just inches above the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, suddenly, the dark figure became a man, just a man. Tall, mid-thirties, athletic build, dark. He wore black jeans, a black polo shirt and a casual jacket. His hair seemed to be darker than the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd his eyes...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey might have been black, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept there seemed to be some kind of a glowing golden light in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told herself to move, to quicken her pace; to hurry past the man, then realized for the first time she was standing dead still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was smiling as he approached her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear the blare of a horn from somewhere, but it might as well have come from another world. It was followed by the plaintive sound of a jazz chord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was so far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart seemed shudder as he spoke. She didn\u0027t understand why she wasn\u0027t moving. It was as if her limbs had become paralyzed. She was furious with herself. What the hell was the matter with her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was deep and smooth. She wondered if that was part of what held her so firmly where she was. But she had been standing still, just waiting, before he had spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t reply. She just stared at him, and he stared back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been looking for you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been looking for her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidiculous. She\u0027d never seen him before. Or had she? At that moment, she knew that she had seen him before; she just couldn\u0027t place where or when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her amazement, she managed to speak. \"I don\u0027t know you,\" she said. If she tried really hard, she thought, she could probably move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I know you. And you will remember me in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the worst pick-up line she\u0027d ever heard, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, I have to get going,\" she murmured, and moved an arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could move!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she managed a step, he was suddenly directly in front of her, even though she hadn\u0027t seen him move. It was as if he had floated there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared into his eyes. They were gold. No, they were dark. No, there was some kind of fire that seemed to glow from within them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it. She really had lost her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This time,\" he said softly, \"I have the advantage. I will not lose you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth to speak. She wanted to protest that he couldn\u0027t lose what he didn\u0027t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the fire in his eyes was so bright....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cross, she thought. The silver cross. If she could just produce it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that would mean that she believed in vampires, and that was ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, she couldn\u0027t move her arms again. She was held by the fire in his eyes. She willed her hand to move, pleaded with her body to function....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found the cross with her fingers and drew it out from under her shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of fury seemed to tear through his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth weren\u0027t yellowed; they weren\u0027t horrid, rank or dripping with gore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren\u0027t teeth at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe willed herself to back away. Because now he was coming right at her, furious at the sight of the cross. He started to reach out for her, as if he were in pain but planning to endure that pain. He was going to seize her cross and rip it from her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was when Mark appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know where he had come from; he was just suddenly there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt his arms on her shoulders, felt him shove her out of the way. He was carrying, of all things, a squirt gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA child\u0027s squirt gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he lifted it and shot her attacker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was steam, a hiss, accompanied by a roar of fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the burning eyes seemed to disappear in darkness and shadow, even as the sound of his voice remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly, there on the street, so near to Bourbon and yet so far, there were suddenly scores of shadows, like moving pools of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey took on form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark tossed her something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother squirt gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, still in shock, but somehow, she reflexively caught the toy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let anyone get the cross. Start shooting,\" Mark ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShooting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a squirt gun?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were crowding around her now. So many of them. They were people. They had been shadows, but now they were people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl in a short skirt with a Betty Page haircut and cute freckles. A twenty-something guy in a Grateful Dead T-shirt. A man who looked like a James Bond wanna-be. A woman who was a dead ringer for the mom on Family Ties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone almost pounced on Mark. He struck out with a kick that would have done Jackie Chan proud. Hi attacker went flying back and struck a wall-hard-then just picked himself up and started coming again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark had whirled, and for a moment she thought he was shooting at her with the squirt gun, but he wasn\u0027t. She heard a cry of fury, followed by that awful hissing right behind her. She turned. A black form was turning to a pool of burning dust behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl hopped on Mark\u0027s back. He caught her with both hands, throwing her over his shoulder to the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked like Pollyanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took dead aim between her eyes with his water pistol. Shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hissing came first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was a small burst of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark began to spin, a steady spray of water coming from his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere, there was jazz music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere, someone laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car horn blared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hissing continued, punctuated by screams of fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot!\" Mark thundered. \"Turn and shoot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun around. A man who looked like a long lost cavalier was almost on top of her. He looked so much like pictures of Charles II that shock almost caused her to hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer finger twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHiss...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was just inches from her. He snarled and let out a cry of fury as he dissipated right in front of her, the picture of his open mouth, fangs gleaming, imprinted on her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought that she saw fire, gleaming through a skull, as he burst into flame....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt something at her back. A man was there, reaching for her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched the silver cross and screamed as his finger burned. He stared at her, his face knitting into a hideous mask of fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she saw fire for an instant, and the mask of fury become a distorted skull. He exploded, and through the soot, she could see Mark, see that he had shot the man..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she heard what sounded like the flapping of wings, saw a rising of shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn seconds the street was quiet again. The sounds from Bourbon Street seemed to grow louder. Become real. And near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still standing on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still staring at a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now the man was Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was shaking, still holding her own water pistol. He bought the good kind, she thought dryly. They held a lot of water. Kids would have a great time playing with them at a pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she wasn\u0027t a kid, and she wasn\u0027t at a pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd already she was finding it almost impossible to believe what had just taken place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Mark asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she all right? What was he, out of his mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I all right?\" she repeated. \"Hell, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a breath and offered a rueful smile. \"I\u0027m sorry. I meant, are you hurt? Did anything...did he touch you before I got here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed. She was suddenly shaking uncontrollably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a careful step toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see what I just saw,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible. It had all been so fast. It couldn\u0027t have been real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at the ground. It looked as if a careless gardener had lost dirt from a wheelbarrow as he had made his way down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out, taking the water pistol from her hand as carefully as if it had been a real gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should get to Montresse House,\" he said gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The house,\" she echoed, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least you\u0027re not passing out,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose words suddenly gave her strength. And the little voice at the back of her mind that had whispered that there must be some veracity in the stories he had been telling her suddenly spoke up loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey existed. Vampires existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m not going to pass out!\" she snapped. Right. She was shaking so hard that she could barely stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Montresse House?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" she said, the light dawning. \"You have a room there, too, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deanna\u0027s been bitten by a vampire, hasn\u0027t she.\" It was a statement, not a question. She was still having trouble digesting the fact that vampires were real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will she live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started walking, her movements jerky. She felt as if she had become a puppet, a marionette, and wasn\u0027t really moving of her own volition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he walked at her side, it occurred to her that he had come in the nick of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he had saved her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were almost on Bourbon Street by then, and there were people everywhere, talking, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA drunk passed her, and he was wonderful. He was real. Normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been following me,\" she said accusingly, stopping and turning on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whenever I\u0027ve been able to,\" he said, stopping, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was tempted to hit him. \"You were late!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were at the hospital. I came as soon as I got word that you\u0027d left,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted him to hold her. She wanted to crawl into his arms. No, she wanted him to be normal, too. She desperately needed to take a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth to speak. There was so much to say, to demand to know. But nothing came out. She didn\u0027t know where to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a step toward him, then another. She leaned against him. He seemed solid. Strong. His arms came around her, holding her, and she stood there, shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, it was so much better here....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laid a hand on his shirt, feeling the strength of his body was through the fabric. She had wanted to be near him, but she had been afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now, she didn\u0027t dare trust him, even if...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if he had saved her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she needed the clean, male scent of him, the vital strength of his form....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, it would be so easy to...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled away from him and started walking again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the house on Bourbon Street, and all of a sudden the air seemed to be full of birds. Masses of birds. Or bats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr winged shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark saw them, too, and his face tensed. But he didn\u0027t appear to be afraid. Instead, he looked angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the gate,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did, and the birds or bats, or shadows, continued to hover overhead. But they didn\u0027t come closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Mark walked up the pathway to the house. The front door opened before they were even half way there. \"Come in, come in, and hurry, please,\" Stacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was evident that she\u0027d already met Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stephan made his first real play for Lauren,\" Mark explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God, where? When?\" She looked at Lauren suspiciously. \"He didn\u0027t...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Mark told her. \"But he\u0027s getting bolder. She was right off Bourbon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey let out a sigh. \"Was he alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He has an army with him, just as I predicted,\" Mark said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren stared from one of them to the other. They were talking as if the city were under siege, and by an enemy they had fought before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A regular infestation,\" Stacey muttered. Then she saw the way that Lauren was staring at her and smiled, shrugging her shoulders. \"I assume now you understand the rule about not inviting anyone in, anyone at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I understand,\" Lauren said. Because she did. They were insane. And she was insane, too, because she was seeing what they saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she murmured. \"I\u0027m trying so hard to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To believe what\u0027s unbelievable,\" Stacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you do believe that vampires exist?\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Stacey told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey shook her head, staring at Lauren. \"But why doesn\u0027t the world know? You\u0027ve just seen them-and you still don\u0027t completely believe. And,\" she said, and hesitated, looking at Mark, \"I think that Mr. Davidson could tell you that there are plenty of vampires out there who are living their lives in as normal a manner as possible, hurting no one. But there are also those who...\" Again, she paused. \"There are people, regular people, who are psychotic. Cold-blooded killers. It\u0027s no different in the world of the undead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The undead,\" Lauren murmured slowly. \"In other words, I may already know some vampires, good vampires, and I just don\u0027t realize it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" Stacey said. \"Many exist without their closest friends knowing the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure they do,\" Lauren said skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that this is a lot to take in,\" Mark said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the important thing is, you\u0027re safe here,\" Stacey said. \"Big Jim sleeps out in the caretaker\u0027s cottage, Bobby is here a lot of the time, and I\u0027ve been through this myself before. Our only weaknesses can come from within.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren stared at them. \"Lieutenant Canady told us to come here. Are you telling me that a police lieutenant believes in vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mark told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His wife used to be one,\" Stacey explained matter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Used to be?\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one really understands what happened there, but Maggie was a vampire. For years and years. Then Sean came into her life, they had a major battle with a really vicious enemy, and then...she was human again. It was really great for Maggie, because she desperately wanted to have a family. It\u0027s different with Jessica Fraser, who owns this place. She\u0027s vampire, too. A good one, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why Sean sent you here,\" Stacey explained. \"We know how to fight evil. We\u0027ve all fought vampires before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bad ones, of course,\" Lauren murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Stacey said, gravely serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould this nightmare be real? Lauren wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d woken up just a few days ago, the world had been spinning on its axis, and, though they\u0027d had their problems, they had all been...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Davidson set a hand on her shoulder, and she looked up into his eyes. Serious eyes, striking eyes, eyes that had practically hypnotized her from the start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be all right. I don\u0027t intend to stop until I\u0027ve taken Stephan down, and it won\u0027t matter how many servants he has running around, doing his bidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" She knew she sounded exhausted and disbelieving, and she didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a shower,\" he said. For the first time she noticed that there was black, sooty, stuff all over his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized that she was covered withg it, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshes to ashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDust to dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was literally wearing the evil of untold years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealization hit her, and suddenly she thought she was going to pass out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered where she had seen the man who had accosted her on the street before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had seen him in the crystal ball. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-red/page-9.html","bookId":2266,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:23:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:23:29 PM"}
