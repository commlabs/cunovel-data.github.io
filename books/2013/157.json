Ten thousand!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Leave me, damn you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Leave you? God of mine, 1 compel you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Errant fell to his knees, tilted his head back, and screamed his rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the world trembled anew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had forgotten. The chains. The wills locked in an eternal tug of war. The flood waters of fierce emotion rising again and again. The deathless drowning. 1 am in the world again. 1 surrendered my weakness, and am imprisoned by power. ‘Only the weak and useless are truly free,’ he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him. ‘No need to be so maudlin, Errant. Go back to the Cedance and see for yourself. Blood now flows between the Tiles. Between them all. The Warrens. The Cedance, at last, maps the truth of things. The truth of things. To use your words, the Tiles now… flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can you not taste them? These new Warrens? Come, let us explore them, you and 1, and choose our aspect. There are flavours… light and dark, shadow and death, life and…oh, what is this? The jesters of Chance, an Unaligned, Oponn? Oponn-dear Errant, you have upstarts standing in your stead. These Twins play your game, Errant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What will we do about that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Abyss take me,’ the god groaned, sinking down onto the cold, clammy pavestones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Summon him, Errant. He is needed. Now. Summon our Mortal Sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I cannot. You damned fool. He is lost to us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I possess-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know what you possess. Do you truly think it enough? To wrest him from Mael’s grasp? You stupid, pathetic bitch. Now, cease this damned prayer, Destrai. Your every demand weakens me-and that is not smart. Not now. Too soon. I am… vulnerable. The Edur-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Edur warlocks tremble and start at shadows now-they do not know what has happened. All they know is blind terror-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Silence!’ the god bellowed. ‘Who can reach through those warlocks, you blubbering capabara? Leave me alone! Now!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was answered with.,… nothing. Sudden absence, a presence recoiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Better,’ he snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he remained, slumped onto the cold floor, surrounded in darkness. Thinking. But even thoughts did not come free, without a price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbyss below, 1 think 1 have made a mistake. And now 1 must live with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd make plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGadalanak stepped in behind and under his round-shield. A huge hand grasped his arm, wrapping round it just below his shoulder, and a moment later he was flying across the compound, landing hard, skidding then rolling until he crashed up against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Meckros warrior groaned, shook his head, then released his short-handled double-bladed axe and reached up to tug clear his helm. ‘Not fair,’ he said, wincing as he sat up. He glared across at Karsa Orlong. ‘The Emperor couldn’t have done that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Too bad for him,’ the Toblakai rumbled in reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think you tore something in my arm.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamar Dev spoke from where she sat on a chair in the shade, ‘Best find a healer, then, Gadalanak.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who else will dare face me?’ Karsa demanded, eyeing the half-dozen other warriors as he leaned on his sword. All eyes turned to the masked woman, who stood silent and motionless, worn and weathered like a forgotten statue in some ruin. She seemed indifferent to the attention. And she had yet to draw her two swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa snorted. ‘Cowards.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hold on,’ the one named Puddy said, his scarred face twisting. ‘It ain’t that, y’damned bhederin bull. It’s your style of fighting. No point in learning to deal with it, since this Edur Emperor don’t fight that way. He couldn’t. I mean, he ain’t got the strength. Nor the reach. Besides, he’s civilized-you fight like an animal, Karsa, and you just might take the bastard down-only you won’t have to, ‘cause I’ll do it before you.’ He hefted the short javelin in one hand. ‘I’ll skewer him first-then let’s see him fight with a shaft of wood impaling him. I skewer him from six paces, right? Then I close with my cutlass and chop him into pieces.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamar Dev stopped listening, since she had heard Puddy’s boasts before, and held her gaze on the woman the Meckros warrior had called a Seguleh. First Empire word, that. The Anvil. Strange name for a people-probably some remnant clan from the colonial period of Dessimbelackis’s empire. A fragment of an army, settled on some pleasant island as their reward for some great victory-those armies were each named, and ‘the Anvil’ was but a variation on a theme common among the First Empire military. The mask, however, was a unique affectation. Gadalanak said all Seguleh were so attired, and something in the glyphs and scratches on those enamel masks indicated rank. But if those marks are writing, it’s not First Empire. Not even close. Curious. Too bad she never says anything. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-157.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
