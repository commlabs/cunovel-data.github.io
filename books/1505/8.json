When he lifted up his head, a piece of dark cloud had covered up the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen this piece of dark cloud covered up the moonlight, Mingyue Xin was facing a embroidery of wild roses by the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was also embroidering wild roses, the wild roses of spring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpring was old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wild roses were also old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei was lying on the bed, not moving an inch, his pale face was not unlike Fu Hongxue\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind was blowing lightly from the window, the wind was cold, cold as the cruel autumn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, she heard their noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir footsteps were lighter than the wind, their voices were colder than the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Yan Nanfei to come down quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he doesn\u0027t come down, we would go up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin exhaled, she knew Yan Nanfei would certainly not go down and they would certainly come up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was because Yan Nanfei didn\u0027t want to kill them. It was them that wanted to kill Yan Nanfei. Hence, Yan Nanfei could lie down comfortably in bed, while they had to bring their weapon, make their way to the lane, knock on the door and hurriedly burst in, for fear of missing the chance to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe murderer and the murdered.

They were initially in great spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, they were feeling a little unhappy because the supposed victim seemed to be far more relaxed than they were. They were standing outside the door like fools, their heartbeat already doubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, killing wasn\u0027t such a happy thing after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock looked at Thumb, Thumb looked at Peacock. Both of them were asking themselves: Is Yan Nanfei really poisoned? Is there an ambush behind the door waiting for them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, they both knew that all their questions would be answered by opening the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut neither of them made a move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you enter, keep your footsteps light.\" Mingyue Xin\u0027s voice was even more gentle now, \"Mr. Yan is poisoned and is now sleeping soundly.

What do you think she is up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock coldly said, \"That\u0027s because she is a woman; a woman by nature would betray a man any time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThumb, \"Not so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock, \"Then what do you think she is up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThumb, \"That is because she knew that the more that she acts in such a way, the more suspicious we would be and the more likely to back off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock, \"You are speaking quite reasonably.

When I die, you could at least recover my body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill smiling, he lightly tapped the door with his fingers. With just that, the door opened. Mingyue Xin was still embroidering in front of the window, and Yan Nanfei was still lying on the bed like a dead man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThumb breathed out, \"Please enter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock, \"You would not go in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThumb, \"You kill people, I open doors.

The moonlight outside the window was completely blocked out by dark clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time is 4 PM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock finally entered the room.

After a quick look, he looked someone who had been kicked in the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin, \"Why don\u0027t you check if this Peacock Plume is exactly the same as the one you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock did not answer.

Although this Peacock Plume is fake, it still has the power to kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock had already turned already and stared at her, \"That\u0027s why I could also use it to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin, \"I know that.

Unfortunately, you have neglected one thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock shut up and waited for her to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin, \"You had neglected to ask me why I know that this Peacock Plume is fake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock indeed asked immediately, \"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin softly said, \"The reason why I am the only one that know this secret is because the one making these fake Peacock Plumes is me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock was stunned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin, \"If I could make these kinds of Peacock Plume, and dared to give one to you so casually. Naturally, I am confident that I can defeat it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock\u0027s face had turned white. His hands were trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis ability to kill was perhaps not because he had the Peacock Plume, but because he had a heart filled with self confidence and a steady pair of hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow these two things had been destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin, \"The first Peacock Plume was also arranged by me for you to find.

He was facing Fu Hongxue, facing the most peerless sabre in the world. Suddenly his mind went back to his lowly childhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy rain pounded the mud, the mud had soiled the whole street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran barefooted in the mud, because someone was chasing behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had escaped from the escort office, where he had stolen an escort officer\u0027s new shoes. The shoes were too big for him and had fallen off before he made it halfway across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the officer still would not spare him. After the officer caught him, he stripped him naked, tied him to a tree and lashed him with a cane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he faced Fu Hongxue now, his heart suddenly had that feeling again, the pain of being lashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn agonizing pain that was beyond words, an agonizing pain that he could never forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain was getting heavier, and the soil on the ground had turned into mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, he took off the pair of soft soled shoes that cost him eighteen taels of silver, and stood barefooted in the mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue seem to have turned into the escort officer who lashed him with the cane, turned into a symbol of his agonizing pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe roared madly and tore off his clothings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood stark naked in the rain and mud, howling madly. All these years of self restraint and control had finally found a release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, he drew his sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment he drew his sabre was the moment of his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, he died!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath was not only passion, but also pain.

Fu Hongxue walked slowly but steadily on the path, his hand clenched on his sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sabre was back in the sheath. The blood on the sabre was cleaned off. The sabre was still pitch black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pupils were also pitch black, deep and black, enough to conceal all the mercy and sorrow of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ray of sunlight had broke through the cover of dark clouds, no doubt the last light of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunlight shone on the high wall. Suddenly from behind the wall there was a peal of laughter. A laughter crisp and clear, and as lovely as silver bells, but carrying a strange ridicule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNi Hui appeared under the sunlight, \"Not exciting, not exciting to watch at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was not exciting to watch?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue did not ask.

I had came to see your sabre-play, but who would have expected that what you used was a trick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe explained further, \"You let Du Lei strike first. On the surface, it is letting him take the initiative. However, it was a trick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was it a trick?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue did not ask, but his footsteps had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNi Hui, \"When a sabre in the sheath, it has hidden strength and power, and nobody knows its sharpness. When a sabre is drawn out of the sheath, its sharpness is revealed, and thus nobody would dare to take it lightly. Thus, a sabre is at its most priceless at the moment when it is about to strike but yet to strike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued, \"You, of course understand this principle, that\u0027s why you let Du Lei strike first...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue had been quietly listening but he suddenly cut her off, \"That is also sabre-play, not a trick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNi Hui, \"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue, \"Sabre-play has different techniques and variations, but all share one essence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression was very solemn, \"That is the highest level of the sabre-play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue, \"Not yet!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNi Hui, \"Then at which stage can one achieve the highest peak of sabre-play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue had yet again fallen silent and continued forward!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was shining bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last ray of sunlight is often the most the gloriously beautiful - sometimes life is also the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNi Hui stood stumped at the wall for a long time, \"Don\u0027t tell me that highest peak of sabreplay is achieved only when there is no variations at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shinning bright sun had dimmed in a flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo variations at all, could that be to surpass the limits of variations? In that case, does that sabre still have any reason to exist?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue sighed in this heart. Even he could not answer that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy does the sabre need to exist? Why does man need to exist?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunlight had disappeared on the high walls, and Ni Hui had also disappeared with the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sun still existed, and Ni Hui too still existed. What had disappeared momentarily was only their image - their image in Fu Hongxue\u0027s vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue pushed opened the door beneath the high walls and slowly walked in. As soon as he lifted his head, he saw Mingyue Xin at the high mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e......\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite being on the tall mansion, Fu Hongxue\u0027s head was hanging down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingxue Xin asked, \"You won?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue did not answer.

It cut into the heart of the question in one stroke.
