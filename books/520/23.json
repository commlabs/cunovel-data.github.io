{"id":44689,"no":23,"title":"LOCK WILLOW, 12th July","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How did your secretary come to know about Lock Willow? \n\u003cbr\u003e (That isn\u0027t a rhetorical question. I am awfully curious to know.)\n\u003cbr\u003e For listen to this: Mr. Jervis Pendleton used to own this farm,\n\u003cbr\u003e but now he has given it to Mrs. Semple who was his old nurse. \n\u003cbr\u003e Did you ever hear of such a funny coincidence? She still calls him\n\u003cbr\u003e `Master Jervie\u0027 and talks about what a sweet little boy he used to be. \n\u003cbr\u003e She has one of his baby curls put away in a box, and it is red--\n\u003cbr\u003e or at least reddish!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Since she discovered that I know him, I have risen very much\n\u003cbr\u003e in her opinion. Knowing a member of the Pendleton family\n\u003cbr\u003e is the best introduction one can have at Lock Willow. \n\u003cbr\u003e And the cream of the whole family is Master Jervis--\n\u003cbr\u003e I am pleased to say that Julia belongs to an inferior branch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The farm gets more and more entertaining. I rode on a hay\n\u003cbr\u003e wagon yesterday. We have three big pigs and nine little piglets,\n\u003cbr\u003e and you should see them eat. They are pigs! We\u0027ve oceans\n\u003cbr\u003e of little baby chickens and ducks and turkeys and guinea fowls. \n\u003cbr\u003e You must be mad to live in a city when you might live on a farm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is my daily business to hunt the eggs. I fell off a beam in the\n\u003cbr\u003e barn loft yesterday, while I was trying to crawl over to a nest that\n\u003cbr\u003e the black hen has stolen. And when I came in with a scratched knee,\n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Semple bound it up with witch-hazel, murmuring all the time,\n\u003cbr\u003e `Dear! Dear! It seems only yesterday that Master Jervie fell off\n\u003cbr\u003e that very same beam and scratched this very same knee.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The scenery around here is perfectly beautiful. There\u0027s a valley\n\u003cbr\u003e and a river and a lot of wooded hills, and way in the distance\n\u003cbr\u003e a tall blue mountain that simply melts in your mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We churn twice a week; and we keep the cream in the spring house\n\u003cbr\u003e which is made of stone with the brook running underneath. \n\u003cbr\u003e Some of the farmers around here have a separator, but we don\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e care for these new-fashioned ideas. It may be a little harder\n\u003cbr\u003e to separate the cream in pans, but it\u0027s sufficiently better to pay. \n\u003cbr\u003e We have six calves; and I\u0027ve chosen the names for all of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 1. Sylvia, because she was born in the woods.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 2. Lesbia, after the Lesbia in Catullus.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 3. Sallie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 4. Julia--a spotted, nondescript animal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 5. Judy, after me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 6. Daddy-Long-Legs. You don\u0027t mind, do you, Daddy? He\u0027s pure\n\u003cbr\u003e Jersey and has a sweet disposition. He looks like this--you can\n\u003cbr\u003e see how appropriate the name is.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I haven\u0027t had time yet to begin my immortal novel; the farm\n\u003cbr\u003e keeps me too busy.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours always,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. I\u0027ve learned to make doughnuts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. (2) If you are thinking of raising chickens, let me recommend\n\u003cbr\u003e Buff Orpingtons. They haven\u0027t any pin feathers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. (3) I wish I could send you a pat of the nice, fresh butter\n\u003cbr\u003e I churned yesterday. I\u0027m a fine dairy-maid!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS.
