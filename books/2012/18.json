A strange warleader for the Barghast to have … will you tell me the tale of that, Ralata?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grunted. ‘I have no skill for tales. Hetan took him for a husband. He was from the Gathering, when all the T’lan Imass answered the summons of Silverfox. She returned to him his life, ending his immortality, and then Hetan found him. After the end of the Pannion War. Hetan’s father was Humbrall Taur, who had united the White Face clans, but he drowned during the landing upon the shores of this continent—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A moment, please. Your tribes are not native to this continent?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. ‘The Barghast gods were awakened to some peril. They filled the brains of the shamans with their panic, like sour piss. We must return here, to our original homeland, to face an ancient enemy. So we were told, but not much else. We thought the enemy was the Tiste Edur. Then the Letherii, and then the Akrynnai. But it wasn’t any of them, and now we are destroyed, and if Sekara spoke truly, then Onos Toolan is dead, and so is Hetan. They’re all dead. I hope the Barghast gods died with them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can you tell me more about these T’lan Imass?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They knelt before a mortal man. In the midst of battle, they turned their backs on the enemy. I will say no more of them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yet you chose to follow Onos Toolan—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He was not among those. He stood alone before Silverfox, a thing of bones, and demanded—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Draconus had leaned forward, almost over the fire. ‘“A thing of bones”? T’lan – Tellann! Abyss below!’ He suddenly rose, startling Ralata further, and she watched as he paced, and it seemed black ink was bleeding out from the scabbard at his back, a stain that hurt her eyes. ‘That bitch,’ he said in a low growl. ‘You selfish, spiteful hag!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUblala heard the outburst and he suddenly loomed into the dull glow of the fire, his huge mace leaning over one shoulder. ‘What’d she do, Draconus?’ He glared at Ralata. ‘Should I kill her? If she’s being spelfish and sightful – what’s rape mean, anyway? It’s got to do with sex? Can I—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ublala,’ Draconus cut in, ‘I was not speaking of Ralata.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Teblor looked round. ‘I don’t see no one else, Draconus. She’s hiding? Whoever she is, I hate her, unless she’s pretty. Is she pretty? Mean is all right if they’re pretty.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior was staring at Ublala. ‘Best climb into your furs, Ublala, and get some sleep. I’ll stand first watch.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right. I wasn’t tired anyway.’ He swung about and set off for his bedroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Be careful with those curses,’ Ralata said in a hiss, rising to her feet. ‘What if he strikes first and then asks questions?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced across at her. ‘The T’lan Imass were undead .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She never let them go?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Silverfox? No. They asked, I think, but no.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to stagger. And, turning away, he slowly sank down on to one knee, facing away from her. The pose was one of dismay, or grief – she could not be sure. Confused, Ralata took a step towards him, and then stopped. He was saying something, but in a language she knew not. A phrase, over and over again, his voice hoarse, thick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Draconus?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders shook, and then she heard the rumble of laughter, a deathly, humourless sound. ‘And I thought my penance was long.’ Head still lowered, he said, ‘This Onos Toolan … is he now truly dead, Ralata?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So Sekara said.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then he is at peace. At long last. At peace.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I doubt it,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted round to regard her. ‘Why do you say that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They killed his wife. They killed his children. If I was Onos Toolan, even death would not keep me from my revenge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew a sharp breath, and it caught as if on a hook, and once more he turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scabbard dripped blackness as if from an open wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, how I want that sword .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWants and needs could starve and die, no different from love. All the grand gestures of honour and faithful loyalty meant nothing when the only witnesses were grass, wind and empty sky. It seemed to Mappo that his nobler virtues had withered on the vine, and the garden of his soul, once so verdant, now rattled skeletal branches against stone walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was his promise? What of the vows he had uttered, so sober and grim in youth, so shiny of portent, as befitted the broad-shouldered brave he had once been? Mappo could feel dread inside, hard as a fist-sized tumour in his chest. His ribs ached with the pressure of it, but it was an ache he had lived with for so long now, it had become a part of him, a scar far larger than the wound it covered. And this is how words are made flesh. This is how our very bones become the rack of our own penance, and the muscles twitch in slick skins of sweat, the head hangs loose – I see you, Mappo – so slumped down in pathetic surrender . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-18.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
