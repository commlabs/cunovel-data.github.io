It would delay his return to the hospital, but he couldn\u0027t have his customers and employees sitting innocently around the place while vampires wandered through looking for the owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. He had to do it. And it only took half an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, sitting there at his desk, with his closing note to his employees and their checks all written, it started getting to him. The waste. The whole, useless, worthless messy waste of it got to him. Dammit! It wasn\u0027t like he had much of a life, anyway, and he was going to have to lose even that? Shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Crow and the Crusaders. Noble and brave and tough and all the rest of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut losers. Losers because they were losing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way they were going to make it through tonight. No way they were going to stop the vampires at that hospital. Witnesses? Hell, the vampires wouldn\u0027t care and, anyway, who would believe it? And who would believe it after seeing it? A couple of days later - with everyone treating them like they were nuts - and even the eyewitnesses would think they had imagined it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ones that lived, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow loses - what is it? Six, seven men? And he goes to Rome and comes back with what? One priest. Father Adam was a good man. Well, better than good. In fact...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was still just one guy. Crow shoulda brought back twenty men, all priests, and a bishop of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t. He didn\u0027t do a lot of things and because of that they were all gonna die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned in his desk chair and looked out the picture window that overlooked the bar. Only it was dark in the bar now. The only thing he could see in the glass was his own face, in the reflection from his desk lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to die,\" he said out loud. \"Tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. It didn\u0027t even sound dramatic enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it was anybody else but Annabelle... Well, if it was her, of course, Davette, he\u0027d have to do it. And maybe...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn\u0027t the goddamned point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goddamned point was that they were going to lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the vampires were going to win, those slimy, greasy, bloodsucking fuckers were going to keep at it. That really riled him. And that notion that they had been sitting here, in his bar, while his waitresses and bartenders served them because they didn\u0027t know. That was the deal. These miserable bastards would be treated as real live people by those who didn\u0027t know. Like they really weren\u0027t scum. Like they really belonged to the company of mankind, instead of... of what? What did they really deserve?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSewage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to die,\" he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he turned back to his desk and wrote what he hoped was a legal document and be hoped he spelled her name right. Then he put it in an envelope, labeled it \"Last Will and Testament,\" and shoved it in the back of his checkbook. They\u0027d find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLousy Crow with his samurai bullshit. We\u0027re already dead so nothing matters but Style! Crap! Is that his excuse for losing? Because the only thing worse than letting the vampires run free was losing to them first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped away from his desk and looked around his rooms one last time, at some photographs on the wall, some souvenirs, some knickknacks. Not enough to leave behind after thirty-odd years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell... then... fuck it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least he\u0027d make damn sure he hurt them first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he stopped and looked again into the glass laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk about your samurai bullshit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix got lost in the vast complex of Parkland Hospital trying to find a new route from where he\u0027d parked the motorhome. It took him ten minutes to finally come around a corner and see the sign for ICU/EMERGENCY. Below the sign, on a couch against the wall, were Cat and Davette. Adam stood against the wall beside them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he called out, tripping toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette lifted her face from her hands and it was all red and bright and tears streaked her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Felix!\" she cried. \"Annabelle died!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she leapt up and threw her arms around him and sobbed like a child, her fragile ribs heaving under his rough hands. He held her and patted her dumbly. Past her, Adam still leaned against the wall, his face grave and pale. And on the couch, Cat looked a whole lot worse, staring straight ahead, boring his eyes at nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it,\" Felix managed. \"The doctor said - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She killed herself, Gunman,\" rasped Cat in a voice from the grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleeping pills,\" added Adam in a quiet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat turned his head at last and looked at Felix and his eyes were scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she knew we\u0027d stay to protect her. And she... couldn\u0027t... stand...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Cat lost it, broke down completely. He collapsed, folding into his own miserable dry sobs, and Felix didn\u0027t think he could stand it, Cherry Cat bawling, and even Davette, hearing that awful wrenching sound, pulled herself loose from Felix and returned to the couch and embraced him and the two of them shook and rocked together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix sat down hard on the magazine-littered coffee table in front of the couch and fumbled around and found a cigarette and put it in his mouth and managed to light it and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was too stunned, too shocked to do much else. Too blown to think. Numb and stupid and... Annabelle dead? Dead? Killed herself? He couldn\u0027t bear their tears but there was no place to go and Adam didn\u0027t look much better so he just sat there and stared at the hospital tiles under his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should feel relief, shouldn\u0027t I? I mean, I\u0027m not going to die tonight, after all. I should feel relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy don\u0027t I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to take another puff and realized the cigarette had burned, unsmoked, down to the filter while he sat there numb and stupid and -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaitaminute!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught Adam\u0027s eye and mouthed: Where\u0027s Jack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Adam only shook his head grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix got up and went over to him and moved him down the wall away from the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give,\" he said tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam shrugged, looked miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know. He... He just walked out when they told us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix glared at him. \"Did he say anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the young priest looked about to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said, \u0027I even managed to get her killed.\u0027 Then be just walked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix looked around. \"Is he outside, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam shook his head. \"He took a cab. Felix?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t look good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like... like crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Felix looked at the other two. They were still crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette had finally gotten Cat to go to sleep in the main bedroom of the hotel suite. His sullen silence on the way from the hospital had been almost as unnerving as his weeping. She had fallen asleep watching him, curled up on the edge of the bed. Adam lay dozing on the lounge beside the bed. Felix sat in a chair by the great picture window that overlooked the Galleria Shopping Mall. The ashtray beside him was full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the sunset was lovely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at his watch. Five hours now. No sign of Jack. No call. No word. No clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at the sleeping trio. He didn\u0027t blame them. If anything, be envied them. He was tired, too. But he was more worried than anything else. He bad brought them to this hotel because it had been the place they were planning to go and because...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he didn\u0027t know what else to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had heard from Crow. He had called the hospital half a dozen times. He had called the bishop\u0027s - the late bishop\u0027s - office and home and church. He had called the Team\u0027s new house three\u0027 times without answer. Each time he had imagined the phone ringing in Carl\u0027s destroyed workshop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up slowly, thought about sneaking into the other room to try calling everyone again. But he knew better. Crow wasn\u0027t at any of those places. Not now and not later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI even managed to get her killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the sleeping three looked mighty small without him there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey look like I feel, he thought, and sat back down and added to the ashtray and stared at the blasted sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Jack?\" came from behind him a moment later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix turned and looked. It was Cat. He looked better. Still pale and drawn and.., hurting. But better. The sleep had done its deed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Jack?\" he repeated, sitting in the chair beside Felix\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Felix replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean he\u0027s gone. He left from the hospital. No one\u0027s seen him since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s almost nighttime!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix looked at him. I don\u0027t understand either, he felt like saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least I hope I don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t say that. Instead, he gave Cat what little he knew from the beginning. When he told him what Adam had said Jack had said, he checked the other man\u0027s face closely for a reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was none. Just the same confusion. And concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette and the priest, he noticed, were up and about once more. Listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping,\" Felix said next, \"that you might know something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat frowned. \"No. I\u0027ve been sorta...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded. \"Yeah. But you know Jack better than anyone. In fact, you\u0027re the only one here,\" he added without thinking, \"who\u0027s known Jack for any...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he stopped, shut up, as the realization hit him. As it hit Cat. As it hit the rest of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo months ago, a full Team Crow. With soldiers and money and Carl and Annabelle and Cat and the monsters on the run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now... just Cat left. In this room anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix held his breath watching Cat, but the smaller man came through the moment. It took a few deep breaths, a little concentration, but he stayed on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood for you, Cherry, Felix thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had things to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you think he might go?\" Felix continued. \"After Annabelle. Would he go get drunk or...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat was silent a moment. But when he spoke his voice was clear enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might. He... we all... loved her. He might just get drunk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know his favorite joints. Where would he go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat nodded, thought a bit. Then he stood up and went over to the bed and sat down next to the phone and rummaged under the end table until he found a phone book. He opened it and started thumbing through it, his other hand resting on the phone. Then he stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing is, the only places I know where he\u0027d go... Well, they might know about them, too. And he wouldn\u0027t go there in case they came looking for him. The only places he\u0027d go would be the places no one knows he goes. And that could be anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put down the phone book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess we\u0027ll just have to wait for him to find us. He knew we were supposed to wait here until the plane leaves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane? Oh, yeah, Felix remembered. The plane for Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jack Crow wasn\u0027t thinking about that plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where,\" Felix asked casually, \"is his favorite spot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Well, the Adolphus. He loves the place, the rooms, the service. He loves the bar. But he couldn\u0027t go there. That\u0027s the one place they\u0027d be sure to look for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give \u0027em a call,\" suggested Felix, his voice still casual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat frowned. \"C\u0027mon, Felix. He wouldn\u0027t go there! They know about the Adolphus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shrugged. \"It\u0027s worth a try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat shook his head. \"That would be asking for it and Jack - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to call?\" This time his voice was as strong as his mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat eyed him a moment. Then he picked up the phone and started dialing. Cat seemed to know this number. And he seemed to know the voice that answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terry? This is Cat. Mr. Catlin. Hi. I\u0027m looking for Mr. Crow. I just thought... What? You\u0027re kidding. Ring him for me, would you? But Terry. You know me. This is an emergency. I... Okay. Okay. Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat hung up and stared at the others in amazement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s there. In the Governor\u0027s Suite. He\u0027s turned off his phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix just sighed and turned away and puffed on his cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it!\" Cat cried next. \"Does he want to die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" said the Gunman quietly, \"that\u0027s the idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-28.html","bookId":2118,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM"}
