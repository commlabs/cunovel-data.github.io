She has only a few close friends, because not everyone appreciates Sookie’s gift: she can read minds. That’s not exactly every man’s idea of date bait – unless they’re undead; vampires and the like can be tough to read. And that’s just the kind of guy Sookie’s been looking for. Maybe that’s why, when she comes across a naked vampire, she doesn’t just drive on by. He hasn’t got a clue who he is, but Sookie has: Eric looks just as scary and sexy – and dead – as ever. But now he has amnesia, he’s sweet, vulnerable, and in need of Sookie’s help – because whoever took his memory now wants his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.jpg","author":"Charlaine Harris","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dead-to-the-world-sookie-stackhouse-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:56 PM"}
