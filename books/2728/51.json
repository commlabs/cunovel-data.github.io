And Reeve’s a seventh grader. I’m perched on the cap, just a few feet above where Reeve is, on the catwalk surrounding the part of the tower that holds the bulb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bring him here, every night, and tell him there’s nothing left to live for. That everything he loves is gone. I repeat it like a script, like a play I’m acting in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually he’ll hear me. And then he’ll do what’s right, what he should have done the first time he came here. He’ll jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLILLIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SPORTS BANQUET WAS SUPPOSED to be a night for all of us, but especially for Reeve. He was the star. Just like Rennie was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t think he’d show up. I thought for sure that he’d skip it. I hoped he would, because every time I see him, it hurts. But there he is, sitting at the end of the banquet table, wrinkled shirt untucked, sipping from a water bottle. Whatever’s inside, I know it isn’t water. Reeve is drunk. And I have this sinking feeling something bad is going to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m at the other end of the banquet table, between Alex and Ash. Alex and I are accidentally matching—I’m in a pale pink silk dress, and he’s in a pink tie. When we saw each other, we laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls on the junior squad present us senior girls with roses, per tradition. Coach Christy presents a plaque for Rennie, and all the girls on the squad cry. I do too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping tears from her eyes, Ash whispers to me, “I can’t believe everything’s about to be over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper back, “Me either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wish—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her hand a squeeze across the table. “I know.” She doesn’t have to say, because I’m wishing the same thing. That Rennie was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the football players get up and make speeches, and everybody cheers. When they call out Reeve as MVP, he doesn’t get up, and my stomach twists in a knot. He acts like he doesn’t even hear. Derek has to pull him up and push him onstage. Oh, Reeve. I’m terrified that he’s going to trip and fall up the steps, but he doesn’t. He accepts the trophy, and as he walks away, he mutters, “This is bullshit,” which the mike picks up. Thank God his parents aren’t here. I bet he didn’t even tell them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the awards and speeches, everyone gets into the buffet line. As is the tradition, the PTA moms made lasagnas. Alex offers to get our lasagnas, but I tell him I’m not hungry. I go to the drink table to get our drinks. I’m pouring two lemonades when I feel a tap on the shoulder. I turn and look, and it’s Reeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What up, girl.” His voice slurs on the word “girl.” “Aw, you and Lindy look so cute together tonight.” He waves a hand at my dress. “Did you guys color-coordinate so everyone would know you’re a couple?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not a couple.” It comes out quick and defensive, but I can barely look him in the eyes. Not because it isn’t true. It just hurts too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, right.” He snatches one of my lemonades and takes a swig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, there’s no alcohol in there,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waggles his eyebrows at me. “You’re feisty tonight. That’s okay. I like you feisty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a shaky breath, I say, “You’re being really belligerent. If you’re going to act like this, you shouldn’t be here. You could get expelled!” I pour myself another lemonade and turn to make sure my parents aren’t seeing this. Thankfully they are deep in conversation with Ash’s mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve reaches out and stops me. “So I’m a piece of shit and Lind is your knight in shining armor. That’s already been established. And you know what, you can go off to Boston with the kid, you can wear his f**king varsity jacket, you can even marry him and have perfect mixed babies. But you’re never gonna love him.” His eyes bore into mine. “Not like you do me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body goes hot and then cold, and then back to hot. I open my mouth, but I don’t have any words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Alex appears at my side, flanked by Derek and PJ. To the guys Alex says, “Get him out of here before the teachers see him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You afraid that if you leave Cho alone with me for one second, she’ll come running back to me?” Reeve throws his head back and laughs uproariously. “Alex, man, you gotta get some balls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s bounce,” Derek says, trying to push Reeve toward the door. “The lasagna sucks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get off me,” Reeve says, shrugging Derek away. People are starting to look. Teachers. Parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesperately I look at PJ and Derek and say, “Please, get him out of here, you guys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePJ throws his arm around Reeve and says, “Come on, man. Let’s go outside for a second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’re forcing him out the door when Reeve twists around and calls out, “You know I’m right, Cho.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go sit back down at the table, and I don’t look up when he calls my name again. People are looking at us, whispering, which I ignore. Alex sits down next to me, and I start cutting into my lasagna, but my hands are shaking so badly, I can’t cut through. I knew Reeve was going to be upset about the breakup, but this is so much worse than I ever could’ve imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” I want to run outside and go to Reeve, but I can’t. Mary could be here; she could be watching. I have to play my part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I’m worried about him too.” Alex sighs heavily. “He’s had a shitty year, that’s for damn sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Because of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t say the words out loud, but the guilt on my face must give me away, because Alex says, “Don’t do that. Don’t blame yourself. This is a long time coming. Reeve’s got demons, Lil. You can’t do anything for him. He’s gotta face them himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKAT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI COME DOWNSTAIRS AND WHIP Pat with my hoodie. He’s on the couch in his boxers, eyes closed, sleeping while Dad watches some fishing show on the TV from his La-Z-Boy. “Where’s my charger, scrub? My phone’s dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePat rolls over and groans. “Kitchen table. Nobody’s calling you anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trade my dead phone for Pat’s on the kitchen countertop. As I do, I spot an envelope from Oberlin tucked inside one of Pat’s racing magazines. As soon as I see it, my heart explodes. I run back into the living room, screaming, “How long has this been here?” It isn’t a huge envelope, but it’s not a small one either. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ashes-to-ashes-burn-for-burn-3/page-51.html","bookId":2728,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM"}
