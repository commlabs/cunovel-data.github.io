Who else but Beta-5 Division even has theresources to use this data?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Spare me the banter, Déjà. I’m not in the mood. Just concentrate on the decryption.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, Doctor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey paced across the antiseptic white tile of the Observation Room. One side of the room wasfilled with floor-to-ceiling terminals that monitored the vital signs of the children—test subjects, shecorrected herself. They displayed drug uptake rates and winking green, blue, and red status indicators:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e EKGs, pulse rates, and a hundred other pieces of medical data.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other side of the observation room overlooked dozens of translucent domes, windows into thesurgical bays on the level below. Each bay was a sealed environment, staffed with the best surgeons andbiotechnicians that the Office of Naval Intelligence could drum up. The bays had been scrubbed andirradiated and were in the final preparation stages to receive and hold the special biohazardous materials.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Done,” Déjà announced. “The file awaits your inspection, Doctor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey stopped her pacing and sat. “On my glasses, please, Déjà.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her glasses scanned retinal and brain patterns, and the security barrier of the file lifted. With a blink ofher eyes, she opened the file.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It read:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e United Nations Space Command Priority Transmission 09872H-98Encryption Code:RedPublic Key:file /excised access Omega/From:Admiral Ysionris Jeromi, Chief Medical Officer, UNSC Research Station HopefulTo:Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey M.D., Ph.D., special civilian consultant (civilian IdentificationNumber: 10141-026-SRB4695)Subject:Mitigating factors and relative biological risks associated with queried experimental medicalprocedures.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Classification:RESTRICTED (BGX Directive)/start file/Catherine,I am afraid further analysis has yielded no viable alternatives to mitigate the risks in your proposed“hypothetical” experimentation. I have, however, attached the synopsis of my team’s findings as well asall relevant case studies. Perhaps you will find them useful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I hope it is a hypothetical study . . . the use of Binobo chimpanzees in your proposal is troublesome.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These animals are expensive and rare now since they are no longer bred in captivity. I would hate to seesuch valuable specimens wasted in some Section Three project.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Best,y.j.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She winced at the veiled rebuke in the Admiral’s communiqué. He had never approved of her decisionto work with the Office of Naval Intelligence, and made his disappointment with his star pupil evidentevery time she visitedHopeful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was hard enough to justify the morality of the course she was about to embark upon. Jeromi’sdisapproval only made her decision more difficult.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey gritted her teeth and returned to the report.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Synopsis of chemical/ biological risksWARNING: the following procedures are classified level-3 experimental. Primate test subjectsmust be cleared through UNSC Quartermaster General Office code: OBF34. Follow gamma codebiohazard disposal protocol.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 1. Carbide ceramic ossification:advanced material grafting onto skeletal structures to make bonesvirtually unbreakable. Recommended coverage not to exceed 3 percent total bone mass because ofsignificant white blood cell necrosis. Specific risk for pre- and near-postpubescent adolescents: skeletalgrowth spurts may cause irreparable bone pulverization. See attached case studies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 2.Muscular enhancement injections: protein complex is injected intramuscularly to increase tissuedensity and decrease lactase recovery time. Risk: 5 percent of test subjects experience a fatal cardiacvolume increase.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 3. Catalytic thyroid implant:platinum pellet containing human growth hormone catalyst is implanted inthe thyroid to boost growth of skeletal and muscle tissues. Risk: rare instances of elephantiasis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suppressed sexual drive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 4. Occipital capillary reversal:submergence and boosted blood vessel flow beneath the rods and conesof subject’s retina. Produces a marked visual perception increase. Risk: retinal rejection and detachment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Permanent blindness. See attached autopsy reports.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 5. Superconducting fibrification of neural dendrites:alteration of bioelectrical nerve transduction toshielded electronic transduction. Three hundred percent increase in subject reflexes. Anecdotal evidenceof marked increase in intelligence, memory, and creativity. Risk: significant instances of Parkinson’sdisease and Fletcher’s syndrome.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e /end file/PressENTER to open linked attachments.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey closed the file. She erased all traces of it—sent Déjà to track the file pathways all the wayback toHopeful and destroy Admiral Jeromi’s notes and files relative to this incident.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She removed her glasses and pinched the bridge of her nose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m sorry,” Déjà said. “I, too, had hoped there would be some new process to lower the risks.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey sighed. “I have doubts, Déjà. I thought the reasons so compelling when we first startedproject SPARTAN. Now? I . . . I just don’t know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I have been over the ONI projections of Outer Colony stability three times, Doctor. Their conclusion iscorrect: massive rebellion within twenty years unless drastic military action is taken. And you know the‘drastic military action’ the brass would like. The SPARTANS are our only option to avoidoverwhelming civilian losses. They will be the perfect pinpoint strike force. They can prevent a civilwar.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Only if they survive to fulfill that mission,” Dr. Halsey countered. “We should delay the procedures.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e More research needs to be done. We could use the time to work on MJOLNIR. We need time to—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There is another reason to proceed expeditiously,” Déjà said. “Although I am loath to bring this to yourattention, I must. If the Office of Naval Intelligence detects a delay in their prize project, you will likelybe replaced by someone who harbors . . . fewer doubts. And regrettably for the children, most likelysomeone less qualified.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I hate this.” Dr. Halsey got up and strode to the fire exit. “And sometimes, Déjà, I hate you, too.” Sheleft the observation room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mendez was waiting for her in the hallway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Walk with me, Chief,” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He followed without a word as they took the stairs to the pre-op wing of the hospital.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They entered room 117. John lay in bed and an IV drip was attached to his arm. His head had beenshaved and incision vectors had been lasered onto his entire body. Despite these indignities, Dr. Halseymarveled at what a spectacular physical specimen he had grown into. Fourteen years old and he had thebody of an eighteen-year-old Olympic athlete, and a mind the equal of any Naval Academy honorsgraduate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey forced the best smile she could muster. “How are you feeling?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m fine, ma’am,” John replied groggily. “The nurse said the sedation would take effect soon. I’mfighting it to see how long I can stay awake.” His eyelids fluttered. “It’s not easy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John spotted Mendez and he struggled to sit up and salute, but failed. “I know this is one of the Chief’sexercises. But I don’t know what the twist is. Can you tell me, Dr. Halsey? Just this time? How do Iwin?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mendez looked away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey leaned closer to John as he closed his eyes and started to breathe deeply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll tell you how to win, John,” she whispered. “You have to survive.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/975/29419.html","bookId":266,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:11:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:11:52 AM"}
