I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve seen Todd orVic around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBunny Marten looked up from behind the counter. She was pretty, with soft blond hair, a round,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edimpled face, and a timid expression. She was in MaryLynnette\u0027s class at school. \"Did you check over at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheGold Creek Bar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette nodded. \"And at their houses, andat the other store, and at the sheriff\u0027s office.\" The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esheriff\u0027s office was also city hall and the public library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if they\u0027renot playing pool, they\u0027re usuallyplinking.\" Plinkingwas shooting atcans for practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but where?\" Mary-Lynnette said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBunny shook her head, earrings glinting. \"Yourguess is as good as mine.\" She hesitated, staring down at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher cuticles, which she was pushing back with a little blunt-pointed wooden stick. \"But, you know, I\u0027ve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheard they go down to Mad Dog Creeksometimes.\" Her wide blue eyes lifted to Mary Lynnette\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emeaningfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMad Dog Creek. . . Oh, great. Mary-Lynnette grimaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Bunny raised her shoulders in a shiver.\"I wouldn\u0027t go down there. I\u0027d be thinking about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat body the whole time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, me, too. Well, thanks, Bun. See you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBunny examined her cuticles critically. \"Good hunting,\" she said absently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette went out of the store, squinting in the hot, hazy August sunlight. Main Street wasn\u0027tbig. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad a handful of brick and stone buildingsfrom the days when Briar Creek had been a gold rush supply\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etown, and a few modem frame buildings with peeling paint. Todd and Vic weren\u0027t in any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, what now? Mary-Lynnette sighed. There was no road to Mad Dog Creek, only a trail that was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econstantly blocked by new growth and deadfall. And everyone knew more than plinking went on there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they\u0027re out there, they\u0027re probably hunting, she thought. Not to mention drinking, maybe using drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuns and beer. And then there\u0027s that body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body had been found last year around thistime. A man; a hiker, from his backpack. Nobody\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknew who he was or how he\u0027d died-the corpse wastoo desiccated and chewed by animals to tell. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople talked about ghosts floating around the creek last winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette sighed again and got into her station wagon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car was ancient, it was rusty, it made alarming sounds when forced to accelerate, but it was hers,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eandMary-Lynnette did her best to keep it alive. She loved it because there was plenty of room in back to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estore her telescope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Briar Creek\u0027s only gas station she fished a scrolled fruit knife from under the seat and went to work,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprying at the rusty gas cap cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little higher up . . . almost, almost . . . now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwist ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cover flew open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever think of going into the safecracking business?\" a voice behind her said. \"You\u0027ve got the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etouch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette turned. \"Hi, Jeremy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled-a smile that showed mostly in his eyes,which were dear brown with outrageously darklashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were going to fall for a guy-and I\u0027m not-itwould be for somebody like him.Not for a big blond cat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho thinks he can pick his sisters\u0027 friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a moot point, anyway-Jeremy didn\u0027t goout with girls. He was a loner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want me to look under the hood?\" He wiped his hands on a rag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. I just checked everything last week.\" Mary-Lynnette started to pump gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up a squeegee and a spray bottle and began to wash the windshield. His movements were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeft and gentle and his face was utterly solemn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette had to swallow a giggle herself, butshe appreciated him not laughing at the pitted glass\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand corroded windshield wipers. She\u0027d always had an odd feeling of kinship with Jeremy. He was the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eonly person in Briar Creek who seemed even slightlyinterested in astronomy-he\u0027d helped her build a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emodel of the solar system in eighth grade, and ofcourse he\u0027d watched last year\u0027s lunar eclipse with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis parents had died in Medford when he was justa baby, and his uncle brought him to Briar Creek in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFleetwood trailer. The uncle was strange-alwayswandering off to dowse for gold in the Klamath wil\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ederness. One day he didn\u0027t come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, Jeremy lived alone in the . trailer in the woods. He did odd jobs and worked at the gas station\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto make money. And if his clothes weren\u0027t as nice assome of the other kids\u0027, he didn\u0027t care-or he didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elet it show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe handle of the gas hose clicked in MaryLynnette\u0027s hand. She realized she had been daydreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything else?\" Jeremy said. The windshieldwas dean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ... well, actually, yes. You haven\u0027t, um, seenTodd Akers or Vic Kimble today, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy paused in the middle of taking her twentydollar bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to talk to them,\" Mary-Lynnettesaid. She could feel heat in her cheeks. Oh, God,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehethinks I want to see Todd and Vic socially-and he thinks I\u0027m crazy for askinghim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hurried to explain. \"It\u0027s just that Bunny saidthey might be down by Mad Dog Creek, so I thoughtyou\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emight have seen them, maybe sometime this morning, since you live down around there....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy shook his head. \"I left at noon, but I didn\u0027thear any gunshots from the creek this morning. Ac\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etually, I don\u0027t think they\u0027ve been there all summerI keep telling them to stay away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said it quietly, without emphasis, but Mary-Lynnette had the sudden feeling that maybe evenTodd\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Vic might listen to him. She\u0027d never knownJeremy to get in a fight. But sometimes a look came into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis level brown eyes that was ..: almost frightening. As if there was something underneath thatquiet-guy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexterior-something primitive and pure and deadly that could do a lot of damage if roused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary-Lynnette-I know you probably think thisis none of my business, but ... well, I think you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshould stay away from those guys. If you really wantto go find them, let me go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. Mary-Lynnette felt a warm flush of gratitude. She wouldn\u0027t take him up on the offer ... but it was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enice of him to make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll be fine, but ... thanks .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched as he went to get her change insidethe station. What must it feel like to be on your own\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esince you were twelve years old? Maybe he neededhelp. Maybe she should ask her dad to offer him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esome odd jobs around the house. He did them for everyone else. She just had to be careful-she knew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy hated anything that smacked of charity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought back the change. \"Here you go. And, Mary-Lynnette ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you do find Todd and Vic, be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Mary-Lynnette said. She had reached for the change, but he hadn\u0027t let go of it. Instead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehedid something odd: He opened her curled fingers with one hand while giving her the bills and coins with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe other. Then he curled her fingers back over it. In effect, he was holding her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment of physical contact surprised herand touched her. She found herself looking at his thin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrown fingers, at their strong but delicate grip on her hand, at the gold seal ring with the black design that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe wore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was even more surprised when she glanced up at his face again. There was open concern in his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes-and something like respect. For an instant she had a wild and completely inexplicable impulse to tell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim everything. But she could just imagine what he would think. Jeremy was very practical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Jeremy,\" she said, conjuring up a weak smile. \"Take care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Youtake care. There are people who\u0027d miss you if anything happened.\" He smiled, but she could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeel his worried gaze on her even as she drove away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right,now what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she\u0027d wasted most of the day looking for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTodd and Vic. And now, with the image of Jeremy\u0027s level brown eyes in her mind, she wondered if it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad been a stupid idea from the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown eyes ... and what color eyes did the bigblond cat have? Strange, it was hard to remember.She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethought that they had looked brown at one point when he was talking about his old-fashioned family. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen he\u0027d said he liked a girl with spirit, she remembered them being a sort of insipid blue. And when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat odd knife-glint had flashed in them, hadn\u0027t they been icy gray?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh,who cares?Maybe they were orange. Let\u0027s just go home now. Get ready for tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow come Nancy Drew always found the people she wanted to interrogate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? Why? Why me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh was staring at a yellow cedar weeping into a creek. A squirrel too stupid to get out of the sun was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estaring back at him. On a rock beside him a lizard lifted first one foot, then another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t fair. It wasn\u0027t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t even believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d always been lucky. Or at least he\u0027d alwaysmanaged to escape a hairsbreadth away from disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time the disaster had hit and it was a total annihilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything he was, everything he believed abouthimself ... could he lose that in five minutes? For a girl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho was probably deranged and certainly more dangerous than all three of his sisters put together?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he concluded grimly. Absolutely not. Not in five minutes. It only took five seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew so many girls-nice girls. Witches withmysterious smiles, vampires with delicious curves,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshapeshifters with cute furry tails. Even human girls with fancy sports cars who never seemed to mind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen he nibbled their necks. Why couldn\u0027t it have been one of them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it wasn\u0027t. And there was no point in wondering about the injustice of it. The question was, what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas he going todo about it? Just sit back and let fate ride over him like an eighteen-wheeler?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorryfor your family, Quinn had said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe that was the problem. Ash was a victim of his Redfern genes. Redfern never could stay out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof trouble; they seemed to tangle with humans at every turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo was he going to wait for Quinn to come backand then offer that as an excuse? I\u0027m sorry; I can\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehandle things here after all; I can\u0027t even finishthe investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he did that, Quinn would call in the Elders and they would investigate for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh felt his expression harden. He narrowed his eyes at the squirrel, which suddenly darted for thetree in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea flash of red fur. Beside him, the lizard stopped moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he wasn\u0027t just going to wait for fate to finish him off. He\u0027d do what he could to salvage the situa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etion-and the family honor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d do it tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do it tonight,\" Rowan said. \"After it\u0027s fully dark, before the moon rises. We\u0027ll move her to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel smiled magnanimously. She\u0027d wonthe argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to be careful,\" Jade said. \"That thingI heard outside last night-it wasn\u0027t an animal. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink it was one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There aren\u0027t any other Night People aroundhere,\" Rowan said gently. \"That was the whole pointof\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoming here in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it was a vampire hunter,\" Kestrel said.\"Maybe the one that killed Aunt Opal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If avampire hunter killed Aunt Opal,\" Rowansaid. \"We don\u0027t know that. Tomorrow we should\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elook around town, see if we can at least get an ideawho mighthave done it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when we find them, we\u0027ll take care ofthem,\" Jade said fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if the thing you heard in the garden turnsup, we\u0027ll take care of it, too,\" Kestrel said. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmiled, a hungry smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwilight, and Mary-Lynnette was watching thedock. The rest of her family was comfortably, settledin for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe night; her father reading a book about World War II, Claudine working conscientiously on a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eneedlepoint project, Mark trying to tune up his oldguitar that had been sitting in the basement for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was undoubtedly trying to think of words to rhyme with Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s father looked up from his book. \"Going starwatching?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. It should be a good night-no moon till aftermidnight. It\u0027s the last chance to see some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerseids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t exactly lying. It would be a good night, and she could keep an eye out for stragglers from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerseid meteor storm as she walked to Burdock Farm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay; just be careful,\" her father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette was surprised. He hadn\u0027t said anything like that for years. She glanced at Claudine, who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejabbed with her needle, lips pursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Mark should go with you,\" Claudine said, without looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, she thinks I\u0027m unstable, Mary-Lynnette thought. I don\u0027t really blame her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. I\u0027ll be fine. I\u0027ll be careful.\" She said it too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Don\u0027t you need any help with your stuff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll take the car. I\u0027ll be. fine. Really.\"Mary Lynnette fled to the garage before her family\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould come up with anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t pack her telescope. Instead, she put a shovel in the backseat. She looped the strap of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecamera around her neck and stuck a pen flashlight in her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe parked at the foot of her hill. Before she gotthe shovel out, she paused a moment to look dutifully\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enortheast, toward the constellation Perseus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo meteors right this second. All right. Keys inhand, she turned to open the back of the station\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewagon-and jumped violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d nearly walked into Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s pulse was racing and her knees felt weak. From fear, she told herself. And that\u0027s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You nearly gave me a heart attack!\" she said. \"Doyou always creep up behind people like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe expected some smart-ass answer of either the joking-menacing or the hey-baby variety. But Ashjust\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrowned at her moodily. \"No. What are you doing out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette\u0027s heart skipped several beats. But she heard her own voice answering flatly, \"I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estarwatching. I do it every night. You might want to make a note of that for the thought police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, then at the station wagon. \"Starwatching?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. From that hill.\" She gestured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was looking at the camera looped around\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher neck. \"No telescope,\" he commented skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or is that what\u0027s in the car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette realized she was still holding the keys, ready to open the back of the wagon. \"I didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebring a telescope tonight.\" She went around to the passenger side of the car, unlocked the door, reached\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein to pull out her binoculars. \"You don\u0027t need a telescope to starwatch. You can see plenty with these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,really.\"Now, that was a mistake, Mary -Lynnette thought, suddenly grimly amused. Acting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas if you don\u0027t believe me ... just you wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to see light from four million yearsago?\" she said. Then, without waiting for him to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanswer: \"Okay. Face east.\" She rotated a finger at him. \"Here, take the binoculars. Look at that line of fir\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrees on the horizon. Now pan up ...\"She gavehim directions, rapping them out like a drill sergeant. \"Now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo you see a bright disk with a kind of smudgeall around it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um. Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Andromeda. Another galaxy.But if you tried to look at it through a telescope, you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t seeit all at once. Looking through a telescope is like looking at the sky through a soda straw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s all the field of view you get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e................\"All right. Okay. Point taken.\" He started to lower the binoculars. \"Look, could we suspend\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe starwatching for just a minute? I wanted to talk toyou\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want tosee the center of ourgalaxy?\" Mary -Lynnette interrupted. \"Turn south.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did everything but physically make him turn.She didn\u0027t dare touch him. There was so much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadrenaline racing through her system already-if shemade contact she might go supercritical and explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn,\" she said. He shut his eyes briefly, then turned, bringing the binoculars up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to look in the constellation Sagittarius.\" She rattled off instructions. \"See that? That\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhere the center of the Milky Way is. Where all the star clouds are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is nice. Okay, now go up and eastyou should be able to find a little dim sort of glow....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pink one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gavehim a quick look. \"Yeah, the pink one.Most people don\u0027t see that. That\u0027s the Trifid Nebula.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are those dark lines in it?\" Mary-Lynnette stopped dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forgot her drill sergeant manner. She stepped back. She stared at him. She could feel her breath\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoming quicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered the binoculars and looked at her. \"Something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re dark nebulae. Lanes of dust in front of the hot gas. But ... you can\u0027t see them.\" \"I just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No. You can\u0027t see those. It\u0027s not possible, notwith binoculars. Even if you had nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emillimeter pupils ...\" She pulled the flashlight out of her pocket and trained it full in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" He jerked back, eyes squeezing shut, hand over them. \"That hurt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Mary-Lynnette had already seen. She couldn\u0027t tell what color his eyes were right now, because the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecolored parts, the irises, were reduced to almost invis ible rings. His eye was all pupil.Like a cat\u0027s at maxi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emum dilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God ...the things he must be able tosee. Eighth-magnitude stars, maybe ninth-magnitude stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine that, seeing a Mag 9 star with yournaked eye. To see colors in the star clouds-hot hy drogen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eglowing pink, oxygen shining green-blue. To see thousands more stars cluttering the sky .. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quick,\" she said urgently. \"How many stars doyouseein the sky right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t seeanything,\"he said in a muffled voice, hand still over his eyes. \"I\u0027mblind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I meanseriously,\"Mary-Lynnette said. And she caught his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a stupid thing to do. She wasn\u0027t thinking. But when she touched his skin, it was like completing a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecurrent. Shock swept over her. Ash dropped hishand and looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor just a second they were face-to-face, gazes locked. Something like lightning trembled betweenthem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Mary-Lynnette pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027ttakeany more of this. Oh, God, why am Ieven standing here talking to him? I\u0027ve got enough ahead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof me tonight. I\u0027ve got abody to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it for the astronomy lesson,\" she said, holding out a hand for the binoculars. Her voice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas justslightly unsteady. \"I\u0027m going up the hill now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-240She didn\u0027t ask wherehe was going. She didn\u0027t care, as long as it was away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated an instant before giving her the binoculars, and when he did he made sure not to touchher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFine, Mary-Lynnette thought. We both feel the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye,\" he said limply. He started to walk away. Stopped, his head lowered. \"What I wanted to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esay ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout turning, he said in a flat and perfectly composed voice, \"Stay away from my sisters, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette was thunderstruck. So outragedand full of disbelief that she couldn\u0027t find words. Then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe thought: Wait, maybe he knows they\u0027re killers and he\u0027s trying to protect me. Like Jeremy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround the sudden constriction in her throat she managed to say, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his drooping head. \"I just don\u0027t thinkyou\u0027d be a very good influence on them. They\u0027rekind of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eimpressionable, and I don\u0027t want them getting any ideas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary-Lynnette deflated. I should have known, shethought. She said, sweetly and evenly, \"Ash? Get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebent and die.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-daughters-of-darkness-night-world-2/page-7.html","bookId":1862,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:54 PM"}
