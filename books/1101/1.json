Delabordeau, a Frenchman, now resident in Cairo, who had given out that he was in some way concerned in the canal about to be made between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. \u0026nbsp;In discussion on this subject he had become acquainted with Mr. Damer; and although the latter gentleman, true to English interests, perpetually declared that the canal would never be made, and thus irritated M.

Delabordeau, had laid herself out to find the weak side of Mr. Damer. \u0026nbsp;Mr. Damer, with all his family, was going up the Nile, and it was known that he had room for two in his boat over and above his own family. \u0026nbsp;Miss Dawkins had told him that she had not quite made up her mind to undergo so great a fatigue, but that, nevertheless, she had a longing of the soul to see something of Nubia. \u0026nbsp;To this Mr. Damer had answered nothing but “Oh!” which Miss Dawkins had not found to be encouraging.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But she had not on that account despaired. \u0026nbsp;To a married man there are always two sides, and in this instance there was Mrs. Damer as well as Mr. Damer. \u0026nbsp;When Mr. Damer said “Oh!” Miss Dawkins sighed, and said, “Yes, indeed!” then smiled, and betook herself to Mrs. Damer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now Mrs. Damer was soft-hearted, and also somewhat old-fashioned. \u0026nbsp;She did not conceive any violent affection for Miss Dawkins, but she told her daughter that “the single lady by herself was a very nice young woman, and that it was a thousand pities she should have to go about so much alone like.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Miss Damer had turned up her pretty nose, thinking, perhaps, how small was the chance that it ever should be her own lot to be an unprotected female. \u0026nbsp;But Miss Dawkins carried her point at any rate as regarded the expedition to the Pyramids.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Miss Damer, I have said, had a pretty nose. \u0026nbsp;I may also say that she had pretty eyes, mouth, and chin, with other necessary appendages, all pretty. \u0026nbsp;As to the two Master Damers, who were respectively of the ages of fifteen and sixteen, it may be sufficient to say that they were conspicuous for red caps and for the constancy with which they raced their donkeys.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now the donkeys, and the donkey boys, and the dragomans were all standing at the steps of Shepheard’s Hotel. \u0026nbsp;To each donkey there was a donkey-boy, and to each gentleman there was a dragoman, so that a goodly cortége was assembled, and a goodly noise was made. \u0026nbsp;It may here be remarked, perhaps with some little pride, that not half the noise is given in Egypt to persons speaking any other language that is bestowed on those whose vocabulary is English.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This lasted for half an hour. \u0026nbsp;Had the party been French the donkeys would have arrived only fifteen minutes before the appointed time. \u0026nbsp;And then out came Damer père and Damer mère, Damer fille, and Damer fils. \u0026nbsp;Damer mère was leaning on her husband, as was her wont. \u0026nbsp;She was not an unprotected female, and had no desire to make any attempts in that line. \u0026nbsp;Damer fille was attended sedulously by Mr. Ingram, for whose demolishment, however, Mr. Damer still brought up, in a loud voice, the fag ends of certain political arguments which he would fain have poured direct into the ears of his opponent, had not his wife been so persistent in claiming her privileges. \u0026nbsp;M. Delabordeau should have followed with Miss Dawkins, but his French politeness, or else his fear of the unprotected female, taught him to walk on the other side of the mistress of the party.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Miss Dawkins left the house with an eager young Damer yelling on each side of her; but nevertheless, though thus neglected by the gentlemen of the party, she was all smiles and prettiness, and looked so sweetly on Mr. Ingram when that gentleman stayed a moment to help her on to her donkey, that his heart almost misgave him for leaving her as soon as she was in her seat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then they were off. \u0026nbsp;In going from the hotel to the Pyramids our party had not to pass through any of the queer old narrow streets of the true Cairo—Cairo the Oriental. \u0026nbsp;They all lay behind them as they went down by the back of the hotel, by the barracks of the Pasha and the College of the Dervishes, to the village of old Cairo and the banks of the Nile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here they were kept half an hour while their dragomans made a bargain with the ferryman, a stately reis, or captain of a boat, who declared with much dignity that he could not carry them over for a sum less than six times the amount to which he was justly entitled; while the dragomans, with great energy on behalf of their masters, offered him only five times that sum.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As far as the reis was concerned, the contest might soon have been at an end, for the man was not without a conscience; and would have been content with five times and a half; but then the three dragomans quarrelled among themselves as to which should have the paying of the money, and the affair became very tedious.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What horrid, odious men!” said Miss Dawkins, appealing to Mr. Damer. \u0026nbsp;“Do you think they will let us go over at all?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, I suppose they will; people do get over generally, I believe. \u0026nbsp;Abdallah! \u0026nbsp;Abdallah! why don’t you pay the man?

Delabordeau to himself. \u0026nbsp;“It can’t be much,” he went on thinking, “or she would not be left in this way by herself.” \u0026nbsp;And the result of his thoughts was that Miss Dawkins, if undertaken, might probably become more plague than profit. \u0026nbsp;As to Miss Dawkins herself, though she was ecstatic about Mount Sinai—which was not present—she seemed to have forgotten the poor Pyramids, which were then before her nose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two lads were riding races along the dusty path, much to the disgust of their donkey-boys. \u0026nbsp;Their time for enjoyment was to come. \u0026nbsp;There were hampers to be opened; and then the absolute climbing of the Pyramids would actually be a delight to them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As for Miss Damer and Mr. Ingram, it was clear that they had forgotten palm-trees, Pyramids, the Nile, and all Egypt. \u0026nbsp;They had escaped to a much fairer paradise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Could I bear to live among Republicans?” said Fanny, repeating the last words of her American lover, and looking down from her donkey to the ground as she did so. \u0026nbsp;“I hardly know what Republicans are, Mr. Ingram.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let me teach you,” said he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You do talk such nonsense. \u0026nbsp;I declare there is that Miss Dawkins looking at us as though she had twenty eyes. \u0026nbsp;Could you not teach her, Mr. Ingram?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And so they emerged from the palm-tree grove, through a village crowded with dirty, straggling Arab children, on to the cultivated plain, beyond which the Pyramids stood, now full before them; the two large Pyramids, a smaller one, and the huge sphynx’s head all in a group together.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Fanny,” said Bob Damer, riding up to her, “mamma wants you; so toddle back.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mamma wants me! \u0026nbsp;What can she want me for now?” said Fanny, with a look of anything but filial duty in her face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To protect her from Miss Dawkins, I think. \u0026nbsp;She wants you to ride at her side, so that Dawkins mayn’t get at her. \u0026nbsp;Now, Mr. Ingram, I’ll bet you half-a-crown I’m at the top of the big Pyramid before you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2907/80035.html","bookId":1101,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 4:20:09 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 4:20:09 AM"}
