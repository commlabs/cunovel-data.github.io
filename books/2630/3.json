{"id":102034,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eBeth Fischer couldn\u0027t wait to get home from her Seattle job as a paralegal for Barney, Blackburn and Buckley, one of the most prestigious law firms in the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute she walked into her small downtown condo, she logged on to the computer. As soon as she was on the Internet, she hit the key to bring up the computer game that had enthralled her for months. World of Warcraft had quickly become addictive. Six months ago, one of the attorneys at the office had casually mentioned it; he\u0027d laughingly advised his colleagues to stay away from it because of its enticing qualities. Beth should\u0027ve listened - but on the other hand, she was glad she hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the game loaded, she hurriedly made herself a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich and carried it into the small office that served as a guest bedroom on rare occasions. Directly off her kitchen, it was a perfect computer room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sank into her comfortable office chair, tucked her shoeless feet beneath her and signed on. Her name was Borincana and she was a hunter. Her pet wolf was called Spot, not the most original name, but it had attracted the attention of a priest named Timixie, who had since teamed up with her. Both were Night Elves and together had risen to level forty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were unbeatable and unstoppable, a legend in the annals of online computer games - in their own minds, anyway. Both of them were addicted to the game and met every evening to play, sometimes for hours. They didn\u0027t need to be online at the same time but often were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lloyd, the attorney, had commented on this game, Beth had been looking for a mindless way to fill her evenings. She needed something to relax her - and distract her from the fact that all her friends were getting married, one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, Beth had served as a bridesmaid in ten weddings. Ten. Already three of her friends were parents, and another two were pregnant. If she\u0027d enjoyed crafts, she would\u0027ve learned to knit or crochet. The truth was, Beth couldn\u0027t bear the thought of spending her evenings sitting in front of the television, creating little blankets for all those babies, when the likelihood of her marrying and having a child of her own hovered around zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarriage terrified her. Been there, done that - and failed miserably. Fortunately she was smart enough to realize her mistake. Some people were meant to fall in love, marry and produce the requisite two children, preferably a boy and a girl. Her younger sister, Angela, had done so in record time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while, the pressure was off Beth. Recently, however, her mother had taken up the old refrain. \"Meet someone. Try again.\" Joyce Fischer hadn\u0027t been subtle about it, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, thank you, Mom. Beth wasn\u0027t interested and that was all there was to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe World of Warcraft was the best alternative she\u0027d found to lonely nights - and the best diversion from talk of marriage and babies. She\u0027d been grateful to find something that was so much fun and so involving. The bonus, of course, was Peter, her Internet partner - the priest Timixie. They chatted by instant message every now and then, congratulating each other on their successes. Like her, Peter seemed to make a point of avoiding relationships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the game they teamed up and traveled together, roaming the World of Warcraft landscape, and generally made a great couple - in strictly virtual terms, of course. As far as Beth was concerned, her relationship with Peter via the game was as close as she was willing to get to another man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when life in the alternate universe was getting interesting and another battle seemed imminent, Beth\u0027s phone rang. Groaning, she glanced at caller ID and saw that it was her mother. She ignored it and after five rings, the machine picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marybeth, I know you\u0027re there. Are you playing that blasted computer game again? This is important - we need to discuss Christmas. Call me back within the hour, otherwise I\u0027ll drive over to your condo and I don\u0027t want to have to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth cringed at the sound of her name as much as the message. She\u0027d grown up as Marybeth and had always hated it. For some reason, it reminded her of those girls on reruns of Hee Haw. Nevertheless, her mother refused to call her anything else. Beth could see she wouldn\u0027t be able to ignore the call. With a sigh, she started to log off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight away, Peter instant-messaged her. Where are you going?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe typed back. Sorry. My mother phoned about Christmas and I need to be the dutiful daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter\u0027s reply came right away. I hear you. I\u0027m being pressured, too. My parents are after me to get a life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth read his comment and nearly laughed out loud. My mother said almost exactly the same thing to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere do you live?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the most personal question he\u0027d ever asked and she hesitated before replying. Seattle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet out of here! I do, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way! It was hard to believe they\u0027d been playing this game for nearly six months and yet they\u0027d just discovered they lived in the same city. Gotta go, she typed quickly. I\u0027ll be back in half an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee you then, Peter wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth put Borincana and Spot, her animal companion, in hiding, where they\u0027d be safe from attack, and reluctantly reached for the phone. Even as she punched the speed-dial button, she knew that the conversation would have little to do with Christmas. Her mother was trying to find out if Beth was seeing anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if she\u0027d been sitting by the phone waiting for her call, Joyce answered on the first ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mother, I\u0027m not dating.\" Beth figured she\u0027d get to the point immediately. That way, she could bypass all the coy questions about coworkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think I\u0027d ask you something like that?\" her mother returned, obviously offended by her directness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you always do,\" Beth countered. She loved her parents and envied them their marriage. If her own had gone half as well, she wouldn\u0027t be in this predicament. She and John, her college boyfriend, had been young, barely twenty-one, and immature. Everyone had advised them to wait, but they\u0027d been too impatient, too much in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin six months of the wedding, they\u0027d hated each other. Beth couldn\u0027t leave fast enough, and John felt the same. He was as eager to escape their disaster of a marriage as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was supposed to be a painless and amicable divorce. Everything had gone smoothly; she\u0027d filed because John seemed incapable of doing anything without her pestering him. If something needed to be done, she had to take responsibility because John was utterly helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn\u0027t afford attorneys, so they\u0027d gone through the legal documents with the assistance of a law student on campus. They had no material goods to speak of. He\u0027d kept the television and she took the bed. Still had it, in fact, but she\u0027d purchased a new mattress a couple of years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat surprised Beth, what had caught her completely unawares, was the unexpected pain caused by the divorce. This wasn\u0027t like breaking up with a boyfriend, which was how she\u0027d assumed it would feel. This was failure with a capital F.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the divorce, she\u0027d gone to see a counselor, who\u0027d described her emotions as grief. At the time she\u0027d scoffed. She was happy to be rid of John and the marriage, she\u0027d said. Nonetheless, she had grieved and in some ways still did. It was perhaps the most intense pain she\u0027d ever experienced. It\u0027d left her emotionally depleted. Nine years later, she was unable to put her failed marriage behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwice during the divorce proceedings she\u0027d hesitated. Twice she\u0027d considered going to John and making one last effort to work it out. The problem wasn\u0027t that she\u0027d found him in bed with another woman or that he\u0027d been abusive, physically or mentally. He wasn\u0027t an addict or an alcoholic - just completely irresponsible and immature. She\u0027d had enough, and in the end she\u0027d walked away. Her failure to try again was one of the things that still haunted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marybeth, I was asking you about Christmas,\" her mother was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sorry, I wasn\u0027t paying attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed,\" Joyce said sarcastically. \"Your father and I thought that instead of the big fancy dinner we do every year, we\u0027d have a potluck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA potluck on Christmas Day? Beth didn\u0027t like the sound of that, although she understood the reasoning. Her mother spent most of the day in the kitchen and that couldn\u0027t be much fun for her. Beth decided she\u0027d do her share without begrudging the time or expense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to complain?\" her mother asked as if taken aback by her lack of response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Actually I was thinking I\u0027d bring the turkey and stuffing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can cook.\" Beth thought the question in her mother\u0027s voice bordered on insulting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so?\" Joyce Fischer asked. \"When did you last eat anything that didn\u0027t come from a pizza delivery place or the frozen food section at the grocery store?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiving alone, Beth didn\u0027t have much reason to stand over a stove. Not when it was convenient and easy to order takeout or grab something from the deli. Her microwave got far more use than her stove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay, I\u0027ll order a cooked turkey. We have to have turkey, Mom. It\u0027s tradition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to begin a new tradition,\" her mother said. \"I want to enjoy the day with my grandkids - speaking of which, when can I expect more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth was amused by the transition from dinner to her absent love life in one easy breath. \"Probably never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marybeth!\" She seemed horrified at the prospect. \"You\u0027re a beautiful woman. You need to put your divorce behind you and move on with your life. You know John has, and more power to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMentioning the fact that her ex-husband had remarried was a low blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa Carroll, a college friend of Beth\u0027s - correction, acquaintance, and an unfriendly one at that - had gleefully shared the news of John\u0027s marriage a couple of summers ago. Beth had taken it hard, although they\u0027d been divorced for seven years by then. John was perfectly free to try his hand at married life a second time. She was happy for him. Thrilled, even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what she\u0027d tried to tell herself, but it didn\u0027t explain the depression she\u0027d sunk into afterward. For weeks she was weepy and miserable. In the back of her mind, she\u0027d held out hope that one day John would return to her. It was an utterly outlandish notion, wholly unrealistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should never have told you John got married again,\" she said, unable to disguise the pain of her mother\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, dear. But you do need to move on. I was in church this week and I lit a candle for you. I asked God to send someone special into your life and I feel sure He\u0027ll answer my prayer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lit a candle on my behalf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always do when I have a special prayer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth rolled her eyes. \"You asked God to send me a husband?\" She couldn\u0027t believe her mother would do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make it sound like I signed you up for a dating service.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t there anyone who interests you?\" Joyce pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desperation in her mother\u0027s voice made Beth uncomfortable. \"Not really,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone at work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Beth most emphatically did not want an office romance. She\u0027d seen a couple of those go sour. After the last one, between a legal secretary and one of the partners, the law firm had set a policy against the practice of dating within the office. Which was fine with Beth, since she happened to enjoy her job and had no intention of risking dismissal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze drifted toward the computer screen. \"Well, there\u0027s someone I met recently....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is?\" Hope flared instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d think Beth had just announced that she\u0027d set her wedding date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We met on WoW.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That ridiculous game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mom. I found out he lives in Seattle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Invite him to Christmas dinner,\" Joyce said promptly. \"I\u0027ll do the full meal. Forget the potluck. I\u0027ll entice him with my cooking - and I promise to teach you how. You know what they say about the way to a man\u0027s heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to be scornful of those old wives\u0027 tales, too,\" her mother continued undaunted, \"but so many of them are true. Now, don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll downplay the fact that you don\u0027t cook. Leave everything to me.\" Her mother didn\u0027t even attempt to hide her delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother, no!\" Good grief, for all she knew, Peter was married. She didn\u0027t dare ask for fear he\u0027d assume she was interested. All right, she was interested, but only because her mother had forced her into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got one week to ask him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I insist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth closed her eyes and before she could protest further, Joyce disconnected the line. Sighing, Beth hung up the phone. It was either arrive on Christmas Day with a man or disappoint her mother. She sighed again as she recalled that Joyce had resorted to prayer in order to find her a husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth loved her sister and she treasured little James and Bella, her nephew and niece, but Angela hadn\u0027t done her any favors by marrying the exemplary Brian and then quickly producing two perfect grandchildren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to forget her woes, she logged back on to the game and was pleased to see that her partner was still online. She joined Peter and soon afterward he sent her a message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow\u0027d the conversation with your mother go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. She wished she hadn\u0027t mentioned that she\u0027d be talking to her family. She was more concerned with what had happened while she was Away From the Keyboard. Did I miss anything exciting when I was AFK?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. I teamed up with level 41 Dwarf Warrior and defeated the last two Warmongers to complete the Crush-ridge quest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth sat up straighter. Wow. Great going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should\u0027ve been here. I started pounding my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Tarzan? she joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly if you\u0027re Jane, came his reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth read the line a second time. He almost seemed to be flirting with her. Nah, he was just teasing, which they often did, bantering back and forth and congratulating each other. It would be easy to misread his intentions, and she didn\u0027t want to make more of this than warranted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she didn\u0027t respond to his comment, they returned to the game. Only later, when she\u0027d logged off and headed for the shower, did Beth pause to reconsider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Peter had been flirting, and that was a huge if, perhaps she should make an effort to learn more about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth turned on the shower. These were the thoughts of a desperate woman, she told herself grimly. Signs of someone who\u0027d sunk to a new low - finding a date for Christmas Day through an online computer game. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-angels-go-angels-everywhere-6/page-3.html","bookId":2630,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:07 PM"}
