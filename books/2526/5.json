This was no way to live... and the irony was, he wasn\u0027t alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos placed both hands against the cool, damp, concrete wall, standing back from it, leaning on his palms as his head hung and he considered his fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to get Damali out of his thoughts, out of his nose, out of his skin, his bloodstream, and his mind. His fangs wouldn\u0027t even retract as he thought about her and shut his eyes. He\u0027d come so close. He could still feel her lacerating him with her softness. His breathing hadn\u0027t steadied, nor had his pulse. The ache for her was becoming so unbearable that he threw his head back, let out the moan that he\u0027d sheltered for the duration of her embrace, and punched the wall in frustration - crumbling cement to leave a crater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a real bitch, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinning on the intruder, the fact that it was male redoubled his strength in preparation for instant battle. When he recognized his adversary, he knew it was a perfect night for Nuit to die. But Nuit just laughed, kept his distance, and circled him, cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you go eat and relax - you\u0027ve got less than an hour before daylight, and this is no way for a man to try to sleep. Too late to go to New Orleans... the women are fantastic there, and the food excellent - blood alcohol levels are high, the cattle eat fantastic cuisine... a little wine in your system might help you drift off easier, but alas. Maybe another night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA combination of fury and humiliation gripped him. Carlos snarled, and rolled his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s better. You\u0027ve got to pace yourself. I\u0027ve heard a hit of Neteru will do that to you... You broke her off from the herd, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos growled low in his throat. \"You never gave me a name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I have to? You said name any one of them. I just did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit smiled and circled him, breathing in deeply. \"I can smell her on you. Amazing... you got close to her, but had the presence of mind to remember our deal. I would have been able to pick up the scent if you\u0027d violated her, too.\" Nuit relaxed. \"Very good. I won\u0027t have to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos narrowed his focus on Nuit, wondering which limb to tear from him first - not answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I better understand the block to my calls to you all night... if you had that hunt rush pumping through your system... yes... makes sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how did you find me?\" Carlos paced back and forth, adrenaline spikes hard to shake as Nuit stoked and toyed with his anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your agony could be heard for miles. I began to worry that you\u0027d just been staked.\" Nuit laughed at his own joke, his guard seeming to become more relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two vampires stared at each other. Carlos analyzed the information contained in Nuit\u0027s statement, and immediately realized that it had opened an advantage - something he\u0027d temporarily forgotten. One of his deals had made good. Nuit was blind to him, but didn\u0027t suspect the Vampire Council or the Covenant. Nuit assumed that the blocks to his calls had been produced by interaction with a Neteru\u0027s strong telepathic ability overriding his mental clarity. Perfect cover. Carlos almost smiled. Yeah, he had slayer in his system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed to play this to the bone. To kill Nuit now would be premature - two masters in a death struggle would go beyond dawn. Nuit needed to believe he had the advantage in order to open another opportunity to get to the cocky bastard when there was more time. It was all about power and control, as well as perception, illusion. Who had the power... and who believed they had the power. Plus, Nuit had eaten, he hadn\u0027t. Right now, Nuit possibly had the endurance advantage. Carlos carefully weighed his options. Even though he had the rage advantage, this would be a long fight. But if he garnered patience, another opportunity could be created to bring Nuit down. Carlos studied the situation, and put the roulette wheel in motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got close, and couldn\u0027t raise anybody from our territorial pack by telepathy,\" Carlos finally said before Nuit became suspicious. \"My focus was totally compromised... maybe overwhelmed is a better description,\" he added, feigning submission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit looked at him hard, and then grinned. \"I guess you did get close to her, or you wouldn\u0027t be down here in a sewer losing your mind. But, odd... it requires a master\u0027s patience, will power, and discipline not to have just taken her in public, which is where I can only assume you found her. Unless you do have some deference to your maker... hmmm. I bet it was positively torturing you not to have been able to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you!\" The wound was too fresh for Nuit to dig his claws into it with a snide remark, and it was impossible to stop the visceral response. Carlos walked away from Nuit, but kept on his guard. The only thing that helped keep him from going for Nuit\u0027s throat was the fact that Nuit\u0027s comment exposed an important variable. Nuit didn\u0027t know he was looking at another master vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit returned a cruel smile, taunting him with a slow, seductive response designed to stoke Carlos\u0027s rage. \"Fuck me? Ahhh... Anytime, but not tonight. What happened to Raven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She went after the Neteru and got her ass kicked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit studied his nails. \"That\u0027s a damned shame - she was good pussy. Well, you can always go make more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos stared at him, disgusted. He would kill this motherfucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s right - you\u0027re a second generation, and can only make thirds.\" Nuit laughed. \"All right, all right, I know - you need me to make a female second to be on your level. We can arrange that. Just pick her out, since Raven misbehaved. I had also told her not to do the Neteru - ever. Just so you know, you and I are on the same page. Women can be so jealous at times. Foolish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, she almost botched the delivery by sending six vamps after Damali\u0027s team, and then by going after the huntress herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit stared at Carlos hard. \"The guardians are always expendable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos shook his head. \"Not if you want the huntress to feel safe and come out of hiding on her own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is brilliant... You do have a point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me to bring her to you, untouched. Correct? And, that she had to comply of her own free will, or some shit like that, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit nodded, no longer nonchalant. \"You can get her to come to us freely?\" Excitement exuded from him and he licked his lips, and then rubbed his jaw with his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your fangs are showing,\" Carlos said evenly. \"Chill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll do that to you. Forgive me,\" Nuit said on a deep breath. \"Just one question... how in the hell did you back away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question gave Carlos pause, because in all honesty, he didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A sense of self-preservation,\" he finally replied, casting a disparaging glare toward Nuit. \"I may be new, but I know better than to go against my maker... or a master vampire. If I chill, well, then it\u0027s all good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ability to govern such restraint is laudable... and very wise. Maybe making you wasn\u0027t such a bad decision after all.\" Nuit studied him for a moment and rubbed his palm over his jaw. \"But you\u0027ve never come to me to feed from my kills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ate from Raven, remember... and had a guard along the way,\" Carlos said quickly, trying to keep the ruse going. \"Then, I went after the Neteru like I was told to - after that, I really haven\u0027t had feeding on my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit hesitated, then came near him and wiped at the sheen of perspiration still on Carlos\u0027s brow. \"Understandable,\" he murmured and put his finger in his mouth. Carlos snarled and Nuit backed away with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s even in your bloodstream. I can taste her in your sweat.\" Nuit sucked in a low hiss with a gulp of air, closed his eyes for a moment, and shuddered. He ran his finger over his lips and his head tilted as he inhaled deeply. \"But she had a white bath - a damned prayer chastity belt! How did you get past it to even sense what she\u0027d be like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos could feel his jaw beginning to unhinge at the sight of another male demonstrating such open desire for his woman. He ran his tongue over his incisors, sending them back into his skull. Not yet. The night would come soon when the game would be over. In that instant he made up his mind that there were only two pending offers to consider - the Vampire Council\u0027s or the other side. Nuit was a dead man walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she trusts me. That\u0027s the only thing that will render her prayer guard ineffective. She has to willingly breach it and we have to draw her beyond it, remember? If I bring her to you struggling, you still won\u0027t be able to get past it - so let me work her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos leveled his gaze at Nuit. \"You just sampled the product, and it opened up your nose, didn\u0027t it? I told you I had the goods. Don\u0027t fuck with me. Not tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make you a second female, quickly. No man in my territory should have to suffer like this - unless he crosses me.\" Nuit gazed at Carlos and held him in an intense stare. \"What was she like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Nuit had taken a hit... liked the product and was damned near strung out from just a taste. Everything he\u0027d learned in the streets collated in Carlos\u0027s mind, and he leveraged his advantage, messing with Nuit without mercy. Let the bastard twist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t even discuss it,\" Carlos said, the truth of his statement not lost on Nuit. That was the best part of it all, he could tell the truth, and the credibility would come through in his tone. Carlos watched his enemy nearly writhe with impatience, and a deep sense of personal satisfaction took residence within him. To the victor go the spoils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bring her to you, Nuit. Then we can deal with my options. For now, she looks like she\u0027s very close to doing the concert - maybe even signing with your label,\" Carlos lied, just to add more lure to the game. \"I\u0027ve been in her ear and in her mind, because she trusts me. We go way back; I can sway her... she doesn\u0027t even know I\u0027ve turned - so don\u0027t blow my cover. That\u0027s how I got past her guardians and her radar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious?\" Nuit leaned against the wall as though he now needed it to hold himself upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She never even saw my fangs,\" Carlos said with pride. \"It was smooth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth vampires looked at each other. Nuit was almost trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I said to stop flushing my hunt,\" Carlos went on, relaxing as he felt his guile take root within Nuit. \"That guy, Dan, he\u0027s a wannabe... but Damali cares for him. The kid got her to consider it, first, when one of the Minion threw the bait out for him to hook up with Blood. I was working on the huntress from a business perspective. Everything was cool, until Raven went after Dan, and her thirds attacked the compound. You have got to pull your people back, or make sure none of the other seconds are moving on your kill. I thought you had this territory locked down, man? There are breaches everywhere, and it\u0027s bullshit. We don\u0027t have a lotta time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit pushed himself off the wall and nodded. \"No one has ever gotten us this close to her physically, or to shifting her will - from there, breaking her spirit is only a matter of time. And none of the others have ever been this loyal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos nodded and walked closer to Nuit. \"You want to feel this agony?\" He leaned in toward Nuit to let him smell where Damali\u0027s head had rested against his neck, then quickly backed away. \"That\u0027s pain, hombre. My jaw almost unhinged - but I remembered the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit tried to come near him again, but Carlos held up his hand. You always had to give them just a taste to make them hunger for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si. So you understand the sacrifice - however, I don\u0027t have a lair, the sun is about to toast both of us, I got motherfuckers creating havoc, and I really am not in the mood to sleep in the sewer my first night out - and not after being this loyal. I need my rest, and I deserve - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fucking throne and a harem, Carlos. The females I\u0027ll send to your lair as part of the package are insatiable. Yes. I completely agree. I\u0027ll make some territorial adjustments, and you can have one of the other dons\u0027 lairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the Dominican\u0027s joint. He and I go way back, and he did a few of my boys a while ago when I was making space for my own in the streets. Some shit never dies - territory is territory. As above, so below.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit nodded. \"Take his villa in Beverly Hills. He has a sumptuous vault in his basement. I\u0027ll do him myself, will explain to the others that it was just business. After a taste, I need one more body for the night, as it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos chuckled. \"I hear you. Then imagine how I feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit laughed. \"He might even have a third generation female already in there who might still be awake - might help take the Neteru edge off? You want her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw, I\u0027m cool, man,\" Carlos murmured. \"Give whatever female you find to one of the other dons. I just ain\u0027t in the frame of mind. In fact, I might just hit a blood bank and take a few pints to bed. If I go hunting this late, I might forget what time it is and wind up on the Neteru\u0027s trail again. Could fuck around and sun bake myself by accident. I\u0027m telling you, man, this slayer is all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is intense, isn\u0027t it... but so much so that you don\u0027t trust yourself to hunt?\" Nuit rubbed his face and shook his head. \"Absolutely amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s equivalent to a master level, Nuit,\" Carlos said quietly, lacing the truth in his game to make it even more credible, but perhaps offering more than he wanted to, the pull of Damali still a toxin within his system. But at the same time, he had to drive a convincing point that would assure her temporary safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos let out a long breath that made Nuit carefully watch him. He closed his eyes and projected images of Damali to Nuit in slow motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can hunt better than Raven ever could - you should see her in action, man... the adrenaline, the stamina, the very perspiration on her after the hunt reeks with the Neteru hormone... one whiff and you\u0027re intoxicated... she can see in the dark, almost like us.\" Although baiting his prey, the memory made Carlos inhale and have to pause. The game was rough, but he had to play it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos sighed. \"I\u0027m not talking myths and legends. I\u0027ve seen her... held her. The woman is a telepath, a tactical sensory - her skin literally comes alive under your hands, she has the nose...\" He pressed on. \"Can project thought, and has a will of iron... can you imagine what she\u0027ll be like when she turns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying not to smile as Nuit\u0027s knees buckled, Carlos opened his eyes and glanced away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s beyond awesome... think of what delivering that first break of skin will be like - especially if she turns her throat to you with her panties wet and begs you to take both her neck and her - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop.\" Nuit\u0027s fangs glistened in the darkness. He couldn\u0027t even pull them back. Water dripping from overhead provided the only sound that echoed between them. \"Two more evenings - you just used up one...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I said, back off with the random hits. If you kill her, or she gets hurt - or one of her people gets jacked, she will go into deep mourning... she\u0027ll never come to you for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you want - work the strategy to bring her to me like that. If you can get inside her head, inside her compound... can get her to follow you to me - then do it! What else in the territory do you want? Name it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit stalked back and forth running his tongue over his incisors, trying to regain his composure. \"Three thousand years since they made a female Neteru - and we thought they wouldn\u0027t make another one. Since that time, they\u0027ve only made males.\" He held Carlos in a furtive gaze. \"Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell yeah, I understand what jonesing for Damali is like.\" Carlos chuckled, an earnest one from his core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want the first daywalker female off the line?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a rhetorical question, or are you playing with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit laughed with Carlos. \"Done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Appreciate it, man, \u0027cause I\u0027m all fucked up - don\u0027t trust myself to even run from the sun... \u0027cause I wanna sit outside her window so bad. I don\u0027t want anything you find at the don\u0027s when you clean out his place. Can\u0027t go there after getting a Neteru in my nose. You feel me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNuit walked toward the tunnel exit nodding. \"Yes. I definitely \u0027feel you,\u0027 and I imagine it is difficult to step down when you\u0027ve been so close.\" Nuit paused and gave Carlos a furtive glance. \"Fifteen minutes, and the lair will be yours. Bring me more word and scent of her next evening. I need to smell her again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done.\" Carlos leaned against the wall as Nuit vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInformation was knowledge, and knowledge was a powerful thing. In the disgusting exchange, he\u0027d moved up in the ranks, took out an old enemy, scored a plush lair, and bought Damali and her crew a valuable, temporary off-limits marker. Baby might have a coupla days of peace. But would he? Regardless, he had inadvertently become a triple agent by making alliances across three borders - Nuit, the Vampire Council, and possibly with the invisible DEA - the forces of light. Question was, how to play it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, not bad for the first night on the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stricken look on Marlene\u0027s face chilled Damali. If Marlene had seen them... Humiliation made her cheeks warm, and it was hard to hold her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big Mike told the others about what happened out there with Raven,\" Marlene whispered. She cast her gaze out the window as she spoke in a quiet voice that trembled. \"I should have told all of you that she was my daughter... but... I couldn\u0027t deal with it. I wanted to put the fact that she was once my child out of my mind. I loved her, Damali,\" she murmured as she swallowed hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene\u0027s eyes held such pain that Damali was almost forced to look away. \"Carried her in my body, and put her to my breast. She was my baby... and Nuit took her when she was your age. She was like you in so many ways... beautiful, talented, headstrong, and fearless. Thought nothing could happen to her that she couldn\u0027t handle, and that I was just Mom who didn\u0027t understand the \u0027happening\u0027 new world. She wouldn\u0027t listen to me, wouldn\u0027t heed my advice, and the streets took her, and then he got her. She was wide open, and vulnerable... maybe that\u0027s why I was so hard on you. I was afraid that I was watching history repeat itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mar - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I didn\u0027t do right by you, child,\" Marlene said fast, cutting off Damali\u0027s words quickly and wrapping her arms about herself. \"God forgive me... I just couldn\u0027t take care of you both, and I thought if I gave you to people who had resources, and if you were hidden... I just thought that maybe we\u0027d all be spared. But he came, not knowing I was pregnant when I ran, and thought my Christine was you... then he turned her into Raven. The joke was on him, though. She wasn\u0027t a Neteru. You were safe, and that was my consolation for a long time. It\u0027s all good. I have to believe that, or else I just won\u0027t be able to go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo large tears formed in Marlene\u0027s eyes, and Damali went to her. Although it had been a relief that Marlene hadn\u0027t witnessed her intimate exchange with Carlos, she didn\u0027t want a telepathy block from pain like this to be the reason Marlene\u0027s second sight was down. She was also sorry she\u0027d been the one that had to kill Raven with the sword Raven\u0027s own mother had given her... and now, holding Marlene in a tender hug, she felt all the reasons Marlene kept things from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she could understand. How would a young, pregnant woman in love explain vampires to a lover? How would a young woman cope, in that day and age, with being left to bear a child alone, predators all around her, and no momma or family to help her because she had to run away and hide in order to protect them? How was Marlene to care for an infant that would bring vampires constantly sniffing, and still protect and provide for a baby, as well as her unborn child or herself, for that matter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali closed her eyes, holding Marlene tighter. Oh, Marlene... Yes, she\u0027d seen teenage mothers in the street with no support, no skills, no money, no education, no parenting skills, and preyed on by guys who\u0027d just stop, drop, and roll them. Yeah, she\u0027d witnessed how that struggle ravaged the hope and potential from so many young girls. It had been the thing that had kept her straight - seeing with her own eyes, and maybe having unknown second sight, at that time, had helped her make wiser choices. There but for the grace she went. She could have gone out like that, too. Marlene had been practically a child herself... young, alone, afraid - with no money, no real skills or education, no defenses, and had to live by her wits and her gift. God in heaven, what would she have done if she had to walk a mile in Marlene\u0027s shoes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali stroked Marlene\u0027s back as she held her, hoping that the aging guardian still had enough sensory battery left to feel the healing of her touch and be able to sense without words the forgiveness being transmitted to her. Yes, it was so true. The things Marlene had taught her were right... judge not, lest ye be judged. You never know what scars another person carries deep within them that causes them to act the way they do. She remembered Rider\u0027s story, and the things Big Mike had said about his own childhood. Then there was Jose\u0027s pain. She knew Shabazz carried his secret hurts so deeply that no one on the team really had the full story about what had happened to him. And Lord knows what J.L. had experienced in Laos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer thoughts drifted to Carlos, and she wondered what scars he\u0027d carried that had made him choose the life that he did. They all had long stories...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mar, I am so sorry I had to be the one to... release Raven\u0027s soul,\" Damali murmured into her hair. She couldn\u0027t even bring herself to call it what it was. She couldn\u0027t describe Raven\u0027s demise in the crude terms the team normally used to verbally distance themselves from what they had to do. How could she say \"put down,\" \"drop,\" \"stake,\" \"take out,\" \"roll,\" \"splatter,\" or \"gut,\" when talking about the loss of Marlene\u0027s daughter? Marlene had been right about that, too. Words had power. Vocabulary was important. Maybe if people called it what it really was, then the very thought of \"doing somebody\" would give them pause, and they\u0027d think twice about murdering another human being. But that\u0027s just the thing, Marlene\u0027s daughter wasn\u0027t human, which is what was breaking Marlene\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry,\" Damali repeated. \"Oh, Mar... I won\u0027t even claim to know how you feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you, baby,\" Marlene said on a shaky sigh. \"You just put my daughter\u0027s soul to rest. I couldn\u0027t have done it. I didn\u0027t have it in me. That\u0027s why I hesitated in battle. I\u0027d keep seeing her face when she was a toddler... I\u0027d think about how she\u0027d climb into bed at night with me so we could read stories, or how proud she was of her first little gold star in school.\" Marlene drew a ragged breath. \"As a mother... you think about all the good, and wonder how it could have gotten so bad, and you lacerate yourself wondering where you went wrong... how could I have let her get taken by evil... and they call me a guardian? I couldn\u0027t even protect my own child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene\u0027s shoulders shook as Damali held her and rocked her for a long time. The sun peeked out from behind the deep gray haze of clouds as the sky gave birth. All Damali could do during the transition was stroke Marlene\u0027s hair and let her cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to get back to the group,\" Marlene murmured. \"None of us has really slept, the compound is breached... and I can\u0027t see. I was already weak from laying hands on Jose, then the fight to get out of the compound, and then... Raven. I\u0027m totally blind, Damali. I\u0027m no more good to you. My second sight is just blackness. I can\u0027t get past the pain to concentrate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Marlene pulled away, Damali held her by her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marlene, you\u0027re worth more to me than your sight or ability to guard. Don\u0027t you know that by now?\" Damali\u0027s hand went to Marlene\u0027s face and she caressed her cheek as she spoke. \"I love you, Marlene, and understand why you gave me away. You just need some rest and some time to heal. This was hard, I know. Why don\u0027t you let me guard you for a change, and take care of you a little bit for once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Letting go, and seeing your children grow up... and accepting that, is probably the hardest thing in the world to do,\" Marlene whispered, wiping the tears from her face. \"I respect your choices,\" she said, nodding. \"I\u0027m proud of you... thank you for not hating me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hating you?\" Damali shook her head slowly. \"For being human? For having a life and for wanting some joy of your own? No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women shared a slight smile, both understanding each other within the unspoken exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon. Let\u0027s get back to the team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked the corridors in silence, Damali\u0027s arm about Marlene\u0027s shoulders as she guided her to where everyone else was sitting. The expressions the team held said it all. Hope was edging away from the group. Profound loss was taking its toll. They were exhausted, battle weary, down a good man, and on the run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali helped Marlene to sit, and then she walked in front of the group, choosing her words carefully. \"Listen, everybody. We need a break. Last night was... It was worse than we\u0027ve ever had to deal with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRider and Big Mike nodded. Shabazz took up Marlene\u0027s hand as J.L. rubbed her back. Dan\u0027s face held such empathy that Big Mike slung an arm over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Damali said on a long breath. \"We need to post a couple of men here at the hospital to stay with Jose. Maybe even Mar can stay?\" She glanced at Marlene who only nodded and looked out the window. \"He needs your prayers, Marlene... even if you can\u0027t see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t see?\" Rider whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali shook her head and Shabazz lowered his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grief,\" Shabazz murmured. \"Let me stay with her and Jose, here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali nodded. \"J.L., Dan - I need you guys to go back to the compound and work on getting all computer systems and security operable, as well as develop some new weapons for the concert. We need the generators stabilized, and electric lines - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not still thinking of doing the concert, li\u0027l sis?\" Big Mike ran his palm over his bald scalp and let out his breath hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Damali said evenly, feeling pure rage fill her. \"After what just happened to Jose, and now Mar, not to mention the others we lost... we have to go to New Orleans today to scope out the lair in the daylight... and if we don\u0027t find what we\u0027re looking for, we\u0027ll need to do the concert to get on the inside of their operation. It\u0027s the only way to bring Jose fully back to us, and to bring back Marlene\u0027s sight. Maybe even put the other souls lost from our team to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRider pushed himself up, and nodded. \"Better have me, you, and Big Mike go into the compound and sweep it for J.L. and Dan, then get on a flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. That\u0027s where I was going,\" Damali said in a quiet voice. \"Once the compound is safe, if Jose gets released again, Mar and Shabazz can bring him back and seal it before nightfall. While we\u0027re gone, we\u0027re also going to need some slamming material - three songs, Dan said, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan nodded. \"Yeah, and you have to be back in enough time to do some of the promo I\u0027ve got lined up - by three P.M. at the latest so they can tape you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, we\u0027ve got a full day ahead of us, and a lot of work to do. The three of us can scope out the last known lair, and get back in way before it gets dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a plan,\" Big Mike muttered. \"Never went in without a seer to guide us, though. I mean no disrespect, li\u0027l sis, but sometimes your sight is on, and sometimes it\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you.\" Damali gazed at him, her self-confidence eroding moment by moment. \"You\u0027ll have to trust me, then. I\u0027ll be able to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan, like J.L., had been quiet except for one comment, and his line of vision swept the group, and then dropped to his hands that were folded between his legs. \"I still feel awful, though. If they got the guy who saved me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carlos is fine,\" Damali said. \"I just saw him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group stared at her and a mild electric current passed between them to settle upon her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\" Marlene asked cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few minutes ago, just before you walked up. He was in shock, looking for hospital records of his family, trying to make logical sense of what isn\u0027t logical. Said he needed to come back when the admin offices opened this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group visibly relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave him sanctuary to stay with us... like we gave Dan - if he gets hunted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain they stared at her, but didn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We cannot leave an innocent man to get fed on by the dark side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rivera isn\u0027t just an innocent like Dan. He\u0027s a drug dealer, darlin\u0027.\" Rider began pacing. \"Or, did you forget what he does for a living? Vamps ain\u0027t the only thing we gotta worry about - try a drug hit, drive-by to settle a score, the police, being brought in as accomplices to his shit, whatever. There are a whole lot of ways to die, sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s still human, and obviously not a vamp helper, and the sanctuary is only temporary until we wipe out the vamp line chasing all of us - then he can go back to whatever he chooses to do... He saved Dan\u0027s life, and that counts for something,\" she argued. A rush of defensive anger throttled her ability to remain calm. \"Plus, if Dan hadn\u0027t made it out of the parking lot, and if they hadn\u0027t chased Dan to where we found him, then we wouldn\u0027t have been able to take out a second generation female, Rider! Everything happens for a reason - everyone has intrinsic value in this war, or did you forget?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their outburst they had momentarily forgotten Marlene\u0027s pain, and both Damali and Rider hung their heads when Marlene covered her mouth and stood, and then paced to a window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mar, I\u0027m sorry,\" Damali whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Marlene... listen. I\u0027m sorry,\" Rider murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarlene kept her back to them and only shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go do what you have to do,\" Shabazz told them in a sad, quiet voice. \"I\u0027ll stay with her and Jose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pssst,\" a voice called to Carlos in the tunnel. \"I have three minutes to give you this information before it will become too dangerous for you to travel. Dawn approaches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHesitant, Carlos waited, monitoring the heat of the environment around him. The pull of the dawn made everything around him feel like an oven. It sapped his strength, made his senses sluggish, and he could only hope that he\u0027d have enough energy to travel to the Dominican\u0027s lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say whatchu gotta say, fast,\" Carlos replied, his chest heaving as though he were having an asthma attack. \"I don\u0027t have much time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue-clad knight stepped out of the shadows. \"I took a risk. I\u0027m not supposed to be here - but the warrior angels gave us word that you helped the Neteru defeat a second generation... and we saw you fight your vampire nature when you had our huntress in your arms - you even told her to pray! You could have violated her, but you didn\u0027t. There is a major conference about the whole situation now at the levels of mercy. Your love for her gives us hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"State your business,\" Carlos said, wheezing. \"I\u0027m running out of time.\" Pain began riddling his body; the air was becoming thick and polluted by slivers of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want the maps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have them, yet. What else? One minute, and I\u0027m out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring us the head of the master vampire who hunts her. When he falls, it will be easy for us to wipe out his line. That will also free the Neteru\u0027s parent\u0027s trapped soul. We\u0027ll be able to destroy many of the vampires, as well as the demons they live with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy, was already on my agenda. Talk fast, hombre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll give you ten minutes of amnesty to deliver the maps to her once you have them in your possession. I am a seer, that\u0027s why I guide my battalion, and chanced this meeting close to dawn. We\u0027ll clear a way to allow you to get the maps to her, but under guarded conditions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo weakened to argue, Carlos siphoned the remainder of his reserves to change shape, and drifted toward his new refuge in the Dominican\u0027s lair. The density on the planet was crushing. With his last burst of energy, he hurled himself back to safe darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRider slapped a newspaper across Damali\u0027s thighs as they sat and waited to board their flight to New Orleans in LAX.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen this?\" he said as Mike also gathered close. \"Read it and weep. This is who you gave sanctuary to last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamali stared at the headline. Carlos Rivera\u0027s car had been found in the North Hills, still running, with a silver briefcase filled with a hundred thousand dollars, a leather briefcase filled with a million dollars, enough artillery to stop a small army, and his handgun weapon fired into the ground. And, there was a high-ranking Dominican drug czar missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment the threesome just looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what line of work Carlos is in, right?\" Big Mike put his hand on Damali\u0027s shoulder. \"Even if he\u0027s not a vamp, or one of their human traitors...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he went out there at night,\" Rider said, agitated, \"the sonofabitch got nicked, trust me. Rivera isn\u0027t the type to leave one-point-one mil lying in the dirt. Something\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he didn\u0027t get nicked,\" Damali insisted, tossing the newspaper on an empty seat. \"It takes three days to turn a vamp - and... He just didn\u0027t get nicked, I know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTense silence drew and quartered the conversation to a halt. Damali could feel her pulse race with worry. Heaven help Carlos... what had he done? He was in so deep that they must have tried to ice him. Rider was right about one thing: vamps or the mob, both were dangerous predators that could have a man\u0027s life hanging in the balance - how many times had she tried to tell Carlos this! If a war was on, then the team\u0027s concern had merit - she couldn\u0027t let him in the compound... but she also couldn\u0027t let him get eaten alive. Choices. But at least, for the moment, Carlos wasn\u0027t a vampire. If he were, she\u0027d be frying right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t get nicked,\" she murmured again, more to reassure herself than to convince Rider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you so sure?\" Rider finally asked in a sarcastic tone as he studied her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Big Mike and Rider stared at her as Rider\u0027s question stabbed at her. She found her gaze slipping away to watch the planes through the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I hugged him - and I\u0027m still sitting here in the sunlight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s just fucking great!\" Rider shook his head and pushed himself back in his chair. \"We fight six vamps and their ringleader, have the compound invaded, a man on a stretcher - and a guy with a possible nick in his system gets up close and personal with our vampire huntress - like in jugular range? Why am I following this woman to New Orleans - to a lair, in the middle of known vampire country, huh? Just answer me that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have seen the look on his face,\" Damali said. \"He was like Dan. Freaked out. Confused. Maybe he did see something in the woods, and got the hell out of there - which is why the money was left behind. Or maybe it was a drug deal gone bad and he made it out before he ran into Dan. He might have shot one of them and took their car. Or maybe he was delivering a bounty for his family - knowing Carlos, that\u0027s what he was doing, because he still can\u0027t wrap his mind around this madness. Can you blame him? Did you, when you saw your first set of fangs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRider continued to sit back in his chair with his arms folded, appearing grudgingly mollified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Mike sighed. \"We aren\u0027t going to get anywhere arguing amongst ourselves. That\u0027s always evil\u0027s strategy - divide and conquer. They did it with the religions, cultures, nations, and it\u0027s happening now with us. Unify. Respect each others\u0027 points of view... and have compassion for each others\u0027 weaknesses... and squash this bullshit - now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Rider and Damali nodded, but looked off in different directions with their arms still folded over their chests. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-awakening-vampire-huntress-legend-2/page-5.html","bookId":2526,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:37:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:37:15 PM"}
