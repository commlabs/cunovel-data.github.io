He put the good old cup of tea softly on the table by my bed, and I took a refreshing sip. Just right, as usual. Not too hot, not too sweet, not too weak, not too strong, not too much milk, and not a drop spilled in the saucer. A most amazing cove, Jeeves. So dashed competent in every respect. I\u0027ve said it before, and I\u0027ll say it again. I mean to say, take just one small instance. Every other valet I\u0027ve ever had used to barge into my room in the morning while I was still asleep, causing much misery: but Jeeves seems to know when I\u0027m awake by a sort of telepathy.

Bingo Little is a chap I was at school with, and we see a lot of each other still. He\u0027s the nephew of old Mortimer Little, who retired from[Pg 9] business recently with a goodish pile. (You\u0027ve probably heard of Little\u0027s Liniment—It Limbers Up the Legs.) Bingo biffs about London on a pretty comfortable allowance given him by his uncle, and leads on the whole a fairly unclouded life. It wasn\u0027t likely that anything which he described as a matter of importance would turn out to be really so frightfully important. I took it that he had discovered some new brand of cigarette which he wanted me to try, or something like that, and didn\u0027t spoil my breakfast by worrying.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After breakfast I lit a cigarette and went to the open window to inspect the day.

Kind of uplifted feeling. Romantic, if you know what I mean. I\u0027m not much of a ladies\u0027 man, but on this particular morning it seemed to me that what I really[Pg 10] wanted was some charming girl to buzz up and ask me to save her from assassins or something.

Ever since I have known him—and we were at school together—he has been perpetually falling in love with someone, generally in the spring, which seems to act on him like magic. At school he had the finest collection of actresses\u0027 photographs of anyone of his time; and at Oxford his romantic nature was a byword.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027d better come along and meet her at lunch,\" he said, looking at his watch.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A ripe suggestion,\" I said. \"Where are you meeting her?

About fifty yards east of the Ritz there is one of those blighted tea-and-bun shops you see dotted about all over London, and into this, if you\u0027ll believe me, young Bingo dived like a homing rabbit; and before I had time to say a word we were wedged in at a table, on the brink of a silent pool of coffee left there by an early luncher.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I\u0027m bound to say I couldn\u0027t quite follow the development of the scenario. Bingo, while not absolutely rolling in the stuff, has always had a fair amount of the ready. Apart from what he got from his uncle, I knew that he had finished up the jumping season well on the right side of the ledger. Why, then, was he lunching the girl at this Godforsaken eatery?
