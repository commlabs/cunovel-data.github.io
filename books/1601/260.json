It had been an unsettling experience—she had been totally in his power, and her life could have been snuffed out in an instant. She had also been unnerved by the intensity of his ravings; his hatred of the Dragon Reborn was unlike anything she had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of Sharans moved down the slope, and together they sent weaves at the makeshift fortification. Leane sliced one weave from the air, working like a surgeon cutting away withered flesh. Leane was much weaker in the One Power now than she had once been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to be more efficient with her channeling. It was remarkable what a woman could achieve with less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bulwark exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeane threw herself aside as clods of soil rained down. She rolled through curling smoke, coughing and clinging to saidar. It was those Sharan men! She couldn’t see their weaves. She picked herself up, her dress tattered from the explosion, her arms scored by scratches. She caught a hint of blue peeking from a furrow nearby. Doesine. She scrambled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found the woman’s body there. Not her head, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeane felt an immediate, almost overpowering, sense of loss and grief. Doesine and she had not been close, but they had been fighting together here. It was wearing on Leane—the loss, the destruction. How much could they take? How many more would she have to watch die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe steeled herself with difficulty. Light, this was a disaster. They had anticipated enemy Dreadlords, but there were hundreds upon hundreds of those Sharans. An entire nation’s worth of channelers, all trained in war. The battlefield was strewn with bright bits of color, fallen Aes Sedai. Their Warders charged up the hillside, screaming in rage at the loss of their Aes Sedai as they were cut down by blasts of the Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeane stumbled toward where a group of Reds and Greens fought from a hollowed out piece of ground on the western slope. The terrain protected them for now, but how long could the women hold out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, she felt proud. Outnumbered and overwhelmed, the Aes Sedai kept fighting. This was nothing like the night the Seanchan attacked, when a fractured Tower had broken from the inside out. These women held firm; each time a pocket of them was scattered, they grouped back together and continued fighting. Fire fell from above, but nearly as much flew back, and lightning struck on either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeane carefully made her way over to the group, joining Raechin Connoral, who crouched next to a boulder while launching weaves of Fire at the advancing Sharans. Leane watched for return weaves, then deflected one with a quick weave of Water, making the ball of fire burn away in tiny sparks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaechin nodded to her. \"And here I thought you’d stopped being useful for anything other than batting your eyes at men\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Domani art is about achieving what you want, Raechin\", Leane said coolly, \"with as little effort as possible\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaechin snorted and launched a few fireballs toward the Sharans. \"I should ask advice from you on that sometime\", she said. \"If there really is a way to make men do as you like, I should like very much to know it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat idea was so absurd as to nearly make Leane laugh, despite the terrible circumstances. A Red? Putting on paints and powders and learning the Domani arts of manipulation? Well, why not? Leane thought, striking down another fireball. The world was changing, and the Ajahs—ever so subtly—changing with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sisters’ resistance was attracting the attention of more Sharan channelers. \"We’ll have to abandon this position soon\", Raechin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeane only nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those Sharans . . \" the Red growled. \"Look at that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeane gasped. Many of the Sharan troops in this quarter had withdrawn earlier in the fight—something seemed to have drawn them away—but the channelers had replaced them with a large group of frightened-looking people and were herding them at the front of their line to absorb attacks. Many carried sticks or tools of some sort for fighting, but they bunched together, holding the weapons timidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood and bloody ashes\", Raechin said, causing Leane to raise an eyebrow at her. She continued weaving, trying to send lightning down behind the lines of the frightened people. It still hit many of them. Leane felt sick, but joined in the attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they worked, Manda Wan crawled up to them. Soot-stained and blackened, the Green looked horrible. Probably much as I do, Leane thought, glancing down at her own scratched and sooty arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re pulling back\", Manda said. \"Maybe we’ll have to use gateways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And go where?\" Leane said. \"Abandon the battle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three grew silent. No. There was no retreat from this fight. It was win here or nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are too fragmented\", Manda said. \"We must at least fall back to regroup. We need to bring the women together, and this is the only thing I can think of. Unless you have a better idea\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManda looked to Raechin. Leane was too weak in the power now for her opinion to hold much weight. She started cutting down weaves as the two continued to speak in hushed tones. The Aes Sedai nearby began pulling back out of the hollow and moving back down the slope. They’d regroup, make a gateway toward Dashar Knob and decide what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. What was that? Leane sensed powerful channeling nearby. Had the Sharans created a circle? She squinted; they were well into night now, but enough of the landscape burned to give firelight. It also raised a lot of smoke. Leane wove Air to blow the smoke out of the way, but it lifted on its own, split as if by a powerful wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene al’Vere strode past them up the slope, glowing with the power of a hundred bonfires. That was more than Leane had ever seen a woman hold. The Amyrlin walked forward with her hand thrust out, holding a white rod. Egwene’s eyes seemed to shine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a burst of light and force, Egwene released a dozen separate flows of fire. A dozen. They battered the hillside above, throwing the bodies of Sharan channelers into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Manda\", Leane said, \"I think we have found you a better rallying point\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes lit a twig off the lantern, then used it to light his pipe. He took one puff before hacking and emptying the pipe’s bowl on the rock floor. The tabac had gone bad somehow. Horribly bad. He coughed and ground the offending tabac into the floor with his heel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all right, my Lord?\" Melten asked, walking past, idly juggling a pair of hammers with his \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-260.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
