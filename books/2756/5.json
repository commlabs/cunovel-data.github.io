The handshake was weirdly comfortable and formal all at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Everyone will tell you that I‘m just being nice because I‘m running for student council,‖ David said. ―They‘re partly right.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―About the student council part, or the being nice part?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Oh, I‘m running. Looks good on the résumé. If you haven‘t gotten that speech from your advisor yet, you will. Do you know who that is?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―I‘m too busy trying to find my way around.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tardy bell rang. David dropped his voice to a whisper, ―Well, if you need any help or don‘t understand something, just ask, okay?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Sure.‖ I gave my perkiest you bet grin and faced forward. But, to tell you the truth, Bob, I was a little pissed off, too. Like, did I look as if I needed the help?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just like the ward. I inched a little lower in my seat. Don’t shout, don’t make a fuss, smile at the doctor and we’ll all be just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first day of all classes is virtually the same, regardless of the school. Trig was no different. Fish Eyes finished calling attendance and then got a couple students to hand out textbooks. We spent the next twenty minutes going through the books, looking for stray marks, and noting where other students had scribbled in answers. Then, in the fifteen minutes that were left, Fish Eyes snorted and snuffled his way through the first chapter, all of it review, and assigned homework—―Even problems, one through sixty‖—with maybe thirty seconds to spare before the bell shrilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you, GAWD. I gathered up my books as everyone else started jabbering like caged parakeets. All the noise was the perfect cover, though. I figured to just slip in behind those three girls and glide on out—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid slid in at my elbow. ―What do you have next?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Ah.‖ I had to think about it a sec. ―Honors English.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Oh, you‘ll like Dewerman.‖ He grinned. ―He‘s really—‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Ms. Lord,‖ Fish Eyes called just as we got to the door. ―A moment, please.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI braked so quickly that David nearly tripped over my feet. ―Sorry,‖ I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―It‘s okay,‖ he said. ―You want me to wait?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Ah . . .‖ Everyone else was spilling around us, some tossing curious glances and others smirking: Yeah, sucks to be you. To be honest, David was getting on my nerves. I wasn‘t a lost puppy, for God‘s sake, just the crazy new kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―No, I‘m good, thanks,‖ I said. David opened his mouth to say something else, but I was already doing a quick about-face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―David, if you‘ll close the door on your way out?‖ Fish Eyes called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Sure,‖ David said. ―See you, Jenna.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Yeah,‖ I said but didn‘t look around. I heard the door snick shut. The room was dead quiet except for the shush of my slides over linoleum as I walked back to Fish Eyes‘s desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Yes, sir?‖ I wasn‘t sure if I ought to say sir, but I blanked on the guy‘s name and Fish Eyes would probably be a mistake. ―Is there a problem? Did I do something wrong?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Wrong? Oh, no, no.‖ Fish Eyes tugged off his glasses and dragged a cloth from his front pocket. Without his specs, his eyes dwindled to lead pellets. ―I just wanted to let you know how delighted we all are that you‘re here, Jenna. . . . May I call you Jenna? Good. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‘ve, uh, had the opportunity to look at your record—your placement exams and those you took while you were homeschooled—and they are impressive, most impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParticularly.‖ He hawed on one lens and rubbed with the cloth. ―Particularly given your, ah, peculiar circumstances.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said nothing. I could feel the heat rising up my neck and splashing over my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God, was it going to be like this with every teacher? No, wait, that wasn‘t fair. Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnderson hadn‘t treated me like a freak. Yet. Maybe he just hadn‘t placed the name with the diagnosis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―We, uh, know that you‘ve had quite the, ah, struggle,‖ Fish Eyes said. ―A very bad, very tough time of it. I want you to know how sorry I am about—‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Thanks.‖ In five seconds, my twitching skin would rip itself from my bones and go screaming down the hall. All I wanted was to run run run and find someplace to cut in peace. ―I should go,‖ I said, flashing a bright, chipper little grin. ―Wouldn‘t want to be late my first day.‖ Which was true enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―No, of course not.‖ Fish Eyes slipped on his glasses. ―I just want you to know that if you, ah, need anything, any special help, just want to talk maybe . . .‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Thanks,‖ I said, edging away, grinning my frozen little rictus of a grin. ―Thanks a lot.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn‘t exactly run, not like I had from Mr. Anderson. Oh, I wanted to, but my eyes stung and I would probably have bashed into a wall. And, anyway, running was just too pathetic. But I was still moving pretty fast and so, of course, as I burst through the door and into the general swirl, I didn‘t look where I was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBam!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plowed right into David Melman so hard that even he staggered. My notebooks, bright M\u0026amp;M colors, fluttered like broken-winged kites. My trig textbook promptly got turned into a hacky sack by assorted legs and feet before some kid scooped it up on the fly and backhanded it to David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Whoa, you okay? Here, let me.‖ David stooped just as I bent to pick up my notebooks and we banged heads. My vision sheeted white. This time, both our trig books went to ground. ―Jeez.‖ David put a hand to his forehead. ―Are you all right?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―I‘m fine,‖ I said for what must be the millionth time that day. How many hours had I been at this already? I could feel a knot beginning right above my left eyebrow. Great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I‘d look like a rhino. ―Are you okay?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Yeah.‖ David started piling notebooks into my arms. ―I just hung around in case you needed, you know, help getting to your next class.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―No, I‘m good,‖ I said, as the second bell rang. ―But I‘ve got to go. See you, okay?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Wait.‖ David grabbed my elbow. ―You won‘t get there in time if you go that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, we‘ll take a shortcut through the cafeteria.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, I didn‘t argue. We pretty much jogged down the stairs and into the lunchroom, which already had a sprinkling of kids in small knots, drinking coffee and munching doughnuts. Someone shouted at David, but he waved them off and then we were blasting out of the lunchroom and into a side corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Okay,‖ David said. He was panting a little, and his dark hair was mussed. ―You go all the way down the hall, last door on your left. I have to go upstairs now, but I‘ll be back in time to take you to your third period class. And we‘ve got the same lunch. Sit with me and I‘ll introduce you around.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―I don‘t need an escort,‖ I said as he started for a narrow stairwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Yes, you do,‖ he said over his shoulder. ―You just don‘t know it yet.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7: a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonors English, second period: I blew through the door after the tardy bell. Of course, the only seats left were in front. I scuttled into one closest to the wall. Everyone ignored me, which was fine. The teacher, Dewerman, was nowhere in sight. Most everyone was chatting with someone else except for one girl two rows back who didn‘t look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was pretty in a sporty kind of way, with a long blonde ponytail, good skin, and preppy clothes, the kind of girl who might be either a cheerleader or captain of the soccer team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my eyes skipped over her, she turned to whisper something to another girl, who shot a glance, made a face, giggled, and whispered something back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away. A survival tactic I learned on the psych ward was how to quickly size up potential enemies or garden-variety badasses. Ponytail did not like me, that was clear. Fine. You don’t bother me, I won’t bother you. But I wondered what I‘d done to tick her off. Unless she disliked new kids on general principle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze skimmed the walls. Dewerman liked posters, the ones with celebs urging you to read, and art reproductions: Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Picasso. Behind his desk and snugged along the wall to my left were three bookcases crammed with hardcovers and paperbacks, arranged alphabetically. My eyes ran over the spines—and then the title of a very familiar book hooked my gaze like the business end of a steel barb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit. My stomach bottomed out. My eyes cut away, but the title was burned onto my retinas the way the sun scorched if you looked too long. Relax; he doesn’t know; no one here does; just let it slide. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Welcome back, boys and girls!‖ Dewerman barreled in, an enormous mug clutched in one paw. My God, Bob, every single adult in this place was this major addict. Dewerman was this bearded 1960s throwback: a Teletubby in tie-dye, suspenders, and thinning hair scraped back into a stringy gray rat. ―All right, let‘s roll.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did the attendance drill. Ponytail was Danielle Connolly, which fit. I gave my prepared Hi-I’m-Jenna spiel and was about to sit back down when Dewerman shot me a curious look. ―Your mother owns a bookstore? Is it MacAllister‘s?‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Uh.‖ Why had I mentioned the store to begin with? I knew he had the book. It was like I was daring him to put two and two together. I could‘ve lied. Maybe I should‘ve. But, instead, I said, ―Yeah.‖\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e―Well, I‘ll be damned.‖ Dewerman bustled over to the bookshelf, fingered out the paperback I‘d recognized and held it up. It was one of the reissues because THE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCOMPLETE UNEXPURGATED EDITION OF THE SHATTERING NOVEL screamed from the cover. Because, of course, Dewerman was a fanboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little sidebar, Bob, because you don‘t look like the bookish type. That‘s not a slam, it‘s just . . . well, it‘s probably a fact. If I were directing the movie of your life, I figure you must‘ve been a star athlete in high school, probably football. Ten to one, you were angling for a scholarship, only you messed up your knees or back, and that‘s why you became a cop. Only I bet you got bored or sick of standing by while EMTs scraped people you knew—friends, old drinking buddies, maybe a girlfriend— off the pavement. Maybe you cut one too many people out of crushed cars. You had to think that, hell, making detective‘s got to be better. Break-ins, assaults, drug deals, but not a lot of bodies. You had to think that there just aren‘t many homicides this far north. Maybe one or two a year, tops. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/drowning-instinct/page-5.html","bookId":2756,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:34 PM"}
