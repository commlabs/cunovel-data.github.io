{"id":42803,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV SIX FEROCIOUS BEARS","content":"“And now,” said Jeanne, as she returned from dancing the sun up, “tell me another story.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the old man looked at her a droll smile played over his wrinkled face. “I don’t think you believe my stories,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, yes, I do!” she protested vigorously. “At—at least, almost.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, then—” He placed his feet on the ground, then prodded the sod with his cane. “Once I was in the Catskill Mountains—or was it the Cascades? I disremember.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The mountains don’t matter,” the girl laughed. “I can’t ever remember names. But mountains. There are always bears in mountains.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 33\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The little French girl’s look suddenly went very sober. She seemed ready to burst into tears. Little wonder, for only one short month before she had buried her pet and pal, Tico the bear. Tico had shared her joys and sorrows for many a year. With him as her dancing partner, she had achieved notable success. Now he was gone. So, too, it seemed, were her chances of ever dancing on the stage again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He’s gone,” she thought with a sigh, “My pal.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tico’s illness had cost her much money. He had been given all the care of a gentleman of importance, and had been buried in a formal manner. Now the little French girl was poor, and Tico was gone forever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Bears,” she repeated, pulling herself together, “bears in the mountains. Wild bears. Not tame ones.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, wild bears!” the old man said as if taking his cue. “Six ferocious wild bears. I met them all in the Alleghenys—or was it the Rockies?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The Cumberlands,” laughed Jeanne.\n\u003cbr\u003e 34\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, that’s it, the Cumberlands. Six wild, hungry, man eating bears. They formed a circle about me and sat there on their haunches with their tongues lolling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They were ready to eat me. And what did I do?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What did you do?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I danced and made faces. I can dance; not like fairies. But I can dance and make faces. Want to see me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jeanne nodded her head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Springing from his place on the bench, the old man began to dance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And now it was the girl’s turn to open her eyes wide in surprise. This old man was an artist. True, he did not dance as lightly as she. But he knew steps and movements. He had not been on his feet for five minutes when she realized that he could teach her much about her own beloved art.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the joy of dancing he forgot the terrible faces he was to make.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At last, quite out of breath, he threw himself down beside her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’ve been on the stage,” she said solemnly.\n\u003cbr\u003e 35\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why, so I have. All my life.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She put out a small hand. “I, too.” Her voice was mellow with emotion. “I am Petite Jeanne.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Petite Jeanne! I should have guessed it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And you?” Jeanne still held his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Plain Dan Baker. A ham actor. You never heard of me. And never will. They won’t let me hoof it in the sticks any more.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am not sure of that,” Jeanne’s face was sober. “Once to every man and nation. Your time may come.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But the bears?” She whirled about. “What of the six ferocious bears?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As she turned she saw with a start that a second man, a young man with dark skin and very black eyes, had dropped to the bench on the other side of Dan Baker.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did Dan Baker know this? Was he acquainted with this young man? If so, he made no sign but went straight on with his story.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, yes, the bears!” He chuckled. “There they were, six bears, brown bears; no, grizzlies. There they were ready to eat me.\n\u003cbr\u003e 36\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What did I do? I began dancing and making faces. A bear’s got a sense of humor; oh, yes, a very keen sense of humor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No time at all till I had ’em; had ’em good. Most appreciative audience you ever saw.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Then, still dancing, I began chucking them hard under their chins, cracking their teeth on their tongues. See!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No time at all and their tongues were so sore they couldn’t swallow. So why try to eat me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s the way they looked at it. Soon as the show was over they left; went right off into the mountains; all but one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And that one, the biggest one of all, meant to eat me, sore tongue or no tongue at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “With a ferocious growl, tongue out, teeth shining, he came right at me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What did I do? What could I do? Just one thing. An inspiration! I sprang at him, seized his tongue, crammed it down his throat and choked him to death!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Killed him,” said a voice over his shoulder. It was the strange young man.\n\u003cbr\u003e 37\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Didn’t he bite you?” asked Petite Jeanne.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Bite me? Oh, yes, to be sure. But then, what’s a little bite between friends?” Once more that deep, dry chuckle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Angelo!” he exclaimed. “This is Petite Jeanne. She dances, you know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “She does! I saw her. It was divine!” The youth’s eyes shone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jeanne flushed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You see,” said Dan Baker to Jeanne, “Angelo, here, tries to write plays. I try to be a ham actor. You try to dance on the stage. They won’t let any one of us do what we wish to do, so we should get on famously together.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We are all going to be rich,” Jeanne said cheerfully. “For this is my luckee day!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We shall be rich, indeed!” exclaimed the young Italian, springing to his feet. “This very moment I have a bright idea. I shall write a play around you two. You shall act it, and we’ll be made.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But come! I still have the price of coffee and rolls for three. It is time for that now. Let’s go.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1913/55010.html","bookId":914,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:17:33 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:17:33 AM"}
