He sat there listening to the person on the other line without speaking. The more they talked the whiter he got. My heart was racing. Something terrible had happened. I kept waiting for him to say something. Anything. But he didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way,\" he said in a flat voice before dropping his phone to his lap and moving his hand from my grasp to grip the steering wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong, Rush?\" I asked more scared now than I had been while he was on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go inside the house, Blaire. I have to go. Nan\u0027s been in an accident. Some damn sailboat.\" He closed his eyes tightly and muttered a curse. \"I just need you to get out of the car and go inside. I\u0027ll call you when I can but I have to go, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she hurt? Can\u0027t I go with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NO!\" he roared, still looking straight ahead. \"You can\u0027t go with me. Why would you even ask that? My sister is in ICU and unresponsive. I need to go to her and I need you to get out of the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was hurting and scared. I understood that. But I wanted to be there for him. I loved him and I didn\u0027t want him hurting alone. \"Rush, please let me go with you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"GET OUT OF THE CAR!\" he yelled so loudly my ears stung. I fumbled for the door handle and grabbed my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe revved the engine and continued to stare straight ahead while his knuckles turned as white as his face from gripping the steering wheel so tightly. I wanted to say more but he was so upset I was scared of what he would do. He didn\u0027t want to hear me speak nor did he want to look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to cry in front of him. That wasn\u0027t what he needed right now. I got out of the car as quickly as I could. Before I could get the door fully closed he threw the car in reverse and spun out of the drive. I just stood there and watched as he drove away. I couldn\u0027t help him. I wasn\u0027t wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears ran down my face freely now. He was hurting. My heart broke for him. Once he got there and saw her he would call me. I had to believe that. I wanted to call him and make him talk to me but my ears still rang and my heart still hurt from his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally turned to look back at the house. It was large, sprawling and dark. Nothing was welcoming about it without Rush. I didn\u0027t want to stay here alone but I didn\u0027t have a car to drive to Bethy\u0027s either. I shouldn\u0027t have moved from Bethy\u0027s. It had been too soon. Everything with Rush had moved so fast. Now, it was all about to be tested. I wasn\u0027t sure I was ready for that test. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling Bethy and telling her I needed a ride to work and that Rush had left wasn\u0027t something I was up for tonight. She would find something wrong with this and make me feel even worse. I understood Rush\u0027s fear and the way he reacted and left but Bethy wouldn\u0027t. At least I didn\u0027t think she would. Rush had won some points in his favor when he put the ring on my finger in her eyes and I wanted to keep it that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my purse to get out the keys when I realized I hadn\u0027t brought them. Rush had taken me to work. I hadn\u0027t thought I needed them. Looking back up at the dark house I was almost relieved I wouldn\u0027t have to be staying there alone tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe club was only three miles from here. I could walk that. Then Bethy\u0027s was just a short walk from the club. The evening breeze had cooled things down and it wasn\u0027t so bad. I slipped my purse back over my shoulder and started walking down the brick paved driveway toward the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took about an hour and fifteen minutes to get to Bethy\u0027s. Her car wasn\u0027t in the parking lot. There was a good chance she was staying with Jace tonight. I guess I should have thought about that. I stopped and looked at the door to the condo. I didn\u0027t have the energy to walk back. My stubbornness not to call for a ride was biting me in the butt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bent down and lifted the mat. There on the cement slab was the spare key. She must have put it back out after I moved. She\u0027d only stopped hiding it there because I had asked her to. Tonight it came in extremely handy. I doubted she was coming home until tomorrow anyway. I didn\u0027t have to tell her about all this tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carried the key inside with me and then headed back to my bathroom to take a shower. Rush had insisted she keep the bed he\u0027d bought in the second bedroom instead of taking it when I moved out. Something else I could be thankful for tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to get to work without Bethy ever knowing I\u0027d needed to crash at her place last night. It wasn\u0027t that I thought she\u0027d care but I wasn\u0027t ready to answer her questions or hear her opinions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter changing into a clean uniform from the supply room I made my way to the kitchen. Just before I reached the door Woods stepped out and leveled his gaze on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was looking for you,\" he said and nodded his head toward the hallway that led to his office. \"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe more than likely knew about Nan. I was sure everyone in their circle did by now. Was he going to ask me about her? I really hoped he wasn\u0027t. Admitting that I knew nothing made me sound like I didn\u0027t care. Did Rush think I didn\u0027t care? Was it my responsibility to call him? He was the one hurting. His reaction last night had scared me but if he needed me I had to get over that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you sleep at all?\" Woods asked looking back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I hadn\u0027t really slept well but I had gotten some sleep. The three-mile walk had helped exhaust me to the point that I couldn\u0027t keep my eyes open once I lay down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods opened his door and held it so I could go inside. I went in and walked over to stand beside the chairs across from his desk. He stood in front of his desk and sat on the edge of it while crossing his arms over his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frown wrinkled his forehead as he studied me. I was beginning to wonder if this was about something else. I\u0027d thought it was about Nan but maybe it wasn\u0027t. Had I done something wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a call from Grant this morning. He\u0027s at the hospital and he\u0027s worried about you. He said Rush showed up in the middle of the night and was in a rage. Seeing as how for the first time in their life Nan and Rush aren\u0027t on speaking terms and now she is in this condition, Rush isn\u0027t taking it well. Grant was concerned as to how he left you and if you were okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart hurt. I hated to know Rush was in so much pain and there was nothing I could do. He wasn\u0027t calling me and that only led me to believe he didn\u0027t want to talk to me. I was the reason for his rift with Nan. I was the reason he hadn\u0027t spoken to her in weeks. I was the reason he was going through this. Tears stung my eyes. As much as I didn\u0027t want to admit this, I was the reason this was even harder on Rush. If I hadn\u0027t caused their fight then he wouldn\u0027t be living with the guilt I knew he was swimming in right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was why Rush and I would never work. Pretending the fairy tale was real had been amazing. But it hadn\u0027t been real. We\u0027d been biding our time until the fact I didn\u0027t fit into his world sent it crumbling down. He needed his family right now. I wasn\u0027t his family. I wasn\u0027t even accepted by his family. How did I fit into this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I don\u0027t know what to do.\" I choked out, hating that Woods was going to see me cry. I didn\u0027t want him to see me cry. I didn\u0027t want anyone to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He loves you,\" Woods said gently. I wasn\u0027t even sure he believed those words. Not now. Maybe Rush had thought he loved me but how could he still love me? I\u0027d caused him to turn on Nan and now he might lose her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he?\" It was a question I needed to ask myself, not Woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027ve never seen him with anyone the way he is with you. Right now... the next few days or weeks however long this lasts it may not feel like it. But he does. I\u0027m not telling you this because of Rush. He\u0027s an ass and I owe him nothing. I\u0027m telling you this for you. It\u0027s the truth and I know you need to hear it right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. I didn\u0027t need to hear it. Thinking clearly and deciding what was best for me and my baby was what I needed to do. Could I bring a child into a family that might never accept it? If I never fit then how would my child?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you what to believe. But if you need anything, I\u0027m here. I know Rush has a garage full of cars but if you don\u0027t want to drive one then I can give you a ride to the doctor or the store. Just call me if you need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy next doctor\u0027s appointment was in five days. How was I going to get into the house? And he\u0027d never shown me where the keys to his cars were or given me permission to drive them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m locked out of the house. He thought I had my key when he left,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you stay last night?\" he asked dropping his hands from his chest and standing up. He looked angry. I hadn\u0027t meant to make him mad. I was just stating a problem I had. All my clothes were in Rush\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bethy\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I walked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit! Blaire, that is three and a half miles at least. It was dark last night when Rush left. You have a phone now, use it.\" He was yelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to walk. I needed to walk. Don\u0027t yell at me,\" I raised my voice and glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tension in Woods\u0027 shoulders left and he sighed. \"I\u0027m sorry. I shouldn\u0027t have talked to you like that. It\u0027s just that you\u0027re so damn determined to be independent. Let me make myself clear. Call me if you ever need a ride. I like to think we\u0027re friends. I help my friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed friends. \"I like to think we\u0027re friends too,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Good. But as your boss I\u0027m not letting you work today. I\u0027ll have you in Rush\u0027s house within the hour. I\u0027ll drive you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could ask him how he had his phone to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got her in my office. She\u0027s locked out of the house.\" He paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No shit. She walked to Bethy\u0027s last night. I\u0027m going to take her there if you can get Rush\u0027s housecleaner to go unlock the place.\" He paused again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. Happy to help. Keep me updated, I\u0027m thinking about y\u0027all.\" He hung up and looked at me. \"Grant\u0027s having the housecleaner open the house. You go get something to eat from the kitchen and then we can head that way. He said to give her about twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t hungry but I nodded. \"Okay.\" I started for the door then stopped and turned to look back at him. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods winked. \"My pleasure.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/never-too-far-too-far-2/page-37.html","bookId":1994,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:58 AM"}
