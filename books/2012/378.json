Already the losses were appalling – and she knew her own Evertine soldiers were suffering the same behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, these Perish … a part of her wanted to sink her teeth into the throat of the Grey Helms. For all that betrayal and treachery thrived in the court games of the Bolkando kingdom, out here it was a far deadlier indulgence. Maybe this is teaching me a lesson. About backstabbing, lying and cheating to get your way .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, try as I might, I can’t swing it across. The palace is my world and I’ll run it the way I like .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoofs thundering, she was fast closing on the Perish – the soldiers were smoothly forming up now that they’d cleared the fort, and she saw them wheeling to face her. ‘You want us first, do you? Spax will be so pleased!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn’t tactical – no, clearly they should have swung to face the Letherii. And as she drew yet closer, the front ranks before her made no effort to draw weapons. Can it be? Has Krughava won them over? Where is she? Where is Tanakalian? Errant’s nudge, who’s commanding this army?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal waved up the messenger. ‘Stay close, until we’re within earshot, and then halt yourself. I will ride on. Listen well to this parley, soldier – the lives of thousands may well count on it, should I fail to win clear.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman, selected for her riding ability, was pale beneath the rim of her helm, but she nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your eyes are better than mine – do you see a commander anywhere?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Highness, there is one – with the grey face. He has been gesturing – sending out orders. There,’ and she pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see him. What’s with the face paint?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’s a cutter, Highness. A field medic.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever . ‘No matter. Looks as if he’s the one wanting to talk – I don’t like this. What has happened to Krughava?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey slowed to a canter, and at the appropriate distance the messenger halted, whilst the queen trotted forward. She studied the cutter. An old man, at least in so far as these Grey Helms went. His face was well worn with tracks of sorrow and loss, and she saw nothing in that face to suggest that anything had changed in his outlook. Her unease deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cutter raised a hand in greeting. ‘Highness, the Grey Helms welcome you. I am Syndecan, elected commander following the tragic deaths of the Mortal Sword and the Shield Anvil.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal felt her jaws clench. The words had struck like a blow to her chest. Leave it, woman. Now is not the time . ‘You are arrayed. State your intentions, Syndecan – as you can see, we’ve got us a fight here and I really cannot waste any more time while you decide which way the fucking wind’s blowing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man recoiled as if slapped, and then he drew a deep breath and slowly straightened. ‘The Perish Grey Helms humbly place themselves under the command of you and Prince Brys.’ He made a faint gesture to the troops behind him. ‘We face you because we could not determine the whereabouts of the prince. Highness, the Pure Forkrul Assail was injured in a clash with our Destriant. It is safe to assume, however, that he will recover. And when that happens … we anticipate an awakening of dire sorcery.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can you defend against it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man shook his head. ‘I fear not, Highness. We have lost our place as the weapon of the wolf gods. You see us as we are – simple soldiers seeking to regain our honour as men and women. That and nothing more.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As soon as that Pure is made aware of the attack on the Spire, he will disengage as many soldiers as he feels he can spare.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We understand this, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are your soldiers rested, Syndecan? Can you fast-trot down this valley, and find an undefended ascent?’ She made her voice louder, addressing the soldiers waiting behind the cutter. ‘Grey Helms! Can you stand in the path of the Kolansii who will soon drive east to the Spire?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer the soldiers shipped their shields on to their backs, began tightening straps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal grunted. Who needs words?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSyndecan spoke. ‘Do you require that we delay the enemy, or stop them in their tracks?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are not enough of you to stop them, Commander, and you know it. If I can, I will spare you my Barghast, and the Teblor – but they may be arriving late to the fight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We shall hold until they arrive, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbrastal hesitated, and then called, ‘What I’ve seen of you thus far, Perish, has been sticks up the ass and plenty of proper marching and not much else. Well, now’s your chance to show the world what you can do in a real fight.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-378.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
