Everyone would transfer the points and rewards to him at the initiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The leader has the responsibility to protect the privacy of his team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t wrong but Zheng felt strange that this came out of Xuan. He stood there and pondered for quite a while, yet he couldn\u0027t figure out what Xuan was planning. If it wasn\u0027t because Xuan remained normally calm instead of having any sort of smile, Zheng would have believed he was scheming on something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, everyone nodded in agreement and Zheng had to take on this responsibility to revive the three people. This was the best decision in terms of privacy after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first person to revive is Zhao Yinkong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the notification on revival was announced, images appeared in Zheng\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a dark alley. A petite girl was fighting a man who seemed cold yet had a smile on his face. Their speed was beyond what the human eyes could capture. Every step, every movement, every dodge, and attack was almost a perfection. Just a little mistake and they would kill the other person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilling intent filled the girl\u0027s eyes. Zheng had never seen her like this. Even when he fought her previously, her eyes remained calm as ice. That was the heart of an assassin, a mind that was always emotionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, she looked like had lost herself to her inner devil. Her wrath erupted as she looked at this handsome man. She wanted to kill her, even if that was at the cost of her own life. This was the first time she showed herself like this, at least it was for Zheng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the fight reached its peak, the man suddenly turned around and ran along the alley. The girl couldn\u0027t let him get away and sprinted after him. She ran at a speed approaching Zheng\u0027s Destruction. Yet, at the turn of the corner, a steel wire cut off that beautiful head of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng had closed his eyes when he saw this but the images still streamed into his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was silent mansion on the hill. A man was holding on the hand of a two or three year old girl as they walked through the front passage of the mansion. The girl cheered when the man brought out an apple and handed it to her. Yet, before she could take a bite on the apple, he slapped her on the face harshly. Her face turned swollen but she didn\u0027t cry. She quietly wiped what little of tears was on the corner of her eyes then bit at the apple, swallowing it along with the blood in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl grew up. She was about five to six years old and came to a new environment with kids around her age. Everyone carried a little bag. Inside the bag was a bottle of drinkable water and several pieces of tough bread. The girl had her bread and water and conserving the food in the bag. When the other kids came to seize her food, she easily knocked them down and took their food. She gave herself a full meal then continued eating her own food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer childhood was spent such combat and hunger. It wasn\u0027t all enemies that she met. She had comrades and friends that she trusted. Life was difficult but she would show that long forgotten smile and serenity when they fought together and chatted together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil that man, smiling yet had eyes that were cold as a blade, he protected her and took care of her the whole time. She always had an indescribable feeling for him until that nightmare. This brother who had protected her killed all her friends. He buried her childhood into memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng quietly watched Yinkong opened her eyes. There was still wrath flowing through her eyes like lava. A few seconds later, she closed her eyes without a word then dropped down on the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I died?\" Yinkong lay there for several seconds then got up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corner of her eyes still seemed wet but she had returned to her normal indifferent expression. It was like her wrath never existed. However, Zheng knew the wrath didn\u0027t disappear. She buried them deep within her. The wrath would consume her enemies and her the next time they were unleashed, just like her last fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng held Yinkong in his arms then said by her eyes. \"It\u0027s okay. We will start from the beginning. You will win the next time you meet him! And we are your comrades right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYinkong looked at Zheng with surprise. It was just a blink of an eye for her but she could feel a change happened to Zheng. Though she couldn\u0027t tell what kind of change it was. She pushed Zheng away and nodded. Then she walked to the other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan walked to Yinkong and embraced her. She lowered her head to comfort Yinkong then glanced at Zheng harshly, as if to criticize his vulgar act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng also knew that was rather abrupt. He gave an awkward laugh then continued with the revival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also put the words he said to Yinkong into his heart. \"Yes. We will start from the beginning. We will win the next time we meet him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Revive Zhang Heng!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill inside that same dark alley. Heng was facing a girl with his bow in hand. The strange thing was his expression was full of pain, and tears were flowing down the girl\u0027s face. They both released their arrows but even a layman like Zheng could tell they were not trying. It wasn\u0027t even that, they didn\u0027t once shot at the other\u0027s fatal spots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one that couldn\u0027t stand the fight was Heng. He seemed to have made a determined decision and headed through an alley after he made the next shot. The girl\u0027s attention slipped for a moment and let him got away from her sight. She immediately chased after Heng with her wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng stopped by a main road. He watched as the girl flew close then suddenly drew his bow. He aimed the arrow at her head with a serious look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled with relief and aimed her arrow at Heng\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both let go of their arrows. Heng\u0027s arrow grazed past her body. Zheng could see the arrow penetrated a building from far away. There was seemingly a figure on top of that building. However, Heng\u0027s heart had become empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the side of two small houses, a boy and a girl played together cheerfully. They held each others\u0027 hands with laughters. They were only several years old but the fondness between them was apparent. Perhaps this was what people called childhood sweethearts, people who would keep walking down the path of life holding hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe days lasted until a traffic accident. The boy\u0027s mother died and his father\u0027s arm suffered comminuted fracture, losing the ability to hold a bow for the rest of his life while his career was an archer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe depression, lost of hope, and the lost of his love and mental support caused the father to become increasingly abusive. He would abuse the boy when he felt the slightest bit annoyed. The boy became weaker and weaker from suffering the long term beatings. He would cower away as soon as anyone showed signs of wanting to hit him. He knew he could act back, he could resist, but having suppressed himself for so long had taken away his courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy and girl had separated for many years until they grew up to adults. He started working. His father had passed away. And he finally met his beloved again. Even the heavens seemed to pity his childhood and wished to give happiness to his future. If he could seize that happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t. When his car broke down and they encountered hooligans, when the hooligans mentioned the word kill, his fear erupted. He ran, leaving her, the one he would love forever behind in that darkness. He tore apart their happiness with his own hands!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng opened his eyes. His face was filled with tears. He didn\u0027t seem to notice he had revived until Zheng punched him hard on the face. Heng flew off five meters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coward, you still have a chance! Come with us and seize back your chance!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-15-chapter-2-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-15-chapter-2-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-15-chapter-2-02","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
