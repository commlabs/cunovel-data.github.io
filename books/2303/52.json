Even with the door closed, she could smell their blood, hear the beating of their hearts. \"Will they be able to tell that I\u0027ve changed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik shook his head. \"Not unless you tell them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had kept in touch with Alex and her parents. Her mom and dad were still mourning Brandon, of course. To Daisy\u0027s surprise, her mother had informed her that Alex was spending a lot of time with Paula O\u0027Reilly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s in love with her,\" Irene had remarked during one conversation. \"Perhaps it was inevitable. They started out comforting each other and, well, it looks like Paula might eventually be a part of the family after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy was summoning the nerve to knock on the door when she heard footsteps behind her. She didn\u0027t have to turn around to know that Alex was coming up the walk, and that he wasn\u0027t alone. Paula was with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, sis!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, she turned to face him. \"Hi, Alex. Paula.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded at Erik, then threw his arms around Daisy and gave her a quick hug. \"I didn\u0027t know you were coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was kind of spur of the moment,\" Daisy said. \"Paula, I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve met Erik.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik extended his hand. \"Pleased to meet you, Paula.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likewise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnoyed with the amenities, Alex opened the door and ushered everyone inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few minutes were spent on introductions as Erik met Daisy\u0027s parents. Even though Daisy knew her mother and father were uncomfortable with having a vampire in the house, they handled his presence better than she had expected. Her mother invited Erik to sit down and soon they were all seated in the living room, with Erik and Daisy on the love seat, Alex, Paula, and Irene on the sofa, and Noah in his favorite chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, daughter, how was your trip?\" Noah asked. \"Did you fly or drive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy slid a glance at Erik. \"We flew.\" In a manner of speaking, she thought, smiling inwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you get here from the airport?\" Alex asked. \"I didn\u0027t see a rental out front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We took a taxi,\" Daisy said. She didn\u0027t like lying to her family, but the truth was out of the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, no need for a car,\" Noah said, \"since you\u0027ll be staying here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Dad, but we\u0027re staying at a hotel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, you know I won\u0027t hear of that,\" Irene said, her hands fluttering. \"You can stay in your old room and Erik can...can...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik can stay in Brandon\u0027s room,\" Noah finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Dad, but we\u0027ve already made reservations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well, if that\u0027s what you want,\" Irene murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy didn\u0027t miss the look of relief in her mother\u0027s eyes when she realized Erik wouldn\u0027t be staying the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Irene said briskly, \"where are my manners? Can I get you all anything? I made a devil\u0027s food cake this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good, Mom,\" Alex said with a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None for me, thank you,\" Erik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, either,\" Daisy said. \"We ate just before we got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Daisy,\" Irene said, \"it\u0027s your favorite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Daisy said, smiling. \"Maybe later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have some of that cake,\" Noah said, \"with a little ice cream on the side. And a cup of coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me help you, Mrs. O\u0027Donnell,\" Paula said. Rising, she followed Irene into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem a little uptight, daughter,\" Noah remarked after Irene and Paula left the room. \"Is anything wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should anything be wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" He leaned forward in his chair, his eyes narrowed. \"You tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, Dad, just a little, ah, jet-lagged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy looked at Erik for reassurance. Should I just tell them the truth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s up to you, love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Daisy, spit it out,\" Alex said. \"You\u0027re hiding something.\" He sent a suspicious glance at Erik, and then swore softly. \"You didn\u0027t. Dammit, you bloodsucker, tell me you didn\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah looked at Alex, then at Daisy, and then at Erik. \"Didn\u0027t what?\" he asked, and then comprehension dawned in his eyes. \"Daisy, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t face the disappointment in her father\u0027s eyes, the disgust in Alex\u0027s. Sobbing, \"I knew this was a bad idea,\" she fled the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Erik started to follow, Alex stood and blocked his path. \"You filthy bloodsucker! How could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was her decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe that for a minute,\" Alex said, his voice tinged with bitterness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember Mariah? Well, she had a boyfriend. Damon wasn\u0027t very happy about what happened to his lady love. He attacked Daisy. My guess is that you would have been next. Of course, that\u0027s neither here nor there. Daisy was dying when I found her. I gave her a choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Noah O\u0027Donnell gained his feet and took a menacing step toward Erik. \"She would never agree to that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik swore under his breath. Daisy had been right. Coming here had been a bad idea. Judging by the looks on the faces of Daisy\u0027s father and brother, things were about to get really ugly really fast. Unable to think of a safe way to defuse the situation, he was about to dissolve into mist when Daisy materialized beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik\u0027s telling the truth,\" she said, taking his hand in hers. \"It was my idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of breaking dishes rang out from the kitchen. Before anyone could go see what had happened, Irene appeared in the doorway. Tears cascaded down her cheeks as she murmured, \"Oh, Daisy, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Mom.\" Daisy tugged on Erik\u0027s hand. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Hurrying across the room, Irene O\u0027Donnell threw her arms around her daughter. \"I don\u0027t care what you are. All that matters is that you\u0027re still here, with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Irene--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned on her husband like a mother grizzly defending her young. \"Hush up, Noah Patrick O\u0027Donnell. Would you rather she was gone forever, like Brandon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoulders sagging, Noah shook his head. \"No.\" Head bowed, he took several deep breaths and then, heaving a sigh, he straightened his shoulders and offered Erik his hand. \"Welcome to the family. Son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith tears in her eyes, Daisy threw her arms around her father. \"Thank you, Daddy,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex snorted softly, and then he, too, offered Erik his hand. \"Welcome to the family. Vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on the edge of the bed in their hotel room, Erik pulled Daisy onto his lap. \"I told you everything would be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right? Is that what you call all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, at least your old man didn\u0027t drive a stake through my heart,\" he said with a wry grin. \"Or yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll get used to the idea. Just give them a little time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange advice coming from you,\" Daisy retorted. \"You said you left your home and your family after you were turned, and never went back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not the same thing. I didn\u0027t have anybody to show me the ropes when I was turned. No one to tell me I didn\u0027t have to kill to survive. I didn\u0027t know anything about vampires, and there was no one with me when I woke up that first night, no one to tell me what to expect. All I had was a raging thirst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy nodded. He was right, of course. She didn\u0027t know what she would have done if Erik hadn\u0027t been there. He had made her transformation from mortal to vampire almost painless. He had even made a joke the first night he had taken her hunting, asking her what she was in the mood for, Italian, French, or Chinese. She hadn\u0027t been amused at the time, but she saw the humor in it now. What couldn\u0027t be changed must be accepted. And if you could do it with a smile, so much the better. And looking at Erik always made her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was watching her, his dark eyes filled with concern, and she loved him the more for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop worrying about me. I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re better than okay, darlin\u0027. You\u0027re perfect. And you know what else? I don\u0027t think we should let Alex and Paula beat us to the altar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage, Daisy Mae. I\u0027m asking you to marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at him. \"You want to marry me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I thought I did. But if you don\u0027t want to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I want to. Now, hush up and kiss me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStifling a laugh, he said, \"You sound just like your mother. Maybe we can have a double wedding. Rhys can be the best man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very thought made Daisy burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Daisy darlin\u0027, more than you\u0027ll ever know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarmth and affection flooded Daisy\u0027s heart and soul as she wrapped her arms around him. \"And I love you. Only you. All of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew what she wanted even before she did. Falling back on the bed, he finessed her clothes away, then drew her down on top of him, his hands sliding up and down her bare back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a lot of perks to being a vampire, Daisy mused when he kissed her. All of her physical senses were enhanced, which served to heighten her pleasure when they made love, so that every kiss, every touch, was experienced on a deeper, more sensual level. She slid her hands under Erik\u0027s shirt, loving the way his muscles bunched and quivered beneath her fingertips, the latent sense of power that radiated from him. But best of all, he never got tired, and neither did she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a heartfelt sigh, she surrendered to the sensual magic of Erik\u0027s touch, reveling in each tender kiss, each languid caress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn\u0027s first light was hours away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-kiss-everlasting-1/page-52.html","bookId":2303,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:09:32 PM"}
