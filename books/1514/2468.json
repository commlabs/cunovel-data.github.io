Fear was revealed on the faces of the previously merrily laughing group, while the smiles on their faces had finally disappeared. Originally, they had thought that with the two leaders bringing them to join Four Titans Palace, the latter would definitely lower themselves and try to welcome them. Yet, the scene before them now…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt seemed that Four Titans Palace did not feel that they must absolutely have the Zhou Yi duo join them like the latter had imagined.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Zhou Yi duo were also startled because of this sudden turn of events. Soon after, they lifted their heads to look at the two unfamiliar figures in the air and frowned slightly. Clearly, they did not know the identities of these two.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Big brother!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, just as fury was rising in their hearts, Little Flame’s joyous voice stunned them. Their eyes flashed, and only then did they look a this young skinny figure with surprise. Other than that rarely seen Lin Dong, there was no one else Commander Yan of Four Titans Palace would call big brother.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the air, Lin Dong smiled at Little Flame. After which, he landed on the ground.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Ha ha, brother Lin Dong, you have finally returned.” The Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio grinned and said after seeing Lin Dong. Their eyes involuntarily paused on the latter when they spoke. Although it had only been three months since they last met, they could feel that Lin Dong was very different from before for an inexplicable reason.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough Lin Dong’s fighting strength was already extremely overwhelming previously, his cultivation was merely that of the advance Profound Death stage. Unless he was in his battle mode, the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio would not detect any pressure from him. After all, they were genuine Samsara stage experts. Lin Dong was able to rely on his many techniques to raise his fighting strength, but a gap still existed between them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNow however, the vast and mighty ocean like Yuan Power within their bodies had become a little sluggish for some unknown reason when they looked at Lin Dong.

Soon after, he faintly laughed, “Samsara stage experts are indeed a great help, but if they aren’t suitable, it will instead cause the faction that we have built with great effort to be jeopardised.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFrom the looks of it, the Zhou Yi duo were clearly extremely proud individuals. Such people might be strong, but if no one suppressed them, they would only cause internal chaos within Four Titans Palace. At that time, this huge organisation that they had created with much difficulty would end up collapsing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong was also well aware that he must not give in when faced with such arrogant individuals. Otherwise, they would only take advantage and it will be even more difficult to suppress them in future.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLittle Flame nodded. He also understood this point. However, the Zhou Yi duo were indeed powerful. Within Four Titans Palace, even the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio would have difficulty obtaining a clear victory in a one on one fight. It was precisely because of this that trying to forcefully suppress the pride of these two was not an easy task.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Leave this to me.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong smiled as an indescribable expression flashed across his eyes. Amongst the five great leaders in the newly established Four Titans Palace, the individual strengths of both Little Flame and himself did not stand out. The reason he could suppress the Samsara stage Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio, was mainly because he possessed the identity of the Dragon tribe Punishment Elder and his shocking battle power.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough the Heaven Dragon Demon Commander trio appeared quite respectful, it was unavoidable that they would feel some unease deep within their hearts. The Demonic Beast World honored strength. Lin Dong’s advance Profound Death stage strength would ultimately cause them to feel some discomfort in their hearts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong had been well aware of this in the past. However, due to his strength having yet to reach the necessary level, he did not make any moves. Things were different now. With the advancement of his Mental Energy to the Symbol Grandmaster level, just his Mental Energy cultivation alone meant that ordinary Samsara stage experts would no longer be a match for him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was the best time to create a deterrence to those outside and within the faction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Ha ha, this must be brother Lin Dong right? We have long heard of your name.” The complexions of the Zhou Yi duo gradually recovered. They looked at Lin Dong, cupped their hands together and smilingly said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Those who come are guests. Please forgive us if there is anyway we have failed to take care of you. However, you should seek to understand the rules of my Four Titans Palace.” Lin Dong faintly smiled and said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That is only natural.” Zhou Yi nodded. His gaze quickly shifted as he said, “But we also hope brother Lin Dong can understand our difficulties. We have brought our subordinates here. If we fail to gain some kind of position, we will neither have the face to see them nor be able to account to them.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Why is someone who has been chased away by the Nine Phoenix tribe speaking about face? Isn’t that a little comical?” Little Marten coldly laughed. His laughter was filled with ridicule.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What did you say?!” The expressions of the Zhou Yi duo instantly changed upon hearing these words as they furiously roared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Are you deaf?

They were a little stunned as they looked at the bewitchingly handsome face of Little Marten, who wore the mocking smile of someone looking down on them. The words that were about to emerge from the Zhou Yi duo’s mouth were forcibly swallowed by them. They did not expect that this person in front of them was actually from the Celestial Demon Marten tribe...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Ha ha, please do not mind him. My second brother always has such a temper. He is the tribe leader successor of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe. Therefore, his character is a little bad.” Lin Dong smiled warmly. However, the words he said did not match his expression. Nevertheless, it was likely that the Zhou Yi duo understood his meaning.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Tribe leader successor?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe corners of Zhou Yi’s eyes twitched rapidly. He felt greatly shocked in his hearts. Both of them had been forced into such a miserable state after merely offending an elder within the Nine Phoenix tribe. This person in front of them was actually the tribe leader successor of the Celestial Demon Marten tribe? This position was many times higher than that of an elder. If they were to offend him, it was likely that they could forget about staying in this Demon Region.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This Four Titans Palace actually has such a relationship with the Celestial Demon Marten tribe?” Zhou Yi’s heart pounded. The arrogance originally present on his face had greatly diminished. Those subordinates behind him also shuddered.

He stared at the Zhou Yi duo, whose expressions were fluctuating, as he continued, “Of course, if you people do not feel any enmity towards those who have uprooted the faction that you established with much effort and chased you away like homeless strays, you can treat it as though I have not said anything.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe expressions of the Zhou Yi duo had become completely dark after Lin Dong’s words sounded.
