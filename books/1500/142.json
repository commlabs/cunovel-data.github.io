Su stopped to first assess his surrounding circumstances. This terrain was rather complex. Long cement elevated highways were collapsed to one side, and not far off, there were some small abandoned houses that were scattered about. Large, bizarre shaped trees grew everywhere.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s figure flashed behind a broken concrete pillar and gazed into the smoke and dust rolling in the distance. At this moment, the void world that had already gradually faded away became clear again. A wave of scarlet bloody mist rose, and then the void world disappeared.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt the very front were some loading trucks, and there were Roxland markings on the vehicles. The vehicle was packed with people, most of them soldiers, but a few researchers and engineering staff as well. Most of them seemed to be wounded. Despite the rugged terrain, the loading truck was moving frantically, as if its passengers were fleeing for their lives. The direction they came from was precisely Pendulum City.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu activated the tactical tablet to first send information back to the troops behind him. He informed them of his current position, as well as to prepare for battle and close in on his position. Then, Su bent his body down and quickly made his way through the ruins, silently taking note of various sniping locations along the way.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRoxland’s fleet quickly closed in. At the front of the fleet were three soldier transporting trucks, and at the escorted part behind them were two armed off-road vehicles. Li and Li Gaolei sat in the backseat of two different vehicles, aiming their heavy machine guns at the incoming road. The two individuals’ bodies were riddled with scars that were crudely bandaged.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Li Gaolei, Li!” Su jumped out from the place where he was hiding at and shouted loudly towards the fleet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe fleet slowly came to a stop, and then the off-road vehicles made a turn before heading towards Su. Before the vehicle even came to a full stop, Li already leapt over in a hurry. Jumping five or six meters should be an easy task for Li, but when she landed this time, her legs buckled and she almost fell in front of Su.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter being lifted up by Su, Li laughed in a somewhat unnatural manner and said, “I was too tired and never expected my legs to already give out.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEven though her face was pale, the worry and anger she was experiencing was already starting to fade. Li noticed that after seeing Su, she began to feel at ease, as if there was something she could rely on. However, this type of peacefulness really didn’t match her temperament.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu looked at Li who was covered in smoke and bloodstains, and then at Li Gaolei who hobbled over before asking, “What happened? Why did you all leave Pendulum City?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Who else would it be but those fellows from last time? Only, this time, they sent over even more people! Pendulum City is already theirs. Most of our men already died. God dammit! Hey, they might catch up soon, so shouldn’t we switch to a different place to talk about this?” Li asked.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Su saw the three loading trucks rammed with quite a few engineers and researchers, he tapped a few times on the electronic map in his hands and drew out a path of advance so that Li and Li Gaolei could first take those left from Pendulum City to the designated rest and reorganization point. He himself would stop the Blue Scorpion pursuers here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Just by yourself?” Li’s eyes widened and hurriedly said, “I know you’re strong, but no matter how skilled you are, a single person can’t defeat a hundred scorpions!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu laughed.

However, delaying them for a while is still possible.” While speaking, Su suddenly heard an extremely soft humming sound that sounded like the noise created by some type of engine. He immediately looked towards the source of the sound, and not far away, a small unmanned drone flew through the radiation cloud and headed in this direction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu dashed a few steps outwards and quickly grabbed the rifle from his back. While half squatting on the ground, the muzzle pointed at the unmanned drone in a slanted manner. A cross appeared in his green pupil, silently calculating the distance between himself and the unmanned plane. At this moment, towards this distance that was under two kilometers, he was already precise to a 1 meter deviation. This was a secret no one knew but himself.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe drone noticed the fleet that stopped alongside the road. After making a circle through the air, it whistled as it flew over. The one operating the drone had clearly received instructions from the investigation troop, so when the drone flew to roughly a meter from the stopped vehicles, it suddenly turned around, turning back towards the distance in an extremely agile manner.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, as soon as it turned, Su’s muzzle already released fire!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith a\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ebang\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e, the drone in the sky turned into a ball of flame. Ten kilometers outwards, an off-road vehicle that was currently speeding over suddenly came to an emergency stop, causing some of the people inside to fall over.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“1171!

The two sides were packed with numerous and densely packed display screens, as well as all types of switches.
