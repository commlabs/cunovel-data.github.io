I was hit in the head—accident—and I didn\u0027t know who I was. Please wait—just listen to me—You don\u0027t know, don\u0027t understand what it would do to them to have a scandal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have you in a dungeon before nightfall!\" she raged, flinging off Sheridan\u0027s hands. \"I\u0027ll have your precious earl exposed for the fool he is—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlackness rose up before Sheridan\u0027s eyes. Black on white. Headlines screaming. Scandal. Dungeons. \"This is England, and you aren\u0027t nobody, so the law will be on his side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave!\" she cried, her voice plaintive and demented and confused as she began backing toward the door. \"I won\u0027t come back. I won\u0027t cause trouble. Don\u0027t bring authorities. Scandal will kill them. Look at me—I\u0027m leaving.\" Sherry whirled and ran. She fled down the staircase, nearly knocking over a footman. A lump rose in her throat at the realization that Stephen was going to walk into this hall in an hour, thinking he was about to be wed, only his bride would have deserted him. Her heart hammering, she raced into the library, scribbled a note, and thrust it at the stricken elderly butler, then she tore open the door, and raced down the steps, down the street, around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran and ran until she couldn\u0027t run anymore, and then she leaned against the side of a building, listening to a voice of her more recent past—a beloved voice—a beloved voice explaining things that had never happened to a woman he\u0027d never met: \"The last time we were together in America, we quarrelled. I didn\u0027t think about our quarrel while you were ill, but when you began to recover the other night, I found it was still on my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did we quarrel about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you paid too much notice to another man. I was jealous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaggered by yet another shock, Sherry stared blindly at a passing carriage as she wandered slowly down the street. But he hadn\u0027t been jealous. His attitude had hardened from the moment she\u0027d asked him if they were \"very much in love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause they\u0027d never been in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind went numb with confusion and shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen grinned at Colfax as he strode into the main hall, dressed formally for his wedding. \"Is the vicar here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my lord, in the blue salon,\" the butler said, his expression oddly withdrawn for such a festive occasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is my brother with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s in the drawing room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCognizant of the fact that he was not supposed to see his bride before the ceremony, Stephen said, \"Is it safe to go in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfectly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen walked swiftly down the main hall into the drawing room. Clayton was standing with his back to the room, looking into the empty fireplace. \"I\u0027m early,\" Stephen began. \"Mother and Whitney are a few minutes behind me. Have you seen Sherry? Does she need any—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClayton slowly turned around, his expression so foreboding that Stephen stopped in mid-sentence. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s gone, Stephen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to react, Stephen stared at him in blank disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She left this behind,\" Clayton said, holding a folded sheet of notepaper out to him. \"Also, there is a young woman here, waiting to see you. She claims to be the real Charise Lancaster,\" Clayton added, but he made that last announcement in a tone of acceptance, not ridicule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen opened the short, disjointed letter that had obviously been written in haste, and each unbelievable word seemed to sear his mind, branding his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you will soon discover from the real Charise Lancaster, I am not who you thought I was. Not who I thought I was. Please believe that. Until the moment Charise Lancaster walked into my bedchamber this morning, I did not remember anything about myself except what I was told after the accident. Now that I do know who I am and what I am, I realize that a marriage between us would probably be impossible. I also realize that when Charise is finished telling you her opinion of what I intended to accomplish, it may sound far more believable than my truths in this note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would hurt me more than you can imagine. I wonder how I would go on, knowing that somewhere in this world you would be living your life, forever believing that I was a fraud and a schemer. You won\u0027t believe that, I know you won\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d crossed out the last word and simply signed the letter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheridan Bromleigh\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheridan Bromleigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheridan. In the most painful moment of his life, with her letter in his hand and the unbelievable words scored into his brain, Stephen stared at her real name—a strong, beautiful name. Unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he thought Sheridan fit her far better than Charise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The woman who is waiting for you says that you\u0027ve been duped. Deliberately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen\u0027s hand closed on the letter, wadding it into a ball, and he tossed it in the direction of the table. \"Where is she?\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waiting for you in your study.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression as murderous as his feelings, Stephen stalked out of the room, determined to prove that this new Charise Lancaster was a liar, or a fraud, or that she was mistaken about Sherry\u0027s having deliberately duped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the one painfully irrefutable fact that he could not ignore, or disprove, was that Sheridan had run from him, rather than facing him and explaining. And that hinted unbearably of guilt…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e40\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he walked swiftly toward his study, Stephen told himself Sherry would return in an hour or two. She\u0027d run away because she was upset—hysterical. Whitticomb had said memory loss was a form of hysteria. Perhaps hysteria came with its return as well. With visions of her wandering through London streets, alone and confused, he strode into his study. With only a curt, icy nod to the blonde who was waiting for him, he flung himself into the chair behind his desk, determined to disprove her contention that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherry had deliberately deceived him. \"Sit down,\" he ordered curtly, \"let\u0027s hear what you have to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I have a great deal to say!\" she burst out, and Stephen was momentarily disconcerted by the fleeting irony that this Charise Lancaster looked exactly like the curly-haired blonde he\u0027d expected to meet at the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharise sensed his desire to disbelieve anything she said, and as it sank in that this handsome, rich man might somehow have belonged to her, her fury and determination grew to new proportions. Daunted by his glacial manner, she was trying to decide how to best begin, when he said in a savage voice, \"You\u0027ve made a damning accusation against someone who isn\u0027t here to defend herself. Now, start talking!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3/page-75.html","bookId":1803,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM"}
