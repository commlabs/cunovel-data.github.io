Maybe sixty miles covered. But in the noisy darkness inside the panel truck Reacher had no idea which direction those sixty miles were taking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was handcuffed to the young woman with the bad leg and within the first few minutes of their forced acquaintance they had worked out how to get as comfortable as they were ever going to get. They had crabbed around inside the truck until they were sitting sideways on the floor, legs straight out, propped against the big wheel well on the right, braced against the motion. The woman sat against the rear side and Reacher sat on the forward side. Their cuffed wrists lay together on the flat top of the metal bulge like they were lovers idling their time away in a cafe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, they hadn\u0027t spoken. They just sat for a long time in stunned silence. The immediate problem was the heat. It was the middle of the last day of June in the Midwest. They were shut into an enclosed metal space. There was no ventilation. Reacher figured the rush of air over the outside of the truck\u0027s body must be cooling it to an extent, but nowhere near enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just sat there in the gloom and used the hot dead time thinking and planning like he was trained to do. Staying calm, staying relaxed, staying ready, not burning his energy away with useless speculation. Assessing and evaluating. The three guys had shown a measure of efficiency. No great talent, no real finesse, but no significant mistakes. The jumpy guy with the second Glock was the weakest component of the team, but the leader had covered for him pretty well. An efficient threesome. Not at all the worst he\u0027d ever seen. But at that point, he wasn\u0027t worrying. He\u0027d been in worse situations and survived them. Much worse situations, and more than once. So he wasn\u0027t worrying yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he noticed something. He noticed that the woman was not worrying yet, either. She was calm, too. She was just sitting there, swaying, cuffed to his wrist, thinking and planning like maybe she was trained to do, as well. He glanced across at her in the gloom and saw her looking steadily at him. A quizzical stare, calm, in control, faintly superior, faintly disapproving. The confidence of youth. She met his gaze. Held it for a long moment. Then she stuck out her cuffed right hand, which jarred his left wrist, but it was an encouraging gesture. He reached around and shook her hand and they smiled brief ironic smiles together at their mutual formality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holly Johnson,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was assessing him carefully. He could see her eyes traveling around his face. Then they flicked down to his clothing, and back up to his face. She smiled again, briefly, like she had decided he merited some kind of courtesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to meet you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at her. Looked at her face. She was a very good-looking woman. Maybe twenty-six, twenty-seven. He looked at her clothes. A line from an old song ran through his head: hundred-dollar dresses, that I ain\u0027t paid for yet. He waited for the next line, but it didn\u0027t come. So he smiled back at her and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack Reacher,\" he said. \"Pleasure\u0027s all mine, Holly, believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was difficult to speak, because the truck was cruising noisily. The sound of the engine was fighting with the roar from the road. Reacher would have been happy to sit quiet for a time, but Holly wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to get rid of you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA confident woman, well in control of herself. He made no reply. Just glanced at her and glanced away. The next line was: cold, cold-blooded woman. A dying fall, a sad poignant line. An old Memphis Slim song. But the line was not right for her. Not right at all. This was not a cold-blooded woman. He glanced over again and shrugged at her. She was staring at him. Impatient with his silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understand exactly what\u0027s happening?\" she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her face. Watched her eyes. She was staring straight at him. Astonishment on her face. She thought she was stuck in there with an idiot. She thought he didn\u0027t understand exactly what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s pretty clear, right?\" he said. \"From the evidence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What evidence?\" she said. \"It was all over in a split second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" he said. \"That\u0027s all the evidence I need, right? Tells me more or less what I need to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped talking and started resting again. Next opportunity to get away would be the next time the truck stopped. Could be some hours away. He felt he could be in for a long day. Felt he should be prepared to conserve his resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you need to know?\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were steady on his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been kidnapped,\" he said. \"I\u0027m here by accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still looking at him. Still confident. Still thinking. Still not sure whether or not she was cuffed to an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s pretty clear, right?\" he said again. \"It wasn\u0027t me they were after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made no reply. Just arched a fine eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody knew I was going to be there,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t even know I was going to be there. Until I got there. But it was a well-planned operation. Must have taken time to set up. Based on surveillance, right? Three guys, one in the car, two on the street. The car was parked exactly level. They had no idea where I was going to be. But obviously they knew for sure where you were going to be. So don\u0027t be looking at me like I\u0027m the idiot here. You\u0027re the one made the big mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mistake?\" the woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re too regular in your habits,\" Reacher said. \"They studied your movements, maybe two or three weeks, and you walked right into their arms. They weren\u0027t expecting anybody else to be there. That\u0027s clear, right? They only brought one set of handcuffs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his wrist, which raised hers too, to make his point. The woman went quiet for a long moment. She was revising her opinion of him. Reacher rocked with the motion of the vehicle and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you should know better,\" he said. \"You\u0027re a government agent of some sort, right? DEA, CIA, FBI, something like that, maybe a Chicago PD detective? New in the job, still fairly dedicated. And fairly wealthy. So somebody is either looking for a ransom, or you\u0027ve already become a potential problem to somebody, even though you\u0027re new, and either way you should have taken more care of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked across at him. Nodded, eyes wide in the gloom. Impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evidence?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couple of things,\" he said. \"Your dry cleaning? My guess is every Monday lunch break you take last week\u0027s clothes in to get them cleaned, and you pick up this week\u0027s clothes to wear. That means you must have about fifteen or twenty outfits. Looking at that thing you got on, you\u0027re not a cheap dresser. Call it four hundred bucks an outfit, you\u0027ve got maybe eight grand tied up in things to wear. That\u0027s what I call moderately wealthy, and that\u0027s what I call too regular in your habits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" she said. \"Why am I a government agent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy enough,\" he said. \"You had a Glock 17 shoved at you, you were bundled into a car, you were thrown in a truck, handcuffed to a complete stranger and you\u0027ve got no idea where the hell they\u0027re taking you, or why. Any normal person would be falling apart over all that, screaming the place down. But not you. You\u0027re sitting there quite calmly, which suggests some kind of training, maybe some kind of familiarity with upsetting or dangerous situations. And maybe some kind of sure knowledge there\u0027ll be a bunch of people looking to get you back soon as they can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and she nodded for him to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also, you had a gun in your bag,\" he said. \"Something fairly heavy, maybe a thirty-eight, long barrel. If it was a private weapon, a dresser like you would choose something dainty, like a snub twenty-two. But it was a big revolver, so you were issued with it. So you\u0027re some kind of an agent, maybe a cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman nodded again, slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why am I new in the job?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your age,\" Reacher said. \"What are you? Twenty-six?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-seven,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s young for a detective,\" he said. \"College, a few years in uniform? Young for the FBI, DEA, CIA, too. So whatever you are, you\u0027re new at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" she said. \"Why am I fairly dedicated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher pointed, left-handed, rattling their shared handcuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your injury,\" he said. \"You\u0027re back to work after some kind of an accident, before you\u0027re really recovered. You\u0027re still using that crutch for your bad leg. Most people in your position would be staying home and drawing sick pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could be handicapped,\" she said. \"Could have been born this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head in the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a hospital crutch,\" he said. \"They loaned it to you, short-term, until you\u0027re over your injury. If it was a permanent thing, you\u0027d have bought your own crutch. Probably you\u0027d have bought a dozen. Sprayed them all different to match all your expensive outfits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. It was a pleasant sound above the drone and boom of the truck\u0027s engine and the roar of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty good, Jack Reacher,\" she said. \"I\u0027m an FBI Special Agent. Since last fall. I just ripped up my cruciate ligaments playing soccer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You play soccer?\" Reacher said. \"Good for you, Holly Johnson. What kind of an FBI agent since last fall?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was quiet for a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just an agent,\" she said. \"One of many at the Chicago office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacher shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just an agent,\" he said. \"An agent who\u0027s doing something to somebody who maybe wants to retaliate. So who are you doing something to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t discuss that,\" she said. \"Not with civilians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. He was comfortable with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any agent makes enemies,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me as much as anybody,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced across at her. It was a curious remark. Defensive. The remark of a woman trained and eager and ready to go, but chained to a desk since last fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Financial section?\" he guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t discuss it,\" she said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you already made enemies,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a half-smile which died fast. Then she went quiet. She looked calm, but Reacher could feel in her wrist that she was worried for the first time. But she was hanging in there. And she was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not out to kill you,\" he said. \"They could have killed you in that vacant lot. Why haul you away in this damn truck? And there\u0027s your crutch, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about my crutch?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t make any sense,\" he said. \"Why would they toss your crutch in here if they\u0027re going to kill you? You\u0027re a hostage, Holly, that\u0027s what you are. You sure you don\u0027t know these guys? Never saw them before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know who the hell they are, or what the hell they want from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her. She sounded way too definite. She knew more than she was telling him. They went quiet in the noise. Rocked and bounced with the movement of the truck. Reacher stared into the gloom. He could feel Holly making decisions, next to him. She turned sideways again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to get you out of here,\" she said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at her. Glanced away and grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suits me, Holly,\" he said. \"Sooner the better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When will somebody miss you?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a question he would have preferred not to answer. But she was looking hard at him, waiting. So he thought about it, and he told her the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" she asked. \"Who are you, Reacher?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked across at her and shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept on looking at him, quizzically. Maybe irritated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, what kind of nobody?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Memphis Slim in his head: got me working in a steel mill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a doorman,\" he said. \"At a club in Chicago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which club?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A blues place on the South Side,\" he said. \"You probably don\u0027t know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A doorman?\" she said. \"You\u0027re playing this pretty cool for a doorman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doormen deal with a lot of weird situations,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked like she wasn\u0027t convinced and he put his face down near his wristwatch to check the time. Two-thirty in the afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how long before somebody misses you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her own watch and made a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite a while,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve got a case conference starting at five o\u0027clock this afternoon. Nothing before then. Two and a half hours before anybody even knows I\u0027m gone.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/die-trying-jack-reacher-2/page-3.html","bookId":2340,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:40 AM"}
