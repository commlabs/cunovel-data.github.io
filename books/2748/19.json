Of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Abby\u0027s voice was saying, growing closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was desperate. I knocked. \"Ms. McHenry, are you in there? May I have a word?\" I asked, still clinging to my cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" Abby said behind me. \"A four-hundred- foot perimeter should be more than ample.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was really desperate. I pulled a bobby pin out of my hair. And tried the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the lock turn just as Abby pushed free of the crowd, and in the next second I was surrounded by darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt someone grab for me, but I dodged it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand grabbed my hair—or what it thought was my hair—and pulled the wig free. Abby\u0027s voice was louder now—right outside—and inside the tiny compartment everything went still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a faint yellow glow in a small crack beneath the door, and in the light I saw Zach look from the wig and then to me and then back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t supposed to be here, Gallagher Girl.\" It wasn\u0027t playful. It wasn\u0027t fun. He wasn\u0027t smiling or flirting. He was…Mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMad like I\u0027d never seen him. Mad like I didn\u0027t even know he could be. I\u0027ve always known that Zach was strong (a girl doesn\u0027t spar with a guy in P\u0026amp;E for a semester and not figure that out), but right then he was like stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing that hit me was the shock. The second…was the anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re telling me that I shouldn\u0027t be here?\" I snapped. Sure, my aunt and half the United States Secret Service were probably right outside the door at that moment, and yet I couldn\u0027t stop myself,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s dangerous,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In case you haven\u0027t noticed, I can take care of myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the train picked that moment to lurch, and despite the best protection-and-enforcement training in the world, I found myself stumbling, falling into Zach\u0027s outstretched arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to pull away, but he held me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" he said as the voices in the hall outside faded for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the scariest thing of all happened: Zach looked like he wanted to kiss me…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was the same boy who had dipped me movie-style in front of my whole school in the middle of finals week, and yet there we were, crammed together in the dark of a moving train, adrenaline and drizzle hanging all around us, and he didn\u0027t make a single move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice disguise,\" he told me, smiling at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too,\" I said. I thought about that moment—what it meant, how long I wanted it to last, and what I was willing to give up to find the truth. So that\u0027s why I added, \"It looked even better in Boston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are moments in a spy\u0027s life when time speeds up, and then there are seconds that last a lifetime. And this… this was one of those instances that seemed to go on for years. In the narrow space, with Zach\u0027s arms still wrapped around me and voices still echoing outside, I watched his expression shift from confusion to shock to the look of someone desperate for a plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was knocking. My eyes were wide as they stared into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" he said, gesturing to the collapsible overhead sleeping bunks that, before that moment, I\u0027d only ever seen in old movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore knocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, someone yelled, \"Who\u0027s got a key for this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut by the time the door burst open, Zach and I were nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Note to self: don\u0027t become a spy if you\u0027re even a little bit claustrophobic.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on, Zach?\" I whispered through the pitch blackness of the little collapsible bunk. That we had cob lapsed. With ourselves locked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arm was around my waist. His breath was warm on the back of my neck. Sure, I could hear Aunt Abby in the tiny compartment saying, \"Macey, I don\u0027t want to argue about this anymore. Just wait in here,\" but I didn\u0027t really care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were in Boston, Zach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" he whispered, pulling me closer with a jerk around my middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside our tiny bunk I heard more voices coming from compartment fourteen. I would have known Macey\u0027s speech pattern anywhere. But the other voice was familiar too, and yet I couldn\u0027t quite…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" the deeper of the two voices said, \"I\u0027ve been told this is my best suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreston!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard more talking and music, but all of that seemed a million miles away as I lay there, my mind racing faster than the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how you knew about the laundry chute,\" I hissed, another piece of the puzzle falling into place. \"Why were you there, Zach?\" I whispered, growing desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now.\" His voice was soft but strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t say it was because we were in danger, because at the time we weren\u0027t in any danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to take a nap or something?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and while we\u0027re on the subject, why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could ask the same thing of you, Gallagher Girl, except we should be shutting up now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was a very good idea because the voices outside had stopped. Macey and Preston weren\u0027t talking anymore, but the spy (not to mention the girl) in me knew somehow that they were still out there. Because there were sounds. Sounds I recognized. Sounds I really didn\u0027t want to think too much about. Because I think they were the sounds of kissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was currently smashed up against a boy that I had kissed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at that moment kissing needed to be the furthest thing from my mind!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you and Mr. Solomon talking about?\" I said, because, frankly, I really needed to say something!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Zach must have been immune to the kissing sounds. Or kissing thoughts, because he snapped, \"You don\u0027t get it, do you?\" He twisted me somehow so that our faces were inches away from each other in the black. \"This is dangerous,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCammie,\" he said, not Gallagher Girl. \"This is—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I kinda figured that out the day I woke up with a concussion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make light of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about \u0027concussion\u0027 is synonymous with \u0027making light\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t be here,\" he said again slowly, like I wasn\u0027t bright enough to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re here,\" I snapped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, this is no place for…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train may have been swarming with armed guards…My roommate and the potential future first son of the United States may have been making out a few feet away…The world as I knew it may have been on the verge of being over if Zach and I had gotten caught…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I. Didn\u0027t. Care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A student?\" I tried again. \"What, Zach? Tell me what you are that I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then my eyes must have adjusted to the black, because I swear I could see him—really, truly see him—as the cockiest boy I\u0027d ever known looked at me and whispered, \"I\u0027m someone who doesn\u0027t have anything to lose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything else went away then—the noise from outside, the rocking of the car, the pressure, and the fatigue. I don\u0027t know what would have happened next. Maybe I would have cried. Maybe I would have given in. Or maybe I would have demanded more answers to the questions I barely dared to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we\u0027ll never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause just as Zach touched my face, the world fell out from underneath us. Gravity took hold. One moment I was lying in the arms of one of the most complex (and gorgeous) boy spies ever, and the next I was landing like a ton of bricks on the hard, cold floor of a moving train while one of my best friends stared down at me. And the boy on top of me. And said, \"Well, this wasn\u0027t on my agenda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least Preston was gone—or at least I thought Preston was gone. I couldn\u0027t be too sure because it was taking me a second to get my bearings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. McHenry!\" a male voice shouted from the other side of the door. \"Secret Service! Is everything okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at Macey. Zach was splayed on top of me, one of his legs tangled with Macey\u0027s backpack. A tray of food had fallen with us and was now splattered all over the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey looked at us, the most unusual look on her face, as if she knew that, with a single word she could bring that door—and our entire world—crashing down. She smiled, savoring the moment before she slowly said, \"Everything\u0027s fine. I just knocked over a tray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we send a porter to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Macey snapped. \"I want to be alone, or is that too hard to understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard retreating footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey dropped to the bench across from us while Zach and I tried to right ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Zach,\" she said, her right leg swinging as she sat with it crossed over her left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Macey,\" he said, as if he fell out of ceilings and into the private chambers of the most highly protected girl in the country every day. \"Sorry to drop in,\" he said with a look that told me he thought he was entirely too clever, \"but Cammie just had to be alone with me. You know how she gets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smacked his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinched. \"You know, you\u0027re going to hurt me one of these days, and then you\u0027re going to feel really bad about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I started, \"well, maybe if you would be honest with me for one—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, just so you know,\" Macey said, cutting me off as she leaned back, enjoying the show, \"Abby will be back in approximately two minutes, so you lovebirds might want to make this quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI totally expected the boy in front of me to recoil at the word \"lovebirds.\" But he didn\u0027t. Instead he grabbed the bag he\u0027d been carrying and turned to Macey. \"Thanks.\" He placed his knee on the bench and leaned toward the dark window, staring into the black as he said, \"This is my stop anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, from what I could tell, the train wasn\u0027t stopping. It wasn\u0027t even slowing down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, McHenry, you mind?\" He gestured to the door then stepped back as Macey opened it and checked the aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, officer,\" she called to the sentry stationed in the hall outside. \"Can I see your gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the man turned his back on us, Zach dashed out into the hall and to the door at the end of the car. I started to follow, but he stopped suddenly and turned to me. \"Hey, Gallagher Girl,\" he said, looking at me more deeply than he ever had, \"promise me something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe train was faster now. Night streamed through the windows. And Zach stepped even closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be\"—he reached up and gently touched the place where my bruise had been as if it were still fresh and swollen—\"careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Zach stepped to the end of the car and slid open the door. The noise was overpowering for an instant. We were going over a great ravine, nothingness streaming on both sides as Zach spread his arms out wide. He looked back at me for one fleeting second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd jumped into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So…\" the voice behind me was strong and even. I turned to see a very sorry-looking Macey and a very impressed-looking Aunt Abby staring at me and the fading parachute that was Zach. \"I take it that\u0027s the man in your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen an operative is compromised mid-mission, there are a lot of things that have to be said. And done. For example, it\u0027s great if you have a legend or two you can whip out to distract the catcher from the catchee\u0027s actual intentions. Also, misdirection is always useful, so you can place blame on anyone but yourself. Or you can retreat. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-19.html","bookId":2748,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM"}
