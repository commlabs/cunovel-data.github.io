Instead, he poured all of his true essence into the red spear, issuing out his final, most brilliant strike!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe power of fire and the power of space had perfectly fused together. The might of this spear was earthshaking!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Lin Ming didn’t stab towards Corpsemancer. Instead, he threw his spear towards the bat puppet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Go!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe red spear flew out from his hands, crossing the skies like a blazing rainbow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a light piercing sound, the bat puppet’s head was pierced by the spear light. It’s skull was cracked apart, and brain fluid shot out!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the same time, Corpsemancer’s scythe cut into Lin Ming’s waist. Lin Ming’s bodily protective true essence was instantly melted away, and corpse fire burnt through Lin Ming’s clothes. The scythe seemed as if it would split him apart. However at that moment, the scythe’s blade was actually blocked by something.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming’s robes burned away, it revealed a jet black armor. This was the Demon Emperor’s armor that Lin Ming had taken out from the Cosmic Melting Furnace!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Demon Emperor’s armor could weaken the majority of an attack, but it wasn’t an absolute defense. Some of the leftover Yin energy rampaged through Lin Ming’s body, recklessly tearing through his meridians.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s complexion paled, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCorpsemancer’s final attack had severely wounded him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf it weren’t for the Demon Emperor’s armor, Lin Ming might have died here. It was hard to say whether or not his body’s physical defense could withstand Corpsemancer’s strike.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s over?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What happened?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone looked on, dumbfounded, at Corpsemancer’s scythe that was embedded in Lin Ming’s waist. As for Lin Ming’s spear, it was stuck through the bat puppet’s head.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCorpsemancer stood stock still in front of Lin Ming, completely uninjured.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Did the bat puppet block that youth’s final attack for its master?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“No wait, why do I feel that the youth intentionally attacked the bat puppet?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Not unless that youth is an idiot.
