Where\u0027s the gods of Ephebe and Tsort?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elo, clutching at his nose, waved vaguely towards the center of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You nidn\u0027t naf to ndo dat!” he said reproachfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm strode across the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center of the room was what at first looked like a round table, and then looked like a model of the Discworld, Turtle, elephants and all, and then in some undefinable way looked like the real Discworld, seen from far off yet brought up close to. There was something subtly wrong about the distances, a feeling of vast space curled up small. But possibly the real Discworld wasn\u0027t covered with a network of glowing lines, hovering just above the surface. Or perhaps miles above the surface?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm hadn\u0027t seen this before, but he knew what it was. Both a wave and a particle; both a map and the place mapped. If he focused on the tiny glittering dome on top of the tiny Cori Celesti, he would undoubtedly see himself, looking down on an even smaller model . . . and so on, down to the point where the universe coiled up like the tail of an ammonite, a kind of creature that lived millions of years ago and never believed in any gods at all . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gods clustered around it, watching intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm elbowed aside a minor Goddess of Plenty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were dice floating just above the world, and a mess of little clay figures and gaming counters. You didn\u0027t need to be even slightly omnipotent to know what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He hid by nose!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never forget a face, friend. Just take yours away, right? While you still have some left?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“S\u0027cuse me,” said a voice by his waist. He looked down at a very large newt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You not supposed do that here. No Smiting. Not up here. It the rules. You want fight, you get your humans fight his humans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who\u0027re you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“P\u0027tang-P\u0027tang, me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re a god?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah? How many worshipers have you got?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fifty-one!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newt looked at him hopefully, and added, “Is that lots? Can\u0027t count.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt pointed at a rather crudely molded figure on the beach in Omnia and said, “But got a stake!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm looked at the figure of the little fisherman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When he dies, you\u0027ll have fifty worshippers,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That more or less than fifty-one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot less.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definite?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one tell me that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were several dozen gods watching the beach. Om vaguely remembered the Ephebian statues. There was the goddess with the badly carved owl. Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm rubbed his head. This wasn\u0027t god-like thinking. It seemed simpler when you were up here. It was all a game. You forgot that it wasn\u0027t a game down there. People died. Bits got chopped off. We\u0027re like eagles up here, he thought. Sometimes we show a tortoise how to flY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, to the occult world in general, “There\u0027s people going to die down there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Tsortean God of the Sun did not even bother to look round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s what they\u0027re for,” he said. In his hand he was holding a dice box that looked very much like a human skull with rubies in the eye-sockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, yes,” said Om. “I forgot that, for a moment.” He looked at the skull, and then turned to the little Goddess of Plenty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s this, love? A cornucopia? Can I have a look? Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm emptied some of the fruit out. Then he nudged the Newt God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I was you, friend, I\u0027d find something long and hefty,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is one less than fifty-one?” said P\u0027Tang-P\u0027Tang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s the same,” said Om, firmly. He eyed the back of the Tsortean God\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you have thousands,” said the Newt God. “You fight for thousands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm rubbed his forehead. I spent too long down there, he thought. I can\u0027t stop thinking at ground level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think,” he said, “I think, if you want thousands, you have to fight for one.” He tapped the Solar God on the shoulder. “Hey, sunshine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the God looked around, Om broke the cornucopia over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t a normal thunderclap. It stuttered like the shyness of supernovas, great ripping billows of sound that tore up the sky. Sand fountained up and whirled across the recumbent bodies lying face down on the beach. Lightning stabbed down, and sympathetic fire leapt from spear-tip and sword-point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimony looked up at the booming darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell\u0027s happening?” He nudged the body next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Argavisti. They stared at one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore thunder smashed across the sky. Waves climbed up one another to rip into the fleet. Hull drifted with awful grace into hull, giving the bass line of the thunder a counterpoint of groaning wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA broken spar thudded into the sand by Simony\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027re dead if we stay here,” he said. “Come on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey staggered through the spray and sand, amidst groups of cowering and praying soldiers, fetching up against something hard, half-covered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crawled into the calm under the Turtle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther people had already had the same idea. Shadowy figures sat or sprawled in the darkness. Urn sat dejectedly on his toolbox. There was a hint of gutted fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The gods are angry,” said Borvorius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bloody furious,” said Argavisti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m not that happy myself,” said Simony. “Gods? Huh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is no time for impiety,” said Rham-ap-Efan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a shower of grapes outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can\u0027t think of a better one,” said Simony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA piece of cornucopia shrapnel bounced off the roof of the Turtle, which rocked on its spiked wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But why be angry with us?” said Argavisti. “We\u0027re doing what they want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorvorius tried to smile. “Gods, eh?” he said. “Can\u0027t live with \u0027em, can\u0027t live without \u0027em.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone nudged Simony, and passed him a soggy cigarette. It was a Tsortean soldier. Despite himself, he took a puff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s good tobacco,” he said. “The stuff we grow tastes like camel\u0027s droppings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed it along to the next hunched figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHANK YOU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorvorius produced a flask from somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you go to hell if you have a drop of spirit?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So it seems,” said Simony, absently. Then he noticed the flask. “Oh, you mean alcohol? Probably. But who cares? I won\u0027t be able to get near the fire for priests. Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pass it round.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHANK YOU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Turtle rocked to a thunderbolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“G\u0027n y\u0027himbe bo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked at the pieces of raw fish, and Fasta Benj\u0027s hopeful expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could rake some of the coals out of the firebox from here,” said Urn, after a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone tapped Simony on the shoulder, creating a strange tingling sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHANK YOU. I HAVE TO GO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he took it he was aware of the rush of air, a sudden breath in the universe. He looked around in time to see a wave lift a ship out of the water and smash it against the dunes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA distant scream colored the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There were people under there,” said Argavisti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimony dropped the flask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no one, as they hauled on timbers in the teeth of the gale, as Urn applied everything he knew about levers, as they used their helmets as shovels to dig under the wreckage, asked who it was they were digging for, or what kind of uniform they\u0027d been wearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFog rolled in on the wind, hot and flashing with electricity, and still the sea pounded down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimony hauled on a spar, and then found the weight lessen as someone grasped the other end. He looked up into Brutha\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t say anything,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gods are doing this to us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t say anything!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve got to know!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s better than us doing this to us, isn\u0027t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s still people who never got off the ships!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one ever said it was going to be nice!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimony pulled aside some planking. There was a man there, armor and leathers so stained as to be unrecognizable, but alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen,” said Simony, as the wind whipped at him, “I\u0027m not giving in! You\u0027ve haven\u0027t won! I\u0027m not doing this for any sort of god, whether they exist or not! I\u0027m doing it for other people! And stop smiling like that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of dice dropped on to the sand. They sparkled and crackled for a while and then evaporated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea calmed. The fog went ragged and curled into nothingness. There was still a haze in the air, but the sun was at least visible again, if only as a brighter area in the dome of the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, there was the sensation of the universe drawing breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gods appeared, transparent and shimmering in and out of focus. The sun glinted off a hint of golden curls, and wings, and lyres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they spoke, they spoke in unison, their voices drifting ahead or trailing behind the others, as always\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.happens when a group of people are trying to faithfully repeat something they\u0027ve been told to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm was in the throng, standing right behind the Tsortean God of Thunder with a faraway expression on his face. It was noticeable, if only to Brutha, that the Thunder God\u0027s right arm disappeared up behind his own back in a way that, if such a thing could be imagined, would suggest that someone was twisting it to the edge of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the gods said was heard by each combatant in his own language, and according to his own understanding. It boiled down to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI. This is Not a Game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eII. Here and Now, You are Alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027d make a good bishop,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me?” said Didactylos. “I\u0027m a philosopher!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. It\u0027s about time we had one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“”And an Ephebian!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. You can think up a better way of ruling the country. Priests shouldn\u0027t do it. They can\u0027t think about it properly. Nor can soldiers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” said Simony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were sitting in the Cenobiarch\u0027s garden. Far overhead an eagle circled, looking for anything that wasn\u0027t a tortoise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like the idea of democracy. You have to have someone everyone distrusts,” said Brutha. “That way, everyone\u0027s happy. Think about it. Simony?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m making you head of the Quisition.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want it stopped. And I want it stopped the hard way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want me to kill all the inquisitors? Right!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. That\u0027s the easy way. I want as few deaths as possible. Those who enjoyed it, perhaps. But only those. Now . . . where\u0027s Urn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Moving Turtle was still on the beach, wheels buried in the sand blown about by the storm. Urn had been too embarrassed to try to unearth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The last I saw, he was tinkering with the door mechanism,” said Didactylos. “Never happier than when he\u0027s tinkering with things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. We shall have to find things to keep him occupied. Irrigation. Architecture. That sort of thing.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-47.html","bookId":1629,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM"}
