ANTONIO\u0027S PLOT.","content":"Such is a specimen of the yarns—sometimes true, sometimes spun out of whole cloth—with which the sailors amused themselves and beguiled the tedium of the night-watch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The companionship of honest and stout-hearted Bill Sturdy proved a great source of happiness to Charlie, and enabled him to bear up, as otherwise he might have found it difficult to do, under the hardships of his condition, the persecution of the captain and the mate, who had not forgotten their animosity, and the uncertainty he could not but feel as to the situation in which his mother was left, with the painful doubt as to whether she would be able to support herself till he could return and relieve her necessities.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When we get back, my lad,\" said Bill Sturdy, \"I\u0027ll put half that money in the Savings Bank in your name, so that if you and your mother want it at any time, you can use it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [195]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Bill,\" said Charlie, earnestly, \"you are very kind, but I couldn\u0027t consent to that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And why not, my lad? What do I want of it? I\u0027ve got neither chick nor child, and am not likely to have. I\u0027ve taken a fancy to you, and the money\u0027ll do you more good than me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are very kind,\" said Charlie, gratefully; \"but I mustn\u0027t take advantage of your generosity.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nonsense, my lad. I know what it is to be a poor boy, without money or friends, and nowadays money will bring friends. Mayhap it\u0027ll start you in some business, and when you get rich you can pay me; or if, by and by, I take a notion to come to anchor on shore, you\u0027ll give me a corner in your house, where I can smoke my pipe and spin my yarns.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That I will, Bill,\" said Charlie, seizing the old sailor\u0027s rough hand. \"If I have a roof to cover me, it shall cover you too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, my lad,\" said Bill. \"I know you would.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Under Bill Sturdy\u0027s rough exterior there[196] was a kind heart which warmed to our young hero, partly because of his solitary position on board, partly on account of his manliness and attractive qualities. So they became fast friends.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charlie did not find his duties altogether distasteful. He was a bright, active boy, not without ambition, and resolved to do himself credit in his new position, however it may have been forced upon him. For this reason it was that the captain and the mate, although they watched him with lynx eyes, hoping that he would afford them some pretext for showing their rancorous feelings towards him, watched ineffectually. By his activity, and his frank and manly disposition, he was fast ingratiating himself with the crew, who were the more disposed to espouse his cause, because they could not fail to notice the injustice with which the officers treated him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But trouble was brewing for Charlie, and soon the storm broke forth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The scuffle between Bill Sturdy and Antonio, of which Charlie was the occasion, will not have been forgotten. Antonio had before[197] hated Bill on account of his superiority in strength, which deprived him of his former champion\u0027s life. This feeling was increased by the issue of the contest which had resulted in his humiliation and defeat, and his anger was also stirred up against Charlie, who had been the occasion of it. Yet he did not dare to venture upon abuse, because it was generally understood that Bill Sturdy had constituted himself Charlie\u0027s especial friend and protector.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there were other ways of compassing his end. Antonio was subtile. He felt that his revenge must be a more secret one, and he desired that it should involve both Bill Sturdy and his protégé. If he could only involve Charlie in some offence which would draw upon him the active displeasure of the captain, and subject him to public punishment, he felt sure that Bill Sturdy would not stand tamely by and see it inflicted, while any interference would be insubordination, and get his rival into serious trouble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After reflection Antonio decided to implicate Charlie in a charge of theft. It happened[198] that the captain had a valuable gold ring, set with diamonds, which, for reasons unnecessary to state, he prized even beyond its pecuniary value. Captain Brace, however, was not a careful man. He would sometimes take off his ring, and lay it down on the cabin table. On one occasion Antonio, while upon deck, observed the captain pass, and ascertained by a swift glance that the ring was not upon his finger. He watched his opportunity, and slipping down into the cabin, found, as he anticipated, the ring upon the table. It was the work of a moment to snatch and conceal it in his pocket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He returned to the work in which he had been engaged, and resumed it, supposing he had not been observed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In this he was mistaken.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bill Sturdy had had his eye upon him from the time of his difficulty with him. He could see Antonio\u0027s craftiness in his face, and the apparent affability and conciliatory manner of the latter afterwards had by no means deceived him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look out for squalls,\" thought he. \"He\u0027s[199] too fair seeming to be trusted. I\u0027ve no doubt he\u0027s hatching up something or other. I\u0027ll keep a sharp lookout for him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Antonio made his stealthy visit to the cabin, as above described, the vigilant eye of Bill Sturdy was upon him and his movements.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In a moment he reappeared. Bill saw it all out of the corner of his eye, though he appeared to be looking in just the opposite direction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the fellow up to?\" he thought. \"Some mischief, I reckon. What business has he in the cabin? I must watch him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of course, Antonio\u0027s object will be understood. He meant to place the ring in Charlie\u0027s chest, and when the loss should be discovered by the captain, he would suggest that a general search should be instituted, the result of which must involve our young hero.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Charlie was, of course, quite unconscious of the machinations which were being formed against him, and even Bill was not yet quite certain for what purpose Antonio had made his visit to the cabin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [200]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Antonio felt the necessity of doing quickly what he had in contemplation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Going below, he made his way to the chest belonging to our hero, and, lifting the cover, for it was unlocked, let the ring drop into one corner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bill Sturdy saw his second disappearance from the deck. He could not ascertain precisely what he was doing, without following him,—a thing which he did not wish to do, since it would arouse Antonio\u0027s suspicions, and place him on his guard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Antonio came up with an expression of malicious satisfaction, which Bill did not fail to notice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish,\" he thought, \"I knew exactly what the fellow has been doing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bill was destined to learn ere long.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The captain went below, and glanced carelessly at the place where he remembered to have left the ring. To his surprise, it had disappeared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What can have become of it?\" he thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He instituted a careful examination, but did not succeed in finding the lost article.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [201]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He prized it beyond its actual value, which was considerable, and began to feel alarmed. It occurred to him that he might have been mistaken about leaving it on the table. It might possibly have been dropped upon deck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Going on deck, he communicated his loss to the crew and requested a general search.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think, Captain Brace,\" said Antonio, officiously, \"that I can guess where it is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I saw that boy have it,\" pointing to Charlie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s a lie!\" exclaimed Charlie, surprised and indignant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll see about that,\" said the captain, with a sneer. \"Do you know what he did with it, Antonio?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think he may have hidden it in his chest.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let his chest be brought on deck, and publicly examined. If he is found guilty, he shall be punished, as sure as my name is Brace.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1752/51214.html","bookId":1128,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:10:45 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:10:45 PM"}
