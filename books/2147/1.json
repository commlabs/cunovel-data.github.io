I was living the nightmare I\u0027d always dreamed of - I was in love with a gorgeous vampire, and I had fabulous Under-worldly friends and a hauntingly gothic nightclub where I could dance until dawn. The only thing I was missing was being an actual member of the Coffin Club - by becoming a real vampire. But if I couldn\u0027t be a vampire yet, then I would gladly enjoy the moment while I thought of new ways to convince Alexander I was truly ready to be turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much had happened recently. Alexander\u0027s best friend, Sebastian, had escaped the clutches of his new girlfriend, Luna, who had been set to dig her fangs into him for eternity. Sebastian was solo now, safe and crashing out in a downtown apartment in Dullsville. Scarlet and Onyx, my two vampire ghoul friends, were still inhabiting the Crypt and each had their mark on a guy - Scarlet had her sights set on my nemesis, Trevor Mitchell, which made me uneasy. While I didn\u0027t want to date Trevor, it was odd to see him in the company of a vampire. And Onyx had her eyes on Luna\u0027s twin brother, Jagger. And Jagger, Alexander\u0027s former nemesis, was basking in the moonlight now that his club was a hit in Dullsville. My best friend, Becky Miller, had learned Alexander\u0027s and my other friends\u0027 true vampire identities and was accepting this unexpected news as best as any mortal could. Alexander was as dreamy as ever, feeling more relaxed with a peer vampire population in this small town, and both of us were eagerly anticipating the arrival of his little sister, Athena \"Stormy\" Sterling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was slightly after midnight, a week after our birthday bash, when Alexander and I entwined our bodies, dancing to the music of Vlad and the Impalers at the Crypt. I was lost in his gaze, his chocolate eyes as irresistible to me as his red-licorice-hued lips. His brilliant smile glowed on his handsome, pale face. I felt as if we were the only couple in the club, or the world, for that matter. No one else existed to me. His pointed fangs glistened in the pulsing strobe lights, and I melted in his slow embrace. He leaned in to me, his fangs continuing to catch the flashing light. I\u0027d been on the other end of them before, in sight and sultry temptation, but not in true bite, and each time was like it was the first - fresh, real, and tantalizingly dangerous. I imagined the bite that would take me into his world forever, and how it would feel against my neck. Would it sting like getting my ear pierced again or hurt like getting a shot, or far worse, like a bite of an animal? Or would his knifelike teeth slide in painlessly as if they were always meant to have penetrated my skin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy blood would not be solely mine anymore but ours. I was mesmerized by my one true love and knew he was the one I\u0027d been dreaming about to live with for an eternity. We\u0027d cohabitate in the Underworld, strolling through cemeteries at night and cuddling in our king-sized coffin all day. I\u0027d decorate the Mansion and run my gothic and vampy mag while Alexander painted masterworks in our attic bedroom. I\u0027d fulfill his need for nourishment and he for me while we laughed, danced, and kissed in the darkness. Alexander\u0027s fangs slid farther down the nape of my neck until I was jarred out of my dream state. I felt myself pushed back from him, and suddenly someone was dancing between us. At s. ween usfirst I thought a wayward dancer had bumped into us, but when I saw long, bubblegum-pink hair, I knew it was intentional. Luna swayed her lithe, fairylike body to the morbidly slow beat and then threw her head back as if she\u0027d just been bitten. No one was going to come between Alexander and me! I scooted myself in between them and pushed her out with all my might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna sailed into another dancer and fell into his arms. I glanced over and noticed the dancer had blond hair. It was Trevor, who had once dated Luna. Scarlet wasn\u0027t going to be as gentle as I was with another girl coming between her and her man - after all, she was a real vampire. Scarlet lunged at Luna and hissed like a cat as her eyes seemed to turn blood-red. Luna ignored her and instead flashed her long, glittery pink lashes at Trevor, who was helplessly caught in her charms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarlet grabbed Trevor by his polo sleeve and yanked him away from the entrancing Luna. Trevor was startled by Scarlet\u0027s bold move but then smiled about the tug-of-war and possible catfight over him. He shot me a look as if to say, \"See what you\u0027re missing?\" As Scarlet dragged Trevor off the dance floor, Luna appeared unfazed. She glanced around until she saw the nearest male clubster - Matt Wells, my best friend\u0027s boyfriend. Becky and Matt were jamming when Luna sidled up to Matt. He was caught off guard, and his face flushed cherry red with her sudden attention. Poor Becky seemed blindsided and didn\u0027t know what to do. I pushed my way through the crowd of dancers and pulled Luna away from my favorite couple. I\u0027d clobber anyone who came between my best friend and her soulmate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Luna a death stare. She returned my fiery gaze, tensed her soft, pale cheeks, and bit her baby-pink lips. It must be hard for someone as beautiful as Luna to accept rejection. Until recently, rejection had been something I\u0027d been accustomed to - it was acceptance that was new to me. However, Luna had first been rejected by Alexander and now by his best friend, Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna had been a Sulky Sue since Sebastian had hightailed it out of the Crypt when he found out the covenant ceremony he was performing with Luna was on sacred ground. If he\u0027d bitten her as they planned, they\u0027d be bonded together as vampire lovers for eternity. Jagger had tried to trick Sebastian into being a mate for his twin sister for a lifetime - and beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho knew what other tricks the Maxwells had up their torn sleeves? I would have to keep them in my sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with Luna on the rebound and apparently moving in on our boyfriends, it was going to be impossible for any of us girls to be happy with her being solo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone but Luna in relationships meant only one thing - trouble. And I knew that the guy she craved the most was my beloved Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though Luna was my adversary, when I gazed into her starlet-blue eyes I saw a lonely girl gazing back at me, a girl who longed for true love, just like I had before I met Alexander. And even though she was sneaky and troublesome, she, too, deserved happiness. There had to be someone out there for her to make her dreams come true - someone who wouldn\u0027t get in the way of my or my friends\u0027 love lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away from ther away fre scowling Luna and gazed around the club hopelessly until I spotted someone familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomeo, the hot bartender from the Coffin Club, was serving bubbly liquid at the Crypt. Why hadn\u0027t I thought of him sooner? He had been right under her nose and mine. I\u0027d never seen Romeo hanging out with one particular girl here or at the Coffin Club in Hipsterville, so I was hoping he was available for a romantic setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned back to Luna but she was gone. I couldn\u0027t see her pink hair anywhere. I pushed through the crowd and found Alexander talking to Sebastian by the club\u0027s entrance. Sebastian was eyeing all the girls in the club, but one in particular had grabbed his attention since the split with Luna - Onyx. She was hanging by Jagger\u0027s side as he attended to business concerning the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave my hot-and-steamy Alexander a kiss on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right back,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right here.\" His dark locks fell over his eyes; his soft smile was mesmerizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed back to the dance floor and grabbed Becky by the sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re on a mission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"Aren\u0027t we always?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to guide her off the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I want to dance,\" she whined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I want to dance,\" she whined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky was growing accustomed to the club, too, along with the other students at Dullsville High. But this matter took precedence above our happiness for the night. If we didn\u0027t attempt to handle Luna\u0027s singlehood, we\u0027d have a bigger mess on our hands later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is more important than dancing,\" I insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t want to leave Matt alone,\" she said as she followed me reluctantly. \"I don\u0027t trust Luna. She seems to be trying to get her hands on every guy here at the club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. And we have to fix that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can we do? If I leave Matt alone, she may try to come around again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take care of that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Scarlet asked as she caught up to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to find a soulmate for Luna,\" I answered swiftly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, good!\" she said. \"I\u0027ll come with you! But can we leave her alone with our guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can in a bit,\" I replied to the bewildered girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stormed over to the bar, where a member of Jagger\u0027s security team was watching the dance floor. The burly guard was as wide as he was tall. And he was very tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you make sure that that pink-haired girl,\" I said, pointing to Luna, who was now dancing alone at the edge of the dance floor, \"stays away from those three guys?\" I gestured to our dates - Alexander and Sebastian, by the club\u0027s entrance, and Matt, who was hanging out by a pool table with Trevor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh ... isn\u0027t she Jagger\u0027s sister?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027s the boss.\" He towered over me like a concrete building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m the customer,\" I insisted. \"Isn\u0027t the customer always right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just like a concrete building, he didn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug into my Hello Batty evening bag and pulled out a five. I waved it in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the security guard didn\u0027t even look. I slipped the money into his behemoth-sized palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at me as if I\u0027d handed him a penny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" Becky reached into her purse and took out a few dollars. \"Our love lives depend on it.\" The hulky guard couldn\u0027t help but grin as he loomed over us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Scarlet said, handing him another bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay - \" he finally said, \"but this stays between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" we agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tick a lock,\" I said, winding a pretend key against my dark-stained lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed the girls\u0027 hands and we tore through the crowd to the bar. It was impossible to find an empty stool and even harder to get Romeo\u0027s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed between a preppy couple, leaned over the bar, and scooted as close to Romeo as I could. I didn\u0027t have any more money to wave. Instead I held up a white cocktail napkin. \"Romeo, over here!\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Romeo was pouring and delivering as many drinks as humanly possible, even for a vampire. At this rate, we\u0027d be waiting at the bar all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t wait any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he passed me by, I reached over the bar and grabbed his tattooed wrist, causing him to spill one of the drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! What\u0027s going on?\" he yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"I just need to speak with you.\" I knew Romeo recognized me from our previous meetings at the Coffin Club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomeo was handsome and a great fit for Luna, I thought. He had a tattoo of Munch\u0027s Scream on his bicep and Chinese characters on his wrists. His shaggy dark hair couldn\u0027t hide the countless silver studs and hoop rings in his ears. He wore a Berlin T-shirt and ripped jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you see I\u0027m busy?\" He wiped off the bar and the back of his drink-soiled hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s imperative I speak with you now,\" I said urgently. \"What do you think of Luna?\" I asked him with a hopeful smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luna?\" he said, half listening, as he served another drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luna Maxwell. Jagger\u0027s sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know who she is,\" he said as if I was bothering him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what do you think of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to face me. Romeo was cute with his dark, wavy hair and intense stare. \"DDG,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop-dead gorgeous,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI beamed. \"Then why don\u0027t you ask her out?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dunno.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you should. Why don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged his shoulders. \"Uh ... she\u0027s, like, sixteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - she\u0027s, like, eighteen. Maybe even nineteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" He perked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And she\u0027s single.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s cool.\" He bounced a bit as he wiped down the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should ask her out,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you should. Now.\" I was getting impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you should,\" Becky repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ditto,\" Scarlet added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay ... maybe later,\" he finally answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later?\" I asked. \"We don\u0027t have time for later!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t do it now,\" he said as if I was crazy. \"I\u0027m working.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about I help out?\" Scarlet whisked around the bar and joined Romeo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t a bartender,\" he scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am now,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who wants a cold one?\" Scarlet shouted to the patrons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral hands raised high in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral hands raised high in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Romeo didn\u0027t move. Instead he seemed distracted by the help that Scarlet was providing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t leave,\" he told me. \"I could get fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did work have to come in the way of his love life - and mine? I couldn\u0027t wait until the end of his shift to get Luna hitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to get her over to the bar,\" I said to Becky. At least with Scarlet helping out Romeo, he might have more time to talk to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Alexander asked me when he found us looking for Luna in the crowd. \"I thought we were dancing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just need to fix something,\" I said, scanning the crowd for pink pastel hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fix what?\" Alexander shouted over the music. He drew me in to him. \"Can\u0027t you do it later? I wait all day to see you, and the nights that we have together are cut short by you having to go home. This is our time together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said, feeling pulled in two directions. I didn\u0027t want to be apart from Alexander any more than was forced on us by the sun. \"But you\u0027ll have to trust me on this one.\" If Luna wasn\u0027t in a romantic relationship, then the time I was apart from Alexander would be even harder for me since I knew she\u0027d still be after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached up and gave him a quick peck on his tender lips. \"I won\u0027t be but a moment. I promise.\" Alexander shook his head, and Sebastian asked, \"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just Raven getting into another one of her messes, I\u0027m sure,\" Alexander said with a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spotted pink hair out among the blondes and brunettes; Becky, Onyx, and I raced over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took Luna aside while my friends hung behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Romeo wants to talk to you,\" I said in as sweet a voice as I could to my adversary. \"He said he really likes you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Romeo?\" she asked skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, don\u0027t you think he\u0027s hot?\" I asked as if it were fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the bartender,\" she said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. The hot bartender.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnyx and Becky nodded their heads enthusiastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\" Luna couldn\u0027t be bothered with my small talk and tapped her fuchsia Mary Janes to the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you noticed him before?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh ... yes. He works for Jagger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. So what do you think of him?\" I inquired eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just shrugged her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know much about Romeo except that he was a bartender and that he was nice. In fact, I didn\u0027t even know if he was a vampire, but I assumed that, because he worked at the Coffin Club and was in Jagger\u0027s inner circle, he must be. I wasn\u0027t sure what else to tell her, other than what I\u0027d seen of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s really worldly,\" I said, recalling his T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been to Berlin. He loves to travel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? I\u0027ve been there, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have? See, you already have things in common. There aren\u0027t many guys here who have been to Chicago, much less Berlin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess that\u0027s cool,\" she said with halfhearted interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and Onyx nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he loves art,\" I added, remembering his tattoo. \"He\u0027ll take you to the greatest museums.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s an artist, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so,\" I fibbed. \"Maybe he can use you as a model for a painting,\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sounds just like Alexander,\" Becky interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was ready to stomp on my friend\u0027s foot, but Luna\u0027s sparkly pink-lashed eyes lit up like a crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all Luna needed to know. She sailed over to the bar, and a guy offered her his stool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hopped on it, threw back her long pink hair, and leaned her elbows on the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I get you?\" Romeo asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was magic when their eyes locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that depends,\" Luna said in a sultry voice. \"What\u0027s on the menu?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Romeo, I need your help!\" Scarlet called. She was up to her elbows in drink orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no! I\u0027d finally made a love connection for Luna that didn\u0027t involve any of my or my friends\u0027 guys, and it was going to be messed up within seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay where you are!\" I said to Romeo. \"We\u0027ll help her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky followed me as we raced behind the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know the first thing about making drinks,\" Becky said, overwhelmed with our new mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t, either. But since there isn\u0027t alcohol in them, it can\u0027t be that hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not so sure....\" Becky whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just stick an umbrella in it,\" I said. \"It\u0027s that easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found bartending wasn\u0027t as easy as adding cute garnishes to frosted glasses. I had to take back as many drinks as I served, and Scarlet was taking in all the tips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I owed more than we came with, and I hadn\u0027t had a chance yet to get back to Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander finally found us at the bar, exhausted and spent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" he asked, shocked. He and Sebastian sat down on two empty stools. I was pouring a cola from the soda gun; my hair was falling in my face and my charcoal-colored eyeliner was smearing in the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like?\" I asked him. \"How about a Serial Killer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were looking everywhere for you,\" he said, concerned. \"You didn\u0027t answer your phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sorry! I didn\u0027t hear it ring,\" I apologized. \"It must be in my purse. I had no idea how hard this job can be. There are three of us here, and we still can\u0027t keep up.\"\"Why isn\u0027t Romeo working?\" Sebastian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is. Look,\" I said. Romeo and Luna were lost in each other\u0027s gaze. \"Isn\u0027t that sweet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what this is all about?\" Alexander said, scrutinizing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad she has her fangs on someone else,\" Sebastian said, his blond dreads bobbing as he turned her way. \"That girl is cook-a-loo - !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is not,\" I chimed in. \"Well, sort of. I mean, she wanted you,\" I said to Alexander, \"and then you,\" I said to Sebastian. \"And you both rejected her at the altar. How should she feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth guys thought for a moment before Alexander spoke. \"What do you know about Romeo?\" he asked me as I wiped off my hands with the bar rag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know he isn\u0027t you. And to me that\u0027s all he has to be. Besides, why are you worried about who she dates?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know he isn\u0027t you. And to me that\u0027s all he has to be. Besides, why are you worried about who she dates?\" Alexander shot me a look. \"I just want you to be matchmaking for the right reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" I replied. \"I want her to be happy so she doesn\u0027t try to steal you away. I think that is the best reason one could have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would she steal me away?\" He leaned in close and took my hand. \"Don\u0027t I have a choice in this? Don\u0027t you trust me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trusted a lot of things - I was confident with my style, taste, and opinions. And I was secure with my relationship with Alexander. However, Luna, who was sneaky to say the least, had known Alexander before I did and had grown up with his family in Romania. And now that she was inhabiting Dullsville and living in the Crypt, which was only a few miles away from the Mansion, she was too close for comfort. I didn\u0027t trust either her or her brother, and without Sebastian as the object of her romantic attentions she would surely aim her affection toward my true love, Alexander, once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ent size\"I don\u0027t trust her,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed my sweaty hair away from my face and took the drink from my hand and placed it on the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did all that so we could be together?\" he asked, massaging my cola-sticky hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That might be one of the sweetest things in the world,\" he said. \"But don\u0027t worry - it will take more than pink eyelashes to keep me away from you.\" d \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-1.html","bookId":2147,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM"}
