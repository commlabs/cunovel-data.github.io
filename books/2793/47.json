I was nervous. Had I gone too far?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she said, “It’s about damn time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she said, “That bitch. I swear to God…Finally. Finally, Katya.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for her to get it all out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate her. Do you understand me? I hate her. And I’ve been sitting here while you talk about how great she is and how wonderful she is and it’s been killing me. Because she’s not great and she’s not wonderful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember that one story I told you about her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which one?” There were millions. Sooz was the editor of The Compleat Crimes of Andi Donnelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About the girl. In the bathroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. What about…oh.” It hit me. “Oh, God. Sooz. Why didn’t you tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you were so in love with her, that’s why! Because all you could talk about was how great she was and I didn’t want to…I don’t know. I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hugged her. “I’m sorry. I’m really sorry, Sooz.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind. It’s all over.” She shuddered. “Let’s kick her perfectly rounded ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Sooz was on board. Good. I needed her Photoshop expertise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have to spend a little bit of the money I was saving. But if I was willing to do that before, for makeup, shouldn’t I be willing to do it now, for revenge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was insane to take on Andi. She was bigger than me. She was more popular, more important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut here’s something every good paleontologist knows: Even the biggest die. Even the meanest get killed off by something that they can’t see coming. Like a meteor. Or an insect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat it comes down to is this: In this world, you’re either predator or you’re prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many ways that dinosaurs caught and killed their prey. Everyone thinks that T. rex or allosaur or whatever just ran out into the open air and chased the little guys and ate them up. But the truth is that most of the meat-eaters were ambushers. They lay in wait very carefully and then grappled their prey. Chasing after prey was useless—it consumed too much energy and left too great a chance that the predator would injure itself. Besides, a high-speed pursuit of a smaller, more agile creature isn’t to your advantage when you can only move in a straight line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the big boys learned how to be patient. And stealthy. And to attack when least expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a paleontologist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you have to be patient to study dinosaurs. There are massive advantages to patience. On a dig, you can’t just go ahead and rip up everything in your path in your quest for fossils. You’d just end up destroying what it is you’re looking for. Fossils are fragile. They’ve been around for hundreds of millions of years and they won’t react kindly to someone tearing them out of the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo you take your time. You dig out the earth in teaspoons. You don’t gouge the ground—you brush it away gently. You don’t pound the rocks to release the knowledge within—you chip at them. Fragment by fragment. It’s the patient work of centimeters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd once you’ve got the ground chipped and swept and brushed away, you have yet another long wait ahead of you. Maybe you want nothing more than to pull it up and marvel at it, but you can’t. There are procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause once you isolate the fossil in the ground, you have to sketch it for the record and for cataloging. You sketch and take notes and then finally pull it up, but you can’t enjoy it. No. Because you have to wrap it in plaster of paris, for protection. And pack it in a special crate. And send it off to a museum, where it will sit in a basement vault somewhere. It’ll sit there for years until someone has the time (and the grant money) to pull it out and break open the plaster of Paris (again, carefully—patiently) and sit down to clean it and examine it and draw more sketches and officially decide what it is and where it belongs and everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what I had waiting for me in my future. So I was ready. I was ready to be as patient as I had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeday, I’ll be the world’s greatest paleontologist. Because I am patient like nobody’s business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter three months, I began to lose faith in the “ambush theory” of predation. There’s no way a meat-eater could or would wait so long for its prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have a choice, though. I had to wait for soccer season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to wait for Andi to be in practice pretty much every day of the week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I waited. And waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one of my gym days, I “accidentally” left my math book in the locker room after changing. I begged Mom to take me back to school for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got there just as practice was ending. A stream of girls headed into the locker room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach Kimball gave me an annoyed look, but Mom said, “She really needs this book. It’ll just take a second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoach made me give her my cell phone first—cell phones aren’t allowed in the locker room because of the cameras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one noticed my new little credit card–size camera. That’s because I hid it in an empty blush compact, with a hole drilled through for the lens. So I could hold it up and look like I was just looking in the mirror, but I was actually snapping pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I’m stressed—like I was in the locker room that day, surrounded by Andi’s friends, all of whom just ignored me, thank God—I try to remind myself that over ninety-nine percent of all the species that have ever lived on earth are already extinct. So it’s not like I matter. Or any of us. But on that day, I didn’t care that my existence was just a blink of the universe’s eye. I wanted Jamie Terravozza. And if I couldn’t have him, well, at least I could make sure that she couldn’t, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooz giggled uncontrollably when she saw the pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is serious,” I told her. “Stop it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry.” But she kept giggling. “I’m just thinking of how it’s gonna look when I’m done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had taken as many as I could, as quickly as I could. They were mostly pretty bad—you try taking a bunch of pictures through a tiny hole in a compact case while surrounded by girls who could notice you at any minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were two or three that weren’t totally awful. Sooz took the best one and massaged it in Photoshop until it looked pretty good and then she did some more work. I watched her, impatient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it,” I said. “It’s done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet,” she said, focused on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour went by. “Come on, Sooz. It’s perfect.” I was practically dancing from foot to foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s nowhere near perfect. Shut up, Katya.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around her room. I paced. I practiced my brachiosaur walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Sooz!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grumbled a little and clicked the mouse a few last times. “Fine. Fine. Here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the screen over her shoulder. “It’s perfect. It’s beyond perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooz grinned. “How many should we print out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe waited. To have it all come out the next day would be too suspicious. Someone would remember me in the locker room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I waited. Again. Still lying in ambush. I’ve already pegged the prey—it just doesn’t know it yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter two weeks, I pounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrookdale awakened to a new poster on its telephone poles and newspaper boxes and bulletin boards. A new flier tossed in piles by the post office and the grocery stores and scattered all over the entrance to the high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken us all night to walk around and do it. All night. Worth every last second of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t even get five minutes of sleep, but I couldn’t possibly miss school that day. Not and miss what everyone was talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image Sooz had mocked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndi, half-naked from the shower in the locker room, drying her hip and leg, her torso completely revealed. Wet and gorgeous and totally unaware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooz gave it atmosphere and mood. She Photoshopped out the locker room and Photoshopped in a sleazy hotel room we’d found online. And at the top:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDO YOU LIKE SEX? SHE DOES!!!!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the picture: CALL ANDI! with her phone number and her address. And then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTRUST ME—SHE LOVES IT!!! I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE—COUNTLESS TIMES!!!!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time I saw Andi that day, she was in tears. She was alone. She was rushing to the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe probably tried to lie. She probably tried to say it wasn’t her. But she knew it was. You can’t hide that kind of knowledge from your expression, from your eyes. People can tell when you’re lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in Brookdale knows what Andi’s boobs look like now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the talk of the school. I heard all sorts of rumors: She was a secret prostitute. (She and her best friend had had a threesome with a college guy from Pennsylvania.) She was an exhibitionist—she couldn’t help it. It was an ex trying to get back at her. She was a nympho and couldn’t help cheating on Jamie. It wasn’t really her. (Then why did it look like her? Why was her phone number on it?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt lunch, I sat with my usual view of Andi’s table. By then, the real story had spread throughout school: They were over. Period. For good. Zik Lorenz and Michelle Jurgens had heard the whole fight near the stairwell between third and fourth period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is going on? Jamie yelled. Everyone’s saying you’re a slut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not me! she protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is you! It is! Jamie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich clinched it. For everyone. After all, Jamie would definitely know what she looked like naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it’s not real, Jamie demanded, how did they get a naked picture of you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could she say to that? With the locker room Photoshopped out, how could she know where that picture had come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the grapevine, Andi had just broken down into tears again at that. I wished, oh, I wished I had been there to see it! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/geektastic-stories-from-the-nerd-herd/page-47.html","bookId":2793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:14 PM"}
