You are welcome to Rhulad.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa glared at Icarium who, though not as tall, somehow still seemed able to meet the Toblakai eye to eye without lifting his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something odd occurred. Samar Dev saw a slight widening of Karsa’s eyes as he studied Icarium’s face. ‘Yes,’ he said in a gruff voice. ‘I see it now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am pleased,’ replied Icarium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘See what?’ Samar Dev demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the ground behind her Taralack Veed groaned, coughed, then rolled onto his side and was sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa released the Jhag’s arm and stepped back. ‘You are good to your word?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium bowed slightly then said, ‘How could I not be?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That is true. Icarium, I witness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jhag bowed a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Keep your hands away from that sword!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis shout brought them all round, to see a half-dozen Letherii guards edging closer, their weapons unsheathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa sneered at them. ‘I am returning to the compound, children. Get out of my way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey parted like reeds before a canoe’s prow as the Toblakai marched forward, then moved into his wake, hurrying to keep up with Karsa’s long strides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamar Dev stared after them, then loosed a sudden yelp, before clapping her hands to her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You remind me of Senior Assessor, doing that,’ Icarium observed with another smile. His gaze lifted past her. ‘And yes, there he remains, my very own personal vulture. If 1 gesture him to us, do you think he will come, witch?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, still struggling with an overwhelming flood of relief and the aftermath of terror’s cold clutch that even now made her hands tremble. ‘No, he prefers to worship from a distance.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Worship? The man is deluded. Samar Dev, will you inform him of that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As you like, but it won’t matter, Icarium. His people, you see, they remember you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do they now.’ Icarium’s eyes narrowed slightly on the Senior Assessor, who had begun to cringe from the singular attention of his god.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpirits below, why was 1 interested in this monk in the first place? There is no lure to the glow of fanatical worship. There is only smug intransigence and the hidden knives of sharp judgement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps,’ said Icarium, ‘I must speak to him after all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’ll run away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In the compound, then-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where you can corner him?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jhag smiled. ‘Proof of my omnipotence.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSirryn Kanar’s exultation was like a cauldron on the boil, the heavy lid moments from stuttering loose, yet he had held himself down on the long walk into the crypts of the Fifth Wing, where the air was wet enough to taste, where mould skidded beneath their boots and the dank chill reached tendrils to their very bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, then, would be the home of Tomad and Uruth Sengar for the next two months, and Sirryn could not be more pleased. In the light of the lanterns the guards carried he saw, with immense satisfaction, that certain look on the Edur faces, the one that settled upon the expression of every prisoner: the numbed disbelief, the shock and fear stirring in the eyes every now and then, until they were once more overwhelmed by that stupid refusal to accept reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would take sexual pleasure this night, he knew, as if this moment now was but one half of desire’s dialogue. He would sleep satiated, content with the world. His world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked the length of the lowest corridor until reaching the very end. Sirryn gestured that Tomad be taken to the cell on the left; Uruth into the one opposite. He watched as the Edur woman, with a last glance back at her husband, turned and accompanied her three Letherii guards. A moment later Sirryn followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know that you are the more dangerous,’ he said to her as one of his guards bent to fix the shackle onto her right ankle. ‘There are shadows here, so long as we remain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I leave your fate to others,’ she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her for a moment. ‘You shall be forbidden visitors.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The shock goes away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, and he saw in her eyes raw contempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In its place,’ he continued, ‘comes despair.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Begone, you wretched man.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSirryn smiled. ‘Take her cloak. Why should Tomad be the only one to suffer the chill?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-244.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
