There were a hundred people gathered in the park, which was accessible only through two gated paths leading in and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center of the grounds, a dais had been erected, and half a dozen KIG executives were seated there. At the end of the row sat Richard Stevens\u0027s secretary, Betty Barker. She was an attractive patrician-looking woman in her thirties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner was at the microphone. \"?and this company was built by the dedication and loyalty of its employees.

I have to get to her.\" \"Be careful.\" Diane glanced around and said uneasily, \"This is too simple. I have a feeling we\u0027ve been-\" She turned to look back and gasped. Harry Flint and two of his men had appeared at one of the gates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane\u0027s eyes turned toward the second gate. It was blocked by Carballo and two more men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look!\" Diane\u0027s throat was dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly turned to see the six men blocking the exits. \"Is there any other way out of here?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Tanner was saying, \"Regrettably, recent misfortunes have come to several members of our family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when a tragedy befalls someone in the family, it affects us all. KIG is offering a five-million-dollar reward to anyone who can prove who or what is behind all of this.\" \"Five million dollars from one of his pockets into the other,\" Kelly said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner looked out over the crowd at Kelly and Diane, and his eyes were cold. \"We have two bereaved members here today, Mrs. Mark Harris and Mrs. Richard Stevens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to ask them to please come up here on the podium.\" \"We can\u0027t let him get us up there,\" Kelly said, horrified. \"We have to stay with the crowd. What do we do now?\" Diane looked at Kelly, surprised. \"What do you mean? You\u0027re the one who\u0027s going to get us out of here, remember? Start your plan.\" Kelly swallowed. \"It didn\u0027t work.\" Diane said nervously, \"Then go to plan B.\" \"Diane? \"Yes?\" \"There is no plan B.\" Diane\u0027s eyes widened. \"You mean you-you got us here with no way to get us out?\" \"I thought-\" Tanner\u0027s voice boomed over the loudspeaker. \"Would Mrs. Stevens and Mrs. Harris come up here now, please?\" Kelly turned to Diane and said miserably, \"I\u0027m-I\u0027m so sorry.\" \"It\u0027s my fault. I should never have let us come.\" The people in the crowd were turning to watch them. They were trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Stevens and Mrs. Harris? Kelly whispered, \"What are we going to do?\" Diane said, \"We have no choice. We\u0027re going up there.\" She took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.\" Reluctantly, the two women started slowly toward the podium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane was looking up at Betty Barker, whose eyes were fastened on her, a panicky look on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane and Kelly neared the podium, their hearts pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane was thinking, Richard, darling, I tried. No matter what happens, I want you to know that IThere was a sudden loud commotion at the back of the park. People were craning their necks to see what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen Roberts was making an entrance, accompanied by a large crew of cameramen and assistants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women turned to look. Kelly grabbed Diane\u0027s arm, beaming. \"Plan A has arrived!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen is here.\" And Diane looked up and said softly, \"Thank you, Richard.\" Kelly said, \"What?\" She suddenly realized what Diane meant. She said cynically,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Come on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen is waiting for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTANNER WAS WATCHING the scene, his face stiff. He called out, \"Excuse me. I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Roberts. This is a private memorial ceremony. I will have to ask you and your crew to leave.\" Ben Roberts said, \"Good morning, Mr. Kingsley. My show is doing a television segment with Mrs. Harris and Mrs. Stevens at the studio, but while we were here, I thought you might like to have us do a piece on the memorial service.\" Tanner shook his head. \"No, I can\u0027t permit you to stay here.\" \"Too bad. Then I\u0027ll just take Mrs. Harris and Mrs. Stevens over to the studio now.\" \"You can\u0027t,\" Tanner said harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen looked at him. \"I can\u0027t what?\" Tanner was almost trembling with fury. \"I-I mean-you?nothing.\" The women had reached Ben.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said softly, \"Sorry I\u0027m late. There was a breaking news story about a murder and-\" \"There was almost a breaking news story about two more,\" Kelly said. \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\" Tanner watched, frustrated, as Kelly, Diane, Ben Roberts, and his crew pushed past Tanner\u0027s men and walked out of the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry Flint looked over to Tanner for instructions. As Tanner slowly shook his head no, he was thinking, It\u0027s not over yet, bitches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDIANE AND KELLY got into the car with Ben Roberts. His crew was following in two vans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoberts looked at Kelly. \"Now, can you tell me what that was all about?\" \"I wish I could, Ben. But not yet. I will when I know what I\u0027m talking about. I promise.\" \"Kelly, I\u0027m a reporter. I need to know-\" \"Today you came as a friend.\" Roberts sighed. \"Right. Where would you like me to take you?\" Diane said, \"Would you drop us off at Forty-second Street and Times Square?\" \"You ve got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY MINUTES LATER, Kelly and Diane were getting out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly kissed Ben Roberts on the cheek. \"Thanks, Ben. I won\u0027t forget this. We\u0027ll stay in touch.\" \"Be safe.\" They turned to wave as they walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly said, \"I feel naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" \"Diane, we don\u0027t have any weapons. Nothing. I wish we had a gun.\" \"We have our brains.\" \"I wish we had a gun. Why are we here? What are we going to do now?\" \"We\u0027re going to stop running. From now on, we\u0027re on the offensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly looked at her curiously. \"What does that mean?\" \"It means I\u0027m sick and tired of us being the target of the day. We\u0027re going after them, Kelly.\" Kelly looked at Diane a moment. \"We\u0027re going after KIG?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"You\u0027ve been reading too many mysteries. How do you think the two of us can bring down the biggest think tank in the world?\" \"We\u0027re going to start by getting the names of all their employees who have died in the past few weeks.\" \"What makes you think there were more than Mark and Richard?\" \"Because the newspaper announcement said all their employees, so there were more than two people.\" \"Oh. And who\u0027s going to give us those names?\" \"I\u0027ll show you,\" Diane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE EASY ACCESS Internet Cafe was a vast computer hall containing more than a dozen rows of cubicles equipped with four hundred personal computers, nearly all of them in use. It was part of a chain that was springing up all over the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they walked in, Diane went to the card vending machine, to purchase an hour of Internet access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came back, Kelly said, \"Where do we start?\" \"Let\u0027s ask the computer.\" They found an empty cubicle and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly watched as Diane logged on to the Internet. \"What happens now?\" \"First we do a Google search to find the names of the other victims who were employees of KIG.\" Diane typed \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewww.google.com\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then typed in her search criteria: \"obituary\" and \"KIG.\" A long list of search hits appeared. Diane looked specifically for items in newspapers that were available online and found several. She clicked on those links, which led her to a series of recent obituaries and other articles. One article led her to KIG Berlin, and she accessed its Web site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is interesting?Franz Verbrugge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s he?\" \"The question is, where is he? He seems to have disappeared. He worked for KIG in Berlin, and his wife, Sonja, died mysteriously.\" Diane clicked onto another link. She hesitated and looked up at Kelly. \"In France-Mark Harris.\" Kelly took a deep breath and nodded. \"Go on.\" Diane pressed more keys. \"Denver, Gary Reynolds, and in Manhattan\"-Diane\u0027s voice broke-\"Richard.\" Diane stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly said, \"What now?\" \"We\u0027re going to figure out how to put all this together. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHALFWAY DOWN THE block, Kelly and Diane passed a computer store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute,\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane followed as Kelly walked into the store and approached the manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me. My name is Kelly Harris. I\u0027m Tanner Kingsley\u0027s assistant. We need three dozen of your very best and most expensive computers by this afternoon. Is that possible?\" The manager beamed. \"Why-why certainly, Mrs. Harris. For Mr. Kingsley, anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don\u0027t have them all here, of course, but we\u0027ll get them from our warehouses. I\u0027ll take care of it personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill that be cash or charge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"COD,\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the manager hurried away, Diane said, \"I wish I had thought of that.\" Kelly grinned. \"You will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I THOUGHT YOU would like to see these, Mr. Kingsley.\" Kathy Ordonez handed him several newspapers. The headlines told the story:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAUSTRALIA HAS FREAK TORNADO?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE FIRST TORNADO TO EVER HIT AUSTRALIA HAS?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDESTROYED A DOZEN VILLAGES.

Best wishes, Tanner Kingsley.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Tanner looked up at a computer screen when he heard the sound telling him he had received an alert from the security division of his Information Technology department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner had arranged for his IT department to have \"spiders\" installed-high-tech software that constantly combed the Internet, searching for information. Tanner had privately set the spiders to look for people searching for sensitive information relating to the deaths of Richard Stevens and Mark Harris, and he now stared with interest at the alert on the computer monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed a buzzer. \"Andrew, get in here.\" Andrew was in his office, daydreaming about his accident, and remembering. He was in the wardrobe room to get his spacesuit that the army had sent. He started to take one from the rack, but Tanner was there, and Tanner handed him a suit and gas mask. Wear this one. It will bring you luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner was-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andrew! Get in here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eANDREW HEARD THE command, got up, and slowly walked into Tanner\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Tanner.\" He took a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bitches just hit our Web site in Berlin. Do you know what that means?\" \"Yes?I-no.\" Tanner\u0027s secretary buzzed. \"The computers are here, Mr. Kingsley.\" \"What computers?\" \"The ones you ordered.\" Puzzled, Tanner rose and walked out the door into the reception room. Three dozen computers were piled up on dollies. The store manager and three men in overalls were standing next to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager\u0027s face lit up when he saw Tanner approaching. \"I have just what you asked for, Mr. Kingsley. State of the art. And we\u0027ll be happy to help you with any more-\" Tanner was staring at the pile of computers. \"Who ordered these?\" \"Your assistant, Kelly Harris. She said you needed them right away, so-\" \"Take them back,\" Tanner said softly. \"Where she\u0027s going, they won\u0027t be needed.\" He turned and walked back into his office. \"Andrew, do you have any idea why they accessed our Web site? Well, I\u0027ll tell you. They\u0027re going to try to track down the victims and look for the motives behind their deaths.\" Tanner sat down. \"To do that, they would have to go to Europe. Only they\u0027re not going to get there.\" Andrew said sleepily, \"No? \"How are we going to stop them, Andrew?\" Andrew nodded. \"Stop them? Tanner looked at his brother and said contemptuously, \"I wish there was someone with a brain that I could talk to.\" Andrew watched as Tanner walked over to a computer and sat at the keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to start by wiping out all their assets. We have their Social Security numbers.\" He kept typing as he talked. \"Diane Stevens?\" he mused as he used the back-door software KIG installed when they were hired to make Experian\u0027s systems Y2K-compliant. This back-door software gave Tanner access that not even the highest of Experian management could have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look. Experian has all her bank account information, an IRA retirement account, her line of credit at the bank. See?\" Andrew swallowed. \"Yes, Tanner. Yes.\" Tanner turned back to the computer. \"We\u0027ll enter her credit cards as stolen?. Now we\u0027re going to do the same with Kelly Harris?Our next step is going to Diane\u0027s bank\u0027s Web site.\" He accessed the bank\u0027s Web site and then clicked onto a link that said \"Manage Your Accounts.\" Next, Tanner entered Diane Stevens\u0027s account number and the last four digits of her Social Security number and was granted access. Once inside, he transferred all her balances to the line of credit, then returned to Experian\u0027s credit data base and canceled her line of credit under \"In Collection.\" \"Andrew-\" \"Yes, Tanner?\" \"Do you see what I\u0027ve done? I\u0027ve transferred all of Diane Stevens\u0027s assets as debts to be collected by their collection department.\" His tone filled with self-satisfaction. \"Now we\u0027ll do the same thing for Kelly Harris.\" When Tanner was through, he got up and walked over to Andrew. \"It\u0027s done. They have no money and no credit. There\u0027s no way they can get out of the country. We have them trapped. What do you think of your kid brother?\" Andrew nodded. \"On television last night, I saw a movie about a-\" Furious, Tanner clenched his fist and slammed it into his brother\u0027s face so hard that Andrew fell out of the chair and crashed into a wall, making a loud racket. \"You son of a bitch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen to me when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m talking to you.\" The door flew open and Tanner\u0027s secretary, Kathy Ordonez, rushed in. \"Is everything all right, Mr. Kingsley?\" Tanner turned to her. \"Yes. Poor Andrew fell down.\" \"Oh, dear.\" The two of them lifted Andrew to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I fall down?\" Tanner said gently, \"Yes, Andrew, but you\u0027re all right now.\" Kathy Ordonez whispered, \"Mr. Kingsley, don\u0027t you think your brother might be better off in a home?\" \"Of course he would,\" Tanner answered. \"But it would break his heart. This is his real home, and I can take care of him here.\" Kathy Ordonez looked at Tanner admiringly. \"You\u0027re a wonderful man, Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley.\" He shrugged modestly. \"We all have to do what we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTEN MINUTES LATER, Tanner\u0027s secretary was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good news, Mr. Kingsley.
