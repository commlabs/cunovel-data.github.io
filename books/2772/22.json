{"id":86669,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\u003cp\u003eI write about the Re-START trip, and I tell Vanessa about Lou asking my permission to marry my mom. I thought I\u0027d write a small note, but I end up getting carried away. I tell her about Caleb and Trish and Lenny ... by the time I\u0027m done I\u0027ve filled out the front and back of three pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get back home, Matt calls. He\u0027s really nervous about seeing his girlfriend again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you as a buffer,\" Matt says. \"Becca agreed to go out with me tomorrow night. I need you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not gonna be a third wheel, Matt.\" That\u0027s the last thing I want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things with Becca have been strained since the accident. I know you two will get along. Just ... come on, Maggie. You need to help me break the ice. Pleeease. I know you\u0027re not leaving for Spain for another couple of weeks. What else are you doing besides sulking about Caleb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sulking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. \"Okay, what have you done since coming back home from Re-START?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I unpacked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And ... ? You\u0027ve been home almost a week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And went to see Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 daffodils.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a blast so far. And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I just wrote a letter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt laughs again. \"Yeah, I see you have the most exciting life. I\u0027m surprised you have time to talk to me on the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so maybe Matt\u0027s right. I should go out with him and Becca tomorrow, and prove to myself that I\u0027m not living in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, fine,\" I tell Matt. \"But who am I going to find to go out with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got an idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no. I feel a headache coming on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be adventurous,\" Matt says, now totally excited. \"I\u0027ll find you a date. Just give me your address and be ready to go out tomorrow night at six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I hang up, I go to my room. There\u0027s a note on my bed. It\u0027s from my mom, telling me that my dad called and wants to talk to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crumple up the piece of paper, toss it in the trash, and sit on my bed staring at the garbage can. What\u0027s so important that he wants to talk to me now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to call and practically beg for five minutes of his time. I begged him to come back home, but he said he\u0027d moved on. Why should I give him the time of day now? He doesn\u0027t deserve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he plans to tell me his new wife is pregnant, does he expect me to jump up and down? Am I a bad person for resenting his new wife and his new life without me? He never once invited me to Texas to visit him. He shut me and my mom out in the same breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if he\u0027s sick? What if it\u0027s not that he\u0027s having a kid, but that he\u0027s got cancer or some other incurable condition? I hate my dad, but I still love him. I know that doesn\u0027t make sense, but then again, nothing in my life makes sense lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like a hypocrite telling my mom to give Caleb another chance when I\u0027m unwilling to give my father another chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up my phone and dial my father\u0027s number. I hold my breath each time the phone rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart, is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel numb when I hear his voice. Not excited, not angry, not anxiety-ridden. Just numb. \"Yeah, it\u0027s me. Mom said you called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait for the big news he needs to tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been trying to reach you for weeks. I have news,\" he says, then pauses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brace myself for it. Here it comes ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting divorced,\" he blurts out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa, I didn\u0027t expect to hear that. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be. Sometimes these things work out, and sometimes they don\u0027t. You want to know the best part?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m taken aback by his nonchalant attitude. \"The best part?\" I echo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m moving back in with you and Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have heard him wrong. \"You\u0027re moving back here? In our house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d be excited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Mom know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives a nervous laugh. \"Of course she knows, silly. Isn\u0027t it great news, Maggie? We\u0027ll be a family again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say without emotion. I\u0027m stunned, and I feel like my entire world has just tilted on its axis. \"That\u0027s, umm ... great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be flying in on Thursday, and the movers are coming on Friday to move my stuff back in. I\u0027ve got to get packing and wrapping things up here, so I\u0027ll see you next week. Bye, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs usual, he hangs up before I say bye back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait impatiently until my mom gets home at six. Before she can take her waitress uniform off, I corner her in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you letting Dad come live here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You called him,\" she says, stating the obvious. She slowly takes off her apron and drapes it over her arm. \"Because he\u0027s getting divorced and wants to try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re letting him? He left us, Mom. He left us and didn\u0027t look back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s looking back now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to give my dad a second chance, but then realize he\u0027s had many chances to come back and hasn\u0027t. I get a sinking feeling he\u0027ll only stay here until something better comes along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Lou?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe starts up the stairs. \"Lou is great, but he\u0027s not your dad. You always said you wanted to be a family again, Maggie. Your dad is the man I married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the man who divorced you. And replaced you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns around and waves a finger at me. \"Don\u0027t disrespect me. Your father made a mistake. He wants to make things right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears well in my eyes. \"Lou has been more of a dad than my own flesh and blood. He makes you happy. He makes us happy. I don\u0027t understand, Mom. It just doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops when she reaches the top of the stairs. \"I broke up with Lou tonight. I told him about your father coming back. It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can\u0027t be happening. Just when things were going right, they\u0027re all going wrong. I press my hands to my eyes, trying to shut out the world. But it\u0027s not about me. It\u0027s about my mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hobble as fast as I can up the stairs and envelop her in a big hug. I start to cry. \"I just want you to be happy, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugs me back and squeezes me tight. She\u0027s crying, too. \"I want you to be happy, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stand here, crying and holding each other for what seems like forever. We\u0027re two women who\u0027ve been left to fend for ourselves for a long time now. When the doorbell rings, it startles both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom wipes her eyes with the skirt of her uniform and heads back downstairs to open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lou!\" she says, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou is holding a huge bouquet of red roses in one hand and a ring box in the other. He kneels on the porch, and I notice his eyes are bloodshot and puffy as if he\u0027s been crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marry me, Linda.\" He opens the ring box and takes my mom\u0027s hand gently in his. \"Please tell me I\u0027m not too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeah, Lenny, and I are sitting in my parents\u0027 living room, waiting for my dad to come home. Leah\u0027s got her fingers folded neatly in her lap and Lenny is looking at her with one cocked eyebrow. I drilled him endlessly before we came here, making sure I had his word that he wouldn\u0027t talk about the accident or the fact that he knows I wasn\u0027t the one who really hit Maggie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Leah,\" Lenny says as he looks across the room at Leah with one eyebrow cocked. \"You got a boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whack Lenny on the chest with the back of my hand. \"What\u0027re you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me as if I\u0027m the crazy one. \"Makin\u0027 con versation, Caleb. Someone around here has got to fill the dead air. Neither of you is doin\u0027 such a bang-up job at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to fill the air with bullshit,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenny rolls his eyes. \"Okay, Mr. Crabbypants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t anyone ever tell you to talk only if you have something to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Leah interrupts, her voice almost a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenny and I both look at my sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks down at the carpeting. \"I meant no, I, uh, don\u0027t have a boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenny leans forward. \"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe if you smiled it would help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is this, the Lenny Self-Help Show? \"Seriously, man, shut the fuck up. What do you know about girls, anyway? You\u0027re in love with Trish and all you can do is piss her off and dump her in a lake. You don\u0027t know shit about girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you do?\" Lenny laughs. His stupid long hair falls in his eyes and he flicks it back. \"I got one word for you, Mr. Crabbypants-Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mention of Maggie, my sister\u0027s eyes meet mine. I bet we\u0027re both thinking about our little deception that messed up both our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to get some water,\" Leah mumbles, then scurries away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she disappears, the door opens. I stand, stiff at attention, as my dad walks through the front door. He\u0027s wearing a suit, carrying the briefcase he\u0027s had for the past ten years, and sporting the same mustache he\u0027s had for the past twenty years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he sees me, his expression goes from blank to shocked. He freezes in his tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Dad,\" I manage to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk toward him, not knowing if I should hug him or shake his hand or pat him on the back or ... do nothing. It\u0027s sad when your own father has become a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop in front of him. He\u0027s still holding his briefcase and staring at me. What do I say to him now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blurt out, \"I know I should have probably called and told you I was coming, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t heard from you in months, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I couldn\u0027t stay here anymore, Dad. Not like the way things were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother is sick,\" he tells me. \"She\u0027s been in the hospital on and off for months now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says it as if she has a terminal disease. I bet calling her \"sick\" is the standard excuse he\u0027s decided to use instead of saying \"she\u0027s in rehab\" or \"she\u0027s a drug addict.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step back, realizing this isn\u0027t going to be a joyous reunion where my father welcomes me back with open arms. I should have had a clue that\u0027s the way it was going to be when I saw my room had been converted to an office and all signs I\u0027d ever existed had vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s holding his briefcase in front of him, almost like a barrier between us. \"We didn\u0027t know if you were dead or alive. Your mother had to make up a story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn\u0027t be surprised. My mom is the queen of making up stories to make our family look good. \"What did she say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said we sent you to an exclusive boarding school in Connecticut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hearty, snorting laugh comes from the couch. Or, to be exact, it comes from Lenny who\u0027s sitting on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s that?\" my dad asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lenny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenny springs off the couch and envelops my dad in a huge bear hug. My dad steps back, totally caught off guard, but keeps his balance. I bet he\u0027s silently thanking his high school football coach for those balance drills in high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to meet you, Dad,\" Lenny says. \"Or should I call you Dr. Becker? Or Dr. B., or just Doc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push Lenny off my dad. \"Lenny\u0027s kind of a friend of mine,\" I tell my dad. \"More like a sidekick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figure that\u0027s better than explaining that Lenny is a delinquent who thinks he\u0027s funny and doesn\u0027t have a filter when it comes to his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad puts his briefcase in the hall closet and says to Lenny, \"You can call me Dennis.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-22.html","bookId":2772,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM"}
