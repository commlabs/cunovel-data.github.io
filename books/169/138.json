There weren\u0027t too many times when Hari felt annoyed with Dors. But this time, he was very annoyed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He said, \"What a foolish thing to do! Wasn\u0027t it enough that we were all staying at the Dome\u0027s Edge Hotel? That alone would have been sufficient to drive a paranoid ruler into thoughts of some sort of conspiracy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"How? We were unarmed, Hari. It was a holiday affair, the final touch of your birthday celebration. We posed no threat.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, but then you carried out your invasion of the Palace grounds. It was unforgivable. You raced to the Palace to interfere with my session with the General, when I had specifically-and several times-made it plain that I didn\u0027t want you there. I had my own plans, you know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Dors said, \"Your desires and your orders and your plans all take second place to your safety. I was primarily concerned about that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I was in no danger.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"That is not something I can carelessly assume. There have been two attempts on your life. What makes you think there won\u0027t be a third?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"The two attempts were made when I was First Minister. I was probably worth killing then. Who would want to kill an elderly mathematician?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Dors said, \"That\u0027s exactly what I want to find out and that\u0027s what I want to stop. I must begin by doing some questioning right here at the Project.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No. You will simply be upsetting my people. Leave them alone.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"That\u0027s exactly what I can\u0027t do. Hari, my job is to protect you and for twenty-eight years I\u0027ve been working at that. You cannot stop me now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Something in the blaze of her eyes made it quite clear that, whatever Seldon\u0027s desires or orders might be, Dors intended to do as she pleased.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon\u0027s safety came first.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1569/46795.html","bookId":169,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:46:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:46:46 AM"}
