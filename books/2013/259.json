Slaughtered by Letherii soldiers and mages. Clip is the Mortal Sword of Darkness. Had he been there, they would now still be alive-his kin. And the bodies lying motionless in the darkness would be Letherii. He wonders if he has not made a terrible mistake.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That thought,’ the young Tiste Andii said, ‘was fleeting. They were hunting for you, Fear Sengar. And you, Udinaas.’ He turned, his face appalling in its calm repose. The chains spun out, snapped in the cold air, then whirled back inward again. ‘My kin would have made certain there would remain no evidence that you were there. Nor were the Letherii mages powerful enough-nor clever enough-to desecrate the altar, although they tried.’ He smiled. ‘They brought their lanterns with them, you see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The gate didn’t stay there long enough anyway,’ Udinaas said in a cracking voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip’s hard eyes fixed on the ex-slave. ‘You know nothing.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know what’s spinning from your finger, Clip. You showed us once before, after all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin, finished with the second sword, now sheathed it and rose. ‘Udinaas,’ he said to Clip, ‘is as much a mystery as the Acquitor here. Knowledge and power, the hand and the gauntlet. We should move on. Unless,’ he paused, facing Clip, ‘it is time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime? Time for what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is,’ Udinaas said, using the Imass spear to get to his feet. ‘They knew they were going to die. Hiding in that deep pit took them nowhere. Fewer young, ever weaker blood. But that blood, well, spill enough of it…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip advanced on the ex-slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ Silchas Ruin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mortal Sword stopped, seemed to hesitate, then shrugged and turned away. Chain spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mother Dark,’ Udinaas resumed with a tight smile. ‘Open your damned gate, Clip, it’s been paid for.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the spinning chain snapped taut. Horizontally. At each end a ring, balanced as if on end. Within the band closest to them there was… darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac stared, as that sphere of black began growing, spilling out from the ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She has this thing,’ Udinaas muttered, ‘about birth canals.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin walked into the Dark and vanished. A moment later there was a ghostly flit as Wither raced into the gate. Kettle took Udinaas’s hand and led him through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren glanced over at Fear. We leave your world behind, Tiste Edur. And yet, 1 can see the realization awaken in your eyes. Beyond. Through that gate, Fear Sengar, waits the soul of Scabandari.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe settled a hand on his sword, then strode forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Seren Pedac followed, she looked at Clip, met his eyes as he stood there, waiting, the one hand raised, the gate forming a spiralling tunnel out from the nearest ring. In some other world, she imagined, the gate emerged from the other ring. He’s carried it with him. Our way through to where we needed to go. All this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClip winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChilled by that gesture, the Acquitor stepped forward and plunged into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird Maiden Isle was dead astern, rising into view on the swells then falling away again in the troughs. The ferry groaned like a floundering beast, twisting beneath its forest of masts and their makeshift sails, and the mass of Shake huddled sick and terrified on the deck. Witches and warlocks, on their knees, wailed their prayers to be heard above the gale’s swollen fury, but the shore was far away now and they were lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan Derryg, drenched by the spume that periodically thrashed over the low gunnels with what seemed demonic glee, was making his way towards Yan Tovis, who stood beside the four men on the steering oar. She was holding on to a pair of thick ratlines, legs set wide to take the pitch and yawl, and as she studied her half-brother’s face as he drew nearer, she saw what she already knew to be truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re not going to make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCleaving the lines once past the salt marsh, then up, rounding the peninsula and out along the north edge of the reefs, a journey of three days and two nights before they could tie up in one of the small coves on the lee side of Third Maiden Isle. The weather had held, and at dawn this day all had seemed possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The seams, Twilight,’ Yedan Derryg said upon reaching her. ‘These waves are hammering ‘em wide open. We’re going down-’ He barked a savage laugh. ‘Beyond the shore, be well as they say! More bones to the deep!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pale-as pale as she no doubt was-yet in his eyes there was a dark fury. ‘Tour’s Spit lies two pegs off the line, and there’re shoals, but, sister, it’s the only dry land we might reach.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-259.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
