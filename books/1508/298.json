Although his White Peak Sect was ranked tenth out of the 18 third-grade sects, they still weren’t much different from the Seven Profound Valleys – their strength was about the same. But now, the Seven Profound Valleys’ third ranked disciple had actually come out to challenge their chief disciple, this was just looking down on them too much.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt had to be known that the Seven Profound Valleys’ Jiang Baoyun had come to White Peak Sect last year to challenge them, but had been defeated by Zhang Shaoshan!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot just that, but the talent list that Divine Phoenix Island drew up had caused the White Peak Sect elder to fume with self-righteous anger. There were 27 earth-step talents, and 17 of those spots had been taken by the six top third-grade sects, which included Peacock Mountain. He couldn’t say anything about that, but of those 10 measly leftover sports, two of them had been dominated by the Seven Profound Valleys, leaving only eight spots left over for 12 sects to share. White Peak Sect actually hadn’t even been given a spot!

Zhang Shaoshan awkwardly dodged the blade, however, the raging fire that was supported by nine Hollow Flame Essences was too fierce. The waves of fire directly melted away Zhang Shaoshan’s true essence protection, lighting his clothes on fire and burning off his eyebrows.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“How is this possible!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eClang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe treasure sword left its sheath, all of Zhang Shaoshan’s previously boastful demeanor was gone.

However, he didn’t expect that facing his fierce attack, Mugu Buyu would not only not dodge, but rush straight towards his sword!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a deafening explosion, Zhang Shaoshan’s sword had pierced through Mugu Buyu’s pure golden shell.

Zhang Shaoshan was a swordsman, so his defense was never very good. Before, the Evil Fire God’s strike had almost shattered the martial stage’s protective array formation, so how could he defend against it?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePu!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the power of fire entered his body, Zhang Shaoshan was just like a broken kite as he flew backwards, his organs injured and his blood churning in reverse.

In the air, there was no leverage for him to move, and he had been seriously wounded. His true essence was chaotic, and he couldn’t use another powerful sword skill again.

The Evil Fire God puppet’s attack power was too abnormally strong. Zhang Shaoshan could not dodge it, and a single blow sent his sword flying away. As for that golden shell around Mugu Buyu, that was even stranger. It had actually been able to withstand the White Peak 13 Swords without a single scratch!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was just too terrifying!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat the other sects’ elders didn’t know was that Mugu Buyu’s Scarlet Gold Tortoise had managed to continuously withstand two strikes from Lin Ming’s Purple Flood Dragon Divine Thunder, one of which was even mixed with the Evil Fire God’s flame, creating a massive thunderflame explosion. Even then, it had only been slightly cracked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn terms of defensive power, Mugu Buyu was the number one ranked among the entire younger generation of the Seven Profound Valleys, Lin Ming could not hold a candle to him. A True Essence Force Field was a type of power of Law that was even above the Concept of Wind, and was one of the two ultimate legacy secret techniques of the Puppet Faction. Its reputation was well-earned.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeeing Mugu Buyu’s full combat potential, Jiang Baoyun let out a breath of cold air. ‘His main body has near-absolute defense, and the Evil Fire God has irresistible attack power. Also, that alligator puppet has a devouring ability that can contain movements, causing any attack to be undodgeable. This multi-dimensional attack system from Mugu Buyu can almost be called perfect. Unfortunately, his opponent was Lin Ming, and all of this became useless. If I encountered him, I do not have absolute assurance that I could defeat him.’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a sense, Mugu Buyu’s ability to restrain an opponent’s speed was able to suppress Jiang Baoyun. As for Lin Ming, his abnormal attack power was able to overwhelm the defense of Mugu Buyu. Therefore Lin Ming had been able to relatively easily defeat Mugu Buyu, and yet engage in an extended battle with Jiang Baoyun.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Seven Profound Valleys deacons hurried on stage to lift up the unconscious Zhang Shaoshan and carry him down.
