As soon as he freed her, he massaged her wrists, forearms and biceps. “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm. Tired.” She rubbed her mouth on the dark hair bisecting his torso from his chest hair to his groin. He smelled so good right there. All warm, musky male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop tempting me to go another round with you tonight, woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you could, couldn’t you? Go another round.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell tipped her chin up to peer into her face. “That’s the sex-drunk part of you talking.” He brushed his thumb over her lower lip. “But yeah. All I have to do is look at you and I want you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis man could undo her on more levels than she had brain power to contemplate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to know. But you wore me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So crash. It’s been a long night. I’m draggin’ ass myself.” He pulled the sheets back for her and she crawled in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she nestled her head into the pillow and drifted off, she wondered if she should ask him what happened next, not only tomorrow, but next week and in the next month, now that the reunion was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia woke up alone. Not the first time that’d happened when she spent the night at Tell’s place. The man had to get up at the crack of dawn every morning—didn’t matter if it was the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft breeze wafted through the bedroom window. She rolled onto her stomach, stretching out on the cool sheets that smelled like Tell. She’d never paid much attention to a man’s scent before, but his was so distinctive—sunshine, salty musk, the subtle aroma of laundry soap and a hint of lime shaving cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMmm. She wondered if his scent would linger on her skin all day. There was incentive not to jump in the shower. Maybe if she remained naked, when Tell returned, he could rub that scent all over her body again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was imagining Tell’s very inventive ways of waking her up, when voices drifted down the hallway. She rolled and jackknifed, clutching the sheet to her bare chest. Who was here at—she squinted at the alarm clock—nine thirty on a Sunday morning? She listened. She couldn’t discern the words, but she made out two distinct male voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelax. Probably just one of his brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn’t like she could go out and meet the fam. She’d have to stay put because her only clothing was the fancy dress she’d worn last night. A dress that Tell had thoughtfully draped over the chair. When had he done that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it a prompt for her to get dressed? Since he’d also set her underwear, bra, shoes and purse on the dresser—directly in her line of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer doubts from last night pushed front and center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened now? He’d taken her to the reunion; she’d lined up judging gigs for him. Technically they’d each gotten what they wanted. Tell hadn’t mentioned wanting more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither have you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what were her options?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrawl back in bed and yank the covers over her head?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet dressed and face the day—and Tell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOption two won out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she entered the kitchen, Tell didn’t hug her or kiss her. In fact, he didn’t even get up from his seat at the table. He just gave her a once-over and a small smile. “Morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is my brother Dalton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze winged between the two men. Same dark hair, same blue eyes. Dalton had rugged features where Tell’s were sharply defined. Dalton was a big guy—he had a couple inches on Tell and thirty pounds—all muscle, from the looks of it. Most likely Dalton had the same shit-eating grin as his older brother. But there was no sign of it as his gaze moved over Georgia. She fought the urge to fuss with her disheveled appearance, choosing instead to raise her chin a notch and give him an equally cool stare. “Hey, Dalton. I remember you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Georgia. You’re lookin’—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell smacked him in the back of the head. “Shut it, asshole. Why are you even here? Don’t you have something to do today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDalton scowled. “Not me, we. I’m waitin’ on you, because we both have to deal with that one thing, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What one thing?” Tell asked with confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know. That one thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Oh! That one thing. Gotcha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk about vague. Was “that one thing” some secret man code for lemme help you get rid of your pesky overnight female guest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, if the looks exchanged between the McKay boys were any indication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia’s cheeks burned. Yeah, she was some class act the morning after her high school reunion—wearing last night’s wrinkled clothes, smelling of sex, sporting bed head and dragon breath. No wonder Tell had the look of a trapped animal. Was he worried she’d somehow embarrass him in front of his studly younger brother? By acting clingy? Or worse…by making herself at home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew that. She’d hold her head up high. She could act casually slutty, as if rolling out of a man’s bed after a night of hair-pulling, toe-curling sex was a regular occurrence for a tigress like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig talk, Hot Lips. You’d run out the door if you could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers tightened on her purse. “I know you’re a busy man, Tell. But I’m afraid I’ll need a ride home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem. I’ll take you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want me to ride along?” Dalton asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth she and Tell froze, but they didn’t look at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah. I’ll be back in thirty and we can go do that one thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Tell wasn’t planning to hang out at her place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia could feel Tell’s gaze on her as he held open the front door. She never pulled the I’m-so-busy-I’m-constantly-needed-on-my-cell-phone type of avoidance—but she was doing it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so engrossed in the info on her phone she didn’t even glance at Tell after he helped her into his pickup. She was so immersed in the text scrolling across the screen she paid no attention to Tell McKay at all. Muttering to herself as she pretended to ignore the Wyoming countryside rolling by out passenger side window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something wrong?” Tell finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” She paused, wondering if she should take the chance and ask if she’d see him this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry Dalton showed up this morning. I completely forgot I told him I would—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up the hand that wasn’t poking keys on her phone’s keypad, but she didn’t deign to look away from the screen. “No need to explain. I had to hit the road anyway, I’m just sorry I had to tear you away from your plans and you have to give me a ride. This is why I insist on driving. I hate being stuck somewhere without my car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Takin’ you home ain’t a problem, Georgia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hard set to his jaw and the clipped tone belied that statement. “I see my boss left me several e-mails about expecting updated status reports on three projects I was supposed to have finished last week. Now I know what I’ll be doing this week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia heaved a heavy sigh. “Burning the midnight oil. I won’t have time to breathe, let alone do anything else.” There was Tell’s opening, if he wanted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn’t take it. He didn’t counter with a list of things he needed to accomplish this week and then ask if they could carve out time for each other at some point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell left the engine idling when he pulled into her driveway. He didn’t offer to help her out of his truck like he always did. But he did reach for her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia looked at him. Damn man was so freakin’ gorgeous it was unreal. And it smacked her pride that he was done with her. Fine. She’d be done with him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter to end it now rather than dragging it out until the end of summer. Didn’t last night with all the people in this town who are happy to see you miserable just prove that nothing, not even a smokin’ hot, super sweet cowboy who rocks your world in bed and comforts you when you cry, will convince you to stay in Sundance, Wyoming, anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat snarky little conscience of hers had taken on a southern drawl and prompted her back to the cold reality of this situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet Tell brought her knuckles to his mouth for a soft kiss. “I had a great time with you last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “Georgia. I—” at the same time her cell phone rang in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDammit. And it was her boss too. Calling her on a Sunday. She hadn’t been lying entirely; she had a shit ton to do this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell retreated. “You’d better get that, bein’ you’re so busy and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia snatched her purse and bailed out without looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate Monday morning, Tell drove to Ben’s place to work on the baler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d been wrenching on the machine for over an hour when Ben said, “I’m takin’ a break before I haul out the sledgehammer and use it to try and fix this piece of shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good idea.” Tell threw his tools onto the canvas cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So how was your reunion?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiped the sweat from his brow. “All right, I suppose. Didn’t seem a whole lot different from high school, except for the bar in the gym.” And for the fact he fucked Georgia in the history classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen chuckled. “Booze was the only thing that made mine bearable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It helps if you’ve got a hot woman hanging on your arm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t know. I went to my reunion solo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat surprised Tell. “Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. I wouldn’t have gone at all except I found out the girl I’d been crushing on for years was coming. Naturally I wanted to show her how much she’d missed out on by not getting with me back then, and by giving her the chance to rectify that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And did it work?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “Oh yeah. We drank. We danced. We ignored everyone. We ended up doin’ it in the boys’ locker room and missed the awards ceremony. Then we went back to her hotel room and fucked all night. Her plane left early the next morning. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissin-tell-rough-riders-13/page-32.html","bookId":2694,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:54 AM"}
