Now, how many times do we need to go over this?\" Pause, exhale. \"Nor would you have a chance to open that other club you\u0027re planning to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-open behind all our backs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re both silent. I can envision a slow, triumphant smile pulling Alison\u0027s lips upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why you think these things, Alison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up. I will only continue this conversation at Indochine.\" A pause that I let happen. Because of it, Alison calls out, \"Ted-could you ring up Spy Bar for me?\" She clicks off, daring me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePast the limousine parked out front next to a giant pile of black and white confetti and up the stairs into Indochine, where Ted the maitre d\u0027 is being interviewed by \"Meet the Press\" wearing a giant top hat, and I ask him, \"What\u0027s the story?\" Never breaking eye contact with the camera crew, I follow his finger as it points to a booth in the rear of the empty, freezing restaurant, noise from the latest PJ Harvey CD in the dank background. Alison spots me, stubs out a joint and gets up from a table where she\u0027s on her Nokia 232 cell phone to Nan Kempner and eating cake with Peter Gabriel, David LaChapelle, Janeane Garofalo and David Koresh, all of them discussing lacrosse and the new monkey virus, a copy of this month\u0027s Mademoiselle next to each plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison pulls me into the back of the restaurant, pushes me into the men\u0027s room and slams the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s make this quick,\" she growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if there\u0027s any other way with you,\" I sigh, spitting out a piece of bubble gum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lunges at me, clamping her mouth onto mine. In a matter of seconds she pulls back and frantically tears open a zebra-print waistcoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were so cold to me earlier,\" she pants. \"As much as I hate to admit it, I got wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen you all day, baby.\" I\u0027m pulling her tits out of a beige push-up bra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the Alfaro show, baby.\" She pulls an electro-cut miniskirt with charred seams up over tan thighs, pushing down a white pair of panties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, how many times do we need to go through this?\" I\u0027m unbuttoning my jeans. \"I wasn\u0027t at the Alfaro show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god, you\u0027re such an absolute dick,\" she groans. \"You spoke to me at the Alfaro show, baby.\" She glares cross-eyed while thrusting her tongue in and out of my mouth. \"Barely, but you spoke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m at her neck and in mid-lick I straighten up, my pants falling to the floor, and just stare into her sex-crazed face. \"You\u0027re smoking wa-a-a-ay too much weed, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor...\" She\u0027s delirious, my hand in her crotch, two now three fingers inside her, lolling her head back, licking her own lips, grinding down on my hand, her pu**y tightening around my fingers. \"I\u0027m just about through with this-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just come here.\" She grabs my dick, squeezes it hard and pulls it condomless toward her, rubbing its head along the lips of her pu**y. \"Feel this? Is this real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Against my better instincts, yes,\" I say, slamming into her, just how Alison likes it. \"But baby, I sense someone is causing major mischief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, just f**k me harder,\" she groans. \"And lift up your shirt. Let\u0027s see that bod work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterwards, walking slowly back through the deserted restaurant, I grab a half-drunk Greyhound off a table and swish some around in my mouth before, spitting it back into the highball glass. While I\u0027m wiping my lips with the sleeve of my jacket, Alison turns to me, sated, and admits, \"I\u0027ve been followed all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop moving. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just so you know, I\u0027ve been followed all day.\" She lights a cigarette while moving past me, drifting by busboys setting up tables for tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alison-are you telling me that those goons are outside right now?\" I slam my hand against a table. \"Oww-oh shit, Alison.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-48.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
