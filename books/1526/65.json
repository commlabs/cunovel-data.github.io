The sudden silence felt huge and empty, as if something vital had been removed from the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley saw one of the guards look in her direction. Under his bony brow, tears were in his eyes, and something else too-hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that all about?\" Michaelson asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just ran out of time. Mo\u0027amba\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen was just starting to stand when it hit. Like an explosion between his ears. He stumbled back to his knees. At first, he thought some bomb must have detonated, like the one attached to Jason\u0027s waist, but when he pried his eyes open, Jason was just staring at him with a quizzical look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" the boy asked, seemingly unaware of what had just transpired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen nodded. \"I think so…\" Then the world went black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell? He struggled but seemed to be floating in a space without stars, nothing to push against, nothing to fight. He was not unconscious, just surrounded by an infinite blackness. Then a single dull ember appeared, glowing in the darkness ahead. As he concentrated on this landmark, like some distant beacon, the glow intensified to a bright flame. It spoke, vibrating with each word, in his grandfather\u0027s voice. \"… Ben… Ben… you must… hurry…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now, Ben could recognize one of Mo\u0027amba\u0027s callings. But now was not the time. \"What is it? What\u0027s wrong? Is Ashley okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"… weak… tired…\" The flame died again to only a feeble flicker. \"… must hurry…\" It flickered bright for a heartbeat. \"Danger…\" Then it faded, first back to a dull glow, then to nothing. And in the darkness, Ben felt an emptiness. Somehow he knew that Mo\u0027amba had not just broken contact but was gone. Gone for good. As the world reappeared around him, he found tears trailing down his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben, what\u0027s wrong?\" Jason was shaking his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed off the stone floor where he had collapsed. Mo\u0027amba was dead. He knew this as sure as he knew his father\u0027s name. \"I\u0027m okay,\" he answered the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fainted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m fine.\" He patted the boy\u0027s knee, while pondering the meaning of Mo\u0027amba\u0027s final urgent message. He had wanted Ben to return immediately. Not to waste any more time. But what was the hurry? Ben still had seven hours before his deadline. Something must be up. A new danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason looked at him with concern but didn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen glanced at the timer on the boy\u0027s belt. The number five still glowed on the panel. Hurry, Mo\u0027amba had urged. No kidding. He needed a plan. A way to contact Harry. Get him back here to defuse the bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it dawned on him… Hell, why didn\u0027t he think of this earlier?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did have a means of contacting Harry. Well, at least Nob\u0027cobi, who could then tell Harry to get his butt back here. Mo\u0027amba\u0027s calling reminded him. He could do the same. He had never tried it at such a distance… and it was doubtful that Nob\u0027cobi was in a relaxed trance state, susceptible to his calling, but it was possible. Mo\u0027amba had done it to him before. He had to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jason, I know this is gonna seem bloody bonkers, but I\u0027m gonna need to concentrate. I need you to stay quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, but what-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh. Later.\" Ben sat down cross-legged, closing his eyes and breathing deeply. He again pictured his childhood home outside Perth. The orange dust. The \u0027roos in the distance. Home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat in a creaking chair on the porch again, not bothering with a beer this time. Instead he concentrated fiercely on Nob\u0027cobi\u0027s image, visualizing the hunter sitting next to him. He filled in the details of the hunter\u0027s features. The scar across his cheek, the graying patch of fur at the top of his head. As he concentrated, the image flickered into reality for a heartbeat. Nob\u0027cobi\u0027s surprised face turned to him, then winked back out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it! Ben concentrated again. C\u0027mon, Nob\u0027cobi, you saw me there for a second. You know what I want. He pressed forward again. C\u0027mon, listen to me. Nothing. He persisted for what seemed like several wasted minutes. Minutes he didn\u0027t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust before he was ready to scream in frustration and give up, Nob\u0027cobi appeared. He seemed winded. \"What do you want?\" he growled at Ben. \"I almost tripped and fell with that first call. You\u0027re supposed to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough! I need Harry back here. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027re heading back that way. That crak\u0027an must have it in for you. It gave up chasing us and turned back your way. Are you cleared out of there yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027ve got a problem. I need Harry and you to forget about Tiny Tim and meet me back at the office. Run as fast as you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better do the same. That crak\u0027an is coming your way fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry.\" But Nob\u0027cobi had already vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen pushed back out of his dream state and found Jason staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story,\" he said scrambling up. \"We\u0027ve got company coming.\" With a relieved sigh, he noticed Jason\u0027s LED readout showed a 4. Time moved oddly in the dreaming place. It seemed like he was there a lot longer than a mere moment. \"Can you run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason shifted from foot to foot, obviously full of nervous energy. \"Oh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then come on.\" Ben grabbed his hand and hurried away, just as he made out the sound of Tiny Tim scrabbling toward them from the other direction. He increased the pace to a vigorous run. The office was barely a hundred yards away. He reached it with Jason in tow in less than a minute. The readout on the belt changed from 4 to 3 just as he pushed through into the trashed reception area. Now just bloody hurry, Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen crossed to the door leading to the building\u0027s offices and knocked. \"It\u0027s Ben,\" he called. He heard the deadbolt being released; the door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy\u0027s worried face peered out. She spotted Jason and her eyes widened. \"You found the boy!\" She rushed out and scooped him up in a hug as if he were some sort of life preserver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a voice behind him. \"So what\u0027s the big rush?\" Harry stumbled into the reception area. Nob\u0027cobi stepped carefully in behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen noticed Jason\u0027s eyes widen with surprise at his first glimpse of the mimi\u0027swee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen grabbed Harry\u0027s shoulder and pulled him forward. \"Jason\u0027s rigged with explosives. We only have a couple minutes before it blows. I need you to defuse it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell?\" Harry said, crossing to Jason. \"Let me see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Ben\u0027s words, Sandy had released Jason as if he carried the plague and backed away into the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason pointed to the belt, but kept looking over Harry\u0027s shoulder at Nob\u0027cobi as Harry knelt down beside him. The number 2 glowed red. Gingerly, Harry fingered the device, having Jason spin around so he could examine the entire belt. \"Hmmm,\" was all he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Ben asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen this work before. All ready-made. The triggering device is housed in this little tin box. Even if we had time and tools, I can\u0027t get to it without significant risk. Without the code, this baby is gonna blow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn it!\" Ben blurted. \"Then we\u0027re screwed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry shrugged and reached up for the clasp of the belt, triggering an alarmed \"Don\u0027t!\" from Jason. Harry ignored him and yanked it open. The belt merely parted and fell free from his waist. Harry stood up, holding the belt away from him as if it were some snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason tumbled away. \"It was supposed to explode if you took it off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you that?\" Harry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Khalid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was lying. There\u0027s no circuit around the belt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason stood there trembling. \"Then I… I could have taken that off… anytime.\" Ben noticed the boy seemed more disturbed by this fact than by the fact that he had been about to be blown up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry nodded. \"Yep. Now if you don\u0027t mind\"-he pointed at the number 1 glowing on the belt-\"this thing\u0027s still going to explode.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen snatched the belt from Harry. \"Everyone to the back of the building. I\u0027m gonna toss this baby as far as I can. Then run like hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry herded everyone into the hall as Ben headed for the door. From behind him, Harry called, \"Don\u0027t throw like a girl. There\u0027s a shitload of plastic hooked to that belt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just get everyone to the far side of the building!\" Ben dashed out the door. He sprinted several feet away from the building to get a clear path to lob the belt. As he raised his arm, the beast pounced at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a mere ten feet away, the wounded crak\u0027an leaped in front of him, head low, hissing with cold menace. It blocked the entire way forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen scrambled for his pistol, but his hand came back empty. He had left the gun in the building. Ben backed up a few steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny Tim opened its jaws wide and howled at him in triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you!\" Ben whipped the belt toward the open maw, then spun on his heel and ran for the safety of the building. He risked a glance over his shoulder and saw the beast paw at its mouth, trying to dislodge the belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBastard, you just bit off more than you can chew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen flew through the demolished front door and dived for the hallway. Just as he reached the threshold, the explosion ripped the world apart behind him. The force of the explosion grabbed him and threw him down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did his best to roll when he hit, but something snapped as he collided with the hallway floor. Debris rained upon him as he lay sprawled in the hallway. A choking smoke quickly followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason appeared at his side. \"Ben, are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer, he just groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry knelt down. \"Let me take a look at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen pushed to his hands and knees, coughing smoke from his throat. Pain flared at the base of his neck. His shoulder felt dislocated, but he\u0027d live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen glanced up to Jason\u0027s concerned face. \"When we get out of this, I\u0027m buying you a pair of suspenders. No more belts.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-65.html","bookId":1526,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM"}
