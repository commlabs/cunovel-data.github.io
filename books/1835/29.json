Mostly I thought about how to get it, and when I finally did get it, then I thought about how to get it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t know whether to laugh or be angry. The conversation was ludicrous. “You’re saying that every second of every waking hour that’s what you both were thinking about when you were teenagers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty much,” Nick said. “So we know where they’re coming from and what they’re after. Maybe I ought to go outside and have a little talk with them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you dare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick came up with a better idea. He’d intimidate them. He pulled his T-shirt up over his gun and tucked the material behind it so that the weapon was clearly visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe watched him. “That ought to discourage them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Nick was opening the front door for Laurant, he smiled and said, “Maybe I ought to shoot a couple of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant rolled her eyes as she went past him, ignoring his scowl. Waving to her entourage, she jogged across the street and introduced Nick to the boys. She told them that he was her fiancé. The kids all noticed Nick’s gun, of course, but they gave it only a cursory glance before returning their full attention to Laurant’s considerable assets. They didn’t even look at him when Laurant explained that Nick worked for the FBI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all came down to spandex versus a loaded weapon, and spandex won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick stayed right behind her as she ran. The boys fell into step around the two of them, taking turns trying to engage Laurant in conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDonut boy was the first to fade. Three others quickly followed. Laurant gradually picked up the pace, her long legs eating up the pavement as she gracefully glided forward. She’d been right about her fan club’s endurance. By the time they reached the entrance to the park, the last two boys were doubled over and panting for breath. Nick heard one of them gag and got an inordinate amount of pleasure from the sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant loved this time of day. It was so peaceful and quiet and lovely. For an hour she forced herself to forget about everything and concentrate only on the path. The rain last night had left the leaves damp, but she knew that by noon, they would all be dried out again. A drought had hit Iowa hard, and the weeds and scrub were brown. As she rounded the bend around the blue water lake, the entrance to the nature preserve was on her right. There were a good ten acres of tall brown prairie grass. Like wheat, it swayed in the gentle morning breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe passed the abbot’s cabin and had the feeling that Agent Wesson was watching her, but she couldn’t see him because the blinds were drawn. The dock to the right of the cabin and behind was sitting up high out of the water, another sign of the lack of rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat trickled down the back of her neck and between her br**sts by the time she’d made a complete circle around the lake. She slowed down, then stopped, doubled over and took long deep breaths. She could hear Nick panting behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding there, they were easy targets. He did a quick survey of the dense forest and overgrown brush around them, and moved closer to her. His T-shirt was covered with sweat. With the back of his arm he wiped his forehead. She could catch her breath when they were back home. “Let’s get out of here. Do we walk or run home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We jog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys were waiting at the park entrance. Grinning like idiots, they once again fell into step around Nick and Laurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wimps,” Nick muttered as Laurant waved good-bye to the boys and sprinted up the front walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the door was shut behind them, Nick relaxed. “Damn, it’s humid out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you think of our lake? Isn’t it beautiful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw it yesterday,” he reminded her. “When we went to see Wesson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But isn’t it lovely? It’s a fisherman’s paradise. You can actually see the fish in the clear, rock-bottomed water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah? I didn’t notice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had her hands on her h*ps and was still panting a bit. “How could you not notice? What were you looking at?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All the places the bastard could hide. He could have had you in his sights from the moment we entered the park until the moment we left, and I never would have spotted him. I can’t let you do that run again. You hear me, Wesson? The unsub could have been hiding anywhere. There’s too much territory to cover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth went dry when she tried to speak. “You think he’ll use a gun to . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s an up close and personal kind of guy,” Nick said. “He might try to wing you to slow you down though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There were other agents keeping both of you in their sights all the while you were in the park,” Joe added as Laurant passed him on her way to get some bottled water. He followed her into the kitchen and continued. “You both were safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant returned to the living room, tossed Nick a bottle of Evian, and opened her own. She took a big drink and headed for the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to take a shower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” Nick said as he went up the stairs ahead of her. He looked in the bathroom to make sure there weren’t any surprises waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was being overly cautious, and she was thankful for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, go ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could shower in the other bathroom down the hall,” she suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick was sitting on the bed talking on the phone when she came out of the bathroom fifteen minutes later. Her hair was dripping down her back, and she was wearing a short cotton robe that had seen better days. He took one look at her and promptly lost his train of thought. He knew she was na*ed under that thin material, and he had to force himself to turn away so he could concentrate on his conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, Theo, we’ll talk about this when I get back to Boston. All right?” He hung up the phone and slowly turned his head to get a glimpse of Laurant out of the corner of his eye. He watched her open the dresser drawer and take out two little wisps of lace. Immediately, his mind went to visions of her wearing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet a grip, he told himself. She was off-limits, and he had no business fantasizing about her. What the hell kind of a friend was he to lust after Tommy’s sister?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerating himself didn’t do any good. He wanted her. Simple as that. There, he finally admitted the obvious. Now what was he going to do about it? Nothing, he decided. Not a damned thing. Even if she weren’t his friend’s sister, he wouldn’t get involved with her. A relationship between the two of them was impossible. It would never work out, and she’d end up hating him. She wanted what she had never had, a family and kids, lots of kids, and he didn’t want any of that. He’d seen too much to ever let himself become that vulnerable. Even though he came from a family of eight, he was still a loner, and that’s the way he liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never should have kissed her. Bad idea, he decided. He hadn’t been prepared, hadn’t realized how good it was going to be. God, he was arrogant. He actually thought he could remain distant and professional, but when she wrapped her arms around him and he felt her soft lips, thoughts of being professional went flying out the window, and he’d turned into one of those perverted teenagers outside. All he could think about was getting her flat on her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Morganstern was right after all. Maybe Nick was too close and personal for this assignment. His boss had been referring to his friendship with Tommy though. What would Pete think if he knew that his agent was lusting after the friend’s sister? Nick already knew the answer to that question. Pete would have his hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang again. Nick answered it, listened for a minute, and then said, “Yes, Monsignor. I’ll be sure to tell him. Thanks for calling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant was standing in the closet doorway, shifting from bare foot to bare foot as she searched through the clothes crammed together on the single, bowed rod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Nick hung up, she asked, “Was that Monsignor McKindry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Oh, yeah, it was. Tommy left his Daytimer in the kitchen, and Monsignor said he’d mail it to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he mention when Tommy and Noah left?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he answered. “At the crack of dawn. Laurant, for the love of God, put some clothes on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept sorting through her clothes as she answered him. “As soon as you give me a little privacy, I’ll be happy to get dressed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear the embarrassment in her voice. “Okay, okay,” he said, feeling like an idiot. Heading for her shower, he added, “Don’t leave the bedroom until I’m dressed, and keep the door locked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joe’s downstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, well, I still want you to wait for me.” His voice didn’t leave room for argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran after him. He was peeling his T-shirt off as she reached behind him to grab her hair dryer and brush from the counter behind the sink. Her hand accidentally rubbed against the base of his spine, and he reacted as though she’d just burned him with her curling iron. He flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” she stammered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed as he tossed the T-shirt into the sink. “I made you feel awkward again, didn’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were standing toe to toe, facing each other. She clutched the robe to her chest with one hand and gripped the hair dryer and brush with the other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Mr. Wesson listening?” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “The pin’s on the dresser with the earpiece.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want it to be awkward, but it’s just that we kissed. I know we were supposed to, but I . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, she said, “It just made things awkward again. That’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We both got . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d been staring at his toes until he’d said that word. Her eyes flew to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, we did. What do we do about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get past it,” he suggested. “I know one way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sparkle in his eyes should have been a warning. “How?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take a shower with me. That should get you past your shyness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so shocked by the suggestion she laughed, which was exactly what he wanted her to do. The tension vanished. His grin was comical. “You’ve got that leer down perfectly,” she told him as she turned around and left the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the mirror was still clouded with steam, and the bathroom was sweltering, Nick told her to leave the door open. She waited until she heard the shower running, then hurried to get dressed and dry her hair. Since they were going shopping for an engagement ring, she decided to dress up a little, and she put on her white pleated slacks and a peach silk blouse. Then she found her white canvas slip-ons in the back of the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick made the bed while she brushed her hair. The coverlet was all lopsided when he was finished, but she didn’t criticize his effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick wore jeans and a white polo shirt. He clipped the leather holster to his belt. Then he pinned the red disc back on, added the earpiece, and shoved his wallet in his back pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, so what’s the schedule?” he asked after he gave her a quick once-over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some breakfast first because I’m starving, then the grocery store for Joe. After that, I want to check on my store to see if they’ve started on the floors yet. If they haven’t, I’ll work there all afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then the jewelry store,” he suggested as he slipped on a pair of leather loafers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got to pick up the bridesmaid dress too,” she remembered. “And I should spend an hour or two at the abbey. I’ve got to get started on the attic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spent the morning doing errands. It was all so ordinary, tasks that couples did together all the time, but there wasn’t anything ordinary about their situation. She was constantly looking over her shoulder, even when they were in the grocery store getting supplies for Joe. Laurant was stopped by a friend or neighbor on almost every aisle, and each time, she introduced Nick as her fiancé.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put on quite a show. He was attentive and affectionate, and it was all so natural, she had to remind herself that it was just an act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe relaxed only when they were inside the car. She felt safe then. Nick drove through McDonald’s to get breakfast and headed home again. He turned on the radio, and they listened to Garth Brooks croon about a love lost and found again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was eager for Nick to see her store. She helped him carry the groceries inside, and left them in the hall for Joe to put away. Then they got back in the car again. Since they were going up to the abbey after they purchased an engagement ring, he decided to drive to the square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped at the fountain so that he could see all the buildings ahead of him. None of them were historical treasures by any means, but the old structures were charming. Most of the facades needed work, but nothing major.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you see what it could be?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I do,” he agreed. “Why would anybody want to tear this down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly,” she said enthusiastically. “Years ago, this is where everyone did their shopping and their socializing. I want it to be like that again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sprucing up the stores won’t be enough,” he said. “There’s got to be something inside to draw the people in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The president of the college is considering moving the bookstore into the corner building on your right. It’s more than big enough, and they’re running out of room on campus. The kids would have to come into the square to get their books.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That will help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she agreed. “And they can walk. The campus is only a couple of blocks away. Let’s go,” she urged. “I want you to see my store.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer enthusiasm made him smile. He parked in the center block, near the jewelry store. He put his arm around her as they walked along the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t show off her store after all. The first coat of polyurethane had just been applied to the floor. Since the windows were coated, Nick couldn’t even look through to see the lovely marble countertop. He would have to wait at least four days until the second and third coats had been applied and dried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey backtracked to Russell’s Jewelry Store. Nick impressed the socks off of Miriam Russell when he picked out a two-carat diamond ring—the biggest in the store. Laurant didn’t want that one though. She liked the one-and-a-half-carat, marquise diamond. Since it didn’t need to be sized—it fit her finger perfectly—Nick said it was meant to be. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heartbreaker-buchanan-renard-1/page-29.html","bookId":1835,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:23 PM"}
