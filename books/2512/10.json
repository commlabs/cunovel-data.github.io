{"id":108142,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\u003cp\u003eWhen I return to my room, I call Seymour Dorsten, my friend and personal biographer, the young man I cured of AIDS with a few drops of my blood. Seymour is my psychic twin--he often writes about what I am experiencing, without my having to tell him what it is. Lately, I\u0027ve been broadcasting him great material. I wake him up, but as soon as he hears my voice he is instantly alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d be calling me soon,\" he says. \"Was that you down in Los Angeles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joel and I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes a moment to absorb what I am saying. \"Joel is a vampire now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Eddie roughed him up bad. He was dying. I had no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve broken your vow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need to remind me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" He pauses. \"Can I become a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want the headache. Let me tell you what\u0027s been happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next ninety minutes Seymour listens while I detail everything that has occurred since just before I rescued Yaksha and battled with Eddie. I mention Tex, sleeping in his shallow grave in the desert, and my levitating in the moonlight. Seymour ponders my words for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" I ask finally. \"Have you been writing about all of this already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitates. \"I was writing a story about you. In it you were an angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I have wings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were glowing white and flying high above a ruined landscape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like the end of the world,\" I remark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour is serious. \"It will be the end of the world if you don\u0027t get Joel away from these people. You think they really have another vampire in addition to Joel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Andy has constructed a model of vampire DNA. He wouldn\u0027t have had time to do it after Joel was brought to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know what vampire DNA looks like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0027t told Seymour about Arturo. The story is too painful, and besides, I don\u0027t think it applies to the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, I have experience in the matter,\" I reply. \"Andy\u0027s model is accurate. Anyway, whether I have to rescue one or two, my dilemma is the same. I have to get in there and then I have to get three of us out\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds like your best bet is Andy. Can\u0027t you stare him in the eye and make him do what you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That can backfire. If I push too hard, I\u0027ll scramble his brain, and the others will know there\u0027s something wrong with him. But if I\u0027m careful I can plant a few suggestions deep in his mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money is a smart angle. Offer him millions. The fact that he hates his boss doesn\u0027t hurt either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree. But, Seymour, you\u0027re supposed to tell me what I\u0027m missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel you\u0027re missing something?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I can\u0027t explain, but I know it\u0027s there. It\u0027s just not evident to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour considers. \"I\u0027ll tell you a couple things you won\u0027t want to hear. When you get inside the com?pound, you can\u0027t go straight for Joel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to get to the general. You have to be able to control him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might be harder to get to than Joel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it. Joel will be locked in a cage even you wouldn\u0027t be able to escape from. Obviously they know how strong a vampire is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joel is powerful, no doubt. But he is still a child next to me. They don\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They know more than you think, Sita. \"You\u0027re\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;really not looking at the whole picture. They\u0027re proba?bly still searching Lake Mead for your body. The fact that they haven\u0027t found it tells the general that you\u0027re still alive. And for you to have survived what they put you through means that you have to be handled with extreme care.\" Seymour pauses. \"The general must have figured you\u0027ll come for Joel.\" \"You sound so certain,\" I say. \"I\u0027m not.\" \"Look at it logically. You had several chances to leave Joel during your fight with the LAPD--but you didn\u0027t. In fact, you showed tremendous loyalty to him. Believe me, they have constructed a psychological profile on you. They know you\u0027re coming for him. They\u0027ll be waiting for you. That\u0027s one of the reasons you have to go after the general first. Control him and his mind and you control the compound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His associates will know something is up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need only control him for a short time. Also, you have no choice. You need the general for some?thing other than rescue and escape.\" \"What?\" I ask, knowing what he\u0027ll say. \"Samples of vampire blood will be spread all over the compound. I bet they have several labs there, and you won\u0027t be able to walk around and find all the samples. On top of that, they\u0027ll have the research that they\u0027ve conducted in their computers. For these rea?sons the compound has to be completely destroyed. It\u0027s the only way. You\u0027re going to have to force the general to detonate a nuclear warhead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that? Blow up all those people?\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed plenty of people down in L.A.\" My voice is cool. \"I didn\u0027t enjoy that, Seymour.\" He pauses. \"I\u0027m sorry, Sita. I didn\u0027t mean to imply that you did. And I don\u0027t mean to sound cold and cruel. I\u0027m not, you know. I\u0027m just a high school kid, and a lousy writer on top of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re too brilliant to be lousy at anything. Please continue with your analysis. How can I get Joel out alive and blow the place up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitates. \u0027\"You might not be able to do both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod to myself. \"This could be a suicide mission. I\u0027ve thought of that\" I add sadly; \"Won\u0027t you miss me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe speaks with feeling. \"Yes. Come here tonight. Make me a vampire, I\u0027ll help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not vampire material.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? I\u0027m not sexy enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s not the problem. If you were a vampire, Tm sure you\u0027d be a sex machine. It\u0027s just that you\u0027re too special to be ...\" My voice falters as I think of Arturo. \"To be contaminated by my blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sita? What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow past my pain. \"It\u0027s nothing--the past. That\u0027s the trouble with living for five thousand years--I have so much past. It\u0027s hard to live in the present when all that history is inside you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your blood saved my life,\" Seymour says gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you feeling? Are the HIV tests still negative?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m fine. Don\u0027t worry about me. When do you see Andy next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a few hours, near dawn. Then, when he returns to work in the evening, I plan to stow away in the trunk of his car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll need his cooperation. You can\u0027t go search?ing the compound for Joel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy will cooperate, one way or the other.\" I pause. \"Is there anything else you can tell me that might help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Practice that levitating trick. You never know when it\u0027ll come in handy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s causing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously, Yaksha\u0027s blood. He must have devel?oped the ability over the centuries. Could he fly when you knew him in India?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never demonstrated that he could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You vampires are full of surprises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh. \"You\u0027re so anxious to become like me. You envy my powers. But what you don\u0027t know is that I envy you more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour is surprised. \"What do I have that you could possibly want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of Lalita, my daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I cannot talk about children, on this of all nights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re human\" is all I say. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/red-dice-the-last-vampire-3/page-10.html","bookId":2512,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM"}
