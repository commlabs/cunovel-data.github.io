This was to be our first time together in public. Our relationship wouldn\u0027t be a secret any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walked in, I heard a whistle coming from one of the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to see with the glare of the school lights. I peered closer and saw steely gray eyes shining through the brush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brandon?\" I asked, running over to him. \"What are you doing out here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I saw that he was only wearing jeans, I knew he either hadn\u0027t taken the antidote or that it had turned him into a werewolf permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go with you,\" he said. \"I tried to - I planned on taking it. But I was afraid of being a werewolf all the time - and not being one at all. I\u0027m so confused. Then when I changed, I realized it was too late. Now I can\u0027t let you walk in there with a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held him with all my might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I wanted was one dance,\" he said. \"Just to be close to you and see your dress and watch you - just to walk into school holding your hand, like any other boyfriend would do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boyfriend?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you are my boyfriend. For real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe embraced, and I didn\u0027t ever want to let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t walk in there looking like this,\" he lamented. \"I have long hair and a goatee - things I didn\u0027t have an hour ago. And I don\u0027t have clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is dark inside, isn\u0027t it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes . . . but . . . I just wanted one dance, that was all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll have your dance,\" I declared. \"Can you wait here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did my best to hurry back up the front steps in my heels. I rushed down the hallways passing formally dressed couples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Celeste,\" several couples said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speech and drama room was open, as Mrs. Feldman, the teacher, was in the gym chaperoning the dance. I made my way to the back of the room and grabbed a men\u0027s black overcoat and wing-tip dress shoes and hurried back out with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got a few curious stares from students as I passed by and rushed out the front door to Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" I said. \"You can wear these.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe examined the clothes. \"They don\u0027t look too bad, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we are lucky the drama department has a good budget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon held my shoulder for support as he put the shoes on. I helped him adjust the jacket and wiped off any lint I saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t smile too big or grin widely, they won\u0027t see your fangs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about my hair?\" he asked. \"How can I explain that it grew six inches in a day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hm . . .\" I thought. \"Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug into my purse and pulled out a tiny ponytail holder. I combed his wild hair with my fingers and twisted his luxuriously thick mane and wrapped the holder around it. I tucked the ponytail neatly into the back of his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we were able to attend the dance like any normal couple at Legend\u0027s Run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe entered the Moonlight Dance. We walked through an arch of black and white balloons into the dimly lit gymnasium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost students were surprised to see Brandon and me together. Whispers and murmurs followed us as we continued to walk into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy and Abby were already dancing with their boyfriends. When they spotted us, they stopped and came over to greet us while their beaus went for refreshments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look beautiful,\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do you guys,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Brandon,\" Ivy said. \"Your eyes look different in this light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon smiled back and greeted Ivy and Abby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celeste is right, you girls look beautiful,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy and Abby blushed and giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how long have you been here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not long,\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The DJ is great. You\u0027ll have to get out there,\" Abby told us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We plan to,\" Brandon said eagerly. \"I was hoping to wait until a slow song,\" he said into my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hung out for a few minutes until the DJ played a slow tune, and Brandon led me onto the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me close, and I wrapped my arms around his neck. I wasn\u0027t looking anywhere else or thinking about anything else. I was dancing with my romantic werewolf, and no one had any idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we finished, Brandon gazed down at me like he\u0027d done when we were hidden under the staircase, tucked away in his guesthouse, or nestled together in the woods. I felt as if he was going to kiss me - this time in front of the whole school. Then Brandon leaned into me and drew me closer and planted his lips on mine with the intensity of a thousand leading men. I was lost in his lips for what seemed like forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we broke apart, I felt hundreds of staring eyeballs fixated on us. Ivy, Abby, Jake, Dylan, and every student gawked at us. Even the staff and chaperones were staring. Brandon was unaffected and just grabbed my hand and proudly led me off the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we joined my group, there were a few howls from the guys and gaping faces from my girlfriends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon smiled while I blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys went to grab us girls a few drinks when I noticed Heidi Rosen walking in with one of the athletes - not Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Nash wasn\u0027t with Heidi and he wasn\u0027t here, where was he? I was hoping he was concealed in the woods like Brandon said he\u0027d be. I was worried about Nash. He was probably somewhere in the woods hiding. However, until sunrise it was for the best. Once Brandon took the cure and we found it worked, then maybe Nash could as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys returned with our punch, and Brandon seemed preoccupied. \"Thank you,\" he said to me as he handed me my drink. \"I got my one dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to leave,\" I pleaded. But I didn\u0027t know how much longer it would be until someone noticed his paranormal characteristics. His hair was already becoming a little frazzled from dancing, and his goatee and facial hair could be seen when the flashing strobe light hit him at the right angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, me too.\" As my clique sipped punch and gossiped, Brandon drew me aside and gave me a long goodnight kiss. Then he slipped out the side door without anyone the wiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Brandon?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh . . . he wasn\u0027t feeling well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe Nash didn\u0027t come,\" Abby said. \"Maybe he\u0027s sick, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a commotion coming from the gymnasium\u0027s entrance, and a startling howl came from that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" Ivy exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome students screamed while others stepped aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a wolf in here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the lights came on. Everyone scrambled for the sides of the gym. But there wasn\u0027t a wolf in sight. Instead, Nash entered the gymnasium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was fully illuminated by the gym lights. His hair was wildly long, and he had sideburns and blond facial hair. His normally athletic body was even more ripped. He was wearing dress pants and nothing else. Nash was growling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral girls screamed at the sight of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looks like a werewolf!\" one girl exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A gorgeous one!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does he look like that?\" someone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has wolf fangs!\" another said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has to be a joke!\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s pranking us again,\" Abby declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dylan headed for him, I called out, \"Be careful, Dylan. He\u0027s not pranking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean to tell me - \" Ivy started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dylan reached Nash, he stared at his friend. Suddenly Dylan retreated and came back to our huddled group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash headed straight for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what\u0027s he doing?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants Celeste,\" someone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash grabbed me by the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off of her!\" Abby said, trying to break me free. But Nash\u0027s grip was too tight for the ponytailed athlete. He pulled me to the dance floor. Everyone was shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hurting me!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Nash locked his blue-gray eyes on mine, and I was under a spell. He was magnificent, even more muscular than he normally was. His shoulder-length, untamed, beach-colored hair was beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took me into his arms and held me so close I could feel his heart beating against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with him?\" I heard others whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music had stopped, but that didn\u0027t curtail Nash from beginning to dance with me as if it were still playing. He grinned, and his wolf fangs shone brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure what he was going to do next. If he bit me, I suspected I would become a werewolf, too. He had his sights set on me, and I didn\u0027t know what to do. All I knew was that I was becoming frightened of him, and it seemed as if everyone else in the gymnasium was, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to anger Nash any further for fear he might strike out at me - or someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake - do something,\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do?\" I heard him say. \"He\u0027s just dancing with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, Dylan!\" Abby yelled. \"She doesn\u0027t want to dance with him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She seems okay,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll get her,\" I heard Abby say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Brandon entered the gymnasium. He was still wearing the outfit I\u0027d given him. Only this time, the gym was fully illuminated. Brandon\u0027s hair was long and tousled, and his face was lined with hair. Fangs broke through the separation in his lips. Because the lights were on, everyone could see his lycan condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were gasps and whispers and a few screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Dylan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call nine-one-one!\" someone hollered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a - \" Jake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon stared straight at us, and his gray eyes bore through the gym right at Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash perked up, as if he sensed a competitor on his turf. He turned us around so I was the one standing in front of him. Nash held on to me so tightly, there was no way for me to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon grew wildly angry, and he was primed for a fight. The moment was surreal, as if I were in a movie. Brandon charged the dance floor and with all his lycan strength pulled Nash away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell to the ground, and Nash was thrown back off the dance floor but landed on his bare feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy and Abby raced over and helped me up, quickly guiding me off the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash jumped back into the middle of the gym floor and squared off with Brandon, as if at any moment one was going to charge the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then two security officers stormed into the gym. As the two werewolves were primed to lunge at each other, the officers headed toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash let out a fierce howl that startled all the girls, causing screams and panic. Just before the officers reached him, he took off for the opposite gymnasium doors while Brandon headed to comfort me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash busted open the fire exit door and ran off into the night, setting off the alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone covered their ears as the chaperones and security guards scrambled to find Brandon and Nash and to disable the alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the commotion was going on, Brandon grasped my hand and led me to the front entrance of the gym and outside into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the edge of the woods and were safely out of view, Brandon took me in his arms. \"Are you okay?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still shaken. The night had ended so strangely. My teeth were even chattering from nerves. Brandon held me like a little bird that had broken a wing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over now,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it?\" I asked. \"Now everyone knows. About Nash - and you.\" Brandon took off the jacket and placed it around me. I wasn\u0027t cold, but I was freaking out. His caring nature was the only thing that was going to calm me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removed his shoes and T-shirt. He stood in front of me like the handsome werewolf I\u0027d seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are always saving me - and everyone,\" I said. \"Who is going to save you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile overcame him, and he beamed like the moon above us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one girl standing in front of me,\" he said. He drew me in his arms and I fell into his embrace. \"By finishing our dances together underneath the moonlight.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-of-the-moonlight-full-moon-2/page-18.html","bookId":2149,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:29 PM"}
