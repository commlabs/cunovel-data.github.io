A humming sound, a tuneless song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a bang! the front door slammed open and three men burst into the bedroom. They were wearing dark raincoats and hats. Terrified, Marshall set the wineglass on the tableit felland dived for his clothes beside the bed to cover himself, but in an instant the men were on him, grabbing him with gloved hands. He yelled in alarm and panic as they threw him over, shoving him facedown on the bed. He was still yelling as they pushed his face into a pillow. He thought they were going to suffocate him, but they didn\u0027t. One man hissed, \"Be quiet. Nothing will happen if you are quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t believe him, so he struggled, calling out again. Where was Marisa? What was she doing? It was happening so fast. One man was sitting on his back, knees digging into his spine, his cold shoes on Marshall\u0027s bare buttocks. He felt the man\u0027s hand on his neck, shoving him into the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be quiet!\" the man hissed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other men had each taken one of his wrists, and they were pulling his arms wide, spread-eagling him on the bed. They were getting ready to do something to him. He felt terrified and vulnerable. He moaned, and somebody hit him on the back of the head. \"Quiet!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was happening quickly, it was all impressionistic. Where was Marisa? Probably hiding in the bathroom, and he couldn\u0027t blame her. He heard a sloshing sound and saw a plastic baggie and something white in it, like a golf ball. They were placing the baggie under his armpit, on the fleshy part of his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell were they doing? He felt the water cold against his under-arm, and he struggled but they held him tight, and then inside the water, something soft pressed against the arm, and he had a sticky sensation, like sticky chewing gum, something sticky and tugging against the flesh of his arm, and then he felt a little pinch. Nothing, hardly noticeable, a momentary sting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men were moving quickly, the baggie was removed, and at that moment he heard two surprisingly loud gunshots and Marisa was screaming in rapid French\"Salaud! Salopard! Bouge-toi le cul!\"and the third man had tumbled off Marshall\u0027s back and fallen to the ground, then scrambled up, and Marisa was still screaming, there were more shots, and he could smell powder in the air, and the men fled. The door slammed, and she came back, stark naked, babbling in French he could not understand, something about vacherie, which he thought was a cow but he wasn\u0027t thinking straight. He was starting to tremble on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came over and threw her arms around him. The barrel of the gun was hot and he yelled, and she set it aside. \"Oh Jonathan, I am so sorry, so sorry.\" She cradled his head against her shoulder. \"Please, you must forgive me, it is all right now, I promise you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually his trembling stopped, and she looked at him. \"Did they hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I did not think so. Idiots! Friends of Jimmy, they think they make a joke, to scare you. And me I am sure. But you are not hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head again. He coughed. \"Perhaps,\" he said, finding his voice at last. \"Perhaps I should be going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" she said. \"No, no, you cannot do this to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t feel\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely no,\" she said. She pushed closer to him, so her body was touching his. \"You must stay a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we call the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mais non. The police will do nothing. A quarrel of lovers. In France we do not do this, call the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they broke in amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are gone now,\" she said, whispering in his ear. He felt her breath. \"There is only us, now. Only us, Jonathan.\" Her dark body slid down his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was after midnight when he was finally dressed and standing at the window, looking out at Notre Dame. The streets were still crowded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why will you not stay?\" she said, pouting prettily. \"I want you to stay. Don\u0027t you want to please me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I have to go. I don\u0027t feel very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will make you feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. In truth, he really did not feel well. He was experiencing waves of dizziness, and his legs felt oddly weak. His hands were trembling as he gripped the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said again. \"I have to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then I will drive you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer car, he knew, was parked on the other side of the Seine. It seemed far to walk. But he just nodded numbly. \"All right,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in no rush. They strolled arm in arm, like lovers, along the embankment. They passed the houseboat restaurants tied up to the side, brightly lit, still busy with guests. Above them, on the other side of the river, rose Notre Dame, brilliantly lit. For a while, this slow walk, with her head on his shoulder, the soft words she spoke to him, made him feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut soon he stumbled, feeling a kind of clumsy weakness coursing through his body. His mouth was very dry. His jaw felt stiff. It was difficult to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not seem to notice. They had moved past the bright lights now, under one of the bridges, and he stumbled again. This time he fell on the stone embankment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My darling,\" she said, worried and solicitous, and helped him to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I think amp;I think amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darling, are you all right?\" She helped him to a bench, away from the river. \"Here, just sit here for a moment. You will feel better in a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did not feel better. He tried to protest, but he could not speak. In horror he realized he could not even shake his head. Something was very wrong. His whole body was growing weak, swiftly and astonishingly weak, and he tried to push up from the bench, but he could not move his limbs, he could not move his head. He looked at her, sitting beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonathan, what is wrong? Do you need a doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I need a doctor, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonathan, this is not right amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest was heavy. He was having trouble breathing. He looked away, staring straight ahead. He thought in horror: I am paralyzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to look at her. But now he could not even move his eyes. He could only look straight forward. His breathing was shallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need a doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonathan, can you look at me? Can you? No? You cannot turn your head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, her voice did not sound concerned. She sounded detached, clinical. Perhaps his hearing was affected. There was a rushing sound in his ears. It was harder and harder to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Jonathan, let\u0027s get you away from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ducked her head under his arm and with surprising strength got him to his feet. His body was loose and floppy, sagging around her. He could not control where he looked. He heard the clicking of footsteps approaching and thought, Thank God. He heard a man\u0027s voice say in French, \"Mademoiselle, do you need help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, but no,\" she said. \"Just too much to drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does this all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can manage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. Then I wish you bonne nuit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonne nuit,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued on her way, carrying him. The footsteps became fainter. Then she paused, turned to look in all directions. And now amp;she was moving him toward the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are heavier than I thought,\" she said, in a conversational tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a deep and profound terror. He was completely paralyzed. He could do nothing. His own feet were scraping over the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToward the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sorry,\" she said, and she dropped him into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a short fall, and a stunning sense of cold. He plunged beneath the surface, surrounded by bubbles and green, then black. He could not move, even in the water. He could not believe this was happening to him, he could not believe that he was dying this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen slowly, he felt his body rise. Green water again, and then he broke the surface, on his back, turning slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see the bridge, and the black sky, and Marisa, standing on the embankment. She lit a cigarette and stared at him. She had one hand on her hip, one leg thrust forward, a model\u0027s pose. She exhaled, smoke rising in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he sank beneath the surface again, and he felt the cold and the blackness close in around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt three o\u0027clock in the morning the lights snapped on in the Laboratoire Ondulatoire of the French Marine Institute, in Vissy. The control panel came to life. The wave machine began to generate waves that rolled down the tank, one after another, and crashed against the artificial shore. The control screens flashed three-dimensional images, scrolled columns of data. The data was transmitted to an unknown location somewhere in France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt four o\u0027clock, the control panel went dark, and the lights went out, and the hard drives erased any record of what had been done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePAHANG TUESDAY, MAY 11 11:55 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twisting jungle road lay in shadow beneath the canopy of the Malay rain forest. The paved road was very narrow, and the Land Cruiser careened around the corners, tires squealing. In the passenger seat, a bearded man of forty glanced at his watch. \"How much farther?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a few minutes,\" the driver said, not slowing. \"We\u0027re almost there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver was Chinese but he spoke with a British accent. His name was Charles Ling and he had flown over from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur the night before. He had met his passenger at the airport that morning, and they had been driving at breakneck speed ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passenger had given Ling a card that read \"Allan Peterson, Seismic Services, Calgary.\" Ling didn\u0027t believe it. He knew perfectly well that there was a company in Alberta, ELS Engineering, that sold this equipment. It wasn\u0027t necessary to come all the way to Malaysia to see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only that, but Ling had checked the passenger manifest on the incoming flight, and there was no Allan Peterson listed. So this guy had come in on a different name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, he told Ling he was a field geologist doing independent consulting for energy companies in Canada, mostly evaluating potential oil sites. But Ling didn\u0027t believe that, either. You could spot those petroleum engineers a mile off. This guy wasn\u0027t one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Ling didn\u0027t know who the guy was. It didn\u0027t bother him. Mr. Peterson\u0027s credit was good; the rest was none of Ling\u0027s business. He had only one interest today, and that was to sell cavitation machines. And this looked like a big sale: Peterson was talking about three units, more than a million dollars in total.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned off the road abruptly, onto a muddy rut. They bounced through the jungle beneath huge trees, and suddenly came out into sunlight and a large opening. There was a huge semicircular gash in the ground, exposing a cliff of gray earth. A green lake lay below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this?\" Peterson said, wincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was open-face mine, abandoned now. Kaolin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is amp;?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLing thought, this is no geologist. He explained that kaolin was a mineral in clay. \"It\u0027s used in paper and ceramics. Lot of industrial ceramics now. They make ceramic knives, incredibly sharp. They\u0027ll make ceramic auto engines soon. But the quality here was too low. It was abandoned four years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeterson nodded. \"And where is the cavitator?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLing pointed toward a large truck parked at the edge of the cliff. \"There.\" He drove toward it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Russians make it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The vehicle and the carbon-matrix frame are Russian made. The electronics come from Taiwan. We assemble ourselves, in Kuala Lumpur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And is this your biggest model?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this is the intermediate. We don\u0027t have the largest one to show you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pulled alongside the truck. It was the size of a large earthmover; the cab of the Land Cruiser barely reached above the huge tires. In the center, hanging above the ground, was a large rectangular cavitation generator, looking like an oversize diesel generator, a boxy mass of pipes and wires. The curved cavitation plate was slung underneath, a few feet above the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey climbed out of the car into sweltering heat. Ling\u0027s eyeglasses clouded over. He wiped them on his shirt. Peterson walked around the truck. \"Can I get the unit without the truck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we make transportable units. Seagoing containers. But usually clients want them mounted on vehicles eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want the units,\" Peterson said. \"Are you going to demonstrate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right away,\" Ling said. He gestured to the operator, high up in the cab. \"Perhaps we should step away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" Peterson said, suddenly alarmed. \"I thought we were going to be alone. Who is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my brother,\" Ling said smoothly. \"He\u0027s very trustworthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s step away,\" Ling said. \"We can see better from a distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cavitation generator fired up, chugging loudly. Soon the noise blended with another sound, a deep humming that Ling always seemed to feel in his chest, in his bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeterson must have felt it, too, because he moved back hastily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These cavitation generators are hypersonic,\" Ling explained, \"producing a radially symmetric cavitation field that can be adjusted for focal point, rather like an optical lens, except we are using sound. In other words, we can focus the sound beam, and control how deep the cavitation will occur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved to the operator, who nodded. The cavitation plate came down, until it was just above the ground. The sound changed, becoming deeper and much quieter. The earth vibrated slightly where they were standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Peterson said, stepping back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to worry,\" Ling said. \"This is just low-grade reflection. The main energy vector is orthogonal, directed straight down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout forty feet below the truck, the walls of the canyon suddenly seemed to blur, to become indistinct. Small clouds of gray smoke obscured the surface for a moment, and then a whole section of cliff gave way, and rumbled down into the lake below, like a gray avalanche. The whole area filled with smoke and dust. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/state-of-fear/page-2.html","bookId":1706,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:14 AM"}
