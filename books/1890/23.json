{"id":84896,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flung the pink sash at me, \"That is a low blow and you know it. Just tell me how you got it. Who did you pay off? Did Will tell you where I left it? Did he go back and get it and give it to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the main floor button; the door opened. I realized then, we had not actually moved. I stormed from the elevator and looked back at him, \"I went to the Empire State Building, looking for you. Same as today. I came looking for you. I flew across the fucking ocean. I wanted to tell you that you were right. You were right all along. You and I love each other and no one is ever going to love us the same way. So fuck you.\" I flung the sash back at him as the door closed. I turned and stormed into the dining room and sat back in my chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys gave me a look, \"You want some more wine, J.D.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Call me Jack. I like Jack better anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunday Morning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knock at the door woke me. My jet lag and wine hangover was savaging my brain and body. I stumbled to the door. Daniela was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and at my door with a supermodel smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squinted at her, \"What time is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eleven, silly. We are all meeting downstairs for brunch. Mike didn’t want to wake you, but I figured you\u0027d balance out faster if you got up now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Be down in ten.\" I closed the door and prayed I had at least one cute brunch outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t, but Mike had bought me a couple cute dresses and skirts. I slipped on a skirt and blouse, and attempted to get myself close to not puffy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up with so much eye brightener, I looked semi-high. I ran from the room, hoping a little exertion would get me looking better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got downstairs, I was flushed and glowing when I passed the mirror. I hurried into the breakfast room. The server sat me with a wink. I didn’t know what that meant, but I smiled at the guys, \"Morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all nodded at me. Tex slapped me on the back, \"How ya feelin’, Jack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught an evil glare from Mike but smiled anyway, \"Great. Little jet lagged but that\u0027ll wear off.\" I leaned into Tex, \"You let me drink too much last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe beamed, \"With a name like Jack, I figured you would drink us under the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Wine, I bet I can. You guys drink wine with me tonight.\" I waved at Romeo. He came rushing over. I smiled brightly, \"Can we do a post-game wine tasting for these guys, you and I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes lit up, \"Of course. What a fabulous idea. Yes. We will make it wonderful for you all. Red and white?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and clapped my hands, \"Yes, please.\" I grinned wide, opening my brunch menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomeo winked at me, \"Leave it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTex gave me a scowl, \"Now, I don’t drink wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike scoffed, \"Me either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur shook his head, \"More of a draft sort of lad, myself.\" His accent was adorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned wide, \"You will all be converted by the end of the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bat my lashes at them all. They all blushed and joked, apart from Mike. He scowled and grumbled. Daniela seemed to be compensating for his horrid mood. She didn’t know he just needed a nap and some video games. That always got him into a worse funk, and then even he couldn’t stand his own self. Then he would go for a huge workout and come back a new man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI avoided his face. I didn’t know what to say to him. He didn’t believe I went to the Empire State Building. He thought I had used my money and influence to get the sash back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaniela fed him a bite. His eyes darted at me before he bit. I rolled my eyes and smiled at Luce, who was telling a story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finished breakfast and walked out of the dining room. I was stuffed and ready for a nap, but Luce asked if I wanted to go for a walk and sightsee a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded \"Let me just get my sweater. I\u0027ll meet you in the lobby in ten minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and I sighed. If I wasn’t so angry with Mike, I would have paid more attention to the fact Luce was hot. He was dark haired and green eyed and beefy, five o\u0027clock-shadow gorgeous. He had that foreigner hotness that Americans just couldn’t do. He wore Armani and smiled with brilliance and confidence. I had a naughty thought as I stepped into the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike climbed in after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his back against the wall and pushed the door close button several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s the plan for today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved him, \"No way. You can\u0027t be a dick to me yesterday and today be all ‘hey Jack, what\u0027s shaking?’\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and I sighed again. I shook my head though and muttered, \"I hate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my face and pressed his lips to my forehead. It was seductive and more than a forehead kiss. \"I am so sorry I suspected you were here to ruin my chances after I ruined yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed him back, \"You\u0027re getting married. Just stop this. No more kissing.\" When the elevator stopped on my floor, he got out, walking me to my door. I sighed as I opened the door and looked back at him, \"You can\u0027t come in.\" I barred the way with my arms. He grabbed each hand that was clinging to the frame and pushed me into the room. He closed the door with his foot and looked down on me. I felt tiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tell me that you love me, again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"Do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate you. You did ruin my life, Mike. You ruined everything and then you disappeared and left me there alone. I had no one. My sister, my friends, no one. My family doesn’t speak to me. My father took my things from Phil\u0027s and burned them. I picked you, but you were gone so I was stuck alone. Do you know what that felt like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was stoic, but I could see the pain in his eyes, \"I just assumed you picked him when you didn’t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved him back, \"You stormed into my wedding and started a huge fight. I was terrified and shocked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I know. I see that now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"But now is too late. You didn’t answer one phone call or one email or one message. You didn’t hear the message of me calling from the Empire State Building? You had to have heard the sax in the background on the message I left you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced, \"Jack…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head again, \"No. Don’t Jack me like that. Screw you, Mike.\" I grabbed my sweater from the bed and walked out, brushing past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my arm, \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my arm free, \"To hang with Luce. He wants to be with me.\" I didn’t mean it the way it sounded. I saw a fire lit in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and ran for the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried down the stairs but his legs were strong, longer, and in considerably-better shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my arm, spinning me, \"Stop calling me Mike. I hate it when you call me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved his huge hand from my arm, \"I hate when you act like I\u0027m unreasonable. You came and ruined my wedding day and my life, and somehow it\u0027s my fault that I never hopped down from the alter quick enough. You fucking started a brawl at my wedding. A brawl. How did you think I was going to react?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark eyes burned down on me, \"I thought you\u0027d see the romantic gesture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moaned in disbelief, \"You came drunk, romance was not what I saw. I saw a drunk hockey player making a huge scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you care? You don’t even like any of those people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved him again, \"THOSE WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE I HAD! YOU LEFT ME THERE AFTER YOU MADE A FOOL OF ME! YOU DIDN’T EVEN GIVE ME A CHANCE TO REACT!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my face and lowered his, but I shoved him off of me and turned and ran down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce was waiting for me in the lobby. He looked like a model. He looked like he and Daniela should be going sightseeing. He smiled, \"You ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and followed him out of the hotel. The streets and buildings were ancient looking. I loved it. It had a romantic feeling to it. The crisp winter air was surprising. It wasn’t New -York cold but it was not as warm as I expected. The entrance to the hotel wasn’t at all what a five-star hotel in New York would have for a grand entrance. It was old and stone, and the cobblestone streets made it feel like I was part of the history suddenly. We walked down the one-way street until we reached a huge five-way stop. The traffic was nuts, it reminded me of Manhattan but the buildings were amazingly old and beautiful. The smell of the old city was interesting and surprising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce pointed at the building next to us, \"Gallery of Ancient Arts. Let\u0027s go in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been to Rome shopping many times but never had I seen the side the tourists saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked through the huge iron and stone gates into the plaza. It was stunning. When we got inside, it smelled old and dusty but the paintings, ceilings, and woodwork captivated me. He paid and pointed, \"My favorite is down this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my arm in his and led me along, \"You know the painting we are about to see is my all-time favorite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I hadn’t been so angry, I might have liked the fact he had a favorite piece of art in a gallery in Rome. He wasn’t just a hockey player. He was a worldly man from a humble and war-torn country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach painting was more impressive until suddenly we stopped. My eyes scanned the painting, overcome by it all. St. John the Baptist in the Wilderness. The shadows and subtleties were perfect. I was drawn into the dark places I couldn’t see and captivated by the young man whose face was cast to the side. He looked like he was crawling from his bed. The date was the thing that struck me with overwhelming awe, 1603-1604. It was over four hundred years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes you want to see what else is there, what is in the shadows, and what he is looking at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"It\u0027s stunning. It makes me sad and I don’t know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was beheaded for speaking against King Herod\u0027s marriage to his niece. He called it incestuous. He was the man who baptized Jesus but refused to be more than him. He was a humble man, always trying to be smaller and make Jesus bigger.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-23.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
