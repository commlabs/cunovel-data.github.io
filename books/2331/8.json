She goes there during the day and catches four or five hours at a time that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must be awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s safer than a shelter, and a lot more private. Probably cleaner and quieter, too. She changes her clothes there, and there\u0027s a coin laundry in the neighborhood when she needs to do a load of wash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does she wash herself? Don\u0027t tell me she\u0027s got a shower in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She cleans up as well as she can in public rest rooms, and she\u0027s got friends who\u0027ll occasionally let her shower at their place. It\u0027s hit or miss. A shower isn\u0027t necessarily a daily occurrence in her life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she stays sober,\" I said, \"she\u0027ll have a decent place to live sooner or later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With a shower of her own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably. But you get a lot of different lifestyles in this town. There\u0027s a fellow I know who got divorced six or seven years ago, and he still hasn\u0027t got his own place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where does he sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On a couch in his office. That\u0027d be a cinch if he was self-employed, but he\u0027s not. He\u0027s some kind of mid-level executive at a firm with offices in the Flatiron Building. I guess he\u0027s important enough to have a couch in his office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when somebody catches him sleeping on it-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He yawns and tells them how he stretched out for a minute and must have dozed off. Or he was working late and missed the last train to Connecticut. Who knows? He belongs to a fancy gym two blocks from there, and that\u0027s where he has his shower every morning, right after his Nautilus circuit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why doesn\u0027t he just get an apartment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says he can\u0027t afford it,\" I said, \"but I think he\u0027s just being neurotic about it. And I think he probably likes the idea that he\u0027s getting over on everybody. He probably sees himself as an urban revolutionary, sleeping in the belly of the beast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On a leather sofa from Henredon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s leather or who made it, but that\u0027s the idea. In the rest of the country people with no place to live sleep in their cars. New Yorkers don\u0027t have cars, and a parking space here costs as much as an apartment in Sioux City. But we\u0027re resourceful. We find a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning I deposited Adrian Whitfield\u0027s check and tried to think of something I could do to earn it. I spent a couple of hours reviewing press coverage of the case, then spoke to Wally Donn and checked the security arrangements they\u0027d made. Whitfield had called first thing in the morning, but not before Wally\u0027d seen a paper, so he\u0027d known right away what the call was about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me get your thinking on this,\" he said, \"since you know the guy and steered him over here, which incidentally I appreciate. We\u0027re basically looking at him in three places, the courtroom and his home and his office. In court it\u0027s a crowded public place, plus you have to go through a metal detector to get in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which doesn\u0027t mean somebody couldn\u0027t wheel in a howitzer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, and this is a guy who walks through walls, right? Has he used a gun yet? He mostly goes for the throat. He strung up Vollmer and garroted Patsy S. and what was it the right-to-lifer got, a coat hanger around the neck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First he\u0027d been stabbed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s-his-name got his head chopped off, the black guy. Except that doesn\u0027t count on account of his own man did it. Skippy, whatever his name was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scipio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, no guns. The point is he\u0027s not afraid to work close, and he always manages to get the vic in private. Which means Whitfield\u0027s gonna have men around him all the time, but he\u0027s especially not walking in anywhere by himself. Like the john in the Criminal Courts Building, for example. That\u0027s where he got Patsy, isn\u0027t it? In a toilet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His MO\u0027s all over the place,\" he said, \"which is a pain in the neck. You\u0027re right about the abortion guy, he got stabbed first, and Vollmer pretty much got his head beat in, if I remember correctly. So the point is he\u0027s not married to a single way of doing it, which means you can\u0027t rule out a rifle shot from across the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s hard to guard against.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s close to impossible,\" he agreed, \"but there\u0027s still precautions you can take. I got him wearing a Kevlar vest, which won\u0027t stop everything but it\u0027s still a lot more protection than he was getting from his Fruit of the Looms. For transportation he\u0027s getting an armor-plated limo with impact-resistant glass all around. He\u0027s got two men with him at all times, plus the driver who never leaves the vehicle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on to run it all down for me. I couldn\u0027t think of a way to improve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s never the first to walk through a door,\" he said. \"Makes no difference if it\u0027s a room that got checked ten minutes ago. Before he walks in, somebody checks it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This fucker\u0027s spooky, Matt. \u0027The People\u0027s Will.\u0027 Thinks he\u0027s Babe Fucking Ruth, calling his shots and then hitting the ball out. And he\u0027s batting a thousand, too, the son of a bitch. This time we\u0027re gonna strike him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, let\u0027s. Personal protection work\u0027s supposed to be boring. If you do it right, nothing ever happens. But it generally doesn\u0027t come with front-page headlines attached to it. \u0027WILL TAKES AIM AT LEGAL WHIZ.\u0027 And everywhere you go with the guy, there\u0027s reporters and film crews, jokers sticking a mike in his face, other jokers pointing a video cam at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you know what the Secret Service goes through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" he said, \"and they\u0027re welcome to it. I never cared for Washington anyway. The streets go every which way, and the fucking summers there are enough to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found things to do over the next several days. I saw Joe Durkin at Midtown North, and he made a couple of phone calls and confirmed that the open letter to Adrian Whitfield had been written by the same person (or at least laid out in the same fashion and printed in the same typeface) as Will\u0027s earlier correspondence. I\u0027d assumed as much, just on the basis of literary style, but it was something I\u0027d wanted to confirm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, I spent a little time looking for someone with a personal reason to want Whitfield dead. He\u0027d been divorced twice, and was presently married to but legally separated from his third wife, who continued to live in Connecticut. Each of the marriages had produced children, and I remembered that one son (the eldest, it turned out) had been arrested two years previously for selling a few hundred dollars\u0027 worth of Ecstasy to an undercover police officer. Charges had been dropped, evidently in return for his rolling over and giving up his supplier. That looked promising, but it didn\u0027t seem to lead anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked the idea of someone with a private grudge. It wouldn\u0027t be the first time someone had concealed a personal motive behind the smoke screen of serial murder. Sometimes an opportunist would disguise his own solitary act of homicide to look as though it was part of somebody else\u0027s string-I\u0027d had a case like that once, the killer used an ice pick and so did the imitator. And I\u0027d known of cases where the killer committed several purposeless murders at random to establish a pattern of serial murder, then struck down someone he had reason to kill as part of that same pattern. It was a way to divert suspicion from oneself when one would otherwise be the first and most obvious suspect. But it didn\u0027t work, because routine police work sooner or later led someone to take a look at everybody with an individual motive, and once they started looking they always found something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this was a smoke screen, Will was certainly blowing a lot of smoke. Writing letters to newspapers and knocking off a batch of public figures was a long way from strangling a string of housewives so that you could wring your own wife\u0027s neck without being obvious about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe he just plain got into it. That happens. The man who did the housewives killed four of them before he left his own wife with her panty hose knotted around her neck. And he went on to do three more before they caught him. I can\u0027t believe he went on that long just to make it look good. My guess is he was enjoying himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good weather held into the weekend. Sunday it was supposed to rain, but it didn\u0027t, and by late that afternoon it was hot and hazy. Monday was worse, with a high of ninety-two and the air like wet wool. Tuesday was more of the same, and that afternoon I got a phone call that diverted my attention from Will for the time being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe caller was a woman I knew named Ginnie. She said, \"God, I\u0027m so upset. You\u0027ve heard about Byron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know he\u0027s ill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Ginnie from AA. She lived at Fifty-third and Ninth and came to meetings at St. Paul\u0027s. Byron was a friend of hers, and I\u0027d met him a few times at meetings, but he lived in the Village and mostly attended meetings down there. He came into the program because he couldn\u0027t stop drinking, but some years before that he\u0027d been a heroin addict, and he\u0027d shared needles, and shortly after he got sober he had the antibody test and turned out to be HIV-positive. You\u0027d think people would react to such news by saying the hell with it and going out and getting drunk, and I suppose some of them do, but a lot don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eByron didn\u0027t. He stayed sober and went to meetings, and he took the drugs his doctor gave him, along with a nutritional regimen designed to strengthen his immune system. This may have done him some good, but it didn\u0027t keep him from coming down with AIDS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to hear that,\" I said. \"The last time I saw him would have been in March or April. I ran into him at a meeting in the Village. I think it was Perry Street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where he mostly went.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember noticing that he didn\u0027t look well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt, AIDS would have killed him but it didn\u0027t get the chance. Somebody shot him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger. Now why in God\u0027s name would anybody do a thing like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently I said, \"Ginnie, he\u0027d be the one with the best reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he did it himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Christ,\" she said, impatient with me. \"He was in a public place, Matt. You know that little park across the street from his building?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know where he lived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Horatio Street. Not the Van Gogh but the prewar apartment building next door to it. There\u0027s a little park across the street. Abingdon Square? No, that\u0027s the other one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jackson Square.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so. He was sitting there this morning with a cup of coffee and the morning paper. And a man walked up to him and shot him dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they catch the shooter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He got away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there were witnesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were people in the park. It was early, so it was still comfortable. It\u0027s an oven but there now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God for air-conditioning. Byron should have stayed in his own air-conditioned apartment, but he liked the sun. He said he\u0027d spent his whole life staying out of it, but now he seemed to get energy from it. Solar energy. He said one good thing about being HIV-positive is you didn\u0027t have to worry about skin cancer. You didn\u0027t know him well, did you, Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly at all.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-8.html","bookId":2331,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:02 AM"}
