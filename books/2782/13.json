I eyed my dresser where Jack was stored. I could numb everything again. Forget about her rejection and the hurt I felt. I took a step toward my dresser when I heard my cell phone ding again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinking down on my bed, I scooped up my phone from my table and saw I had missed several texts from Dean. I scrolled through them until I got to the first one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey do you have plans today? D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you there? D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have an idea for today. You game? D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I don\u0027t hear from you in the next few minutes I\u0027m going to assume you\u0027re in. D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay time\u0027s up. I\u0027ll be at your house in thirty minutes. Wear comfortable shoes. D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a goof. My depression magically lifted as I read through his messages. The idea of getting out of the house for the day seemed ideal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK. I texted. I still sucked at the whole texting thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet. I was afraid I\u0027d show up and you\u0027d be snoozing. D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNope. I\u0027m up. I answered, tossing my phone on my comforter so I could finish getting ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone dinged again as I was pulling on socks. Glancing down, I was confused over his message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e;) D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e;)? I texted back, figuring it was a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy you\u0027re texting illiterate. It\u0027s a winky face. D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlipping my phone to the side, I tried to make out his \"winky\" face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere\u0027s the nose? I texted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGot eaten by shark attack. D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice. This looks more like a winky face to me ;o) I pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, you\u0027ll have to let the honchos over at Facebook know. They have a whole line of smiley emoticons missing their noses. D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s despicable. And they call themselves a cutting-edge company. I texted, smiling. I could see myself getting used to the whole texting thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny. I\u0027ll be there in five minutes. D\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK. I texted before stowing my phone in the oversized front pocket of my hoodie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was waiting on the front steps of our porch when he pulled into our driveway a few minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, I was going to tell you to wear a jacket,\" he said, taking in my hoodie. \"We\u0027ll be outside the majority of the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" I asked, climbing into the front seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of my favorite places, baby,\" he said, putting the jeep in reverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously?\" I asked, knowing exactly where we were headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time to broaden your horizons,\" he grinned at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned his grin. Smiling still felt awkward, but I was slowly getting used to it. The hour-and-a-half drive passed quickly as we talked about the movies from the night before. I wound up coming clean about zoning out during the action movie, so he spent the majority of the drive going over the plot. I sat back with my head against the seat listening to him. His warm radio voice washed over me as he walked me through the entire plot in his typical animated way. He was a born commentator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually began to feel butterflies in my stomach from the excitement as he pulled off the highway, following the signs leading us to our destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, my ticket\u0027s in there,\" he said, handing me a worn leather wallet. \"We get free parking with the preferred tickets my parents buy,\" he explained as I handed over his ticket while he pulled up to the parking booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like preferred parking?\" the attendant asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Dean said, handing over a five and waiting for his change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn your hazards on and follow the signs for the preferred parking,\" the attendant said, handing over a ticket. \"Have a nice day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You too,\" Dean said, switching on his hazards as he followed the signs leading us to the preferred parking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you just said you get free parking?\" I questioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do, but you can pay the three dollar difference for preferred parking and get even closer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to act cool, I tried to control my gawking as he drove up the ramp leading into the parking garage. Signs from different movies designated the parking areas. Keeping his hazards on, Dean followed the parking attendants who were directing traffic into the Spider-Man section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\" he asked, switching off his hazard lights and placing the parking slip on the dashboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" I said, opening my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked hand in hand, following the crowds of people as they boarded the escalator-style moving walkways. I tried to pull us in the direction of the nonmoving sidewalk that ran parallel with the moving walkway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa,\" Dean said like I\u0027d grown an extra head. \"Trust me, you take the free ride when it\u0027s offered,\" he said pointedly, hopping onto the moving walkway. I shook my head and walked on the sidewalk beside him. I\u0027d grown accustomed to walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral moving walkways later, we entered City Walk, which was the hub connecting the two theme parks together, the original Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was enormous. We stopped for a moment so I could take in the spectacle of it all. There was a giant two-story movie theater, a crazy-looking alien-themed miniature golf course and stores and restaurants everywhere. I could see Margaritaville, Bubba Gump\u0027s and The Hard Rock Orlando. Music blasted out of speakers, making it feel like we were in one big party.\"Come on,\" Dean laughed, dragging me along by the hand. \"We\u0027re going to get you a hopper pass, so we\u0027ll be doing both parks, but first, we\u0027re going to hit Islands,\" Dean explained as we strolled along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, overwhelmed by the crowds and jostling bodies as everyone hurried to their destinations. Two weeks ago, I would have freaked at the constant bumps and accidental touches as the large crowd bottlenecked near the entrance to Islands of Adventure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean stepped up to the will-call booth and pulled out a credit card from his wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you don\u0027t have to buy my ticket,\" I protested, pulling out my small change purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t, although I would have. When my parents heard you\u0027d never been to a theme park, they all but demanded I take you, claiming it was a travesty or something. It\u0027s their treat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked, shocked at their generosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They said to consider it an early birthday present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My birthday is in May,\" I squeaked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, consider it an early Christmas present, although I\u0027m quite confident they\u0027ll get you something then too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous. They don\u0027t even know me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do know you. They know you through me. Plus, they met you last night,\" he chastised me as we had our tickets and thumbs scanned to get in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But…\" I said, letting my voice trail off as a noise as loud as a freight train rumbled through the space we had just entered. Awestruck, I looked up at the massive green track that looped over a small body of water. I watched in fascination as another roller-coaster car shot out of the chute like a cannon, barreling around the track. Its speed was exhilarating to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Hulk?\" I asked, not taking my eyes off the green monster in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep, The Hulk,\" Dean crowed. \"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell yeah,\" I said, letting him drag me toward the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line inside was shorter than I expected and I could see them boarding passengers up ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s kind of off-season right now, so the lines aren\u0027t that bad,\" Dean said, reading my mind. \"During the summer, the line would be all the way outside,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously?\" I asked, thinking of the long trek through the maze of bars we had walked through to get here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, usually we buy the skip-the-lines passes during peak session. That way, you get on quicker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s crazy. I bet people are stuck in line forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"I once waited two hours to ride this,\" he said proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see what you say after you ride it,\" he said knowingly as we edged closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many?\" a bored ride attendant asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two,\" Dean said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Row two,\" the attendant said, pointing us toward the big number \"2\" stenciled on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground beneath our feet rumbled as a new car pulled up to our holding corrals. Excitement hummed through me as we boarded the car and pulled our shoulder restraints down until they locked into place. I gripped the metal handrails on my shoulder restraints and looked over at Dean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis excitement matched mine as he reached over and patted my knee. \"You ready?\" he asked as the car slowly pulled away from the loading platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell ye…\" I started to say as my words were ripped from me when our car took off like a jet. Our green Hulk car barreled down the tracks making my teeth knock together as we were flipped upside down in one of the big loops and then another shortly after that. Everyone was screaming, and the wind blew against my face. I had never felt so alive. Before I knew it, the ride was slowing down and we were back at the start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy crap balls, let\u0027s do it again,\" I said, climbing out of the vehicle with my legs shaking when the ride finally jerked to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha, I knew you were an adrenaline junkie,\" Dean said, pulling me in for a quick hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really tried not to tense. Seriously I did, but as soon as his arms encircled me, everything in me froze. He dropped his arms instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, I\u0027m sorry Mads,\" he said, looking contrite as he shoved his hands deep into the pockets of his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m some freak who totally turns into the ice queen any time I\u0027m touched? It\u0027s not you, it\u0027s me. I shouldn\u0027t be allowed out in public,\" I said, stalking away in embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean jogged up beside \"Come on, freak, let\u0027s ride again,\" he teased in a soft voice. His eyes held mine, and the disgust I was so sure I would find wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re like some after-school special, \u0027The Freak and the Jock,\u0027\" I finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027d get top billing, so it\u0027d be \u0027The Jock and the Freak,\u0027\" he quipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it had Hollywood written all over it. If not Hollywood, then definitely some teenie-bopper, feel-good novel. Of course, both would have to write in a happily ever after since that wasn\u0027t in my life script. Live. That\u0027s the best I could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, it\u0027s almost like holding hands, but better,\" Dean murmured in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friends, remember?\" I pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friends do this all the time,\" he reassured me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, I\u0027m calling bullshit on that one,\" I said, allowing myself to relax slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur second round on The Hulk was as exciting as the first. I wanted to go again, but Dean convinced me the other rides in the park were good too. He was almost right. A half-a-dozen rides later, I was still convinced The Hulk was the best, but I had to admit, the other rides were pretty cool too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" Dean asked as we finally sat down to eat after riding the dragon roller coaster in Harry Potter World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s amazing,\" I admitted, taking a big drink of my butterbeer. \"I guess I can see the whole \u0027theme park junkie\u0027 thing now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027ve never been to one,\" he said, taking a bite of his chicken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just not Donna\u0027s kind of thing,\" I said, swallowing my bite of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else isn\u0027t her thing?\" he asked innocently, taking another bite of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, I debated answering. I could see his ploy. He was slowly unraveling my life like it was layers of an onion. \"Holidays, movies, dinners at home. Basically anything that isn\u0027t church-related.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holidays?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. She doesn\u0027t do holidays. Well, holidays with me anyway. Christmas and my birthday are envelopes of cash. Thanksgiving, she spends at the church in their soup kitchen, which is a worthy cause, so who am I to bitch. Easter is spent at the church, and I think one of the families from church, but I\u0027m not really sure,\" I said, taking a bite of my seasoned potatoes. \"I\u0027ve never asked,\" I admitted once I swallowed my bite of food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t she ever insist you go with her?\" he asked, no longer eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for a very long time,\" I answered. \"Look, Sport-o, don\u0027t get your jockstrap in a bunch. Trust me, it really doesn\u0027t bug me. If I never step another foot in a church, I\u0027d die a happy person. It\u0027s not my thing,\" I said, shrugging my shoulders as if I really didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but, she\u0027s your mom. It\u0027s her duty or whatever to include you in holidays and everything else in between. Do you at least get to spend the holidays with your dad?\" he asked hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. Suddenly, my own appetite was fleeing. \"I haven\u0027t heard from him since he moved out. Look, can we talk about something else?\" I asked as my stomach twisted in knots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he wanted to say something else, but the look on my face stopped him. \"Sure,\" he said as he resumed eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur conversation was stilted after that, and I was pissed at myself for sharing so much. My family screamed dysfunctional, but actually laying it out for someone made it so much worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hit Seuss Landing after lunch and some of the fun from before resurfaced as we rode the whimsical rides, including the carousel, which had appalled Dean to learn that it was my first ride on one. He insisted we needed to ride it three times to make up for lost time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean surprised me by buying me a set of Incredible Hulk dog tags before we headed to the next park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To remind you of the day,\" he said, sliding them over my head, letting his hand linger on my neck for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis touch was intimate and confusing. The contact was enticing, and I yearned to rest my cheek against his knuckles at the same time that I fought the urge to shake it off, knowing the pain a man\u0027s touch could cause. My breath whistled out in shallow gasps. I struggled to remind myself that his touch was different. His eyes never strayed from mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to hurt you,\" he whispered softly, proving his point by running his hand down the length of my neck, over my narrow shoulder and down my arm in a soft caress, until eventually, he gently gripped my hand in his. \"Trust me, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, unable to find the words. I wanted to trust him. I hated the demons that made me frightened by the touch of someone I was slowly beginning to feel something for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still pondering my mixed up feelings when we made it to the other park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re rocking those glasses,\" Dean teased as we sat down for Shrek\u0027s 4D Adventure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, nothing offsets these classy green spectacles like pale, pasty, washed-out skin,\" I said, poking fun at myself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/miss-me-not/page-13.html","bookId":2782,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:24:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:24:59 PM"}
