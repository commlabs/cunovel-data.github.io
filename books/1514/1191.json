Then, she used her small hands to heavily pound Lin Dong’s chest. Soon after, her actions slowed, before she finally burst into tears. Meanwhile, her suppressed cries contained her bitter yearning and worry, that was accumulated over the last three years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Lin Dong saw that girl, who was leaning on his shoulder while crying in a heartbreaking fashion, he involuntarily lifted his head and inhaled a deep breath of icy cold air.

It looked as though she wanted to vent all the bitterness and sorrow that she had suffered over the past three years.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHer cries continued for a very long time, before they gradually died down. Following which, a soft cough sounded from a short distance away. Lin Dong lifted his head and saw Ying Xuanzi, Ying Xiaoxiao, Wang Yan as well as the hall chief and deputy chief of the Desolate Hall, Chen Zhen and Wu Dao, standing at a distance away. Behind them, countless disciples from Dao Sect had all flooded over to this place. Clearly, they had heard something as well. Meanwhile, there seemed to be heated cries being faintly transmitted. Their cries were seemingly trying to inform others that martial brother Lin Dong had returned...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe entire mountain range was packed with disciples from Dao Sect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Huanhuan seemed to have also detected the huge commotion occuring around her. Immediately, a flash of red rose on her face, which typically had little emotion. After which, she bit her red lips, clenched her small fist before she gave Lin Dong a jab. Only then, did she turn around and return to Ying Xiaoxiao’s side. The latter hurriedly hugged her upon seeing this. Meanwhile, she felt relieved in her heart. Her sister had been as cold as an ice mountain over the past three years and it has been a long while since she saw the latter acting in this manner.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Lin Dong saw those familiar faces, his mouth became a little dry. His heart, which did not even waver when up against thousands of soldiers, was evidently at a loss. After which, he cupped his hands towards Ying Xuanzi and said, “Ying… sect chief Ying.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHis words caused Ying Xuanzi’s body to stiffen.

Immediately, everyone turned to look, only to see a red face Wu Dao staring at Lin Dong, before he furiously cried, “You were brought into Dao Sect by this old man. If you want to leave our sect, you will have to ask me for permission. What do you treat Dao Sect as?! If everyone could quit just as simply as you wanted to, what would our sect become?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough Wu Dao was scolding Lin Dong, his eyes were filled with tears. Back then, he was the one who discovered Lin Dong and brought him to Dao Sect. Moreover, he also did his best to groom Lin Dong. In fact, after he learnt that Lin Dong was forced by Yuan Gate to leave the sect back at the Unique Devil City, he was so furious that he wanted to head right to Yuan Gate to demand an explanation. Fortunately, someone stopped him in the end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong was quiet. He was indebted to Wu Dao and he had always respected the latter. However, the Eastern Xuan Region was different from the Demon Region. The sect mentality was extremely prevalent here and once one entered a sect, it was equivalent to joining a family. Hence, it was an extremely serious offence to quit one’s sect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Martial junior Lin Dong, the disciples of Dao Sect have been anticipating your return.” Wang Yan sighed softly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Martial junior Lin Dong.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt a short distance away, Pang Tong had a solemn expression. Meanwhile, his eyes contained an excited tinge that was difficult to hide, as he said, “You should be aware of the current situation in the Eastern Xuan Region.
