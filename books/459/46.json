And the wind from the east blew through the land, blew through the heart of Solomon.... In a minute now they would disappear over the desert\u0027s edge. All seemed somehow tragical, like sailors leaving a great stricken ship, or glory passing from the land of its abiding....\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, Nathan,\" pleaded the young king, \"tell me she lied.
