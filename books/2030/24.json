This is fantastic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda shuddered. They\u0027d snuck into the Grand Hall of the Santa Barbara Historical Society by an emergency exit that had been propped open so prom attendees could slip out to get stoned, and glancing around, Miranda could see how getting stoned would be super-appealing. The walls of the room had been covered in blue satin with white stars embroidered on it, the four big columns in the middle were draped in red and white ribbons, the tables off to the side were covered in American flag-print cloths with fishbowl centerpieces in which the fish had been somehow dyed red and blue, and around the edges major American landmarks such as Mount Rushmore, the White House, the Statue of Liberty, the Liberty Bell, and the Old Faithful geyser had been reconstructed-out of sugar cubes. Courtesy of Ariel West\u0027s father. Ariel had announced the previous day at assembly that after the prom all the decorations would be donated to \"the poor hungry people of Santa Barbara who need sugar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda didn\u0027t know if it was that, the balloons on rubber cords hanging from the ceiling that bounced lazily up and down as people passed under them, or foreboding, but she had a distinct queasy feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby was in heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember-most of the guys here came with dates, so try to be subtle with the Kissing Bandit stuff,\" Miranda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you hear me call to you, you come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I look like a dog to you?\" Miranda gave her a sharp glance. Sibby said, \"Fine, okay, Funkiller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you feel like anything weird is going on at all, you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;let you know. I\u0027ve got it. Now you go and have some fun yourself. Oh, right, you probably don\u0027t know how. Well, when in doubt, ask yourself, \u0027What Would Sibby Do? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I unsubscribe from that list, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby was too busy scanning the room to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, who\u0027s that hot dinner in the corner over there?\" she asked. \"The guy in the glasses?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looked around for a hot dinner but all she saw was Phil Emory. \"His name is Phillip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Helllllo, Phillip,\" Sibby said, plotting a direct course for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda stashed her skate bag underneath a table and stayed close to the wall, between the White House and Old Faithful, partially to keep Sibby in view and partially to avoid being noticed by any faculty members. She\u0027d changed in the employee bathroom from her work suit into the only other thing she had with her, but although it was red, white, and blue, she didn\u0027t think that her Roller Derby uniform was really appropriate prom attire. There were two uniforms in her skate bag, a home uniform-white satin halter top and bottom with blue cape and red, white, and blue stripes on the skirt (if you could call something that was five inches long and required attached panties to be worn under it a skirt)-and an away uniform: the same thing, only in blue. She\u0027d decided white was more formal, but she was pretty sure that wearing it with her black work flats was not helping the look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been standing there for a while, wondering how everyone but her was completely capable of being on a dance floor without debilitating anyone, when she heard a pair of heartbeats she recognized and saw Kenzi and Beth sliding through the crowd toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came!\" Kenzi said, giving her a big hug. One of the things Miranda loved about Kenzi was that she acted like she was on Ecstasy even when she wasn\u0027t, telling people that she loved them, hugging them, never embarrassed about it. \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here. It didn\u0027t feel right without you. So, are you ready to unshackle yourself from the insecurities of your youth? Ready to own your future?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenzi and Beth were dressed to own anything, Miranda thought. Kenzi was wearing a skin-tight blue backless dress and had gotten a black panther with a blue sapphire eye painted on her back. Beth was in a red satin minidress and had a gold snake bracelet with two ruby eyes wrapped around her upper arm (or at least Miranda assumed they were rubies since Beth\u0027s parents were two of the biggest movie stars in Bollywood). On them, adulthood looked like a totally cool and exciting party with an excellent DJ that you could only get into if you were on the VIP list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda glanced at her skating uniform. \"I guess I should have known that when the time came to own my future I\u0027d be dressed like a member of the Ice Capades B-squad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way, you look fantastic,\" Beth said, and Miranda would have assumed she was being sarcastic except that Beth was one of those people who was born without sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truly,\" Kenzi confirmed. \"You\u0027re deep in H2T territory.\" H2T stood for Hot to Trot. \"I see great things for your adulthood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I see a visit to the eye doctor for you,\" Miranda prophesied. In the distance Miranda saw Sibby pull Phillip Emory onto the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda turned back to Kenzi. \"Do you think I\u0027m a fun person? Am I a Grandma Grim? A funkiller?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandma Grim? Funkiller?\" Kenzi repeated. \"What are you talking about? Did you hit your head at derby practice again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m serious. Am I fun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Kenzi said solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Beth agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except when you get all MLAS,\" Kenzi modified. \"And when you have your period. And around your birthday. Oh, there was that one time-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it.\" Miranda\u0027s eyes drifted to Sibby, who now appeared to be leading a conga line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m kidding,\" Kenzi said, turning Miranda\u0027s face from the dance floor to hers. \"Yes, I think you are really fun. I mean, who else would dress up as Magnum P.I. for Halloween?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or think of entertaining the kids on the cancer ward by reenacting Dawson\u0027s Creek with Precious Moments figurines?\" Beth added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenzi nodded. \"That\u0027s right. Even children battling cancer think you\u0027re fun. And they\u0027re not the only ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about Kenzi\u0027s tone when she said the last part made Miranda worried. \"What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was brilliant,\" Beth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Miranda was even more scared. \"Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was nothing, just some research,\" Kenzi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of research?\" For the first time Miranda noticed that there was writing up the length of Kenzi\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenzi said, \"About Will and Ariel. They\u0027re totally not going out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s called an interview,\" Kenzi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Oh no. Tell me you\u0027re kidding.\" Sometimes having a roommate who wanted to be a journalist was dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, he didn\u0027t suspect a thing. I made it seem like I was making small talk,\" Kenzi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was great,\" Beth confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda started wishing for trapdoors again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, I asked him why he thought Ariel asked him to the prom and he said\"-here Kenzi consulted her arm-\"\u0027To make someone else jealous. So of course I asked who and he went, \u0027Anyone. That\u0027s what Ariel thrives on, other people\u0027s jealousy. Isn\u0027t that perceptive? Especially for a guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s smart,\" Beth put in. \"And nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda nodded absently, looking for Sibby on the dance floor. At first she didn\u0027t see her but then she spotted her in a dark corner with Phillip. Talking, not kissing. For some reason that made her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, we made her happy!\" Kenzi said, and she sounded so genuinely pleased that Miranda didn\u0027t want to tell her the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for finding all that out,\" Miranda said. \"It\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t even heard the best part,\" Kenzi said. \"I asked why he agreed to go to prom with Ariel if they\u0027re not a couple and he said\"-glancing at her arm-\"\u0027Because no one made me a better offer. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth reminded her, \"With that cute smile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, with cute smile. And he looked directly at me when he said it and he was so clearly talking about you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clearly.\" Miranda loved her friends even if they were delusional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop gazing at me like I\u0027ve been one-stop shopping at the Lobotomy Store, Miranda,\" Kenzi said. \"I\u0027m completely right. He likes you and he\u0027s not taken. Stop thinking and grab him. Go live ITM.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ITM?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the Mo,\" Beth elaborated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda gaped. \"No. Way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Kenzi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\" Miranda shook her head. \"Even if he\u0027s single, what makes you think Will wants to go out with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenzi squinted at her. \"Um, breezing past all the sappy stuff about how you\u0027re nice and smart I have to say because I\u0027m your best friend, have you looked in the mirror recently?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha-ha. Trust me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye!\" Beth said, interrupting her and dragging Kenzi away. \"See you later!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t forget! ITM!\" Kenzi added over her shoulder. \"Drink a can of man!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you-\" Miranda started to say, then heard a heartbeat close behind her and swung around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly banging her shoulder against Will\u0027s chest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-24.html","bookId":2030,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM"}
