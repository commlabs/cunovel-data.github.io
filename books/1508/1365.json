A massive number of magic tools, weapons, pills, and all sorts of wealth and treasures were scattered about. With a wave of his hand, Lin Ming instantly picked out a shuttle-type magic tool from this random bunch of items.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the space shuttle that Tian Mingzi had given to Nether Limitless. It was a magic tool that could be used to teleport through the void for short distances. Although this space shuttle had no attack power, it was still a very high grade spirit treasure. Before this, Nether Limitless had used this item to overtake Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo any martial artist below the Divine Lord realm, travelling with this space shuttle was several times faster than flying at full speed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was especially true for Lin Ming, who was severely wounded right now.

His vision was becoming increasingly fuzzy. Finally, he fell down from the skies. As he fell, his hand reached out as if he wanted to grasp something in the air. He wasn’t willing to just drop down like this. Or, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he wasn’t willing to perish like this…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“If you wanted this… you could have told me… if you didn’t say then how would I know…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis ridiculous and random thought flashed through Nether Limitless’ mind.

And all around Lin Ming, the other 11 disciples of the Skydark Holy Lands did not dare to block his way at all. All of them kept silent, afraid to move. They were afraid that they would suffer the same fate as Nether Limitless.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt wasn’t that Lin Ming didn’t wish to kill off Tian Mingzi’s avatar, but that strike just now had come at the cost of burning half his blood essence. For him to do this again was impossible, because if he did, that would mean burning all of the essence energy he possessed. At that time, not even a god would be able to save him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd now, taking advantage of the grievously wounded Tian Mingzi and also the remaining strength from burning his blood essence, Lin Ming did the only thing left to him, and that was to escape!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven a grievously wounded Tian Mingzi wasn’t someone he could deal with.

When Lin Ming burnt his blood essence, he had temporarily reached a level of strength that surpassed Tian Mingzi himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi’s movements were slow. Without any expression, a strong aura exuded from his entire body. This was… killing intent!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA terrifying killing intent seemed to substantialize into essence within the void, locking down the surrounding space.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo Tian Mingzi, if Lin Ming were allowed to escape, his fate could be imagined. Now, all of the anger in his heart was swelling forth as killing intent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the other 11 disciples of the Skydark Holy Lands saw Tian Mingzi’s current state, all of them turned pale. This was because a moment ago, due to their fear, they did not dare to hinder Lin Ming. Now, they feared that Tian Mingzi would vent his anger upon them. The present Tian Mingzi gave off a feeling as if he were a wounded beast that had lost all rationale.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow that Lin Ming had escaped, it would be difficult to catch up to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi only had his avatar right now. Although the avatar of a peerless powerhouse was fierce, it had a fatal flaw – the total amount of energy it had was limited.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEvery bit used meant that much less!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot just that, but once an avatar was seriously wounded, it wasn’t able to restore itself. The nature of an ordinary avatar was that it was similar to a puppet; it was a one-time use creation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOnce an avatar was formed, there was also a time limit. As long as they existed, they would continue to expend energy at all times. This also doomed Tian Mingzi to not be able to catch up to Lin Ming. With less than 30% of his strength left and also with severe injuries, his strength would continue dwindling away until there was nothing left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd wasn’t wanting to chase Lin Ming easier said than done?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo Tian Mingzi’s true form, a treasure like a space shuttle was useless, without any meaning at all. But in the lower realms, Tian Mingzi’s avatar only had a Divine Sea realm cultivation. If this avatar were still in its peak state then it would still be able to just barely maintain the same speed as the space shuttle, but now, wanting to overtake it was simply impossible.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOnce Tian Mingzi’s avatar faded away, wanting to rely on these remaining 11 disciples to find him and capture him wasn’t realistic at all. Even if they faced the weakened Lin Ming who had burnt half his blood essence, even if he were wounded so seriously that he couldn’t recover for years, and even if these injuries were so deep that they affected his future cultivation, they still wouldn’t be able to face him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of them were frightened by Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the disciples of the Skydark Holy Lands realized this, they became increasingly horrified. This mission might end in failure! As for the heavy injuries that Tian Mingzi’s avatar suffered, all of this would be reflected on Tian Mingzi’s true self. When he took back his avatar, his cultivation would inevitably suffer damage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHow could they dare to withstand Tian Mingzi’s anger?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“M-master… save… save me…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAn extremely weak and raspy voice came out. If these people present weren’t martial artists with a high cultivation, they simply wouldn’t have heard it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the voice of Nether Limitless.

Thus, even though Nether Limitless was facing this Tian Mingzi that was like a wild and wounded animal, he still called out to him for help!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis life was rapidly fading away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTian Mingzi lowered his head, glancing at Nether Limitless. He waved his hand and Nether Limitless’ body flew forth until it was right in front of Tian Mingzi.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Honorable Master… save… me… I don’t want to die…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNether Limitless knew that if Tian Mingzi’s true self was here, saving him wouldn’t be a problem.

He didn’t even have the ability to think about this question.
