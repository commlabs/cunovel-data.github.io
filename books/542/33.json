Tholomyes was drinking. Zephine was laughing, Fantine smiling, Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at Saint-Cloud.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFavourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Blachevelle, I adore you.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis called forth a question from Blachevelle:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I!\" cried Favourite. \"Ah! Do not say that even in jest! If you were to cease to love me, I would spring after you, I would scratch you, I should rend you, I would throw you into the water, I would have you arrested.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBlachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who is tickled in his self-love. Favourite resumed:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I would scream to the police! Ah! I should not restrain myself, not at all! Rabble!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBlachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, and closed both eyes proudly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I? I detest him,\" replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her fork again. \"He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in my house. He is very nice, that young man; do you know him? One can see that he is an actor by profession. I love actors. As soon as he comes in, his mother says to him: `Ah! mon Dieu! My peace of mind is gone. There he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting my head!\u0027 So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as he can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know what? so that he can be heard down stairs! He earns twenty sous a day at an attorney\u0027s by penning quibbles. He is the son of a former precentor of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He idolizes me so, that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said to me: `Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.\u0027 It is only artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very nice. I am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow. Never mind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore him--how I lie! Hey! How I do lie!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFavourite paused, and then went on:--\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sad, you see, Dahlia. It has done nothing but rain all summer; the wind irritates me; the wind does not abate. Blachevelle is very stingy; there are hardly any green peas in the market; one does not know what to eat. I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so dear! and then you see it is horrible, here we are dining in a room with a bed in it, and that disgusts me with life.\"\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e法梅依和大丽哼着歌儿，多罗米埃喝着酒，瑟芬笑着，芳汀微笑着。李士多里吹着在圣克鲁买来的木喇叭。宠儿脉脉含情地望着勃拉什维尔说道：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“勃拉什维尔。我爱你。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e这话引起了勃拉什维尔的一个问题。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“宠儿，假使我不爱你了，你将怎样呢？”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“我吗！”宠儿喊着说，“唉！不要说这种话，哪怕是开玩笑，也不要说这种话！假使你不爱我了，我就跳到你后面，抓你的皮，扯你的头发，把水淋到你的身上，叫你吃官司。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e勃拉什维尔自诩多情地微笑了一下，正如一个自尊心获得极端满足而感到舒服的人一样。宠儿又说：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“是呀！我会叫警察！哼！你以为我有什么事做不出的！\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e坏种！”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e勃拉什维尔，受宠若惊，仰在椅上，沾沾自喜地闭上了眼睛。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e大丽吃个不停，从喧杂的语声中对宠儿说：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“看来，你对你的勃拉什维尔不是很痴心吗？”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“我，我厌恶他，”宠儿用了同样的语调回答，重又拿起她的叉子。“他舍不得花钱。我爱着在我对面住的那个小伙子。那小子长得漂亮得很，你认得他吗？他很有做戏子的派头。我喜欢戏子。他一回家，他娘就说：‘呀！我的上帝！我又不得安静了。他要叫起来了。唉，我的朋友，你要叫破我的脑袋吗！’因为他一到家里，便到那些住耗子的阁楼上，那些黑洞里，越高越好，他在那里又唱又朗诵，谁知道他搞些什么！下面的人都听得见。他在一个律师家里写讼词，每天已能赚二十个苏了。他父亲是圣雅克教堂里的唱诗人。呀！他生得非常好。他已经爱我到这种地步，有一天，他看见我在调灰面做薄饼，他对我说：‘小姐，您拿您的手套做些饼，我全会吃下去。’世界上只有艺术家才会说这样的话。听！他生得非常好。我已要为那小白脸发疯了。这不打紧，我对勃拉什维尔还是说我爱他。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e我多么会撒谎！你说是吗？我多么会撒谎！”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e宠儿喘了口气，又继续说：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“大丽，你知道吗？我心里烦得很。落了一夏季的雨，这风真叫我受不了，风又熄不了我心头的火，勃拉什维尔是个小气鬼，菜场里又不大有豌豆卖，他只知道吃，正好象英国人说的，我害‘忧郁病’了，奶油又那么贵！并且，你瞧，真是笑话，我们竟会在有床铺的房间里吃饭，我还不如死了的好。”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/75/4170.html","bookId":542,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:46:55 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:46:55 AM"}
