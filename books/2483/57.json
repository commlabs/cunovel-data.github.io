Blood, hot with her life, trailed down her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Katie’s shout echoed throughout the mall even over the roar of the water and the cries of the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears filled her eyes as she saw Katie turn to Kevin and saw him hand Katie his rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept her hand up as her victory salute. She had done the right thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no running away this time. She had faced the monsters and she had saved people she loved. There was no fear anymore. Just joy. She had won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies were coming up the narrow staircase but they didn’t matter anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you, Juan. I love you, Jason. I love you, Benji. I love you, Mikey. I love you, Katie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie raised the rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I did the right thing. This is how it should be. Absolution is good. I can face God and myself once more. I saved the children. I saved those people. I saved the ones I loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies were so close now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni smiled a beautiful, intense smile as peace filled her and tears fell down her cheeks. She clutched her hand tightly over her head, the blood pouring more fiercely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s been one helluva ride,” she whispered to Katie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni saw the flash at the end of the rifle. It was bright and brilliant. It just didn’t flash. It exploded out toward her. A brilliant white pure light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was warm and beautiful and it filled her senses. The smell of death disappeared, the pain disappeared as all she felt was love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body fell in silence from the top of the waterfall, just out of reach of the clutching hands of the zombies as they breached the top. As she fell, her leg hooked onto a rock for a second, twisting her around so she slid down onto a maintenance ledge hidden by the falling water. There she rested in the cold water, out of reach of the zombies forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the ones who loved her could seen her, they would have seen that her silent form was laying face up, the tiny hole in her forehead covered by her long black hair. Her raven locks floated around her head like a halo as the blood she had sacrificed slowly turned the water around her red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would have given them true comfort was this: On her face was a happy, satisfied smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Beyond the Light\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan woke slowly. His eyes flickered open and he took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething felt different. Wrong. The gray morning light filled his bedroom in the makeshift clinic in the hotel. The light felt cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Jenni’s voice said as she slipped into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jenni,” he whispered, tears unexpectedly filling his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, baby.” She sat down next to his bed. Her long dark hair was soaked with water and fell across her brow and face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you wet?” he asked as her hand took his. She felt so cold and damp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know me. A total klutz.” She waved her hand, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were kidnapped.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind felt jumbled and confused. He tried to focus on her, but her form seemed blurred around the edges by the morning light streaming around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know and it totally sucked. We got stuck in this awful mall and there was this bitch of a Senator and it was just bad.” Jenni rolled her eyes. “A mall. Can you believe it? Ugh. So annoying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’re here now,” Juan said with relief. “Oh, Jenni, I was so worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Juan, you should know me by now. Nothing, not even death could keep me from coming to see you,” she said with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer kiss was soft and wonderful and he touched her wet hair lovingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Loca, I missed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I missed you,” Jenni whispered, her smile beautiful and loving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re hurt,” he said with concern, looking at her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know me. I do crazy shit sometimes,” she giggled. She tucked her hand out of sight and winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” he asked worriedly. He was sure they wouldn’t let her into the fort if she were infected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I’m fine now. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’re so wet.” Something didn’t feel right and he struggled to decipher what was bothering him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You make me wet, baby,” she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Loca, I’m shot and you’re beat up and you’re thinking about sex,” Juan teased right back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh. Well, mostly thinking about how much I love you,” Jenni said in a more somber tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you. I promised myself that I would ask you to marry me when you got back. This really isn’t all that romantic, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni kissed him again, then gazed deeply into his eyes. “In my heart, we were always married.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan smiled softly and tried to focus on her, but it seemed so hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re getting me wet, Loca.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I have to go now anyway and you need to sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Loca,” Juan gasped, suddenly feeling very emotional. “Loca, I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up, her hand holding his. She felt so cold and wet. He was worried about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his chagrin, sleep pulled at his eyes and he felt himself fading into slumber. “Jenni, be with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I always will be,” Jenni assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his eyes flickered close, the light behind Jenni seemed to brighten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jenni,” he whispered desperately as he finally understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was engulfed in the light, but her voice whispered, “I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he was asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Exodus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, Katie lowered the rifle. Tears, hot and angry, flowed down her cheeks as she watched Jenni’s body fall. She choked back sobs as Jenni’s body caught on the edge of the waterfall, then fell into a hidden spot behind the water. The zombies pursuing Jenni began to tumble into the pool below, thrashing around. Jenni’s body remained hidden behind the waterfall out of the reach of the dead, her blood turning the flowing water red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katie, we need to go,” Travis said in a firm voice. He stood on the other side of the doorway waiting for her. His hand reached out to her. “Katie, you did the right thing for her, but now it is time to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t tear her gaze away from the food court filled with zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral groups were feasting on the fallen soldiers while others fought to get to the top of the waterfall only to fall into the waters below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katie,” Kevin said softly. He reached for his weapon. “She’s at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey can’t even reach her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGulping down her sobs, she looked toward Travis, her eyes filled with tears. “I did the right thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you did,” Travis answered her in a soft, yet firm voice. “And now it’s time to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanding Kevin the rifle, she moved through the doorway onto the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe helicopters were trying hard to lure the zombies from the back gate and the sound of engines revving filled the air. People were still panicking as they were herded by the surviving soldiers toward the waiting vehicles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSobs of despair, screams of terror, and cries of desperation filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis and Kevin grabbed Katie’s arms and guided her across the roof to the fire escape. It was rickety and frightening, but she moved as fast as she could. Her body was trembling so hard, her teeth were chattering. She had no idea where Bill or her father was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jenni was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to bite her tongue to keep from screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni was dead because she had killed her, but it had been the right thing to do. Lydia had told her the truth. This is what she was supposed to do, but it did not make it any easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBette rushed the children Jenni had saved to the nearby vehicles as Travis ran with Katie across the parking lot. People scrambled to get into trucks or buses that weren’t already filled. Kevin ran to the lead truck as Arnold motioned Katie and Travis to another one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re almost out of here,” Travis exclaimed. “We’re going to be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing could be okay. Jenni was dead. But Katie ran with him, her hand slick with sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back of the National Guard truck was full of people, so the driver shouted at them to get into the cab. It was so far off the ground, it was hard for Katie to get in. Her stomach felt awkward and heavy as she tried to heave herself up into the cab. Travis grabbed her hips and helped her in, then climbed in next to her. The seat was horribly uncomfortable, but Katie squirmed until it felt better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack smoke billowed out of the mall. The helicopters continued to try to corral the zombies away from one of the gates, taking turns gliding over the crowd of zombies as one brave soldier hung out the side waving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis’ hand held Katie’s firmly. Already bruises were showing on her flesh from where he had gripped her so tightly during their escape. He gazed down at her hand. She could see his concern, but the physical pain was nothing compared to her broken heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArnold motioned to the drivers. Slowly, the buses and trucks began to move forward. Soon, they were moving in a huge circle around the parking lot building speed for their departure. The redheaded soldier dove into a big Ford truck just as the gate blew wide open. Immediately, the secondary bombs went off. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/siege-as-the-world-dies-3/page-57.html","bookId":2483,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:34 PM"}
