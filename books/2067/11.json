At her nod, he bounced to his feet and bustled over to the tiny coffeemaker perched on top of a teetering stack of papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought her a cup of coffee, creamed and sugared, and settled down happily in his chair, gazing across his crowded desk at her with an expression of innocent enjoyment. \"I think I have some cookies,\" he offered. \"Not homemade, but they\u0027re reasonably tasty. No?\" Elena shook her head politely and sipped her coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very good,\" she said, and smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a few days since she had told Stefan and Damon she needed to take a break from them. After a much-needed sob session with Bonnie and Meredith, she had done her best to be normal - going to class, having lunch with her friends, keeping up a brave mask. Part of this attempt at normality was coming to James\u0027s office hours, so that she could hear more about her parents. Even though they couldn\u0027t be there to comfort her, talking about them offered some solace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God!\" James cried out. \"You have Elizabeth\u0027s face, and then, when you smile, Thomas\u0027s dimple comes right out. Just the same as his - on only one side. It gave him a certain raffish charm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena wondered if she should thank James. He was complimenting her, in a way, but the compliments were real y directed toward her parents, and it felt a little presumptuous to be grateful for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe settled for saying, \"I\u0027m glad you think I look like my parents. I remember thinking when I was little that they were very elegant.\" She shrugged. \"I guess al little kids think their parents are beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, your mother certainly was,\" James said. \"But it\u0027s not just your looks. Your voice sounds like hers, and the comments you made in class this week reminded me of things your father would have said. He was very observant.\" He delved into his desk drawers and, after a bit of rummaging, pul ed out a tin of butter cookies. \"Sure you won\u0027t have one? Ah, Well.\" He chose one for himself and took a bite. \"Yes, as I was saying, Elizabeth was extremely lovely. I wouldn\u0027t have cal ed Thomas lovely, but he had charm. Maybe that\u0027s how he managed to win Elizabeth\u0027s heart in the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Elena stirred her coffee absently. \"She dated other guys, then?\" It was ridiculous, but she had kind of imagined her parents as always being together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames chuckled. \"She was quite the heartbreaker. I imagine you are, too, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena thought unhappily of Stefan\u0027s soft, dismayed green eyes. She had never wanted to hurt him. And Matt, who she had dated in high school and who had quietly gone on loving her. He hadn\u0027t fal en in love, or even been real y interested in, anyone else since then. Heartbreaker, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames was watching her with bright, inquisitive eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a happy heartbreaker, then?\" he said softly. Elena glanced at him in surprise, and he set his coffee cup down with a little clink. He straightened up. \"Elizabeth Morrow,\" he said in a brisk businesslike voice, \"was a freshman when I met her. She was always making things, particularly amazing sets and costumes she designed for the theater department. Your father and I were both sophomores at the time - we were in the same fraternity, and close friends -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand he couldn\u0027t stop talking about this amazing girl. Once I got to know her, I was sucked into her orbit, too.\" He smiled. \"Thomas and I each had something special about us: I was academical y gifted, and Thomas could talk anyone into anything. But we were both cultural barbarians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth taught us about art, about theater, about the world beyond the smal Southern towns where we\u0027d grown up.\" James ate another cookie, absentmindedly licking sugar off his fingers, then sighed deeply. \"I thought we\u0027d be friends forever,\" he said. \"But we went in different directions in the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Elena asked. \"Did something happen?\" His bright eyes shifted away from hers. \"Of course not,\" he said dismissively. \"Just life, I suppose. But whenever I walk down the third-floor corridor, I can\u0027t help stopping to look at the photograph of us.\" He gave a self-conscious laugh, patting his stomach. \"Mostly vanity, I suppose. I recognize my young self more easily than I do the fat old man I see in the mirror now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Elena asked, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The third-floor corridor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames\u0027s mouth made a round O of surprise. \"Of course, you don\u0027t know al the col ege traditions yet. The long corridor on the third floor of this building has pictures from al the different periods of Dalcrest\u0027s history. Including a nice photo of your parents and yours truly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027l have to check it out,\" Elena said, feeling a little excited. She hadn\u0027t seen many pictures of her parents from before they were married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a tap on the door, and a smal girl with glasses peeked in. \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry,\" she said, and started to withdraw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, my dear,\" James said jovial y, getting to his feet. \"Elena and I were just chatting about old friends. You and I need to have a serious talk about your senior thesis as soon as possible. Come in, come in.\" He gave Elena an absurd little half bow. \"Elena, we\u0027l have to continue this conversation later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Elena said, and rose, shaking James\u0027s offered hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of old friends,\" he said casual y as she turned to go, \"I met a friend of yours, Dr. Celia Connor, just before the semester started. She mentioned that you were coming here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena whipped back around, staring at him. He had met Celia? Images fil ed Elena\u0027s mind: Celia held in Stefan\u0027s arms as he traveled faster than any human, desperate to save her life; Celia fending off the phantom in a room ful of flames. How much did James know? What had Celia told him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames smiled blandly back at her. \"But we\u0027l talk later,\" he said. After a moment, Elena nodded and stumbled out of his office, her mind racing. The girl who was waiting held the door open for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hal outside, Elena leaned against the wal and took stock for a moment. Would Celia have told James about Stefan and Damon being vampires, or anything about Elena herself? Probably not. Celia had become a friend by the end of their battle with the phantom. She would have kept their secrets. Plus, Celia was a very savvy academic. She wouldn\u0027t have told her col eagues anything that might make them think she was crazy, including that she had met actual vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena shook off the unease she felt from the end of her conversation with James and thought instead of the picture he\u0027d told her about. She climbed the stairs to the third floor to see if she could find it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turned out that the \"third-floor corridor\" was no problem to find. While the second floor was a maze of turning passageways and faculty offices subdivided from one another, when she stepped out of the stairWellon the third floor she discovered it was a long hal that ran from one end of the building to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast to the chatter of people at work on the second floor, the third floor seemed abandoned, silent and dim. Closed doors sat at regular intervals along the hal .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena peered through the glass on one door, only to see an empty room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl down the hal , between the doors, hung large photographs. Near the stairWell, where she began looking, they seemed like they were from maybe the turn of the century: young men in side-combed hair and suits, smiling stiffly; girls in high-necked white blouses and long skirts with their hair pul ed up on top of their heads. In one, a row of girls carried garlands of flowers for some forgotten campus occasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were photos of boat races and picnics, couples dressed up for dances, team pictures. In one photo, the cast of some student play - maybe from the 1920s or \u002730s, the girls with shingled flapper cuts, the guys with funny covers over their shoes - laughed hilariously on stage, their mouths frozen open, their hands in the air. A little farther on, a group of young men in army uniforms gazed back at her seriously, jaws firmly set, eyes determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she moved on down the hal , the photos changed from black-and-white to color; the clothes got less formal; the hairstyles grew longer, then shorter; messier, then sleeker. Even though most of the people in the photographs looked happy, something about them made Elena feel sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was how fast time seemed to pass in them: al these people had been Elena\u0027s age, students like her, with their own fears and joys and heartbreaks, and now they were gone, grown older or even dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought briefly of a bottle tucked deep in her closet at home, containing the water of eternal life she\u0027d accidental y stolen from the Guardians. Was that the answer? She pushed the thought away. It wasn\u0027t the answer yet - she knew that - and she\u0027d made the very clear choice not to think about that bottle, not to decide anything, not now. She had time, she had more life to live natural y before she\u0027d want to ask herself that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture James talked about was close to the far end of the hal . In it, her father, her mother, and James were sitting on the grass under a tree in the quad. Her parents were leaning forward in eager conversation, and James - a much thinner version, his face almost unrecognizable beneath a straggly beard - was sitting back and watching them, his expression sharp and amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother looked amazingly young, her face soft, her eyes wide, her smile big and bright, but she was also somehow exactly the mother Elena remembered. Elena\u0027s heart gave a painful but happy throb at the sight of her. Her father was gawkier than the distinguished dad Elena had known - and his pastel-patterned shirt was a fashion disaster of epic proportions - but there was an essential dadness to him that made Elena smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noticed the pin on his horrific pastel shirt first. She thought it was a smudge, but then, leaning forward, she made out the shape of a smal , dark blue V. Looking at the other figures, she realized her mother and James were wearing the same pins, her mother\u0027s half-obscured by a long golden curl fal ing across it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeird. She tapped her finger slowly against the glass over the photograph, touching one V and then the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would ask James about the pins. Hadn\u0027t he mentioned that he and her dad had been in a fraternity? Maybe it had something to do with that. Didn\u0027t frat boys \"pin\" their girlfriends?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething nudged at the edges of her mind. She\u0027d seen one of these pins somewhere. But she couldn\u0027t remember where, so she shrugged it off. Whatever it stood for, it was something she didn\u0027t know about her parents, another facet of their lives to be discovered here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t wait to learn more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-11.html","bookId":2067,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}
