He rested his hand on the curve of her shoulder. “You will make me that dinner sometime, won’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she realized what she was doing, Carol found herself nodding. She hadn’t had a chance to compose herself by the time he’d walked around the front of the car and joined her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither of them spoke on the drive back to her house. Carol’s mind was filled with the things she’d planned to tell him. The things she’d carefully thought out before-hand—about what a nice time she’d had, and how she hoped they’d stay in touch and what a good boy Jim—James—was and how Alex was doing a wonderful job raising him. But the trite, rehearsed words refused to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex pulled into her driveway and turned off the engine. The living room was dark and the curtains drawn. The only illumination was the dim light on her front porch. When Alex turned to face her, Carol’s heart exploded with dread and wonder. His look was warm, eager enough to make her blood run hot…and then immediately cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had a good time tonight.” He spoke first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did, too.” How weak she sounded, how tentative…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like to see you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were the words she’d feared—and longed for. The deep restlessness she’d experienced since the night her car had broken down reverberated within her, echoing through the empty years she’d spent alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carol?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…don’t know.” She tried to remind herself of what her life had been like with Bruce. The tireless lies, the crazy brushes with danger as though he were courting death. The anger and impatience, the pain that gnawed at her soul. She thought of the wall she’d so meticulously constructed around her heart. A wall years thick and so high no man had ever been able to breach it. “I…don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords could never explain her fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me revise my statement,” Alex said. “I need to see you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” she cried. “This was only supposed to be one night…to thank you for your help. I can’t give you any more…I just can’t and…” Her breath scattered, and her lungs burned within her chest. She couldn’t deny the things he made her feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carol,” he said softly. “There’s no reason to be afraid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was. Except he wouldn’t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached up and placed his calloused palm against her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol flinched and quickly shut her eyes. “No…please, I have to go inside…Peter’s waiting for me.” She grabbed the door handle, and it was all she could do not to escape from the car and rush into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” he said huskily, removing his hand from her face. “I didn’t mean to frighten you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, opening her eyes, and her startled gaze collided with his. She watched as he slowly appraised her, taking in her flushed face and the rapid rise and fall of her breasts. He frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re trembling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine…really. Thank you for tonight. I had a marvelous time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand settled over hers. “You’ll see me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until she was safely inside her living room and her heart was back to normal that Carol realized his parting words had been a statement of fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, Dad, how did dinner go with Mrs. Sommars?” James asked as he poured himself a huge bowl of cornflakes. He added enough sugar to make eating it worth his while, then for extra measure added a couple of teaspoons more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex cupped his steaming mug of coffee as he considered his son’s question. “Dinner went fine.” It was afterward that stayed in his mind. Someone had hurt Carol and hurt her badly. He’d hardly touched her and she’d trembled. Her dark brown eyes had clouded, and she couldn’t seem to get out of his car fast enough. The crazy part was, Alex felt convinced she was attracted to him. He knew something else—she didn’t want to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d spent hours talking over dinner, and it had seemed as though only a few moments had passed. There was no need for pretense between them. She didn’t pretend to be anything she wasn’t, and he was free to be himself as well. They were simply two single parents who had a lot in common. After two years of dealing with the singles scene, Alex found Carol a refreshing change. He found her alluringly beautiful and at the same time shockingly innocent. During the course of their evening, she’d argued with him over politics, surprised him with her wit and challenged his opinions. In those few hours, Alex learned that this intriguing widow was a charming study in contrasts, and he couldn’t wait to see her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mrs. Sommars is a neat lady,” James said, claiming the kitchen chair across from his father. “She’s a little weird, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex looked up from his coffee. “How’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She listens to opera,” James explained between bites. “Sings it, too—” he planted his elbows on the tabletop, leaned forward and whispered “—in Italian.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa.” Alex was impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At the top of her voice. Peter told me she won’t let him play his rap CDs nearly as loud as she does her operas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The injustice of it all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames ignored his sarcasm. “Peter was telling me his grandmother’s a real kick, too. She says things like ‘Eat your vegetables or I’m calling my uncle Vito in Jersey City.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex laughed, glanced at his watch and reluctantly got to his feet. He finished the last of his coffee, then set the mug in the sink. “Do you have your lunch money?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad, I’m not a kid anymore. You don’t have to ask me stuff like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you?” Alex pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames stood and reached inside his hip pocket. His eyes widened. “I…guess I left it in my room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t forget your driver’s permit, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex held up both hands. “Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was all the way to the front door when James’s shout stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t forget to pick me up from track practice, all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex pointed his finger at his son and calmly said, “I’ll be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What now?” Alex complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames shrugged and leaned his shoulder against the door leading into the kitchen. “In case you’re interested, Mrs. Sommars will be there, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex was interested. Very interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the house and climbed inside his work van, sitting in the driver’s seat with his hands on the steering wheel. He mulled over the events of the night before. He’d dated several women recently. Beautiful women, intelligent women, wealthy women. A couple of them had come on hot and heavy. But not one had appealed to him as strongly as this widow with the dark, frightened eyes and the soft, delectable mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep part of him yearned to stroke away the pain she held on to so tightly, whatever its source. He longed to watch the anxiety fade from her eyes when she settled into his arms. He wanted her to feel secure enough with him to relax. The urge to hold her and kiss her was strong, but he doubted Carol would let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, Peggy, bear down…push…as hard as you can,” Carol urged the young mother-to-be, clutching her hand. Peggy did as Carol asked, gritting her teeth, arching forward and lifting her head off the hospital pillow. She gave it everything she had, whimpering softly with the intensity of the labor pain. When the contraction had passed, Peggy’s head fell back and she took in several deep breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re doing a good job,” Carol said, patting her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much longer before my baby’s born?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soon,” Carol assured her. “The doctor’s on his way now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman’s eyes drifted closed. “Where’s Danny? I need Danny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll be back in a minute.” Carol had sent her patient’s husband out for a much-needed coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so glad you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarol smiled. “I’m glad I’m here, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Danny wants a son so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure he’ll be just as happy with a little girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy smiled, but that quickly faded as another contraction started. She reached for Carol’s hand, her face marked by the long hours she’d struggled to give birth. Carol had spent the past hour with her. She preferred it when they weren’t so busy and she could dedicate herself to one patient. But for more days than she cared to remember, the hospital’s five labor rooms had been full, and she spent her time racing from one to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy groaned, staring at a focal point on the wall. The technique was one Carol taught in her classes. Concentrating on a set object helped the mother remember and practice the breathing techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re doing just fine,” Carol said softly. “Take a deep breath now and let it out slowly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t do it anymore…I can’t,” Peggy cried. “Where’s Danny? Why’s he taking so long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll be back any second.” Now that her patient was in the final stages of labor, the pains were stronger and closer together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny walked into the room, looking pale and anxious…and so very young. He moved to the side of the bed and reached for his wife’s hand, holding it to his cheek. He seemed as relieved as Peggy when the contraction eased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Adams, old and wise and a hospital institution, sauntered into the room, hands in his pockets, smiling. “So, Peggy, it looks like we’re going to finally have that baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy grinned sheepishly. “I told Dr. Adams yesterday I was sure I was going to be pregnant until Christmas. I didn’t think this baby ever wanted to be born!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil Adams gave his instructions to Carol, and within a few minutes the medical team had assembled. From that point on, everything happened exactly as it should. Before another hour had passed, a squalling Danny, Jr., was placed in his father’s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peggy…oh Peggy, a son.” Tears of joy rained down the young man’s face as he sobbed unabashedly, holding his son close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Carol witnessed scenes such as this day in and day out, the thrill of helping to bring a tiny being into the world never left her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her shift was over, she showered and changed clothes, conscious of the time. She had to pick Peter up from track practice on her way home, and she didn’t want to keep him waiting, although she was the one likely to be twiddling her thumbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing Carol noticed when she pulled into the school parking lot was a van with Preston Construction printed in large black letters on the side. Alex. She drew in a shaky breath, determined to be friendly but reserved. After the way she’d escaped from his car the night before, it was doubtful he’d want anything to do with her, anyway. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/right-next-door/page-32.html","bookId":1962,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:09 AM"}
