Feel like a freaking bat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny thing, too. I didn\u0027t feel it when the thing moved. You\u0027d think accelerating like that, it would have thrown me off or squashed me flat, one or the other. But there was nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, hold on. We\u0027re coming to get you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holden,\" Miller said. \"Just stop it, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence didn\u0027t last more than a dozen seconds, but it carried a wealth of meaning. It\u0027s not safe to bring the Rocinante to Eros, and I came here to die, and Don\u0027t make this harder than it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I just... \" Holden said. And then: \"Okay. Let me... let me coordinate with the technicians. I\u0027ll... Jesus. I\u0027ll let you know what they say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One thing, though,\" Miller said. \"You\u0027re talking about deflecting this sonofabitch? Just keep in mind it\u0027s not a rock anymore. It\u0027s a ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Holden said. And a moment later: \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe connection dropped with a tick. Miller checked his oxygen supply. Three hours in-suit, but he could head back to his little ship and refill it well before that. So Eros was moving, was it? He still didn\u0027t feel it, but watching the curved surface of the asteroid, he could see micro-asteroids, all coming from the same direction, bouncing off. If the station kept accelerating, they\u0027d start coming more often, more powerfully. He\u0027d need to stay in the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his hand terminal back to the Eros feed. The station beneath him was chirping and muttering, long slow vowel sounds radiating out from it like recorded whale song. After the angry words and static, the voice of Eros sounded peaceful. He wondered what kind of music Diogo\u0027s friends would be making out of this. Slow dancing didn\u0027t seem like their style. An annoying itch settled in the small of his back, and he shifted in his suit, trying to rub it away. Almost without his noticing it, he grinned. And then laughed. A wave of euphoria passed into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was alien life in the universe, and he was riding on it like a tick on a dog. Eros Station had moved of its own free will and by mechanisms he couldn\u0027t begin to imagine. He didn\u0027t know how many years it had been since he\u0027d been overwhelmed by awe. He\u0027d forgotten the feeling. He raised his arms to his sides, reaching out as if he could embrace the endless dark vacuum below him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, with a sigh, he turned back toward the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the protective shell, he took off the vac suit and hooked the air supply to the recyclers to charge up. With only one person to care for, even low-level life support would have it ready to go within the hour. The ship batteries were still almost fully charged. His hand terminal chimed twice, reminding him that it was once again time for the anti-cancer meds. The ones he\u0027d earned the last time he\u0027d been on Eros. The ones he\u0027d be on for the rest of his life. Good joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fusion bombs were in the ship\u0027s cargo hold: gray square boxes about half again as long as they were tall, like bricks in a mortar of pink adhesive foam. It took Miller twenty minutes of searching through storage lockers to find a can of solvent that still had charge in it. The thin spray from it smelled like ozone and oil, and the stiff pink foam melted under it. Miller squatted beside the bombs and ate a ration bar that tasted convincingly like apples. Julie sat beside him, her head resting weightlessly on his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been a few times that Miller had flirted with faith. Most had been when he was young and trying out everything. Then when he was older, wiser, more worn, and in the crushing pain of the divorce. He understood the longing for a greater being, a huge and compassionate intelligence that could see everything from a perspective that dissolved the pettiness and evil and made everything all right. He still felt that longing. He just couldn\u0027t convince himself it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still, maybe there was something like a plan. Maybe the universe had put him in the right place at the right time to do the thing that no one else would do. Maybe all the pain and suffering he\u0027d been through, all the disappointments and soul-crushing years wallowing through the worst that humanity had to offer up, had been meant to bring him here, to this moment, when he was ready to die if it bought humanity a little time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be pretty to think so, Julie said in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would,\" he agreed with a sigh. At the sound of his voice, the vision of her vanished, just another daydream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bombs were heavier than he\u0027d remembered. Under a full g, he wouldn\u0027t have been able to move them. At only one-third, it was a struggle, but possible. An agonizing centimeter at a time, he dragged one of them onto a handcart and hauled it to the airlock. Eros, above him, sang to itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to rest before he tackled the hard work. The airlock was thin enough that only the bomb or he could fit through at a time. He climbed on top of it to get out the outer airlock door, then had to lift the bomb out with straps he rigged from cargo netting. And once out, it had to be tethered to the ship with magnetic clamps to keep Eros\u0027 spin from slinging it out into the void. After he\u0027d pulled it out and strapped it to the cart, he stopped to rest for half an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more impacts now, a rough sign that Eros was indeed accelerating. Each one a rifle shot, capable of bouncing clean through him or the ship behind him if bad luck sent it in the right direction. But the odds were low of one of the occasional rocks lining up a killing shot with his tiny antlike figure crawling across the surface. Once Eros cleared the Belt, they\u0027d stop, anyway. Was Eros leaving the Belt? He realized he had no idea where Eros was going. He\u0027d assumed it was Earth. Holden would know by now, probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders ached a little from his efforts, but not badly. He worried that he\u0027d overloaded the cart. Its wheels were stronger than his mag boots, but they could still be overcome. The asteroid above him lurched once, a new and unsettling motion that didn\u0027t repeat. His hand terminal cut off the Eros feed, alerting him that he had an incoming connection. He looked at it, shrugged, and let the call come through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naomi,\" he said before she could speak. \"How\u0027ve you been doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence between them stretched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talked to Holden, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" she said. \"He\u0027s still talking about ways to get you off that thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a good guy,\" Miller said. \"Talk him out of it for me, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence hung long enough that Miller started to get uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing there?\" she asked. As if there were an answer for that. As if all his life could be summarized in answer to one simple question. He danced around what she meant and replied only to what she\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ve got a nuclear bomb strapped to a cargo wagon. I\u0027m hauling it over to the access hatch and taking it into station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miller - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing is, we were treating this like a rock. Now everyone knows that\u0027s a little simplistic, but it\u0027s going to take people time to adjust. Navies are still going to be thinking of this thing like a billiard ball when it\u0027s really a rat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was talking too fast. The words spilling out of him in a rush. If he didn\u0027t give her room, she wouldn\u0027t talk. He wouldn\u0027t have to hear what she had to say. He wouldn\u0027t have to keep her from talking him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to have structure. Engines or control centers. Something. If I truck this thing inside, get it close to whatever coordinates the thing, I can break it. Turn it back into a billiard ball. Even if it\u0027s just for a little while, that gives the rest of you a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured,\" she said. \"It makes sense. It\u0027s the right thing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller chuckled. A particularly solid impact tocked against the ship beneath him, the vibration of it jarring his bones. Gas started venting out of the new hole. The station was moving faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said. \"Well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was talking to Amos,\" she said. \"You need a dead man\u0027s switch. So that if something happens, the bomb still goes off. If you have the access codes...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027ve got a routine you can put on your hand terminal. You\u0027ll need to keep your finger on the select button. If you go away for five seconds, it sends the go signal. If you want, I can upload it to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I have to wander around the station with my finger mashed on a button?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi\u0027s tone made it an apology. \"They might take you out with a head shot. Or wrestle you down. The longer the gap, the more chance for the protomolecule to disable the bomb before it goes off. If you need more, I can reprogram it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller looked at the bomb resting on its cart just outside the ship\u0027s airlock. Its readouts all glowed green and gold. His sigh briefly fogged the inside of his helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, no. Five is good. Upload the routine. Am I going to need to tweak it, or is there a simple place I can put the arm-and-fire string?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a setup section,\" Naomi said. \"It prompts you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand terminal chirped, announcing the new file. Miller accepted it, ran it. It was easy as keying in a door code. Somehow he felt that arming fusion bombs to detonate around him should have been more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got it,\" he said. \"We\u0027re good to go. I mean, I still have to move this bastard, but other than that. How fast am I accelerating on this thing, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eventually it will be faster than the Roci can go. Four g and ramping up with no sign of easing off the throttle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t feel it at all,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about before,\" Naomi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a bad situation. We did what we had to do. Same as always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same as always,\" she echoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t speak for a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the trigger,\" Miller said. \"Tell Amos I appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut the connection before she could answer. Long goodbyes weren\u0027t anyone\u0027s strong suit. The bomb rested in the handcart, magnetic clamps in place and a wide woven-steel belt around the whole mess. He moved slowly across the metallic surface of the port docks. If the cart lost its grip on Eros, he wouldn\u0027t be strong enough to hold it back. Of course, if one of the increasingly frequent strikes hit him, it would be a lot like getting shot, so waiting around wasn\u0027t a good solve either. He put both dangers out of his mind and did the work. For ten nervous minutes, his suit smelled of overheating plastic. All the diagnostics showed within the error bars, and by the time the recyclers cleared it, his air supply still looked good. Another little mystery he wasn\u0027t going to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe abyss above him shone with unflickering stars. One of the dots of light was Earth. He didn\u0027t know which one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe service hatch had been tucked in a natural outcropping of stone, the raw-ferrous cart track like a ribbon of silver in the darkness. Grunting, Miller hauled the cart and the bomb and his own exhausted body up around the curve, and spin gravity once again pressed down on his feet instead of stretching his knees and spine. Light-headed, he keyed in the codes until the hatch opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEros lay before him, darker than the empty sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran the hand terminal connection through the suit, calling Holden for what he expected was the last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miller,\" Holden said almost immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m heading in now,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. Look, there\u0027s a way we might be able to get an automated cart. If the Roci - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but you know how it is. I\u0027m already here. And we don\u0027t know how fast this sonofabitch can go. We\u0027ve got a problem we need to fix. This is how we do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolden\u0027s hope had been weak, anyway. Pro forma. A gesture and, Miller thought, maybe even heartfelt. Trying to save everyone, right to the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Holden finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. So once I\u0027ve broken whatever the hell I find in there...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re working on ways to annihilate the station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027d hate to go through the trouble for nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there... Is there anything you want me to do? After?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah,\" Miller said, and then Julie was at his side, her hair floating around her like they were underwater. She glowed in more starlight than was actually there. \"Wait. Yes. A couple things. Julie\u0027s parents. They run Mao-Kwikowski Mercantile. They knew the war was going start before it did. They\u0027ve got to have links to Protogen. Make sure they don\u0027t get away with it. And if you see them, tell them I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t find her in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Holden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller squatted in the darkness. Was there anything else? Shouldn\u0027t there be more? A message to Havelock, maybe? Or Muss. Or Diogo and his OPA friends? But then there would have to be something to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Miller said. \"That\u0027s it, then. It was good working with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry it came down this way,\" Holden said. It wasn\u0027t an apology for what he\u0027d done or said, for what he\u0027d chosen and refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Miller said. \"But what can you do, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as close to goodbye as either of them could get. Miller shut the connection, brought up the script Naomi had sent him, and enabled it. While he was at it, he turned the Eros feed back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft hushing sound, like fingernails scratching down an endless sheet of paper. He turned on the cart\u0027s lights, the dark entrance of Eros brightening to industrial gray, shadows scattering to the corners. His imagined Julie stood in the glare like it was a spotlight, the glow illuminating her and all the structures behind her at the same time, the remnant of a long dream, almost over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took off the brakes, pushed, and went inside Eros for the last time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-51.html","bookId":2454,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM"}
