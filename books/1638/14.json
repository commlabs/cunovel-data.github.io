He heard the distant thump, and a crowd of people shout in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes walked to the ledge and looked down. A fire truck had been commandeered, the ladder pushed up to the roof.

It was Faison. \"Miss us much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes pointed at Watanabe, and Faison paused. \"Damn. Didn\u0027t like the spook, but still...\" He pointed at two ODSTs and detailed them to wrap up Watanabe\u0027s body. Keyes looked away and swallowed the lump in his throat. He\u0027d seen too much death for one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re firing RPGs around.

He looked around. \"But don\u0027t worry, we\u0027ve got it in hand, Lieutenant.

It gave them unobstructed line of sight to the surrounding streets and buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Water Tower is ... clear of the lattice ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s most definitely not going out to party tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moving location.\" One of them jumped off and sprinted across the rooftop, the long barrel of the sniper rifle bobbing. He set up on the corner of the building, the edge of the gun resting on the concrete lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While you\u0027re huffing about, Mr. Street Corner is sighting on the Pelican ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the last one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaison made a circling motion with his hand. \"That\u0027s how we do it, gentlemen. Bring the other Pelicans in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Pelicans descended out of the clouds and came in hard, slamming onto the roof. Hansen and Keyes ran up the ramps and buckled in; the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelljumpers followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pelicans dusted off, engines screaming as they zigzagged their way out of the neighborhood. An occasional zap of plasma-rifle fire rang in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the ramp shut, Faison staggered his way forward to Keyes and handed him him a cigar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes eyed the flaked exterior. \"A Sweet William?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing but the best, sir. A victory smoke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A victory smoke?\" Keyes looked over at Watanabe\u0027s body. \"We lost two of our own down there. Those rioters have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovenant weapons, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, any day you come back from a mission alive, it\u0027s a victory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Helljumper grinned. They were a different breed of soldier, Keyes had to keep reminding himself. They had to be. Packing yourself into a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheatshield pod, braving the flames of reentry over a planet, and parachuting down into the middle of action, surrounded ... that was a bit above the call of duty for a normal marine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes handed Faison back the cigar. \"I don\u0027t smoke. It\u0027s against regulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, I\u0027ve seen you standing with a pipe, in the chart room, looking over maps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grandfather\u0027s pipe. It was an heirloom, and Keyes kept it on him. It comforted him to have it in hand. An old habit. \"And I don\u0027t smoke it. But tell you what, marine, when I see a victory, I\u0027ll smoke one with you. This wasn\u0027t a victory, it was a cluster -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t a complete loss,\" Hansen said. She stood at the center of the Pelican, balancing as the craft shook and shuddered its way higher and higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reason Kincaide was so set on eliminating us was that he realized he made a mistake. He told me the name of the next ship making a smuggling run while he was trying to bid up the price of the weapons. Said he\u0027d done business with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the name of the ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese Covenant weapons, they\u0027re a problem, Keyes.

And we damn well need to stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hoo-ah,\" one of the Helljumpers agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes folded his arms. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d hunt it to the edge of the galaxy if necessary, as far as Keyes was concerned. Someone was going to have to pay for all the deaths on his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" the pilot of the Pelican shouted back into the hold. \"Sir, the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night\u0027s hailing us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot\u0027s voice had cracked slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes walked calmly up behind the woman\u0027s chair, even though he could feel the kick in his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot\u0027s helmet twisted back. It had the name Carson stenciled on it. The Pelican bucked a bit as it passed over clouds, still gaining altitude. The craft was pitched up, aiming for the black of space. \"The sensor stations at the edge of the system think something\u0027s coming in. Something big,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Covenant?\" Keyes asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know of any other fleets planning to wing by this place?\" Carson returned to getting them to orbit, and Keyes stumbled back down the steep angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are there any Navy ships scheduled to arrive?\" he asked Hansen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Cole is still out near Harvest. Mawikizi\u0027s main fleet is spread out around Ectanus.

So far only Admiral Cole and his battle group had ever scored a meaningful victory against the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCovenant. And it was a loose secret within the Navy that Cole had thrown three ships against the Covenant forces for every ship of theirs he destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night and the three other frigates would be facing long odds. \"If it\u0027s Covenant, we\u0027ll have to utilize that stealth for a defense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith stealth, and the single MAC gun aboard the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight, a series of hit-and-runs could perhaps harass the Covenant into chasing them, and lure them into a situation where the three Destroyers would only face one or two Covenant ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHansen shook her head. \"If the Covenant are coming for Charybdis, your one frigate will make no difference. Keyes, it\u0027s vital you follow up on the Kestrel, find out what the Covenant are really up to. It\u0027s what your ship was designed for. We can\u0027t waste it on a last stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But -- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t be a wise use of resources.\" Hansen bit her lip. \"And the UNSC, every day, has fewer and fewer resources to spare, Keyes. We\u0027ve been fighting the Covenant now for almost a decade. As of now, we\u0027ve pretty much lost all the Outer Colonies. You need to find out what is going on. You need to go after the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Covenant get all the way in-system and trap you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t sit well with Keyes, abandoning people to a doomed defense. He stood next to the ONI agent in silence as the Pelican broke free of the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After you drop me off at the orbital depot, tell Zheng to get clear. I\u0027ll transmit the orders. You\u0027ll find that I outrank you both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" Keyes said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHansen sighed. \"And when you find your real victory, Lieutenant, make sure you smoke one of those Sweet Williams for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re coming in!\" Carson announced from the cockpit. \"And fast. Captain Zheng wants us back on board ASAP.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the cockpit windows the long spars of a Navy orbital depot slowly rotated. Carson twitched the Pelican until it slammed against one of the spokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the back opened, Keyes stood straight and saluted. The ODSTs inside followed his example, not sure what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHansen saluted back, and then left the Pelican.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Carson shouted. \"Hang on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter EIGHTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUNSC DESTROYER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDO YOU FEEL LUCKY?,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHARYBDIS IX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel \u0027Vadamee burst through a corridor at a full run and aimed a plasma rifle down its length.
