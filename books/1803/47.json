There was a stack as high as my waist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip and gave him a laughing look. \"Did you actually look at any of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you\u0027d find them very edifying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen knew nothing of women\u0027s magazines, except that women read them faithfully, but in an effort to keep the conversation going, he politely inquired about the names of the magazines she\u0027d received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there was one with a very long name. If I remember correctly, it was called, The Ladies Monthly Museum, or Polite Repository of Amusement and Instruction: being an Assemblage of what can Tend to please the Fancy, Instruct the Mind or Exalt the Character of the British Fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of that in one magazine?\" Stephen teased. \"That\u0027s quite an ambitious undertaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought, until I looked at the articles. Do you know what one of them was about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Based on that look on your face, I\u0027d be afraid to hazard a guess,\" he said, chuckling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was about rouge,\" she provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The article was about how to rouge one\u0027s cheeks. It was absolutely riveting. Do you suppose that falls under the heading of \u0027Instructing the Mind\u0027 or of \u0027Exalting the Character\u0027?\" she inquired with sham gravity as Stephen\u0027s shoulders shook with helpless laughter at her wit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of the other magazines did have articles of far more import, however. For example, in the one called La Belle Assemblée, or Bell\u0027s Court and Fashionable Magazine addressed particularly to the Ladies, there was an informative treatise on the correct way for a lady to hold her skirts when she curtsies. I was spellbound! I had never realized it was preferable to use only the thumb and forefinger of each hand to spread one\u0027s skirts, instead of all the fingers God gave us. Dainty perfection is the ideal to which every woman must aspire, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that your theory, or the magazine\u0027s?\" Stephen asked with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a sidewise, laughing look that was a miracle of jaunty irreverence. \"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen thought he\u0027d take her jaunty irreverence over dainty perfection every day of his life. \"I think we should have that rubbish removed from your bedchamber.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, you mustn\u0027t. Truly you mustn\u0027t. I read the articles every night in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" Stephen asked because she looked perfectly serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes! I read one page and nod right off. It\u0027s ever so much more effective than a sleeping draught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen pulled his gaze from her entrancing face and watched her shove her hair back off her forehead and give it an impatient shake that sent a veil of coppery locks sliding off her shoulder. He\u0027d liked it where it had been, draped artlessly over her right breast. Annoyed with the impossible direction of his thoughts, Stephen said abruptly, \"Since we\u0027ve ruled out rouge and curtsying, what are you interested in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou, Sherry thought. I am interested in you. I am interested in why you seem uneasy right now. I am interested in why there are times when you smile at me as if you see only me and I am all that matters. I am interested in why there are times when I sense that you don\u0027t want to see me at all, even when I\u0027m in front of you. I am interested in anything that matters to you because I want so much to matter to you. I am interested in history. Your history. My history. \"History! I like history,\" she provided brightly after a pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else do you like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince she couldn\u0027t speak from memory, she gave him the only answer that came to mind. \"I think I like horses very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yesterday, as your coachman drove me through a park, I saw ladies riding, and I felt… happy. Excited. I think I must know how to ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, we\u0027ll have to find you a suitable mount and find out. I\u0027ll send word to Tattersall\u0027s and have someone over there choose a nice, gentle little mare for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tattersall\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an auction house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I go along and watch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not without causing an uproar.\" She gave him a startled look, and he smiled. \"Females are not allowed at Tatt\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I see. Actually, I\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t spend money on a horse. It may turn out that I don\u0027t know how to ride at all. Could I not use one of your horses first, to find out? I could ask your coachman—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t even consider it,\" Stephen warned sharply. \"I do not own a horse suitable for you or any other woman to ride, no matter how accomplished you may be. My animals are not the sort for a demure jog through the park.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what I imagined yesterday. I felt like I wanted to gallop and feel the wind in my face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No gallops,\" he decreed. No matter how much riding she\u0027d done, she was no rawboned country girl; she was slender and delicate, without the strength to handle a spirited gallop. When she looked bewildered and mutinous, he explained gruffly, \"I don\u0027t want to carry you home unconscious for a second time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suppressed a shudder at the memory of her limp body in his arms, and that reminded him of another accident… another limp body belonging to a young baron with a life ahead of him and a beautiful girl who wanted to marry him. The recollection banished all desire to delay coming to the real point of their visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning back in his chair, Stephen gave her what he hoped was a warm, enthusiastic smile and put his plan for her future into action. \"I\u0027m delighted to tell you that my sister-in-law has persuaded the most fashionable modiste in London to abandon her shop in its busiest time and to come here, with seamstresses in tow, in order to design a wardrobe for you to wear during the Season\u0027s activities.\" Instead of being thrilled, she furrowed her brow a little at the news. \"Surely, that doesn\u0027t displease you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. But you see I don\u0027t need any more gowns. I still have two that I haven\u0027t yet worn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a total of five ordinary day dresses, and she actually believed that was a wardrobe. Stephen decided her father must have been a selfish miser. \"You will need a great many other things, besides those few items.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the London Season calls for an extensive wardrobe,\" he said vaguely. \"I also wanted to tell you that Dr. Whitticomb will be arriving this afternoon with an acquaintance of his, an elderly lady who, I understand from the doctor\u0027s note, is eager and competent to be an acceptable duenna for you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3/page-47.html","bookId":1803,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM"}
