To lighten the mood, the guests drag out an old Ouija board for a little spooky fun -- and that\u0027s when things become truly terrifying. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSummoned by the Ouija board, the restless spirit of Beau Kidd, the lead detective -- and chief suspect -- on the original case, seeks Christina\u0027s help: the latest killing isn\u0027t a copycat crime, and he wants his name cleared. Back in the real world, cop-turned-writer Jed Braden is skeptical of Christina\u0027s ghostly encounters, but his police sources confirm all the intimate details of the case -- her otherworldly source is reliable, and the body count is growing. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe spirits are right. The Interstate Killer is still out there, and Christina\u0027s life is hanging in the balance between this world and the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-seance-harrison-investigation-5.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-seance-harrison-investigation-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:29:34 PM"}
