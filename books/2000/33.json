I’m starting to think she might be avoiding me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, I don’t know what to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thinking is all I’ve done, and it’s messing with my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate not knowing where I stand with her. Are we back to being just friends? Have I fucked it up completely with her? Has she changed her mind about me … us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t just come out and ask her. I’m worried if I do, I’ll hear something I don’t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up, feeling irritated and frustrated, and angry with myself. It’s a fucking hot day, and it hasn’t cooled with the sun going down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDozer lifts his head and gives a sad sigh. He’s missing her too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck this. I need to cool off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strip my tank and shorts off, leaving just my boxer shorts on. I run toward the lake, down the boardwalk, and dive straight in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold waters hits me, making me feel instantly clearer. I swim under the water until my lungs start to burn, forcing me to resurface. I scrub my hands over my face, drying off the water, and push my hair back. Blinking the water off my lashes, I tip my head back and float in the water as I stare up at the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve no idea how long I stay there like that, but when I decide to swim back, I push my legs down and lift my head to see Mia standing at the edge of the boardwalk watching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks like an angel silhouetted by the glow of the early evening sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, I swim to her, reaching a few feet from the boardwalk when I’m stopped in my tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers gripping the hem of her shirt, she pulls it over her head, dropping it to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air is knocked out of me, and I can only stare at the gorgeous sight of her. Denim shorts and a white lace bra make for a sexy image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks like a fucking angel. A sexy fucking angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she unbuttons her shorts and slides them down her legs, stepping out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s wearing matching lace panties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you god.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m transfixed. I have never seen anything as beautiful as her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on the edge of the boardwalk, she swings her legs in the water. Hands on the sides, she slides down, submerging herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swims close to me. “Hi,” she says quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry I haven’t been around. I just—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “Mia, you don’t have to explain anything—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I do. And I will. But not right now. Right now, all I want is for you to kiss me … and make love to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. Me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suck in a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want her. Really want her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour ago, I would have sold my Mustang if it meant I could be with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now … I don’t know what this means. She’s been gone all day, and now she turns up, strips off her clothes, and tells me she wants me to make love to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cock is telling my brain to shut the fuck up, and just do it, but my head is worried if I do, I’ll only end up pushing her further away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you, Jordan … please,” she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing her plead like that … I’m done for. Add in the fact that I haven’t had sex for weeks, and she is the most beautiful woman I’ve had the privilege to know, and my willpower is shot to fucking hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand goes to the back of her head and I bring my mouth crashing down to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moans, her arms instantly going around my neck, her legs wrapping around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus fucking Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap both my arms around her tiny waist, kissing her like there’s no breath left in my body. Like she’s my lifeline. With our mouths melded together, I lick the inside of her mouth. She tastes like a mixture of candy and mouthwash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands slide down my arms, into the water and then across my back. Her fingers creep into the elastic of my boxers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you,” she breathes into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen my goddamn brain has to kick back in. I really fucking hate my brain at times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait.” I pull back, breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disappointment shows clear in her eyes. I take her face in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t have to do this now. I’ll wait, however long you need. I just want to be with you. That’s all that matters. Sex can come later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grip on my boxer shorts increases, and I can feel her nails digging in my skin. “I don’t want to wait. I want you now. I want to feel normal and complete and whole, and I feel all those things when I’m with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, solemn. “Babe, having sex with me isn’t going to change how you feel about yourself. Those things will still be there afterwards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho the fuck am I nowadays? Dr. Fucking Phil?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But they’ll be gone for a time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head again because I don’t know what else to do. To be honest, I’m feeling pretty fucking gutted right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze lowers. “You don’t want me,” she whispers, starting to pull away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone in her voice almost kills me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping hold, I force her eyes to mine. “I want you, babe. Believe me, I want you like I’ve never wanted anything before in my life. I can think of nothing else but you. What it would feel like to be inside you. I want you because I’m gone for you.” I let out a light sigh, my gaze dipping. “But I want you to have sex with me because you want it for the same reasons as I do – and no other reason.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leans in and sucks my bottom lip into her mouth. “I want you because, since the day I met you, I’ve thought of nothing else but what it would feel like to have you inside me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, my brain is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss her with everything I have. I kiss her like I don’t know how long I have left with her. And maybe that’s because I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubs herself up against my aching cock, and the need to be inside her becomes urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, Mia,” I groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping hold of her, I wade through the water and walk up the bank, not wanting to let go of her for one second, with only one destination is in mind – my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia’s hands are gripping my shoulders, nails digging in my damp skin. Her wet tits are pressed up against my chest, begging for me to touch them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding the palm of my hand over the lace of her bra, I rub her already hard nipple through it. Then I move my hand up, around the nape of her neck, driving my fingers into her hair, I take her mouth again in a deep, hard kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moans a sound so fucking erotic that I almost lose my shit right here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally reach my room, I kick the door shut, then lay her down on my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy room is in darkness, the only light coming in through the window. I really want to see her, so I reach for the lamp, but she stops me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to see every gorgeous inch of her, but because it’s her, and I know she’ll have her reasons, I let it go and slowly retract my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can forego the light, but after tonight, I’m going to have every light in this goddamn room on so that I can see every beautiful inch of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare down at her, letting my eyes adjust to the dark. I see the creamy skinned silhouette of Mia on my bed, and it turns me on in a way I didn’t know possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never had a woman in my bed before. This has always been my space, but I want to share my space with her. I want her here. I want her in every aspect of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing up on the bed, I kneel between her parted legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean over her, hands pressing into the mattress either side of her head. I dip my mouth down and kiss her once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I trail my hand with featherlight movements down her face, going down her neck until I reach the peak of breasts where her still damp skin awaits me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this okay?” I check before diving in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” She sounds breathy and sexy. So damn hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting her hand to my head, she slides her fingers into my damp hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI free one strap off her shoulder, letting it fall as I move the cup, freeing her breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nipple is taut, and so very ready for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dip my head and take her into my mouth, sucking hard. She groans, her hips jerking upward, pressing her pussy hard against my cock. I nearly shoot my load.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” I groan. I grip her hip with my hand, keeping her steady. I intend on making this last for as long as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI return my attention to her nipple, laving it with my tongue, then I begin licking and sucking every part of her tit. Not content with the limited access, I ease my hand behind her, reaching for the clasp on her bra. She inclines, allowing me to unhook it, and I slide it down her arms, tossing it to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lays back, hands on my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare down at her naked tits, unable to look away. “Fuck … Mia, you’re beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand goes to her face, covering it. I know she’s feeling shy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move her hand from her face. “You’re beautiful,” I reaffirm and press a gentle kiss to her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift down her body, allowing me access to her neglected tit. I take it in my mouth, paying it the same attention, sucking and licking while I pinch her other nipple with my thumb and finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cries out. Pushing against me, panting, “Jordan, please. I need you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck. You’re so fucking hot.” I drop my head against her chest. “I wanted this to last, but I don’t know if I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting to my knees, I hook my fingers into the top of her damp panties. I pause, giving her time to let me know if this is too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods her head, lightly. “Please,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull her panties down her legs. She bends her leg, allowing me to slip it off one leg, then the other. I toss them to the floor and look down at her pussy. It’s shaved and neat. I bet she tastes as sweet as she smells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cock hardens further. I grab it through my wet boxers, sliding the shaft up and down, all the while staring at her pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to taste you.” I’m asking, but I don’t wait for her answer because I’m off the end of the bed, knees on the floor, spreading her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my mouth to her pussy, sucking on her clit. Jesus, she tastes amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cries out, making a mewling sound, digging her heels into the bed. I smile, loving her reaction as I run my nose between her lips, inhaling her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So fuckin’ good,” I murmur, knowing the vibration of my voice will only tease her further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, Jordan…” she moans. “I need…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my tongue down, pushing it inside her, taking more of her sweetness into my mouth. “Shh … it’s okay. I got you, babe.” I press my tongue against her clit and slide a finger inside her. Then another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I’m pumping my fingers in and out, licking and sucking her. And I don’t stop going until she’s exploding under my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she’s coming down from her orgasm, I remove my boxer shorts in the fastest time known to man, and climb up her panting, trembling body, so ready to be inside her it’s not even funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss her, running my tongue over her lips, letting her taste herself on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sucks my tongue into her mouth. Her fingers dig into my hips, pulling me closer. “I want you,” she breathes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus. She’s so fucking sexy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trouble/page-33.html","bookId":2000,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM"}
