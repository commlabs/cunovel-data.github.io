I didn\u0027t know. It was so hard to think in the steamy ass car with her suppleness like a burning line beneath me. I propped myself up on my elbows and swept her hair back from her temples, staring into her eyes, so green even in the dimness of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know how much you want to,\" Jade said in a low voice. Breathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCouldn\u0027t hide a thing from her. I wasn\u0027t one of those jerks though. The guys that just wanted to take a girl for what he could and move on to the next.

I ... \" she couldn\u0027t go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was something else. And I didn\u0027t need Empath skills to pick up on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked, pulling her chin toward me until her eyes met mine, using the pad of my thumb to wipe the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my dad,\" she said in a near whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about him?\" I asked. What the hell did he have to do with any of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to look away and I said, \"Don\u0027t.

Me and Andrea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my balls clench, the rage instantaneous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I asked, seething, my anger like a taste on my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He got served the order and it sent him into some kind of rage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he do, Jade?

I hauled her up into a sitting position. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" I shook her. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell the police?

Her bare arms. Too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d just gotten the streamlined version of her dad\u0027s end. My true fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fervent wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"That\u0027s not the way Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me, Jade,\" I said quietly, \"he\u0027s not gonna stop. Sometime, like what just happened, he\u0027s gonna be there and I\u0027m not. Pulse the cops. Put them on notice. Let them know that he transgressed the order,\" I said, tearing a frustrated hand through my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me be with you. You don\u0027t have to do it alone, ya know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat quietly for a moment, the hot mood shattered like molten glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does this have to do with us... being together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at me from the crook of my arm. \"He called me names, said I was... \" she didn\u0027t want to repeat it, I could tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s ugly,\" embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said that you\u0027d just \u0027tap me\u0027 and throw me away.

Looked like a slut.\" She hung her head in shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head felt thick and I had a surge of thudding vertigo. I\u0027d never wanted to kill someone so bad in my life. Not when Smith had her by the hair, not when Brett had hauled her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for crushing her spirit and making her feel less when she was so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I wanted him to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted his suffering first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt filled my mind like a cup full of water, spilling over the edge and running onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of my words, moving my hand to her clothing, off that skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skin that knew so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not gonna lie, Jade. I want you so bad you make my body ache. It\u0027s the truth.\" I looked down at her face, the soft triangle overwhelmed by the size of her eyes and went on, swallowing, \"But I don\u0027t want you just for that. I love you, I want to be with you. Only you.\" I cupped her face, my thumb running over her jaw, wearing a hole there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI deliberately moved my hand in a slow caress to her neck, wrapping my fingers around the smallness of it and she gasped, the tears flowing freely now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You love me,\" she said, her eyes filling with the sure knowledge of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" I said, never looking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m a whore,\" she said in a soft voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head slowly. \"I could never think that,\" I said. The truth of my words echoing through whatever thread let her feel what people were really about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up on her knees and leaned into me, her hands grabbing my shoulders for balance. \"I\u0027m ready,\" Jade said. Her eyes held mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. Just the words I\u0027d been hopin\u0027 to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I did the right thing. \"I\u0027ve got all kinds of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Like how much time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you? Forever,\" I cupped the smallness of her face, her skin a silken brush under the warmth of my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her lips to mine and we sucked up some more stolen joy. My arms around her. Protecting her from everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncluding myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe left the police station, Garcia and Gale fully aware of LeClerc. It wouldn\u0027t stop his dumb ass, but it would put Jade in a more powerful position if he thought going back over there was a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia had followed Jade and I out into the gray day, rain threatening. Around here, it was the Pacific Northwest fall/winter; six months of gloom, gray and rain. Jade wore her pink puffy and it was a siren of color against the fade of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kids need a ride?\" Garcia said, looking at Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Better for me not to go home right now if you\u0027re gonna talk to Andrea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia turned around and walked toward her. \"You did the right thing, Jade.\" His eyes searched hers and I took her hand. \"He doesn\u0027t get to go to your home and terrorize women. It\u0027s Not. Allowed. That\u0027s why there\u0027s laws against domestic violence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s eyes filled with tears that didn\u0027t fall. \"I know, but she\u0027s scared too. And she\u0027ll be angry with me. Because I told. I told,\" Jade whispered again, her eyes pleading for understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale heard that last and said, \"Someone has to break this cycle, Jade. This is the very reason Andrea has custody. He\u0027s not safe for you to live with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade nodded, she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke the somber mood with, \"Hate to let you down, with how much I love to ride in the back of your cool cop car... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia glowered, his strong arms sticking out from stable hips that had seen some gym time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" I rushed on, \"I have wheels now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade smiled, her sad mood dissipating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" He laughed. \"Okay, Mr. Hart, show me your car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale rolled her eyes. \"Do we have time for your car worshiping, Raul? Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade threw a sympathetic glance her way but it didn\u0027t matter, us guys were on the clear path to Male Communion and the females would have to deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia moved around my car appreciatively. Finally, he asked, \"How could you afford this, Caleb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bry and I worked all summer. I was a landscaping slave and gave the money to Gramps.\" I shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... so this was Mr. O\u0027Brien\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Yeah, he never got rid of it from when he was a teenager.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia gave a low whistle. \"That\u0027s a find and a half!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much did he pay for it when he bought it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two grand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia barked out a laugh, Gale and Jade giving him a peculiar look. \"Those were the days. You know, my Dad had something like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah?\" I put the flat of my hand on the hood and Jade gave me a withering look like I was settling in for a long talk about cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh, go figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFemales just didn\u0027t understand the importance of owning your transport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded emphatically. \"Yeah it was a 1969 Mach I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Ford... come on, Garcia!\" I all but yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChevy or nothing, that\u0027s what Gramps and I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head at me. \"It was The Car to have back then, trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to defend Chevy when Gale interrupted, \"Okay car aficionados.... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia corrected her pronunciation in perfect Spanish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever, we have work.\" She gave him the pre-rant look. Ah-huh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had it. \"Right.\" He turned to me and rapped his knuckle lightly on the hood, close to where my palm lay, \"Nice ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked off to do a little drive by at Jade\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hopped in my car to go do something equally important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to visit Clyde. I needed to come up with a plan for him. He was a sentient being, not some undead pet.

I was bettin\u0027 Gramps had juiced this thing to the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few fat drops of rain splattered the windshield and I pulsed the wipers on. They flung themselves back and forth, swiping the rain away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade smiled and we drove off together.
