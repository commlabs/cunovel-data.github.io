He concentrated on pouring his true essence into the black sphere.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe black sphere was like a bottomless pit. Even though it had already swallowed a colossal amount of energy, it still didn’t give any response.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSlowly, the bald man began to pant as if he had trouble breathing, and the monkey-faced man was also flushed and sweating. However, Lin Ming with his extreme restorative ability and resilience appeared the most relaxed, but as he revolved his true essence, on the surface he appeared to be a bit red and a little sluggish.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“A little more, we’re almost there!” The monkey-faced man said. The black sphere began to emit a faint light and the entire chamber began to shake. With a deep rumbling sound, the door to the Sorcerer Pagoda finally swung open. A magnificently iridescent jade pagoda that glowed with a milky light appeared in front of everyone’s awed gazes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Hahahaha!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe monkey-faced man saw the Sorcerer Pagoda and began to wildly laugh.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming was stirred.

Let’s see which one of us two brothers can reach a higher level. But… before that, there is a little matter that we have to attend to.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe monkey-faced man turned to Lin Ming, smiling, but in that smile was contained a wild killing intent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I told you to leave, why didn’t you leave!?” Na Yi anxiously asked Lin Ming through a true essence sound transmission. She was flustered; was this boy an idiot?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming responded, “The reason I came here is for the power of the Sorcerer, but also because I want to help you. I just said a moment ago, that even though you have the Fatebound Heartcrush Bug, you two sisters might not escape here alive.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Wh… what? Do you really think you are going to…?” Na Yi found it incredible. Did Lin Ming really want to deal with these two people? He was an Altering Muscle stage martial artist while they were at the peak Bone Forging stage! There was a difference in their cultivations of a stage and a half! Not only that, but there were two!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe bald man and the monkey-faced man walked around Lin Ming’s right and left sides, encircling him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Little Brother Mo, you’ve worked too hard.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming had dropped down to his knees, and was taking big gulps of breath as if he had been drained of all strength. He used his elbows to wipe away his sweat and said, “You two big brothers are too kind. Since you’ve been dealing with so many vicious beasts, it’s you two that are working the hardest. I was just taking a trip to accompany you two.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn this posture, he looked like a very unsuspecting idiot victim. However, his soul force had already locked onto the two men’s every action and movement. While leaning down, his finger was already tracing his spatial ring.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSince it was two peak Bone Forging martial artists against one at the Altering Muscle stage, he would first have them lower their guard, and then try kill one in a single stroke. The other he could slowly contend with.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn contrast, if he failed to instantly strike down the first, then the two would be on full alert, and might even separately escape. With so many possible traps in the Sorcerer Holy Land, it would be too troublesome to hunt them down here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNot only that, but since the monkey-faced man had the Fatebound Heartcrush Bug within him, trying to cope with him would be much more tricky.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe monkey-faced man said with a smile, “Little Brother Mo, you see where we are, there are simply countless traps layered on top of each other. This place is deep underground; it’s quiet and safe. It’s simply like a natural tomb!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLin Ming gasped, looking lost, “What do you mean by saying that?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“What do I mean? Hehehe, my meaning is that since the scenery here is so beautiful, then us brothers will let you safely rest here forever!” As the monkey-faced man said this, his expression suddenly turned wretched. He gripped the short axe on his back, and had already moved to chop off Lin Ming’s head. At the same time, the bald man had also taken out the mace on his back and was sweeping towards Lin Ming’s waist!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThese two tandem attacks had instantly sealed off Lin Ming’s ability to dodge in any direction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNa Shui cried out in alarm!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“Die!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs the monkey-faced man’s axe cleaved down, in that moment, Lin Ming’s form had suddenly vanished!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePuff!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe bald man’s mace was just halfway down, when he suddenly felt a piercingly cold feeling in his chest. A shimmering silver object was protruding from his chest. He blankly looked down at this object. It was the spearhead of a long spear. Even though there was some blood on it, the blood did not stick to the spearhead. Instead, it flowed down along the ridge of the spear before collecting into crimson drops and dripping onto the floor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDrip drip drip…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn the deep quiet of the chamber, the sound of blood dripping onto the floor was especially piercing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe monkey-faced man still had his fierce expression.

Though that last strike seemed as if it had easily killed the bald man, the truth was that was because the bald man had lowered his guard, and didn’t utilize much true essence to protect himself. That was why Lin Ming had so easily succeeded.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNow however, the monkey-faced man was on complete guard.
