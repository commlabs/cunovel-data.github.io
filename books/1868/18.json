I grabbed my neck. \"Am I a...?\" I asked. Becky helped me up. \"I thought you were kidding when you said they were vampires. I think that Jagger guy really believed he was. He tried to bite you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my neck for wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the memory started to come back. I never thought it would happen. My nemesis and the love of my life, enraged for different reasons, both staring straight at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had spent the last few days trying to save Trevor from the clutches of a vampire and now he, alongside Alexander, unknowingly saved me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of their tackling Jagger had sent me flying to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I now raced the few yards to the tombs, where a huge crowd had gathered. Alexander was standing over Jagger, who was coughing and wheezing. Luna was leaning against the covenant coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor had no idea that the garlic tablet was making them vulnerable. He thought it was his bravado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soccer snobs encircled Jagger and Luna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt and Becky stayed by my side. \"Alexander\u0027s deathly allergic to garlic,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like Jagger and Luna are, too,\" Becky remarked. \"That and being pummeled by Alexander and Trevor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told Trevor the gelcap was an aphrodisiac,\" I proudly whispered when I reached Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently he told his friends, too,\" he said softly with a smile. \"The entire soccer team must have taken them.\" Alexander turned to Jagger and Luna. \"It\u0027s time you return to Romania. For good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, go back to Romania, you freaks!\" Trevor said, balling up his fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my arm around Alexander\u0027s waist and held him close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I turned to Trevor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you are the school bully again,\" I complimented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then a dog started barking, distracting everyone. We all turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on here?\" Old Jim, the caretaker, called, holding a flashlight toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhosts and goblins started to jump the fence. Werewolves and witches hid behind tombstones. The soccer snobs took off around the shed. Becky and Matt raced up the cemetery aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with all these cans?\" Old Jim scolded. \"I\u0027m going to call the police!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander, Trevor, and I turned back to the coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that remained was the flickering candelabra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger and Luna were gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampireville-vampire-kisses-3/page-18.html","bookId":1868,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM"}
