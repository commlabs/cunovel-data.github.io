By doing that, you went against the rules. In other words, from now on, the Blood Red Hell has been eliminated from the Grand Tournament.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Hahahaha.” Fen Tian threw his head back and laughed. A devilish expression suddenly appeared on his face. The power that he had been suppressing the entire time had instantly burst forth - terrifying Destruction Energy erupted in all directions, as though it had exploded. The sky had immediately darkened - there was practically no need for the Destruction Energy to taint it at all. It made everyone present feel as though they had entered a world that was full of Destruction Energy. All the attributes that were floating in the air had immediately been shattered, leaving behind only terrifying Destruction Energy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a very powerful Celestial Territory - even Zhou Weiqing found it difficult to continue his flight in the sky, causing him to land in front of the Peerless Sect. The surroundings were covered in darkness - they were only able to vaguely identify everything around them because of the purple flames that were ignited on the bodies of the Blood Red Hell members.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Max Level Heavenly God,” said Xue AoTian as he gasped in shock.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore today’s Grand Tournament, everyone had high expectations of Fen Tian. However, the moment when everyone saw Fen Tian display his Max Level Heavenly God Stage cultivation base, they realized that they had underestimated Fen Tian, as well as the Blood Red Hell.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe purple flames on Fen Tian were akin to a layer of dazzling outerwear, making his entire being appear to be more sinister. The surroundings were pitch-black. He was not the only powerful person there. All the Blood Red Hell members that possessed the Destruction Attribute seemed as though they were injected with drugs or steroids - every single one of them emitted an extremely powerful aura that was matchless in this world. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShen Mo’s breathing had clearly become a lot heavier. He was the one who caught Shen Bu’s corpse, as it fell from the sky. Looking at Shen Bu’s completely lifeless body, Shen Bu clenched her teeth and said, “I had already said this before a long time ago - we need to use power to subdue them, and directly lay all our cards on the table in front of them. The Grand Tournament did not have to be part of the plan, and if we did not take part in this tournament, Shen Bu would not have died.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Are you questioning my judgment?” Fen Tian glared coldly at him. Shen Mo immediately stopped talking, and looked down, not daring to make a single sound.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Tianyang looked at the members of the Blood Red Hell and said indifferently, “Fen Tian, what are you trying to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFen Tian replied, “Don’t tell me that you still don’t know what I’m trying to do? This is my Celestial Territory, the Destruction Celestial Territory. Within my Celestial Territory, I am the ruler - unless there is any individual whose cultivation base is higher than mine, which is what the legends termed as the Heavenly Change Stage. Everything here is under my control. According to my original plan, I was going to weaken all of you via the Grand Tournament. After all, all of you are from Saint Lands and hence possess a certain level of power. Unfortunately, from the looks of it, everyone has already found out about the truth. I even lost a few of my competent subordinates in succession earlier on. Thus, I don’t see a point in continuing in the Grand Tournament any longer. Now, I’m going to give you two choices.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused slightly. A devilish light flashed within his eyes that were already flickering with dark purple rays of light. One had to admit that the pressure created by Fen Tian, whose cultivation base was at the Max Level Heavenly God Stage, had caused everyone to feel suffocated, including Xue AoTian himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Heavenly King Stage, the disparity between each level was similar to a gulf. Fen Tian was a Max Level Heavenly God - as a Mid Level Heavenly God, Xue AoTian had no desire to fight against him. Even more so now that they were currently trapped within his Destruction Celestial Territory that seemed to have enveloped the entire heaven and earth.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat should we do?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003eSeveral people present wanted to ask that question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFen Tian’s voice continued to ring in the air, “The first option - I do not need you to pledge allegiance to the Blood Red Hell. As long as every Great Saint Land seals yourselves away and lives in seclusion for a thousand years, I will show mercy and let you off. During the process of sealing yourselves, you are not allowed to interfere with the Mainland’s affairs. I am planning to unify the entire Boundless Mainland.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“What if we don’t agree?” replied Shangguan Tianyang coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFen Tian smiled, “If you don’t agree? If you don’t agree, everyone who is present will have to die. Perhaps, killing all of you might cause us to incur huge losses. However, if I am able to annihilate everyone here, the Boundless Mainland will still be under my control.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was somewhat baffled and asked, “Fen Tian, since you have the power of a Max Level Heavenly God, why did you wait till now to take action? If we were to seal our respective Saint Lands, it does not mean that you won’t attack us. Do you really think we are 3 year old children?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFen Tian replied plainly, “Naturally, I have my reasons for doing things a certain way. Even though we are enemies, I mean what I say. As for what will happen a thousand years later, it will have to depend on your own power by then. However, I would like to add on one more thing - I will allow the other Saint Lands to seal themselves, but as for the Peerless Sect, you don’t have an option as such. Today, I will take the lives of every single member of the Peerless Sect. No man will be spared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled, “I already knew that you will not let me go. The Saint Energy and the Destruction Energy are direct opposites. I am still very young - you are afraid that given enough time, I’ll become a lot more powerful. By then, you will not be able to control me. I’m right, aren’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFen Tian did not deny what Zhou Weiqing said. He looked at him and replied, “You are an intelligent person. Although I am very curious with regards to how you were able to have such impressive achievements at such a young age, I have no other choice but to kill you while you’re still in the cradle. That is because even if you submit to me, I am not confident of controlling you completely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though they were enemies on opposing ends, for Fen Tian to utter such words, it showed how much he actually acknowledged Zhou Weiqing’s strength and abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing shrugged his shoulders and sighed, “What a pity! We have different mindsets. What is this cradle that you mentioned? How do you know that I am still in the cradle? You only have two Heavenly Gods on your side, and we also have two Heavenly Gods on our side. Furthermore, the total number of our members is not less than yours. Did you assume that your crappy Destruction Celestial Territory itself is enough to make everyone surrender and submit to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFen Tian replied calmly, “Young man, don’t be too insolent. Your cultivation base might be decent, and indeed, it is also true that the Saint Energy is able to restrain my Destruction Celestial Territory, or else Long Shiya would have died earlier on. Unfortunately, your cultivation base is way too low. If you are not on the same level as me, what are you going to use to destroy my Destruction Celestial Territory?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing chuckled and said, “Facts speak louder than words. You better take a good look.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke, the smile on Zhou Weiqing’s face had vanished. Two dots of light shot out of his face - from his eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes had become bright and dazzling, like the stars. Dense Saint Energy aura had also immediately been released from within his body.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Saint Energy ripples were very pure; yellowish golden specks of starlight appeared on his body. At the same time, the center of Zhou Weiqing’s chest had also lit up. The specks of starlight circled as they rose, forcefully dispelling the darkness in the surroundings, before expanding outwards at an extremely rapid speed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this very moment, everyone present experienced some sort of an illusion - they seemed to have heard screams from the Destruction Celestial Territory itself, areas where the Saint Energy had passed through. The Destruction will within the Destruction Celestial Territory rapidly vanished, as though it was snow coming into contact with boiling water.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Come out!” shouted Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dense yellowish golden Nebula Saint Energy soared into the sky. Immediately after, a ray of clear golden light shone down from the sky. It was as though the dark sky had split open. A starry sky had appeared before everybody’s eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe starlight was very dense. As it hovered in the sky, in an instant, an enormous cluster of nebula light had filled up the cavity created by the Celestial Territory. All the different energy of the attributes had appeared once again. Even though it was limited to the area around the peak of the Heavenly Snow Mountain, it was sufficient for the powerhouses of all the different Great Saint Lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Celestial Territory.” Fen Tian’s facial expression finally changed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from his deepest secrets which could not be leaked, the reason why he did not attack at full force when he first arrived was partly due to the fact that he was not entirely sure of the power of the other Great Saint Lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe it the Heavenly Snow Mountain or the Heaven’s Expanse Palace, they had a stronger foundation than the Blood Red Hell. The sudden rise of the Blood Red Hell in recent years was due to their reliance on the Destruction Attribute. However, Fen Tian was unaware of the trump cards of the other two Great Saint Lands. Hence, he was more than willing to drain their energy and power via the Grand Tournament. It would be best if he could kill off both Shangguan Tianyang and Xue AoTian in the final round himself. Even if he only managed to kill one of them, it would still be much easier for him to carry out his plans.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, because of the appearance of the Peerless Sect, his plan had failed. Furthermore, it was not a wrong move on his part to use the Destruction Celestial Territory to restrain everyone present. With the Destruction Celestial Territory, the strength and power of the members of the Blood Red Hell would be enhanced. Additionally, the cultivation base of the members of the other Saint Lands would be significantly reduced. However, when Zhou Weiqing had activated his Astral Celestial Territory moments ago, it had thoroughly wrecked his plans.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a user of the Destruction Celestial Territory, Fen Tian received the most impact from Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Celestial Territory. Indeed, Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Celestial Territory was not as powerful as his Destruction Celestial Territory. In fact, it was a lot weaker. However, he had clearly realized something - the purity of the Saint Energy within the Astral Celestial Territory was of a much higher degree than the Destruction Attribute within his Destruction Celestial Territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy was purer than his Destruction Energy. Precisely because of that, even though his Destruction Celestial Territory was far more powerful than Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Celestial Territory, he was unable to destroy the latter’s Celestial Territory, unless he was able to kill Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, they were not the only two people on the Heavenly Snow Mountain. With the help of Zhou Weiqing’s Astral Celestial Territory, without a doubt, the combat powers of the members of both the Heavenly Snow Mountain and the Heaven’s Expanse Palace had significantly increased. On the other hand, the Blood Red Hell’s powers were being suppressed. How was he going to defeat Zhou Weiqing? Even if he was able to achieve victory in the end, he would\u0027ve had to pay a hefty price.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-293-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-294-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-293-3","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
