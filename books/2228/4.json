The late Leonardo Vetra lay on his back, stripped naked, his skin bluish-gray. His neck bones were jutting out where they had been broken, and his head was twisted completely backward, pointing the wrong way. His face was out of view, pressed against the floor. The man lay in a frozen puddle of his own urine, the hair around his shriveled genitals spidered with frost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFighting a wave of nausea, Langdon let his eyes fall to the victim\u0027s chest. Although Langdon had stared at the symmetrical wound a dozen times on the fax, the burn was infinitely more commanding in real life. The raised, broiled flesh was perfectly delineated... the symbol flawlessly formed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon wondered if the intense chill now raking through his body was the air-conditioning or his utter amazement with the significance of what he was now staring at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngels \u0026amp; Demons\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart pounded as he circled the body, reading the word upside down, reaffirming the genius of the symmetry. The symbol seemed even less conceivable now that he was staring at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Langdon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon did not hear. He was in another world... his world, his element, a world where history, myth, and fact collided, flooding his senses. The gears turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Langdon?\" Kohler\u0027s eyes probed expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon did not look up. His disposition now intensified, his focus total. \"How much do you already know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only what I had time to read on your website. The word Illuminati means \u0027the enlightened ones.\u0027 It is the name of some sort of ancient brotherhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded. \"Had you heard the name before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until I saw it branded on Mr. Vetra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you ran a web search for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the word returned hundreds of references, no doubt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thousands,\" Kohler said. \"Yours, however, contained references to Harvard, Oxford, a reputable publisher, as well as a list of related publications. As a scientist I have come to learn that information is only as valuable as its source. Your credentials seemed authentic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s eyes were still riveted on the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler said nothing more. He simply stared, apparently waiting for Langdon to shed some light on the scene before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon looked up, glancing around the frozen flat. \"Perhaps we should discuss this in a warmer place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This room is fine.\" Kohler seemed oblivious to the cold. \"We\u0027ll talk here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon frowned. The Illuminati history was by no means a simple one. I\u0027ll freeze to death trying to explain it. He gazed again at the brand, feeling a renewed sense of awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough accounts of the Illuminati emblem were legendary in modern symbology, no academic had ever actually seen it. Ancient documents described the symbol as an ambigram - ambi meaning \"both\" - signifying it was legible both ways. And although ambigrams were common in symbology - swastikas, yin yang, Jewish stars, simple crosses - the idea that a word could be crafted into an ambigram seemed utterly impossible. Modern symbologists had tried for years to forge the word \"Illuminati\" into a perfectly symmetrical style, but they had failed miserably. Most academics had now decided the symbol\u0027s existence was a myth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who are the Illuminati?\" Kohler demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Langdon thought, who indeed? He began his tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since the beginning of history,\" Langdon explained, \"a deep rift has existed between science and religion. Outspoken scientists like Copernicus - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were murdered,\" Kohler interjected. \"Murdered by the church for revealing scientific truths. Religion has always persecuted science.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But in the 1500s, a group of men in Rome fought back against the church. Some of Italy\u0027s most enlightened men - physicists, mathematicians, astronomers - began meeting secretly to share their concerns about the church\u0027s inaccurate teachings. They feared that the church\u0027s monopoly on \u0027truth\u0027 threatened academic enlightenment around the world. They founded the world\u0027s first scientific think tank, calling themselves \u0027the enlightened ones.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Illuminati.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Langdon said. \"Europe\u0027s most learned minds... dedicated to the quest for scientific truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, the Illuminati were hunted ruthlessly by the Catholic Church. Only through rites of extreme secrecy did the scientists remain safe. Word spread through the academic underground, and the Illuminati brotherhood grew to include academics from all over Europe. The scientists met regularly in Rome at an ultrasecret lair they called the Church of Illumination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler coughed and shifted in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many of the Illuminati,\" Langdon continued, \"wanted to combat the church\u0027s tyranny with acts of violence, but their most revered member persuaded them against it. He was a pacifist, as well as one of history\u0027s most famous scientists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was certain Kohler would recognize the name. Even nonscientists were familiar with the ill-fated astronomer who had been arrested and almost executed by the church for proclaiming that the sun, and not the earth, was the center of the solar system. Although his data were incontrovertible, the astronomer was severely punished for implying that God had placed mankind somewhere other than at the center of His universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name was Galileo Galilei,\" Langdon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler looked up. \"Galileo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Galileo was an Illuminatus. And he was also a devout Catholic. He tried to soften the church\u0027s position on science by proclaiming that science did not undermine the existence of God, but rather reinforced it. He wrote once that when he looked through his telescope at the spinning planets, he could hear God\u0027s voice in the music of the spheres. He held that science and religion were not enemies, but rather allies - two different languages telling the same story, a story of symmetry and balance... heaven and hell, night and day, hot and cold, God and Satan. Both science and religion rejoiced in God\u0027s symmetry... the endless contest of light and dark.\" Langdon paused, stamping his feet to stay warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler simply sat in his wheelchair and stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately,\" Langdon added, \"the unification of science and religion was not what the church wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" Kohler interrupted. \"The union would have nullified the church\u0027s claim as the sole vessel through which man could understand God. So the church tried Galileo as a heretic, found him guilty, and put him under permanent house arrest. I am quite aware of scientific history, Mr. Langdon. But this was all centuries ago. What does it have to do with Leonardo Vetra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe million dollar question. Langdon cut to the chase. \"Galileo\u0027s arrest threw the Illuminati into upheaval. Mistakes were made, and the church discovered the identities of four members, whom they captured and interrogated. But the four scientists revealed nothing... even under torture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Torture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded. \"They were branded alive. On the chest. With the symbol of a cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler\u0027s eyes widened, and he shot an uneasy glance at Vetra\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the scientists were brutally murdered, their dead bodies dropped in the streets of Rome as a warning to others thinking of joining the Illuminati. With the church closing in, the remaining Illuminati fled Italy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon paused to make his point. He looked directly into Kohler\u0027s dead eyes. \"The Illuminati went deep underground, where they began mixing with other refugee groups fleeing the Catholic purges - mystics, alchemists, occultists, Muslims, Jews. Over the years, the Illuminati began absorbing new members. A new Illuminati emerged. A darker Illuminati. A deeply anti-Christian Illuminati. They grew very powerful, employing mysterious rites, deadly secrecy, vowing someday to rise again and take revenge on the Catholic Church. Their power grew to the point where the church considered them the single most dangerous anti-Christian force on earth. The Vatican denounced the brotherhood as Shaitan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shaitan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Islamic. It means \u0027adversary\u0027... God\u0027s adversary. The church chose Islam for the name because it was a language they considered dirty.\" Langdon hesitated. \"Shaitan is the root of an English word...Satan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn uneasiness crossed Kohler\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s voice was grim. \"Mr. Kohler, I do not know how this marking appeared on this man\u0027s chest... or why... but you are looking at the long-lost symbol of the world\u0027s oldest and most powerful satanic cult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alley was narrow and deserted. The Hassassin strode quickly now, his black eyes filling with anticipation. As he approached his destination, Janus\u0027s parting words echoed in his mind. Phase two begins shortly. Get some rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hassassin smirked. He had been awake all night, but sleep was the last thing on his mind. Sleep was for the weak. He was a warrior like his ancestors before him, and his people never slept once a battle had begun. This battle had most definitely begun, and he had been given the honor of spilling first blood. Now he had two hours to celebrate his glory before going back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleep? There are far better ways to relax...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn appetite for hedonistic pleasure was something bred into him by his ancestors. His ascendants had indulged in hashish, but he preferred a different kind of gratification. He took pride in his body - a well-tuned, lethal machine, which, despite his heritage, he refused to pollute with narcotics. He had developed a more nourishing addiction than drugs... a far more healthy and satisfying reward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling a familiar anticipation swelling within him, the Hassassin moved faster down the alley. He arrived at the nondescript door and rang the bell. A view slit in the door opened, and two soft brown eyes studied him appraisingly. Then the door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome,\" the well-dressed woman said. She ushered him into an impeccably furnished sitting room where the lights were low. The air was laced with expensive perfume and musk. \"Whenever you are ready.\" She handed him a book of photographs. \"Ring me when you have made your choice.\" Then she disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hassassin smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he sat on the plush divan and positioned the photo album on his lap, he felt a carnal hunger stir. Although his people did not celebrate Christmas, he imagined that this is what it must feel like to be a Christian child, sitting before a stack of Christmas presents, about to discover the miracles inside. He opened the album and examined the photos. A lifetime of sexual fantasies stared back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarisa. An Italian goddess. Fiery. A young Sophia Loren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSachiko. A Japanese geisha. Lithe. No doubt skilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKanara. A stunning black vision. Muscular. Exotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe examined the entire album twice and made his choice. He pressed a button on the table beside him. A minute later the woman who had greeted him reappeared. He indicated his selection. She smiled. \"Follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter handling the financial arrangements, the woman made a hushed phone call. She waited a few minutes and then led him up a winding marble staircase to a luxurious hallway. \"It\u0027s the gold door on the end,\" she said. \"You have expensive taste.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should, he thought. I am a connoisseur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hassassin padded the length of the hallway like a panther anticipating a long overdue meal. When he reached the doorway he smiled to himself. It was already ajar... welcoming him in. He pushed, and the door swung noiselessly open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw his selection, he knew he had chosen well. She was exactly as he had requested... nude, lying on her back, her arms tied to the bedposts with thick velvet cords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed the room and ran a dark finger across her ivory abdomen. I killed last night, he thought. You are my reward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Satanic?\" Kohler wiped his mouth and shifted uncomfortably. \"This is the symbol of a satanic cult?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon paced the frozen room to keep warm. \"The Illuminati were satanic. But not in the modern sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon quickly explained how most people pictured satanic cults as devil-worshiping fiends, and yet Satanists historically were educated men who stood as adversaries to the church. Shaitan. The rumors of satanic black-magic animal sacrifices and the pentagram ritual were nothing but lies spread by the church as a smear campaign against their adversaries. Over time, opponents of the church, wanting to emulate the Illuminati, began believing the lies and acting them out. Thus, modern Satanism was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler grunted abruptly. \"This is all ancient history. I want to know how this symbol got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon took a deep breath. \"The symbol itself was created by an anonymous sixteenth-century Illuminati artist as a tribute to Galileo\u0027s love of symmetry - a kind of sacred Illuminati logo. The brotherhood kept the design secret, allegedly planning to reveal it only when they had amassed enough power to resurface and carry out their final goal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler looked unsettled. \"So this symbol means the Illuminati brotherhood is resurfacing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon frowned. \"That would be impossible. There is one chapter of Illuminati history that I have not yet explained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler\u0027s voice intensified. \"Enlighten me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon rubbed his palms together, mentally sorting through the hundreds of documents he\u0027d read or written on the Illuminati. \"The Illuminati were survivors,\" he explained. \"When they fled Rome, they traveled across Europe looking for a safe place to regroup. They were taken in by another secret society... a brotherhood of wealthy Bavarian stone craftsmen called the Freemasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler looked startled. \"The Masons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon nodded, not at all surprised that Kohler had heard of the group. The brotherhood of the Masons currently had over five million members worldwide, half of them residing in the United States, and over one million of them in Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly the Masons are not satanic,\" Kohler declared, sounding suddenly skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not. The Masons fell victim of their own benevolence. After harboring the fleeing scientists in the 1700s, the Masons unknowingly became a front for the Illuminati. The Illuminati grew within their ranks, gradually taking over positions of power within the lodges. They quietly reestablished their scientific brotherhood deep within the Masons - a kind of secret society within a secret society. Then the Illuminati used the worldwide connection of Masonic lodges to spread their influence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon drew a cold breath before racing on. \"Obliteration of Catholicism was the Illuminati\u0027s central covenant. The brotherhood held that the superstitious dogma spewed forth by the church was mankind\u0027s greatest enemy. They feared that if religion continued to promote pious myth as absolute fact, scientific progress would halt, and mankind would be doomed to an ignorant future of senseless holy wars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much like we see today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon frowned. Kohler was right. Holy wars were still making headlines. My God is better than your God. It seemed there was always close correlation between true believers and high body counts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" Kohler said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon gathered his thoughts and continued. \"The Illuminati grew more powerful in Europe and set their sights on America, a fledgling government many of whose leaders were Masons - George Washington, Ben Franklin - honest, God-fearing men who were unaware of the Illuminati stronghold on the Masons. The Illuminati took advantage of the infiltration and helped found banks, universities, and industry to finance their ultimate quest.\" Langdon paused. \"The creation of a single unified world state - a kind of secular New World Order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A New World Order,\" Langdon repeated, \"based on scientific enlightenment. They called it their Luciferian Doctrine. The church claimed Lucifer was a reference to the devil, but the brotherhood insisted Lucifer was intended in its literal Latin meaning - bringer of light. Or Illuminator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler sighed, and his voice grew suddenly solemn. \"Mr. Langdon, please sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon sat tentatively on a frost-covered chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler moved his wheelchair closer. \"I am not sure I understand everything you have just told me, but I do understand this. Leonardo Vetra was one of CERN\u0027s greatest assets. He was also a friend. I need you to help me locate the Illuminati.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon didn\u0027t know how to respond. \"Locate the Illuminati?\" He\u0027s kidding, right? \"I\u0027m afraid, sir, that will be utterly impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler\u0027s brow creased. \"What do you mean? You won\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Kohler.\" Langdon leaned toward his host, uncertain how to make him understand what he was about to say. \"I did not finish my story. Despite appearances, it is extremely unlikely that this brand was put here by the Illuminati. There has been no evidence of their existence for over half a century, and most scholars agree the Illuminati have been defunct for many years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words hit silence. Kohler stared through the fog with a look somewhere between stupefaction and anger. \"How the hell can you tell me this group is extinct when their name is seared into this man!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had been asking himself that question all morning. The appearance of the Illuminati ambigram was astonishing. Symbologists worldwide would be dazzled. And yet, the academic in Langdon understood that the brand\u0027s reemergence proved absolutely nothing about the Illuminati.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Symbols,\" Langdon said, \"in no way confirm the presence of their original creators.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that supposed to mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means that when organized philosophies like the Illuminati go out of existence, their symbols remain... available for adoption by other groups. It\u0027s called transference. It\u0027s very common in symbology. The Nazis took the swastika from the Hindus, the Christians adopted the cruciform from the Egyptians, the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This morning,\" Kohler challenged, \"when I typed the word \u0027Illuminati\u0027 into the computer, it returned thousands of current references. Apparently a lot of people think this group is still active.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Conspiracy buffs,\" Langdon replied. He had always been annoyed by the plethora of conspiracy theories that circulated in modern pop culture. The media craved apocalyptic headlines, and self-proclaimed \"cult specialists\" were still cashing in on millennium hype with fabricated stories that the Illuminati were alive and well and organizing their New World Order. Recently the New York Times had reported the eerie Masonic ties of countless famous men - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Duke of Kent, Peter Sellers, Irving Berlin, Prince Philip, Louis Armstrong, as well as a pantheon of well-known modern-day industrialists and banking magnates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler pointed angrily at Vetra\u0027s body. \"Considering the evidence, I would say perhaps the conspiracy buffs are correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize how it appears,\" Langdon said as diplomatically as he could. \"And yet a far more plausible explanation is that some other organization has taken control of the Illuminati brand and is using it for their own purposes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What purposes? What does this murder prove?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question, Langdon thought. He also was having trouble imagining where anyone could have turned up the Illuminati brand after 400 years. \"All I can tell you is that even if the Illuminati were still active today, which I am virtually positive they are not, they would never be involved in Leonardo Vetra\u0027s death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The Illuminati may have believed in the abolition of Christianity, but they wielded their power through political and financial means, not through terrorists acts. Furthermore, the Illuminati had a strict code of morality regarding who they saw as enemies. They held men of science in the highest regard. There is no way they would have murdered a fellow scientist like Leonardo Vetra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKohler\u0027s eyes turned to ice. \"Perhaps I failed to mention that Leonardo Vetra was anything but an ordinary scientist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon exhaled patiently. \"Mr. Kohler, I\u0027m sure Leonardo Vetra was brilliant in many ways, but the fact remains - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, Kohler spun in his wheelchair and accelerated out of the living room, leaving a wake of swirling mist as he disappeared down a hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the love of God, Langdon groaned. He followed. Kohler was waiting for him in a small alcove at the end of the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Leonardo\u0027s study,\" Kohler said, motioning to the sliding door. \"Perhaps when you see it you\u0027ll understand things differently.\" With an awkward grunt, Kohler heaved, and the door slid open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon peered into the study and immediately felt his skin crawl.
