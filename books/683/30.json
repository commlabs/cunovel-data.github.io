\u0026nbsp;Will you kindly tell me who lives here?’ \u0026nbsp;The answer came with some hesitation:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Sister Ruth.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘And who is Sister Ruth?’ \u0026nbsp;The question came instinctively and without premeditation. \u0026nbsp;The maid, embarrassed, held hard to the half-open door and shifted from foot to foot uneasily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I don’t know!’ she said at last. \u0026nbsp;‘Only Sister Ruth, I suppose!’ \u0026nbsp;It was manifest that the matter had never afforded her anything in the nature of a problem. \u0026nbsp;There was an embarrassing silence. \u0026nbsp;Stephen did not wish to seem, or even to be, prying; but her curiosity was aroused. \u0026nbsp;What manner of woman was this who lived so manifestly alone, and who had but a Christian name! \u0026nbsp;Stephen, however, had all her life been accustomed to dominance, and at Normanstand and Norwood had made many acquaintances amongst her poorer neighbours. \u0026nbsp;She was just about to ask if she might see Sister Ruth, when behind the maid in the dark of the low passage-way appeared the tall, slim figure of a silver woman. \u0026nbsp;Truly a silver woman! \u0026nbsp;The first flash of Stephen’s thought was correct. \u0026nbsp;White-haired, white-faced, white-capped, white-kerchiefed; in a plain-cut dress of light-grey silk, without adornment of any kind. \u0026nbsp;The whole ensemble was as a piece of old silver. \u0026nbsp;The lines of her face were very dignified, very sweet, very beautiful. \u0026nbsp;Stephen felt at once that she was in the presence of no common woman. \u0026nbsp;She looked an admiration which all her Quaker garments could not forbid the other to feel. \u0026nbsp;She was not the first to speak; in such a noble presence the dignity of Stephen’s youth imperatively demanded silence, if not humility. \u0026nbsp;So she waited. \u0026nbsp;The Silver Lady, for so Stephen ever after held her in her mind, said quietly, but with manifest welcome:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Didst thou wish to see me? \u0026nbsp;Wilt thou come in?’ \u0026nbsp;Stephen answered frankly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I should like to come in; if you will not think me rude. \u0026nbsp;The fact is, I was struck when riding by with the beautiful situation of the mill. \u0026nbsp;I thought it was only an old mill till I saw the garden hedges; and I came round to ask if I might go in.’ \u0026nbsp;The \u0026nbsp;Silver Lady came forward at a pace that by itself expressed warmth as she said heartily:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Indeed thou mayest. \u0026nbsp;Stay! it is tea-time. \u0026nbsp;Let us put thy horse in one of the sheds; there is no man here at present to do it. \u0026nbsp;Then thou shalt come with me and see my beautiful view!’ \u0026nbsp;She was about to take the horse herself, but Stephen forestalled her with a quick: ‘No, no! pray let me. \u0026nbsp;I am quite accustomed.’ \u0026nbsp;She led the horse to a shed, and having looped the rein over a hook, patted him and ran back. \u0026nbsp;The Silver Lady gave her a hand, and they entered the dark passage together.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stephen was thinking if she ought to begin by telling her name. \u0026nbsp;But the Haroun al Raschid feeling for adventure incognito is an innate principle of the sons of men. \u0026nbsp;It was seldom indeed that her life had afforded her such an opportunity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Silver Lady on her own part also wished for silence, as she looked for the effect on her companion when the glory of the view should break upon her. \u0026nbsp;When they had climbed the winding stone stair, which led up some twenty feet, there was a low wide landing with the remains of the main shaft of the mill machinery running through it. \u0026nbsp;From one side rose a stone stair curving with the outer wall of the mill tower and guarded by a heavy iron rail. \u0026nbsp;A dozen steps there were, and then a landing a couple of yards square; then a deep doorway cut in the thickness of the wall, round which the winding stair continued.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Silver Lady, who had led the way, threw open the door, and motioned to her guest to enter. \u0026nbsp;Stephen stood for a few moments, surprised as well as delighted, for the room before her as not like anything which she had ever seen or thought of.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a section of almost the whole tower, and was of considerable size, for the machinery and even the inner shaft had been removed. \u0026nbsp;East and south and west the wall had been partially cut away so that great wide windows nearly the full height of the room showed the magnificent panorama. \u0026nbsp;In the depths of the ample windows were little cloistered nooks where one might with a feeling of super-solitude be away from and above the world.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The room was beautifully furnished and everywhere were flowers, with leaves and sprays and branches where possible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even from where she stood in the doorway Stephen had a bird’s-eye view of the whole countryside; not only of the coast, with which she was already familiar, and on which her windows at the Castle looked, but to the south and west, which the hill rising steep behind the castle and to southward shut out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Silver Lady could not but notice her guest’s genuine admiration.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Thou likest my room and my view. \u0026nbsp;There is no use asking thee, I see thou dost!’ \u0026nbsp;Stephen answered with a little gasp.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I think it is the quaintest and most beautiful place I have ever seen!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘I am so glad thou likest it. \u0026nbsp;I have lived here for nearly forty years; and they have been years of unutterable peace and earthly happiness! \u0026nbsp;And now, thou wilt have some tea!’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stephen left the mill that afternoon with a warmth of heart that she had been a stranger to for many a day. \u0026nbsp;The two women had accepted each other simply. \u0026nbsp;‘I am called Ruth,’ said the Silver Lady. \u0026nbsp;‘And I am Stephen,’ said the Countess de Lannoy in reply. \u0026nbsp;And that was all; neither had any clue to the other’s identity. \u0026nbsp;Stephen felt that some story lay behind that calm, sweet personality; much sorrow goes to the making of fearless quietude. \u0026nbsp;The Quaker lady moved so little out of her own environment that she did not even suspect the identity of her visitor. \u0026nbsp;All that she knew of change was a notice from the solicitor to the estate that, as the headship had lapsed into another branch of the possessing family, she must be prepared, if necessary, to vacate her tenancy, which was one ‘at will.’\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was not long before Stephen availed herself of the permission to come again. \u0026nbsp;This time she made up her mind to tell who she was, lest the concealment of her identity might lead to awkwardness. \u0026nbsp;At that meeting friendship became union.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The natures of the two women expanded to each other; and after a very few meetings there was established between them a rare confidence. \u0026nbsp;Even the personal austerity of Quakerdom, or the state and estate of the peeress, could not come between. \u0026nbsp;Their friendship seemed to be for the life of one. \u0026nbsp;To the other it would be a memory.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Silver Lady never left the chosen routine of her own life. \u0026nbsp;Whatever was the reason of her giving up the world, she kept it to herself; and Stephen respected her reticence as much as she did her confidence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It had become a habit, early in their friendship, for Stephen to ride or walk over to the windmill in the dusk of the evening when she felt especially lonely. \u0026nbsp;On one such occasion she pushed open the outer door, which was never shut, and took her way up the stone stair. \u0026nbsp;She knew she would find her friend seated in the window with hands folded on lap, looking out into the silent dusk with that absorbed understanding of things which is holier than reverence, and spiritually more active than conscious prayer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She tapped the door lightly, and stepped into the room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With a glad exclamation, which coming through her habitual sedateness showed how much she loved the young girl, Sister Ruth started to her feet. \u0026nbsp;There was something of such truth in the note she had sounded, that the lonely girl’s heart went out to her in abandoned fulness. \u0026nbsp;She held out her arms; and, as she came close to the other, fell rather than sank at her feet. \u0026nbsp;The elder woman recognised, and knew. \u0026nbsp;She made no effort to restrain her; but sinking back into her own seat laid the girl’s head in her lap, and held her hands close against her breast.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Tell me,’ she whispered. \u0026nbsp;‘Won’t you tell me, dear child, what troubles you? \u0026nbsp;Tell me!

\u0026nbsp;Don’t be frightened! \u0026nbsp;It is not murder that I tell you of. \u0026nbsp;Perhaps if it were, the thought would be easier to bear! \u0026nbsp;He would have been hurt less if it had been only his body that I slew. \u0026nbsp;Well I know now that his life would have been freely given if I wished it; if it had been for my good. \u0026nbsp;But it was the best of him that I killed; his soul. \u0026nbsp;His noble, loving, trusting, unselfish soul. \u0026nbsp;The bravest and truest soul that ever had place in a man’s breast! . . . ’ \u0026nbsp;Her speaking ended with a sob; her body sank lower.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sister Ruth’s heart began to beat more freely. \u0026nbsp;She understood now, and all the womanhood, all the wifehood, motherhood suppressed for a lifetime, awoke to the woman’s need. \u0026nbsp;Gently she stroked the beautiful head that lay so meekly on her lap; and as the girl sobbed with but little appearance of abatement, she said to her softly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Tell me, dear child. \u0026nbsp;Tell me all about it!

\u0026nbsp;It will do thee good!’ \u0026nbsp;She was startled once again as the other seemed for an instant to grow rigid in her arms, and raising her hands cried out in a burst of almost hysterical passion:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n ‘Cry!
