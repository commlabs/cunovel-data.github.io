Ever since her mom\u0027s boyfriend kicked them out, Amber, her mom, and her totally loyal dog, Bobby Big Boy (aka Thrice B) have been camped out in the back of Hello Yellow (the school bus her mom drives). Still, Amber, the self-proclaimed princess of hope and girl of unyielding optimism, refuses to sweat the bad stuff. But when a fatal tragedy threatens Amber\u0027s optimismâ€”and her way of life, can Amber continue to be the rock star of hope? With an oddball cast of characters, and a heartwarming, inspiring story, this novel unveils a beautifully beaten-up world of laughs, loyalty, and hard-earned hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sorta-like-a-rock-star.jpg","author":"Matthew Quick","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/sorta-like-a-rock-star.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:34 AM"}
