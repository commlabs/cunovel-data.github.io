This was a requirement for surgery, but it also granted Su a rare chance to rest and relax. In this type of state, there was no way Su could control his body, so could it be that there was another irregular life form existing in Su’s body?!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen didn’t doubt for a second that if she aimed that blade towards Su’s heart, her right hand most likely couldn’t be saved.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen’s skills in dealing with the injuries were fast and perfect. After she completely treated the injuries, she said to Persephone, “Bring him to the underground first floor number one ward. The culture cylinder there will be vacant.

The darkness that surrounded him was especially warm, quiet, and safe. It made every cell in his body relax, single-heartedly busying about inside his body to carry out rest and advancement.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Su opened his eyes, he actually felt extremely reluctant to part from the peacefulness of sleep. He really wanted to sleep a bit longer. Unfortunately, in this era, survival was always the number one priority in everyone’s mind, and this was true even after one obtained seven levels of ability. This was why he forcefully rejected the warmth and temptations of darkness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThrough the culture cylinder’s transparent lid, the first thing that greeted Su’s field of view were familiar black framed glasses, and behind the lens was a pair of enticing eyes.

The skin covering Su’s entire body wriggled about, sending all of the sensors bouncing off, and then he jumped out from the culture cylinder. Towards things like the culture cylinder, Su felt an instinctive dislike and hatred. If he didn’t immediately see Persephone, his body might have instinctively urged him to directly smash this culture cylinder apart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone handed over a set of Black Dragonrider uniforms as well as a card to Su. “This is your uniform, and this is one million.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu who had just emerged from the culture cylinder felt that every part of his body was full of life. Apart from a bit of hunger, there wasn’t anything else that was off. He didn’t accept the clothes and instead directly reached out his hands, grabbing towards Persephone. From the burning flames in his eyes, he most likely wanted to settle things with her right here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone revealed a faint smile. Her elbow pressed down on the hand Su reached over, forcing his hand to move forward. Then, she easily placed the clothes and card into the hand. With a smile, she said, “Right now is no good! I haven’t even showered yet! Also, don’t forget that before you can beat me, you don’t have the power of choice.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu felt as if he was being crushed by an enormous boulder weighing several dozen tons, unable to budge an inch.

Then, gently going on the tip of her toes, she lightly touched her lips on top of his before saying with a smile, “When I am interested in playing with you, I will naturally come to find you!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHaha!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone turned around and left, not giving Su any room for retaliation. All of her previous gentleness was washed away like water. Her ostentatious and unbridled laughter rang through the corridor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu stared at her figure that was gently swaying, her long and slender legs, as well as her bottom that was tightly wrapped within her short skirt. Together with that laughter that showed no respect for him as a man, it made him feel a raging inferno that could not be put out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA young and pretty nurse walked into the ward. She gave Persephone who was leaving into the distance an ambiguous look, and then she looked at Su. When her eyes landed on Su’s naked body, she immediately began to burn with passion, as well as met Su’s gaze without any fear of misgivings. She did not want to nor did she dare fight over Persephone’s man, but she definitely wouldn’t refuse having a little something with Su, let alone the fact that Su was also looking at her so fervently, so this looked like quite a good opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“How long have I been asleep?” Su asked while putting on his clothes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“46 hours.” Those that were used to working with Helen were all used to using precise numbers.

He unexpectedly slept that long. It seemed like that peaceful and long sleep was because Persephone was guarding his side, giving him a sense of peace.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe thought back to how when they first met, everything was like a type of business deal. Meanwhile, Su believed that back then, he was just one of many candidates Persephone chose. Now, Su already proved that he had the potential to complete that deal, and had become her only choice. Only the difference from what he expected at first was that the nature of this deal had already somewhat changed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu didn’t know that while recalling all of this, he was smiling.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA moment later, Su already put on his clothes and reattached his eyepatch.

The amount of energy he had left was practically no different from his state after fighting Sarton.

Three off-road vehicles were already waiting as planned. Painted on top of the vehicles were enormous red patterned spiders. This was the marking of the Spider Empress, which allowed these vehicles to move completely unobstructed anywhere within Dragon City. Su ascended the central off-road vehicle, and after sitting down, he closed his eyes to get some rest. He really was just too tired.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Su stood in front of the dark red castle’s imposing entrance, it was already nightfall.
