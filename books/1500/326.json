She felt extremely uncomfortable under this soft and feminine style of clothing. From her perspective, tough, cold, dark, rough, and sinister were her style, just like that armor that was full of spikes. Of course, Death Prison wasn’t too bad looking either.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, when she looked around, this entire parlor room only had this single set of clothes. In addition, after this transformation, all of her abilities disappeared, so it was simply impossible for her to wear the armor she was used to right now, nor was it likely she would be able to wear it again for the foreseeable future.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe was still not used to the feeling of her current body.

Also, Mr. Avidar, why did I suddenly transform? Even if it was a transformation, shouldn’t it be an incomplete transformation to strengthen my currently existing strength? How did it end up being a complete transformation?!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Young miss really does have a lot of questions.” Avidar continued to maintain his refined smile, and in an unhurried voice, he said, “The empress gave a portion of her own life force to you, and only then could young miss undergo transformation. Meanwhile, the complete transformation was a decision someone else made in young miss’ place, not something me or the empress decided on. Also, the empress has decided that after this transformation, it is already time for young miss to leave Dark Red Castle. Meanwhile, the one that made the decision for young miss already agreed to shoulder the responsibility for protecting and watching over your growth.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“And who is this person who wants to be my guardian?” Madeline released a cold laugh. Perhaps due to being so used to slaughter, that unmatched little face was already covered with killing intent.

The killing intent that was seeping out was restrained bit by bit. Those that were familiar with her knew that the more calm Madeline became, the more terrifying she was. Even though she lost all her abilities, Madeline still wouldn’t feel the slightest bit of fear towards any powerful individual in this world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSeveral minutes later, the elder brought Madeline in front of a guest room. After telling Madeline that the one she wanted to see was inside, the elder took a step back.

Only, when he saw Madeline in her current attire, Su’s heart was also slightly moved. His head even felt a bit dizzy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEver since she was small, Madelin was pretty to an unimaginable degree.

He smiled. Right when he was about to call out to her, Madeline suddenly jumped out, and like a swallow returning to her nest, she suddenly threw herself into Su’s embrace!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis firm force made even Su take a few steps back, falling down onto the guest room’s couch.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen he looked at Madeline who had rolled up into a ball, unwilling to raise her head no matter what he said, Su suddenly felt a myriad of emotions welling up within him.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDuring those eight years when they were mutually dependent on each other for survival, just how many days and nights were there when his body was her protective screen just like this, protecting her from cold winds, rain, snow, radiation, as well as enemies of all shapes and sizes. The Madeline back then was as docile as a kitten, only silently following him. If Su brought back food, regardless of what it was, she would always try her best to eat it. If Su offered her his arm, then she would fall asleep inside of his warm embrace. At Su’s side, even if it was the chaotic wilderness, she didn’t have to think about anything. She just had to calmly wait.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePerhaps due to being fortunate, every time she waited, there would always be a result.
