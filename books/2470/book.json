These all-new, interlinked stories offer a full measure of McCammon\u0027s trademark narrative excitement, and comprise a fascinating composite portrait of a unique fictional creation. The volume opens with a pair of brief glimpses into Michael\u0027s early life in Russia and his initial recruitment into the British Secret Service. It ends with a haunting vision of the werewolf at twilight. In between, McCammon gives us three stellar novellas depicting different phases of Michael\u0027s long, brutal war against Nazi Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-hunter-from-the-woods-michael-gallatin-2.jpg","author":"Robert McCammon","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunter-from-the-woods-michael-gallatin-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:42:47 PM"}
