{"id":8433,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XX. THE AMATEUR DETECTIVES.","content":"\u0026nbsp;WHEN it was found that Robert was not seriously hurt there was a general feeling of relief among his circus friends, for the boy rider was a great favorite. Though he was somewhat reserved he was always polite, affable, and ready to be of assistance to any of his associates. He was sometimes called \"the little gentleman,\" and was generally supposed to have sprung from a good family, though even to himself his birth was a secret. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Among those who inquired anxiously for him were Charlie Davis and the Norwegian giant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He has sprained his ankle slightly,\" said Dr. Grey. \"It will require a week or two of perfect rest, perhaps more. Indeed it will not do for him to ride again this season.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you sure of that, doctor?\" asked the manager.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 163\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am positive that it would be most imprudent.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I asked because it cuts off the boy from earning money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There need be no trouble on that score. He can stay at my house as long as he likes, and it will cost him nothing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are very kind, Dr. Grey. However, the boy is not without funds. I have two hundred dollars of his in my possession, and before I leave town I will hand it to him or you, as this accident will part us for the remainder of the season.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Give it to him, then. I am glad he has been so provident.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dr. Grey and Sidney obtained a carriage, and Robert was taken home to the doctor\u0027s comfortable and even luxurious dwelling, for, besides having had an extensive practice for years, he had married a lady with a fortune. Leaving Robert there in good hands, we return to the circus.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As soon as the entertainment was over, Charlie and Anak, remembering their engagement, bent their steps towards the house of Mr. Tarbox. They were detained, however, for fifteen minutes or more before being able to depart, and this gave Carden an opportunity to get at work.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 164\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you seen Carden this evening, Charlie?\" asked Anak.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; he was at the circus.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wonder whether it was he that threw the rock?\" said Anak, suddenly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder. I didn\u0027t think of it before.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He could have no other object in coming to the show. He had seen it plenty of times. Besides, his money must have been low.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps he got in for nothing,\" suggested Charlie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Go and ask.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Charlie, upon inquiring at the ticket-office, found that Carden had tried to obtain a pass on the score of his former connection with the circus, but without success, as the manager had left orders that he was not to be admitted, except on the same footing with others.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He grumbled some, but finally bought a ticket,\" added the ticket-seller. \"I wondered at it, for there was nothing new to him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He must have been the one who fired the rock at poor Robert\u0027s horse—the villain!\" said Anak, gravely. \"We know he had a spite against the boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 165\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d like to fire a rock at him!\" said Charlie, impetuously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He may get into trouble yet,\" said Anak. \"Let us go along.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Shall we go to the house and speak to Mr. Tarbox?\" asked Charlie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, for he will know where to look for him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wonder what he will say when he sees you? Bet he\u0027ll be scared.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We\u0027ll soon let him understand that we came for his good.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Tarbox was just about retiring, or rather he was making the usual preparations—bringing in kindling wood from the shed, raking out the fire, etc.—when a knock was heard at the outer door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the Tarbox household such a thing as a visitor at half-past 10 o\u0027clock in the evening was absolutely unknown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who can it be, Nathan?\" asked Mrs. Tarbox, in a flutter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How do I know?\" returned her husband in the usual polite tone in which he was accustomed to address his wife.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Suppose it should be burglars?\" suggested Mrs. Tarbox, nervously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 166\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They\u0027d be very likely to knock at the door, wouldn\u0027t they, you goose!\" said her husband. \"That\u0027s exactly what they always do, isn\u0027t it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The knock was repeated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Go to the door, Mrs. Tarbox.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh mercy, Nathan, I couldn\u0027t. I might be killed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Give me the lamp, then, you fool!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Tarbox readily gave her husband the lamp, and he strode to the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he opened it, and his inquiring glance fell on the towering form of Anak, it must be admitted that Mr. Tarbox himself felt nervous. He made a movement to close the door, but Anak thrust in his huge foot, and this made the effort impossible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you want?\" demanded Tarbox, his calmness not quite undisturbed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We come on important business,\" said Anak, in his deep voice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you might have come at a better time,\" said Tarbox, his fears dissipated and his ill-temper returning. \"It is time all honest persons were abed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So it is, Mr. Tarbox,\" answered Anak, \"but I167 am afraid there is one dishonest person that is wide awake.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you mean?\" demanded Tarbox, with a vague suspicion that the remark might be made at his expense.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is there anything of value concealed under the barn yonder?\" asked Anak, pointing to the one already referred to in a former chapter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why do you ask?\" queried the farmer, turning pale, and eying the questioner with suspicion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because a man who has been discharged from our show—a canvas man, named Carden—was seen by Charlie here prowling about the barn this afternoon, and trying to look under it through a crack.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now Tarbox turned pale in earnest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It must have been when I was there,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very likely; were you under it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ye-es,\" answered the farmer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then he was watching you. You know best whether he was likely to see anything that could be of service to him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is he there now?\" asked Tarbox, agitated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should not be at all surprised.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 168\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He may be robbing me at this moment,\" said Tarbox, wildly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then there is something hidden under the barn?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ye-es. What shall I do? Is he armed? Is he a strong man?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No matter whether he is or not. I\u0027m middling strong myself,\" said the giant, with a laugh. \"Get your hat, and I\u0027ll go with you, and we\u0027ll see if we can\u0027t defeat him and his plans.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll go, too,\" added Charlie, in an important tone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You alone are able to frighten him, Charlie,\" said Anak, aroused.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tarbox got his hat and led the way hurriedly towards the barn. Before they reached there a sudden suspicion entered his mind and he stopped short.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How do I know but this is a trick?\" he said, nervously. \"You may be intending to rob me yourself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Make your mind easy, Mr. Tarbox!\" said Anak. \"We don\u0027t do business in that way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are my enemy,\" said Tarbox.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not at all. You have done me no harm. You169 were meaning to arrest me, to be sure, but you didn\u0027t, and I have no hard feelings against you. I will do you a good turn if you will let me, especially as this Carden is a bad fellow. He tried to kill Robert Rudd, to-night.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What, the boy rider?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. Robert caught him stealing, or trying to steal, from his locker, and this led to his discharge. He threw a rock at the boy\u0027s horse, and he was thrown.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At another time Tarbox might possibly have felt rejoiced that the boy against whom he himself felt a spite had met with an accident, but now he felt too anxious about his own property to concern himself about other matters.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By this time they had reached the solitary barn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Charlie got down on his knees and peered through the same crevice which Carden had used in the afternoon.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027s there!\" he exclaimed in excitement, \"and he\u0027s got a lighted candle.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is he doing?\" asked Tarbox in agitation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027s digging.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 170\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He will steal my money!\" ejaculated Tarbox in dismay. \"There\u0027s between three and four hundred dollars hidden there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Rather a queer savings bank, Mr. Tarbox!\" said Anak, dryly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83308.html","bookId":277,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:38 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:32:38 AM"}
