His fingers work to zip up my suit. “I’m fine,” he says. “Really. I just want to know you’re okay. If you’re all right here, then I am too. Everything is fine.” His breath catches. “Okay? Everything is going to be fine.” The shaky smile on his face is making my pulse forget it has a job to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” It takes me a moment to find my voice. “Okay sure but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens and Sonya and Sara are halfway into the room before they freeze, eyes fixed on our bodies wound together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh!” Sara says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um.” Sonya looks down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam swears under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can come back later—,” the twins say together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’re headed out the door when I stop them. I won’t kick them out of their own room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask them not to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ask me if I’m sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take one look at Adam’s face and know I’m going to regret forfeiting even a minute of our time together, but I also know I can’t take advantage of my roommates. This is their personal space, and it’s almost time for lights-out. They can’t be wandering the corridors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam isn’t looking at me anymore, but he’s not letting go, either. I lean forward and leave a light kiss on his heart. He finally meets my eyes. Offers me a small, pained smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you,” I tell him, quietly, so only he can hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhales a short, uneven breath. Whispers, “You have no idea,” and pulls himself away. Pivots on one heel. Heads out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is beating in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls are staring at me. Concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya is about to speak, but then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea switch\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea click\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea flicker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand the lights are out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dreams are back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d left me for a while, shortly after I’d been freshly imprisoned on base with Warner. I thought I’d lost the bird, the white bird, the bird with streaks of gold like a crown atop its head. It used to meet me in my dreams, flying strong and smooth, sailing over the world like it knew better, like it had secrets we’d never suspect, like it was leading me somewhere safe. It was my one piece of hope in the bitter darkness of the asylum, just until I met its twin tattooed on Adam’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like it flew right out of my dreams only to rest atop his heart. I thought it was a signal, a message telling me I was finally safe. That I’d flown away and finally found peace, sanctuary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t expect to see the bird again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now it’s back and looks exactly the same. It’s the same white bird in the same blue sky with the same yellow crown. Only this time, it’s frozen. Flapping its wings in place like it’s been caught in an invisible cage, like it’s destined to repeat the same motion forever. The bird seems to be flying: it’s in the air; its wings work. It looks as if it’s free to soar through the skies. But it’s stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to fly upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve had the same dream every night for the past week, and all 7 mornings I’ve woken up shaking, shuddering into the earthy, icy air, struggling to steady the bleating in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStruggling to understand what this means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawl out of bed and slip into the same suit I wear every day; the only article of clothing I own anymore. It’s the richest shade of purple, so plum it’s almost black. It has a slight sheen, a bit of a shimmer in the light. It’s one piece from neck to wrists to ankles and it’s skintight without being tight at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move like a gymnast in this outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have springy leather ankle boots that mold to the shape of my feet and render me soundless as I pad across the floor. I have black leather gloves that prevent me from touching something I’m not supposed to. Sonya and Sara lent me one of their hair ties and for the first time in years I’ve been able to pull my hair out of my face. I wear it in a high ponytail and I’ve learned to zip myself up without help from anyone. This suit makes me feel extraordinary. It makes me feel invincible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a gift from Castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had it custom-made for me before I arrived at Omega Point. He thought I might like to finally have an outfit that would protect me from myself and others while simultaneously offering me the option of hurting others. If I wanted to. Or needed to. The suit is made of some kind of special material that’s supposed to keep me cool in the heat and keep me warm in the cold. So far it’s been perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far so far so far\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head to breakfast by myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya and Sara are always gone by the time I’m awake. Their work in the medical wing is never-ending—not only are they able to heal the wounded but they also spend their days trying to create antidotes and ointments. The one time we ever had a conversation, Sonya explained to me how some Energies can be depleted if we exert ourselves too much—how we can exhaust our bodies enough that they’ll just break down. The girls say that they want to be able to create medicines to use in the case of multiple injuries they can’t heal all at once. They are, after all, only 2 people. And war seems imminent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeads still spin in my direction when I walk into the dining hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am a spectacle, an anomaly even among the anomalies. I should be used to it by now, after all these years. I should be tougher, jaded, indifferent to the opinions of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be a lot of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my eyes and keep my hands to my sides and pretend I’m unable to make eye contact with anything but that spot, that little mark on the wall 50 feet from where I’m standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pretend I’m just a number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo emotions on my face. Lips perfectly still. Back straight, hands unclenched. I am a robot, a ghost slipping through the crowds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6 steps forward. 15 tables to pass. 42 43 44 seconds and counting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am scared\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am scared\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am scared\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFood is served at only 3 times throughout the day: breakfast from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m., lunch from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m., and dinner from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. Dinner is an hour longer because it’s at the end of the day; it’s like our reward for working hard. But mealtimes aren’t a fancy, luxurious event—the experience is very different from dining with Warner. Here we just stand in a long line, pick up our prefilled bowls, and head toward the eating area—which is nothing more than a series of rectangular tables arranged in parallel lines across the room. Nothing superfluous so nothing is wasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spot Adam standing in line and head in his direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e68 69 70 seconds and counting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, gorgeous.” Something lumpy hits me in the back. Falls to the floor. I turn around, my face flexing the 43 muscles required to frown before I see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenji.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig, easy smile. Eyes the color of onyx. Hair even darker, sharper, stick-straight and slipping into his eyes. His jaw is twitching and his lips are twitching and the impressive lines of his cheekbones are appled up into a smile struggling to stay suppressed. He’s looking at me like I’ve been walking around with toilet paper in my hair and I can’t help but wonder why I haven’t spent time with him since we got here. He did, on a purely technical level, save my life. And Adam’s life. James’, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenji bends down to pick up what looks like a wadded ball of socks. He weighs them in his hand like he’s considering throwing them at me again. “Where are you going?” he says. “I thought you were supposed to meet me here? Castle said—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you bring a pair of socks in here?” I cut him off. “People are trying to eat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe freezes for only a split second before he rolls his eyes. Pulls up beside me. Tugs on my ponytail. “I was running late to meet you, your highness. I didn’t have time to put my socks on.” He gestures to the socks in his hand and the boots on his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s so gross.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, you have a really strange way of telling me you’re attracted to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, try to bite back my amusement. Kenji is a walking paradox of Unflinchingly Serious Person and 12-Year-Old Boy Going Through Puberty all rolled into one. But I’d forgotten how much easier it is to breathe around him; it seems natural to laugh when he’s near. So I keep walking and I’m careful not to say a word, but a smile is still tugging at my lips as I grab a tray and head into the heart of the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenji is half a step behind me. “So. We’re working together today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, what—you just walk right past me? Don’t even say hello?” He clutches the socks to his chest. “I’m crushed. I saved us a table and everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at him. Keep walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe catches up. “I’m serious. Do you have any idea how awkward it is to wave at someone and have them ignore you? And then you’re just looking around like a jackass, trying to be all, ‘No, really, I swear, I know that girl’ and no one believes y—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you kidding?” I stop in the middle of the kitchen. Spin around. My face is pulled together in disbelief. “You’ve spoken to me maybe once in the two weeks I’ve been here. I hardly even notice you anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, hold up,” he says, turning to block my path. “We both know there’s no way you haven’t noticed all of this”—he gestures to himself—“so if you’re trying to play games with me, I should let you know up front that it’s not going to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I frown. “What are you talking abou—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t play hard to get, kid.” He raises an eyebrow. “I can’t even touch you. Takes ‘hard to get’ to a whole new level, if you know what I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” I mouth, eyes closed, shaking my head. “You are insane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe falls to his knees. “Insane for your sweet, sweet love!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kenji!” I can’t lift my eyes because I’m afraid to look around, but I’m desperate for him to stop talking. To put an entire room between us at all times. I know he’s joking, but I might be the only one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he says, his voice booming around the room. “Does my love embarrass you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please—please get up—and lower your voice—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” I’m pleading now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because if I lower my voice, I won’t be able to hear myself speak. And that,” he says, “is my favorite part.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t even look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t deny me, Juliette. I’m a lonely man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is wrong with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re breaking my heart.” His voice is even louder now, his arms making sad, sweeping gestures that almost hit me as I back away, panicked. But then I realize everyone is watching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEntertained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI manage an awkward smile as I glance around the room and I’m surprised to find that no one is looking at me now. They’re all grinning, clearly accustomed to Kenji’s antics, staring at him with a mixture of adoration and something else. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unravel-me-shatter-me-2/page-4.html","bookId":1772,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:06 AM"}
