Just look at him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can look all you want but I have to get to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff shook his head and bent to take Beau from her slipper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace hated to be so coldhearted but she couldn’t lower her guard, not even a little. The instant she did, Beau would wriggle his way into her affections, which was exactly what Cliff and Beth hoped would happen. Grace was determined it wouldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later, after a second cup of coffee and a toasted English muffin, Grace drove to the library with Beau in the box beside her. She had several small bottles of formula, which she’d have to feed him during the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCliff said that if the meetings ended early, he’d come and pick up Beau, but he wasn’t making any promises. She figured she’d be stuck with the puppy all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally Beau had everyone on the library staff wrapped around his tiny paw the moment she carried him into the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyone want to feed him?” she asked. If she could arrange for someone else to do it, all the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery single employee volunteered. She let them work out a schedule as she retreated to her office and assumed her tasks for the day. Writing the email newsletter that went out to patrons every Monday morning was at the top of her list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth phoned shortly after the library opened. “How’s it going?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s going. Cliff named him Beau.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Beth had been in contact with Cliff. If Grace was a paranoid kind of person, she’d wonder if those two were teaming up against her. More than likely Beth had phoned the house and Cliff had answered, then simply forgotten to mention the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you weighed Beau lately?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not me. Cliff did, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember his weight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth asked a few additional questions, but Grace was no more helpful with those than she’d been with the first one. Cliff had taken on nearly all Beau-related duties and that was how Grace intended to keep it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce she was off the phone, she went to check with the children’s librarian regarding story hour that Friday afternoon. She needed the information for her newsletter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she walked toward the children’s section, she noticed several people smiling in her direction. She didn’t think anything of it until she looked back. Beau was trotting after her as if he were her shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace stopped and so did Beau. He sat on his haunches and stared up at her, his tail wagging. Ignoring him, she moved forward purposely. Beau ran after her, his small legs hardly able to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she couldn’t stand it a minute longer. Crouching down, she picked him up and cradled him in her arms. He licked her hand, then reached for her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her chin out of his range. “I am not going to love you, no matter what you do,” she insisted. “Don’t even try, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeau whimpered as if to disagree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to find you a good home,” she said, stroking his soft fur. “A family with lots of children for you to play with. That’s what you need—a family with children. You don’t want to live with Cliff and me. We won’t feel like playing chase or throwing a Frisbee or doing any of the other things you’d love. It’s for your own good. Do you understand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently Beau didn’t, because he licked her hand again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-One\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri Polgar was enjoying her first peaceful moment of the day. She sat in the most comfortable chair in the family room, rested her feet on the matching ottoman, leaned back and closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe triplets were all asleep and, after the morning she’d had, Teri was ready for a nap herself. Friends and family claimed that if anyone could handle a multiple birth, she could. It was a nice compliment, and she took it as such, although she was beginning to doubt the high opinion they had of her abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby and James were off for the next few days meeting with the video game people in L.A. Bobby was a huge help with their sons, and of course Gabrielle, their nanny, was, too. Still, the major part of the triplets’ care fell to her. Other than quick trips to buy groceries, Teri couldn’t even remember when she’d last ventured out of the house. As for “girl time”—it’d been practically nonexistent. Her hair needed to be cut and her fingernails were a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe missed Rachel, although they’d talked a few days ago—for the first time in ages. Rachel had described her situation—her housemate and the temporary position she’d taken with the shipyard. That girl must like living on the edge because she was definitely not in her right mind to be living with Nate Olsen. Teri could only imagine what Bruce would say once he found out. Well, she wasn’t going to be the one to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce Peyton. Teri felt like slapping him silly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly—letting a thirteen-year-old dictate his life. How crazy was that? Teri knew what poor Rachel had endured in the months that led up to her moving out. She certainly didn’t blame her. In Teri’s opinion, Rachel deserved a medal for putting up with that spoiled brat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, last week, just when things seemed promising—because Bruce was seeing a counselor and Jolene appeared to be softening—everything had blown up in Rachel’s face. Jolene had gotten sick and Bruce had to hurry home. But Bruce soon discovered that this so-called illness had been self-inflicted. He found an empty bottle of ipecac in the garbage and confronted his daughter. He’d emailed Rachel, and Rachel had subsequently told Teri. This marriage wasn’t looking good. Not good at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell chimed and Teri bounded to her feet with more energy than she’d realized she had. If whoever it was woke any of the triplets…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce stood on the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bruce?” She was too surprised to say any more. Then she added, “What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came to talk to you about Rachel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri shook her head, unwilling to let him in. This was Rachel’s worst fear, that Bruce would ask Teri for information. “I don’t think I should,” she said bluntly. She’d vowed she wouldn’t supply Bruce with any of the details Rachel had so recently and reluctantly shared. Not until Rachel had the chance to tell him herself, which she’d fully intended to do until she’d heard about this latest trick of Jolene’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have something I want you to give Rachel,” he pleaded, still on the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sad eyes did her in. Teri had always been a sucker for sad eyes. She’d learned more quickly than her sister had, however. Christie’s heart had been broken more times than a carton of eggs, usually over some down-on-his-luck loser. Christie did eventually learn; it just took her longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, you can come in,” she said, not very graciously. Stepping aside, she gestured into the house, then led him into the family room. It was far enough away that they wouldn’t disturb the triplets, but at the same time she could hear them if they cried. That was especially important, since Gabrielle had the night off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe motioned toward the sofa, which Bruce sank into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What can I do for you?” she asked, not bothering with small talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need help,” Bruce admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll say you do.” However, Bruce needed more help than she could give him. She hoped he was continuing to see the counselor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “I really blew it with Rachel, didn’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo point in answering that. Bruce already knew he was in trouble with his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you hear what happened last Saturday?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled slowly. “I was beginning to think Rachel might be willing to move back home. Then the three of us could all go to the counselor together. We need to work on being a family, and Rachel living somewhere else complicates everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri couldn’t even manage an encouraging smile for fear she’d blurt out her opinion, which she was sure Bruce wouldn’t appreciate. As far as she was concerned, Jolene should be grounded until she turned thirty or wised up, whichever came first. Teri felt the girl would see the light far more quickly that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce apparently thought the best approach was to attempt reason. What a joke! Reason with a teenager? No wonder their marriage was falling apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you talked to Rachel in the past week?” Bruce asked with wide-eyed hopefulness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” Teri mentally zipped her mouth shut. She refused to divulge a single detail of their conversation. Not one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, that was tricky. “All right…I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce leaned forward. “We had dinner two weeks ago and everything went so well that we started talking on the phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri knew that, too, but didn’t respond. Rachel would never forgive her, and this was her closest, dearest friend in the world. Well, other than her sister. Rachel had entrusted her with this secret, which Teri vowed she would keep to herself. Not even Bobby knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But after last weekend, she won’t answer my calls anymore,” Bruce concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d missed a whole section of what he’d been saying, which was just fine. The less she heard, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m worried about her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clamped her teeth tightly together. If Bruce was worried, he didn’t have anyone to blame but himself. How he could’ve been so oblivious to Jolene’s manipulations for so long would forever remain a mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said, I want you to give Rachel something for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and took a wad of bills out of his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to give her money?” He thought that was how he’d win back his wife? Even Bobby, with his chess brain, wouldn’t dream of doing anything so…so dumb. And he’d had some prize ideas in his time, adorable though he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She must be low on cash,” Bruce explained. “So, would you give this to her for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What makes you think she’s low on cash?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze held hers, and Teri quickly looked away, afraid he’d read something in her expression that she didn’t intend to tell him. “I know she’s working but she’s also paying rent,” he said, “and there have to be additional expenses. I just feel I should be helping her financially.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should talk to her about this, not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but she refuses to discuss money with me—or anything else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe murmured a few noncommittal words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do know she’s working,” he went on, “but not where. I called every salon in the Kitsap area looking for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri gave him high grades for trying. She still hadn’t taken the money, although he continued to extend it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to be sure she has vitamins, good food—stuff like that. She might not want to talk to me, but I’d feel better if I knew she had the things she needs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand why she’s upset, but I feel responsible for her and the baby.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/1105-yakima-street-cedar-cove-11/page-27.html","bookId":1953,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:47 AM"}
