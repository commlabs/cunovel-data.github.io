Only a handful of scientists were present, a sprinkling of high brass, some Congressmen, a few newsmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlvin Homer of the Washington Bureau of the Continental Press found himself next to Joseph Vincenzo of Los Alamos, and said, \"Now we ought to leam something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincenzo stared at him through bifocals and said, \"Not the important thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomer frowned. This was to be the first super-slow-motion films of an atomic explosion. With trick lenses changing directional polarization in flickers, the moment of explosion would be divided into billionth-second snaps. Yesterday, an A-bomb had exploded. Today, those snaps would show the explosion in incredible detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorner said, \"You think this won\u0027t work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincenzo looked tormented. \"It will work. We\u0027ve run pilot tests. But the important thing-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That these bombs are man\u0027s death sentence. We don\u0027t seem to be able to learn that.\" Vincenzo nodded. \"Look at them here. They\u0027re excited and thrilled, but not afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newsman said, \"They know the danger. They\u0027re afraid, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not enough,\" said the scientist. \"I\u0027ve seen men watch an H-bomb blow an island into a hole and then go home and sleep. That\u0027s the way men are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor thousands of years, hell-fire has been preached to them, and it\u0027s made no real impression.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell-fire: Are you religious, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you saw yesterday was hell-fire. An exploding atom bomb is hell-fire. Literally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was enough for Homer. He got up and changed his seat, but watched the audience uneasily. Were any afraid? Did any worry about hell-fire? It didn\u0027t seem so to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights went out, the projector started. On the screen, the firing tower stood gaunt. The audience grew tensely quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a dot of light appeared at the apex of the tower, a brilliant, burning point, slowly budding in a lazy, outward elbowing, this way and that, taking on uneven shapes of light and shadow, growing oval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man cried out chokingly, then others. A hoarse babble of noise, followed by thick silence. Horner could smell fear, taste terror in his own mouth, feel his blood freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oval fireball had sprouted projections, then paused a moment in stasis, before expanding rapidly into a bright and featureless sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat moment of stasis-the fireball had shown dark spots for eyes, with dark lines for thin, flaring eyebrows, a hairline coming down V-shaped, a mouth twisted upward, laughing wildly in the hell-fire-and horns. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-stories/page-11.html","bookId":1734,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:56 AM"}
