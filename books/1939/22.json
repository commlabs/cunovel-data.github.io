Just as I\u0027d feared, despite the clip, her pant cuff had gotten caught in the chain and had torn. I pulled away the bicycle and rested it against a tree, then did a quick visual exam. The skin on her elbow had been scraped and was bleeding, as was her knee, which appeared to be the worst of her injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch me!\" She tensed as I bent down to examine her more thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" I promised, looking in both directions to make sure no cars were coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter closed her eyes and released a shaky breath. \"Does anything feel broken?\" I asked, quickly transitioning into doctor mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep still for a moment. Concentrate. Where\u0027s the pain?\" \"My elbow and knee--nothing\u0027s broken. I\u0027m sure of it.\" She struggled into a sitting position. When I tried to help, she shook her head, telling me she wanted to do this on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up slowly and, bending her arm, studied her elbow first. Then she stared down at her knee. I knew it must hurt. It wasn\u0027t as if we were kids and could easily recover from a fall. As adults we land a lot harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel dizzy?\" I asked, afraid she might have bumped her head. She was wearing Hannah\u0027s old helmet, but I had to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Light-headed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The helmet saved me, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why we\u0027re supposed to use them.\" I\u0027ve dealt with too many preventable head injuries in children who hadn\u0027t been wearing helmets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter grinned. \"You\u0027re not one of those men who take delight in saying I told you so, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned back. \"Every man lives for the opportunity.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought,\" she said, coming awkwardly to a stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take you to the house and patch up your wounds,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter hobbled toward the house while I pushed both bikes. So much for that plan. Bike riding had been a disaster. \"I\u0027m sorry, Winter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should you apologize? I\u0027m the inept one.\" \"I should\u0027ve suggested we do something else.\" I put the bikes in the garage, then joined her. With my arm around her waist, I led her into the kitchen and sat her down on a kitchen chair while I went in search of Band-Aids and antibiotic cream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I returned I had a fresh washcloth, too. Next I ran cool water into a bowl and brought it over to the table where I\u0027d set my supplies. I dabbed at her scraped elbow and knee, applied ointment and carefully bandaged them. \"I\u0027m not a good patient,\" Winter said from between clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the contrary, you\u0027re an excellent patient.\" She smiled and our eyes met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I\u0027d finished, I took away the water and the cloth and put everything back where it belonged. I hate to admit it, but I\u0027m a neat freak, as Hannah rather unflatteringly described me. It\u0027s a habit I developed as a child, perhaps because my brother, with whom I shared a bedroom, was such a slob. Ever since then, I\u0027d felt a need to have order around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother always gave me a treat when I was hurt as a kid,\" Winter told me when I came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of treat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes it was hot cocoa, other times a cookie. When I broke my arm she let me sleep in her bed and watch movies all day.\" Her face reddened and she immediately broke eye contact. \"I wasn\u0027t asking to sleep in your bed, Michael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t taken it that way and merely laughed. \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thanked me with a lopsided smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to watch a movie?\" I offered. That was the only thing I could think of, probably because she\u0027d just mentioned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have popcorn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me check.\" Groceries were a hit-and-miss chore with me. I was thankful to discover an unopened box of microwave popcorn in the cupboard above the refrigerator. I didn\u0027t know how long it\u0027d been there, but it served the purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I stood guard over it, Winter went through the stack of DVDs. I couldn\u0027t remember when I\u0027d actually sat down and watched one, although we owned quite a few. Hannah was the movie lover, everything from black-andwhite classics to foreign films to Hollywood blockbusters. I watched them with her--mainly to be with her--but movies seemed a waste of time to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter came into the kitchen, a DVD in her hand. \"The African Queen is one of my favorites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah\u0027s, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027m guessing she bought it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe popping slowed and then stopped, and the timer buzzed. I was grateful for the distraction. I didn\u0027t want to get caught up in memories of Hannah. I didn\u0027t think it was wise to drag her name into every conversation. Winter must have felt the same way because she didn\u0027t mention Hannah again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe TV was in the family room and I inserted the movie, then sat down on the sofa next to Winter. I left several inches between us. She had her bowl of popcorn and I had mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027d been probably four years since I\u0027d seen the Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn movie. I\u0027d forgotten what a moving love story it is. I did recall that Hannah invariably cried at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the credits rolled, Winter glanced in my direction. Neither of us had moved during the film. The same few inches still separated us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you feeling?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got some aspirin.\" I should\u0027ve thought of it earlier. If she wasn\u0027t stiff and sore now, she would be soon. She shook her head. \"It hardly hurts at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, tomorrow might be another story,\" I said, blaming myself regardless of her protests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you might\u0027ve guessed, I\u0027m more of an inside woman,\" Winter announced. \"I\u0027ve always loved working in the kitchen and experimenting with recipes. I\u0027m not really into sports.\" Hannah had enjoyed cooking, too, but as far as sports went, she was game for anything. She had the spirit of an adventurer. Never once could I remember her holding back when I suggested we try something new, whether it was biking a hundred and fifty miles on a two-day trek to Oregon or signing us up for a river rafting trip. \"I might not be any good at sports, but I could whip up a dinner you\u0027d rave about for weeks,\" Winter said. \"I\u0027ll bet you could.\" I hoped she didn\u0027t hear the lack of enthusiasm in my voice. Since Hannah\u0027s charming dinner parties, I\u0027d lost any interest in elaborate meals. Eating was just a means of fueling the body for me, not the soul. \"What would you like to do?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you play cards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore.\" I used to play poker, of course, but not since Hannah got ill. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Her disappointment was obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you do on your days off?\" I asked. \"I putter around in my kitchen. I know!\" Her eyes brightened. \"How about if I make you dinner?\" \"Don\u0027t you cook all week? You shouldn\u0027t have to do it on your day off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s what I love,\" she said. \"When I\u0027m at the cafe I\u0027m stuck doing the paperwork, ordering, things like that. So I seldom get a chance to experiment in the kitchen anymore. There are a few dishes I\u0027ve been eager to try, but it doesn\u0027t make sense to cook for one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t been to the store in a while.\" I gestured for her to search through the fridge and cupboards if she wished, knowing she\u0027d find mostly canned soup and a few frozen meals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s part of the fun,\" she said. \"I like grocery shopping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned widely as I reached for my car keys. This wasn\u0027t how I\u0027d envisioned spending our Sunday afternoon, but if it was what she wanted I wasn\u0027t about to complain. From the moment we stepped inside the store, it was clear that Winter was in her element. She maneuvered the aisles like a pro, pausing now and then to throw an item into the cart. She read labels, talked to the butcher requesting a special cut, and smelled and squeezed the fruit and vegetables. It was an experience just being with her. Tagging along, I caught a bit of her enthusiasm. Passion is contagious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve memorized the recipe?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me as if I\u0027d spoken a foreign language. \"You know,\" I said. \"The recipe for this fabulous dinner you\u0027re cooking me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha!\" she said with a laugh. \"I don\u0027t have any recipe!\" \"You said there was one you wanted to try.\" \"Well, yes. It\u0027s something I had not long ago while I was out with friends. I\u0027ve been dying to reproduce it myself.\" \"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind--I promise it\u0027ll taste like a feast Henry VIII would\u0027ve been proud to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Otherwise off with your head?\" I joked, and she seemed to find that funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the house, I unloaded the car while Winter set to work in the kitchen. She soon had the vegetables in the sink and started organizing ingredients on the counter. I saw the thick slices of fresh tuna and boneless chicken breasts and couldn\u0027t imagine what she might be planning with that combination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do?\" I asked, my hands in my back pockets. I\u0027d never been much use in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me and for an instant I saw a flicker of sadness in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you thinking of Hannah just now?\" I asked. It did seem odd to see another woman in Hannah\u0027s kitchen, even if that woman was there by invitation. Almost immediately I realized I\u0027d broken one of my own rules. I\u0027d brought Hannah into our conversation, and I\u0027d been determined not to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Hannah,\" Winter answered after a brief pause. \"Then who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pierre. He\u0027s the chef I mentioned. We used to love cooking together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinter turned abruptly away from me. \"I think I told you Pierre and I...are taking a break from each other,\" she said. \"Unfortunately it looks like it\u0027ll be a permanent one.\" Winter was preparing a meal, indulging in her favorite pastime--which she used to share with the man she loved. I\u0027d done the same thing when I suggested we take out the bikes. Hannah and I had often gone cycling on a Sunday afternoon, and it appeared that Winter and Pierre had spent their time together in the kitchen, doing something they were equally passionate about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could picture them working side by side, offering each other small tastes of their creations, arguing, laughing, kissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What exactly happened with you and Pierre?\" I asked. She shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she whispered. Her voice registered such pain that I automatically took a step closer, and stopped myself just in time from wrapping my arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she said again. \"I can\u0027t even begin to explain it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike me, like Leanne...Winter, too, was dealing with loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eG rumbling the entire time, Macy did as Dr. Everett had requested and drew a jungle scene. The problem was that the man had no imagination. She\u0027d met men like him before and found them uniformly boring. He obviously didn\u0027t have a sense of humor, either. In her humble opinion, the children\u0027s doctor could use a good laugh. He took everything far too seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday afternoon, as promised, she showed up at his office--on time. He didn\u0027t seem impressed. This illmannered physician hardly even noticed the effort she\u0027d put into making sure she wasn\u0027t late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Macy was kept waiting for five whole minutes. She could\u0027ve used those extra minutes. Snowball hadn\u0027t eaten that morning, and Macy was concerned. He could be ill. Or mad. He seemed to think he was punishing Macy by not eating. How like a male to punish \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-22.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
