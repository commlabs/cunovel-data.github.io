He had the huge trunk of his Crown Vic stocked with the special ammo Abe had supplied, but it was garaged a couple of hours away in the city. He needed to get back to Manhattan, and hoped Abe had acquired the final items on his shopping list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn\u0027s Volvo sat in the O\u0027Donnells\u0027 garage and would stay there. Weezy had hidden the rented SUV off road in the trees down by the highway and driven in with Dawn. Round trip from way out here to the city this time of year took about four hours. On a crowded summer weekend it could take that long just one way. Weezy could drive him in and head right back, but that would mean leaving Dawn out here alone for four hours. Not a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he remembered: The Hampton Jitney ran between Montauk and the city. Probably a limited schedule this time of year, but he could hop one of those early tomorrow morning and make it to the city without leaving Dawn unattended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the steps to the second floor two at a time and slipped into the darkened front bedroom. Two figures sat by the window, silhouetted against the glow from the streetlight outside. Dawn stared out at the night, Jack\u0027s Leica Ultravid binocs pressed to her eyes. Weezy turned at his entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lights are going out over there,\" she said. \"Looks like they\u0027re calling it a night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you didn\u0027t see my baby?\" Dawn said, still peering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve a pretty good idea what a baby looks like, and I didn\u0027t see one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027m pretty sure I heard one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d told her about seeing Gilda but hadn\u0027t mentioned the bassinet or the screech. He wasn\u0027t sure of the best way to play this, but that seemed like the way to go. The screech might get her all upset, thinking the baby was in distress or being mistreated, making her a wilder card than she already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered the Leica. \"Damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Dawn, it\u0027s late,\" he said. \"Only the great room was lit. The baby was probably asleep in one of the dark rooms. Add Gilda\u0027s presence to the doctor\u0027s visit and it\u0027s almost a sure thing he\u0027s there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy looked at him. \"Just as you\u0027re almost sure Ra - \" She cleared her throat. \"Mister Osala is not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at her. She\u0027d almost slipped there. Dawn knew nothing of Rasalom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just got it on good authority that he\u0027ll be returning tomorrow night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent,\" Weezy said. \"Then all the pieces will be in place and we can start to plan our moves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack already had a plan forming. If it worked out, Rasalom would never reach the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy was rubbing Dawn\u0027s shoulder. \"Won\u0027t be long now, Dawn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack took the glasses and checked out the mansion. All dark now. Early to bed and early to rise?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focused on the window to the baby\u0027s room, remembering those two points of light in the crib. Could it have been standing at two weeks old?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d promised Dawn he\u0027d help her get her baby back, but what exactly would she be getting? She\u0027d had only a glimpse of the child right after delivery. Would she still want it when she saw it close up in the light of day?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory of its screech still rattled him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-40.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
