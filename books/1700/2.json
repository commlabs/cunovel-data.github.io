{"id":65731,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you tell anyone about this?” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t want to have to admit to any weakness,” I say. “And I didn’t want Four to know I was working with his father. I knew he wouldn’t like it.” I feel new words rising in my throat, prompted by the truth serum. “I brought you the truth about our city and the reason we are in it. If you aren’t thanking me for it, you should at least do something about it instead of sitting here on this mess you made, pretending it’s a throne!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn’s mocking smile twists like she has just tasted something unpleasant. She leans in close to my face, and I see for the first time how old she is; I see the lines that frame her eyes and mouth, and the unhealthy pallor she wears from years of eating far too little. Still, she is handsome like her son. Near-starvation could not take that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am doing something about it. I am making a new world,” she says, and her voice gets even quieter, so that I can barely hear her. “I was Abnegation. I have known the truth far longer than you have, Beatrice Prior. I don’t know how you’re getting away with this, but I promise you, you will not have a place in my new world, especially not with my son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile a little. I shouldn’t, but it’s harder to suppress gestures and expressions than words, with this weight in my veins. She believes that Tobias belongs to her now. She doesn’t know the truth, that he belongs to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn straightens, folding her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The truth serum has revealed that while you may be a fool, you are no traitor. This interrogation is over. You may leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about my friends?” I say sluggishly. “Christina, Cara. They didn’t do anything wrong either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will deal with them soon,” Evelyn says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand, though I’m weak and dizzy from the serum. The room is packed with people, shoulder to shoulder, and I can’t find the exit for a few long seconds, until someone takes my arm, a boy with warm brown skin and a wide smile—Uriah. He guides me to the door. Everyone starts talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUriah leads me down the hallway to the elevator bank. The elevator doors spring open when he touches the button, and I follow him in, still not steady on my feet. When the doors close, I say, “You don’t think the part about the mess and the throne was too much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. She expects you to be hotheaded. She might have been suspicious if you hadn’t been.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like everything inside me is vibrating with energy, in anticipation of what is to come. I am free. We’re going to find a way out of the city. No more waiting, pacing a cell, demanding answers that I won’t get from the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards did tell me a few things about the new factionless order this morning. Former faction members are required to move closer to Erudite headquarters and mix, no more than four members of a particular faction in each dwelling. We have to mix our clothing, too. I was given a yellow Amity shirt and black Candor pants earlier as a result of that particular edict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, we’re this way. . . .” Uriah leads me out of the elevator. This floor of Erudite headquarters is all glass, even the walls. Sunlight refracts through it and casts slivers of rainbows across the floor. I shield my eyes with one hand and follow Uriah to a long, narrow room with beds on either side. Next to each bed is a glass cabinet for clothes and books, and a small table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It used to be the Erudite initiate dormitory,” Uriah says. “I reserved beds for Christina and Cara already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on a bed near the door are three girls in red shirts—Amity girls, I would guess—and on the left side of the room, an older woman lies on one of the beds, her spectacles dangling from one ear—possibly one of the Erudite. I know I should try to stop putting people in factions when I see them, but it’s an old habit, hard to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUriah falls on one of the beds in the back corner. I sit on the one next to his, glad to be free and at rest, finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zeke says it sometimes takes a little while for the factionless to process exonerations, so they should be out later,” Uriah says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I feel relieved that everyone I care about will be out of prison by tonight. But then I remember that Caleb is still there, because he was a well-known lackey of Jeanine Matthews, and the factionless will never exonerate him. But just how far they will go to destroy the mark Jeanine Matthews left on this city, I don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t care, I think. But even as I think it, I know it’s a lie. He’s still my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” I say. “Thanks, Uriah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, and leans his head against the wall to prop it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you?” I say. “I mean . . . Lynn . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUriah had been friends with Lynn and Marlene as long as I’d known them, and now both of them are dead. I feel like I might be able to understand—after all, I’ve lost two friends too, Al to the pressures of initiation and Will to the attack simulation and my own hasty actions. But I don’t want to pretend that our suffering is the same. For one thing, Uriah knew his friends better than I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to talk about it.” Uriah shakes his head. “Or think about it. I just want to keep moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. I understand. Just . . . let me know if you need . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” He smiles at me and gets up. “You’re okay here, right? I told my mom I’d visit tonight, so I have to go soon. Oh—almost forgot to tell you—Four said he wants to meet you later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull up straighter. “Really? When? Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little after ten, at Millennium Park. On the lawn.” He smirks. “Don’t get too excited, your head will explode.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTOBIAS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMY MOTHER ALWAYS sits on the edges of things—chairs, ledges, tables—as if she suspects she will have to flee in an instant. This time it’s Jeanine’s old desk in Erudite headquarters that she sits on the edge of, her toes balanced on the floor and the cloudy light of the city glowing behind her. She is a woman of muscle twisted around bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we have to talk about your loyalty,” she says, but she doesn’t sound like she’s accusing me of something, she just sounds tired. For a moment she seems so worn that I feel like I can see right through her, but then she straightens, and the feeling is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ultimately, it was you who helped Tris and got that video released,” she says. “No one else knows that, but I know it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen.” I lean forward to prop my elbows on my knees. “I didn’t know what was in that file. I trusted Tris’s judgment more than my own. That’s all that happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought telling Evelyn that I broke up with Tris would make it easier for my mother to trust me, and I was right—she has been warmer, more open, ever since I told that lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now that you’ve seen the footage?” Evelyn says. “What do you think now? Do you think we should leave the city?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what she wants me to say—that I see no reason to join the outside world—but I’m not a good liar, so instead I select a part of the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid of it,” I say. “I’m not sure it’s smart to leave the city knowing the dangers that might be out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considers me for a moment, biting the inside of her cheek. I learned that habit from her—I used to chew my skin raw as I waited for my father to come home, unsure which version of him I would encounter, the one the Abnegation trusted and revered, or the one whose hands struck me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my tongue along the bite scars and swallow the memory like it’s bile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slides off the desk and moves to the window. “I’ve been receiving disturbing reports of a rebel organization among us.” She looks up, raising an eyebrow. “People always organize into groups. That’s a fact of our existence. I just didn’t expect it to happen this quickly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of organization?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The kind that wants to leave the city,” she says. “They released some kind of manifesto this morning. They call themselves the Allegiant.” When she sees my confused look, she adds, “Because they’re allied with the original purpose of our city, see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The original purpose—you mean, what was in the Edith Prior video? That we should send people outside when the city has a large Divergent population?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That, yes. But also living in factions. The Allegiant claim that we’re meant to be in factions because we’ve been in them since the beginning.” She shakes her head. “Some people will always fear change. But we can’t indulge them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the factions dismantled, part of me has felt like a man released from a long imprisonment. I don’t have to evaluate whether every thought I have or choice I make fits into a narrow ideology. I don’t want the factions back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Evelyn hasn’t liberated us like she thinks—she’s just made us all factionless. She’s afraid of what we would choose, if we were given actual freedom. And that means that no matter what I believe about the factions, I’m relieved that someone, somewhere, is defying her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arrange my face into an empty expression, but my heart is beating faster than before. I have had to be careful, to stay in Evelyn’s good graces. It’s easy for me to lie to everyone else, but it’s more difficult to lie to her, the only person who knew all the secrets of our Abnegation house, the violence contained within its walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to do about them?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am going to get them under control, what else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word “control” makes me sit up straight, as rigid as the chair beneath me. In this city, “control” means needles and serums and seeing without seeing; it means simulations, like the one that almost made me kill Tris, or the one that made the Dauntless into an army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With simulations?” I say slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scowls. “Of course not! I am not Jeanine Matthews!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer flare of anger sets me off. I say, “Don’t forget that I barely know you, Evelyn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winces at the reminder. “Then let me tell you that I will never resort to simulations to get my way. Death would be better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s possible that death is what she will use—killing people would certainly keep them quiet, stifle their revolution before it begins. Whoever the Allegiant are, they need to be warned, and quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can find out who they are,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure that you can. Why else would I have told you about them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are plenty of reasons she would tell me. To test me. To catch me. To feed me false information. I know what my mother is—she is someone for whom the end of a thing justifies the means of getting there, the same as my father, and the same, sometimes, as me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll do it, then. I’ll find them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rise, and her fingers, brittle as branches, close around my arm. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force myself to look at her. Her eyes are close above her nose, which is hooked at the end, like my own. Her skin is a middling color, darker than mine. For a moment I see her in Abnegation gray, her thick hair bound back with a dozen pins, sitting across the dinner table from me. I see her crouched in front of me, fixing my mismatched shirt buttons before I go to school, and standing at the window, watching the uniform street for my father’s car, her hands clasped—no, clenched, her tan knuckles white with tension. We were united in fear then, and now that she isn’t afraid anymore, part of me wants to see what it would be like to unite with her in strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel an ache, like I betrayed her, the woman who used to be my only ally, and I turn away before I can take it all back and apologize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave Erudite headquarters amid a crowd of people, my eyes confused, hunting for faction colors automatically when there are none left. I am wearing a gray shirt, blue jeans, black shoes—new clothes, but beneath them, my Dauntless tattoos. It is impossible to erase my choices. Especially these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTRIS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI SET MY watch alarm for ten o’clock and fall asleep right away, without even shifting to a comfortable position. A few hours later the beeps don’t wake me, but the frustrated shout of someone across the room does. I turn off the alarm, run my fingers through my hair, and half walk, half jog to one of the emergency staircases. The exit at the bottom will let me out in the alley, where I probably won’t be stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I’m outside, the cool air wakes me up. I pull my sleeves down over my fingers to keep them warm. Summer is finally ending. There are a few people milling around the entrance to Erudite headquarters, but none of them notices me creeping across Michigan Avenue. There are some advantages to being small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Tobias standing in the middle of the lawn, wearing mixed faction colors—a gray T-shirt, blue jeans, and a black sweatshirt with a hood, representing all the factions my aptitude test told me I was qualified for. A backpack rests against his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did I do?” I say when I’m close enough for him to hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well,” he says. “Evelyn still hates you, but Christina and Cara have been released without questioning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pinches the front of my shirt, right over my stomach, and tugs me toward him, kissing me softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” he says as he pulls away. “I have a plan for this evening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, well, I realized that we’ve never been on an actual date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chaos and destruction do tend to take away a person’s dating possibilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would like to experience this ‘date’ phenomenon.” He walks backward, toward the mammoth metal structure at the other end of the lawn, and I follow him. “Before you, I only went on group dates, and they were usually a disaster. They always ended up with Zeke making out with whatever girl he intended to make out with, and me sitting in awkward silence with some girl that I had somehow offended in some way early on.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allegiant-divergent-3/page-2.html","bookId":1700,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:52 AM"}
