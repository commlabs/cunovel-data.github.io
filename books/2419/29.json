When your partners wouldn\u0027t go along with the sale, you helped Pena force the situation. Maybe you didn\u0027t realize how zealous he would be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re suggesting I would sabotage my own company?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you work it, Ruby? What did Pena promise you—just extra money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes zigged their way down from my face to my chest. Her anger seemed to be collapsing from the inside. \"Just extra money. That\u0027s good, Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pena doesn\u0027t quit when he\u0027s won,\" I warned her. \"He won\u0027t leave you alone. If you come clean, maybe I can help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"You\u0027re cute, and all, Tres. But sorry—I don\u0027t do the damselindistress routine. There\u0027s nothing going on I can\u0027t handle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA speedboat went by, far out in the channel. I watched its line of wake roll toward us, hundreds of yards, until it broke against the shore, lifting Ruby\u0027s red racing boat in a gentle swell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If everything\u0027s so great,\" I said, \"why are you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby absently swatted a mosquito from in front of her eyes. \"I couldn\u0027t apologize to Garrett, so I thought I would apologize to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was fragile, covering a world of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scary thing was that despite everything I suspected about her collaborating with Pena, despite the fact that her exhusband had been murdered, despite the fact that she was quite possibly the worst thing that ever happened to my brother with the exception of the northbound train—I found myself wanting to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn part, I wanted to undermine Pena, to prove to myself that his influence over people wasn\u0027t total. But my instinct to help Ruby went deeper than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like out of the three people who\u0027d created Techsan, I might relate to Ruby the best. The past weighed on her as heavily as it weighed on Garrett or Jimmy, and yet she\u0027d done her best to get out from under the McBride legacy—to make her marina business pay off, to build her tower. I couldn\u0027t help admiring that, and I couldn\u0027t blame her for getting disillusioned with Jimmy and Garrett, either. I had a growing suspicion that if there were one person in the world I might be able to talk to honestly about my brother, it would be Ruby McBride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you came here on Sunday,\" I said, \"you were looking through Jimmy\u0027s things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou picked out Clara\u0027s picture, her journal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to understand the Other Woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to know why Jimmy was obsessed with his mother\u0027s past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby lifted the unfired pot, cradled it in her lap. \"With Jimmy—there was always something going on that he didn\u0027t share, always something else taking up his thoughts, even when he was working nineteen hours a day on Techsan. That\u0027s what attracted me to him. When you have ninety percent of someone\u0027s attention—I suppose it drove me crazy, not knowing where that other ten percent was focused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did you find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. Her eyes were getting teary, red. \"It\u0027s the goddamn Elavil, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not me. The alcohol . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t protect Matthew Pena, Ruby. He\u0027s not worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at the vase—the smooth surface, muddy with unfired glaze, the ribbed interior made by Jimmy\u0027s fingers. \"You still think he murdered Jimmy. You think I helped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for me to respond. I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about leaving, heading back up to the dome for a bitter, silent supper with my cat, when Ruby said, \"You really want to believe someone else killed Jimmy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone besides Garrett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me defiantly. \"Then where\u0027d they go afterward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean to get away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came rushing down from the house, right? You would\u0027ve heard a boat. Coming down here, so soon after the shots, you would\u0027ve run smack into the killer if he\u0027d tried to get away up the road. The only person you saw was Garrett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The shoreline,\" I said. And then, realizing it only as I said it: \"There\u0027s an access road about two hundred yards south. I passed the entrance driving up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t the police have scoured that entire area?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby lifted her eyebrows in challenge. \"I think you owe me a walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me her hand. I pulled her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t a trail to speak of, but the terrain was fairly easy. We hiked through agarita bushes, pushed past live oak saplings. Limestone outcroppings made a ridge along the water, in one place high enough to be a diving spot. The remnants of a fraying rope swing hung from the branch of a massive water cypress. Instead of evoking childhood memories, it just reminded me of a lynching tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure what we were looking for, and nothing screamed \"clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only the glint of water, the ground thickly littered with cedar needles and leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we got within sight of the access road, we were no wiser, no cooler, and I was down several quarts of blood from the chiggers and ticks and mosquitoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby stopped in front of me, turned. \"Nothing,\" she decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to agree with her when I caught myself staring at the water. The ground at my feet was littered with something besides cedar needles—a large scatter of sunflower seed shells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crouched down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Ruby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back toward Jimmy\u0027s house. The shore curved between here and there, with a clear line of sight along the cove. You could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esee the kiln, the dock, Ruby\u0027s sleek Conbrio. You could easily stand here in the woods at night, undisturbed, and munch sunflower seeds while you watched Jimmy\u0027s dock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you could study a murder scene you\u0027d just left, like a painter standing back from his canvas. And if you were so inclined, you could discard a piece of evidence without much worry that it would ever be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over the edge of the limestone ridge. The water rippled two feet below. It was shallow here, and one glint under the surface was a little brighter than the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheer luck. It\u0027s scary how often it boils down to that. But there I was looking at it from the only right angle to see it—a .380 calibre brass casing in the water, flashing like a coin in a fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Vic Lopez the next morning after my UT class. I had never wanted to get through a discussion of Gawain and the Green Knight with more haste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe state crime lab was an unassuming yellow brick box wedged between two warehouses at the back of the Department of Public Safety complex. Black and white state trooper units lined the street. In the visitors\u0027 lot, Lopez sat on a loading bay between two stacks of crates, waiting for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid down from his perch. \"You have any idea how many markers this cost me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting my neck on the line to get evidence processed on a day\u0027s notice? It\u0027s goddamn irregular, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez wore his normal smile, but his tone had an edge that told me joviality was not to be reciprocated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You drop the names I gave you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez put his finger on my chest. \"IRREGULAR. Word gets around I\u0027m running to DPS \u0027cause some private dick found a piece of brass in the lake—I\u0027m going to be laughed out of the deputies\u0027 quilting club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if I\u0027m right . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, checked his watch. \"Ten minutes. And these people are serious about appointment times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back against the loading bay, fished a pack of cigarettes out of his coat pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You interviewed Garrett yesterday?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had a friendly conversation. Hard not to be friendly, with Miss Lee present. I heard Matthew Pena learned that lesson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still haven\u0027t filed charges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez plucked out a cigarette, pointed it at me. \"I only smoke when I\u0027m pissed off. Just so you feel honoured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re waiting for ballistics on the casing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked his watch again. \"I told my sergeant to be here at 11:15. He wants to observe the test himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me it was at eleven o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got to have time to look first, don\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m irregular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a bad influence. Did I mention that?\" He sparked a flame from his lighter. \"Your friend died early Friday A.M. This is Tuesday. Five days is a hell of a long time in homicide, you know that? They started throwing me new cases yesterday—a couple of drownings. A momandpop shooting. You think my sergeant likes me churning a case from last week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That piece of brass was over a hundred yards down the shore, Vic—down a rocky path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got your word for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Ruby McBride\u0027s. You\u0027re going to tell me Garrett rolled down the shoreline in his wheelchair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I remember, you were at the lake that night, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you really thought I\u0027d planted evidence, we wouldn\u0027t be here now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried his cigarette, didn\u0027t seem to like the flavour much. \"What I think, Jimmy\u0027s killer met him at the water that night. The killer was able to drug him—maybe a laced beer, some kind of drink. That meant spending some time together, talking in the truck for more than a few minutes. Drugs start to kick in, Jimmy starts to fade. Killer took a .380, put the muzzle about two inches from Jimmy\u0027s head, and told him goodbye. It was intimate, Navarre. Like an old friend. You want to tell me Matthew Pena could pull that off, get that close to Jimmy Doebler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the lines of highway patrol cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hell of it was, I agreed with Lopez. The setup of the crime was too personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Lopez about Jimmy\u0027s call to Dwight Hayes the week before he died. I told him about Ruby, the strong possibility that she\u0027d help Matthew Pena sabotage her own company for a sellout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez slid his lighter into his pants pocket. \"And she just happened to walk with you straight to the place where you just happened to find this casing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t implying—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like hell you weren\u0027t,\" Lopez said. I could almost see the homicide detective gears turning in his head. \"Sounds like I should pay another visit to Ms. McBride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The night Clara Doebler died,\" I said. \"You were the reporting officer. You were there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him about Maia and me visiting Faye DoeblerIngram— how she\u0027d treated us to tea and homicide reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez looked less than ecstatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I told you, Navarre. You need a report, ask me for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m asking. Jimmy was killed at the same spot his mother died. What happened with Clara Doebler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled himself up on the ledge of the loading dock. \"Five years ago, the Doebler property was a good place for patrol cops to hang out. Before Jimmy built on it, a lot of deputies used it. You could sit there in your car and catch up on paperwork and be within striking distance for most calls in the David Twenty sector. One night I was finishing B shift, pulled in at the Doebler property about 2100. My partner\u0027s unit was a few miles south, and he was on the way to rendezvous with me. I was sitting there doing paperwork when I heard a shot from down the hill. First I figured it was nothing—just a hunter, or some kid screwing around—but I called it in, got out to investigate. There was this pickup truck by the water, this woman sitting on the tailgate with her back to me, and she was playing with something, like she was rolling a joint. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-29.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM"}
