He holstered the Glock and went to retrieve it. The same number as before. He thumbed SEND.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weezy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been calling Dawn but she doesn\u0027t answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack glanced back toward the Volvo. \"Yeah ... well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What, Jack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was on a cell, the signal going who knew where.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember that movie with Bruce Willis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Die Hard? Listen, Jack, I don\u0027t want to play movie trivia. Dawn - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember what Haley Joel Osment\u0027s character could see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ohmigod! You mean - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m seeing three ... and a really ugly baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dawn? Is she - oh, God, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pull it together, okay? I - we need you to stay together. We\u0027ve got big trouble. What street are you on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ju-just off twenty-seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any landmarky place nearby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see a farmer\u0027s market across the street but it\u0027s closed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I saw the place on the way in. Forget the car and get over there and wait. I\u0027ll pick you up ASAP.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut the call before she could say anything else and looked around. Had to get these bodies out of sight. He wasn\u0027t worried about anyone hearing the shots in this wind and weather. What few people were within earshot were inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe emptied Georges\u0027s pockets and found nothing but a cell phone and the Volvo keys. He grabbed him by the wrists and dragged him around to the far side of the car where he loaded him into the passenger seat. Heavy son of a bitch. Then he moved to the rear compartment to deal with Dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor kid. If she\u0027d just done what he\u0027d told her she\u0027d still be alive. He tried to imagine what had happened since he\u0027d left. She\u0027d been with Weezy, and Weezy had walked down to the car ... and then what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned in and went to grab her shoulders to pull her farther into the car when the baby\u0027s deafening screech stopped him. He looked at the child - the Marty Allen hair and the scrunched-in features gave him a troll-doll look without any of the cuteness. Fury lit his beady little black eyes and Jack thought he was angry for taking his mother from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, little guy. I\u0027m not gonna - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he saw the red smears on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he watched, the kid dipped his fingers into the blood welled in Dawn\u0027s shoulder wound and then stuck them in his mouth, sucking greedily. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-49.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
