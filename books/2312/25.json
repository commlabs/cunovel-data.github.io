Quit using that thing, will you? It sounds like a woman, but it’s your way of talking, your inflections underneath it all. Let me hear the Keller I know so well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unhooked the gadget. “Better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Much better. Your pal came through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got the numbers right and everything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed he did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think the voice-change gizmo helped,” he said. “It made him see we knew everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, he’d have paid anyway,” she said. “All you had to do was yank his chain a little. You just liked using your new toy, that’s all. When are you coming home, Keller?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not right away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I think I’ll wait a few days,” he said. “Right now he’s edgy, looking over his shoulder. Beginning of next week he’ll have his guard down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Makes sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides,” he said, “it’s not a bad town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God, Keller.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ ‘It’s not a bad town.’ I bet you’re the first person to say that, including the head of the chamber of commerce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not,” he insisted. “The motel set gets HBO. There’s a Pizza Hut down the street.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep it to yourself, Keller, or everybody’s going to want to move there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’ve got things to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little metalwork project, for starters. And I want to buy something for Andria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not earrings again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t have too many earrings,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s true,” she agreed. “I can’t argue with you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up and used the carbide-bladed hacksaw from the hardware store to remove most of both barrels of the shotgun from the sporting goods store, then switched blades and cut away most of the stock as well. He loaded both chambers and left the gun tucked under the mattress. Then he drove along the river road until he found a good spot, and he tossed the sawed-off gun barrels, the hacksaw, and the box of shotgun shells into the Mississippi. Toxic waste, he thought, and shook his head, just imagining all the junk that wound up in the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove around for a while, just enjoying the day, and returned to the motel. Right now Randall Cleary was telling himself he was safe, he was in the clear, he had nothing to worry about. But he wasn’t sure yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few days he’d be sure. He’d even think to himself that maybe he should have called Keller’s bluff, or at least not agreed to pay double. But what the hell, it was only money, and money was something he had a ton of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid amateur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich one was he, anyway? The nerd with the wispy mustache? The plump one, the dumpling? Or someone yet unseen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he’d find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller, feeling professional, feeling mature, sat back and put his feet up. Postponing gratification was turning out to be more fun than he would have guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7 Keller\u0027s Choice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eK eller, behind thewheel of a rented Plymouth, kept an eye on the fat man’s house. It was very grand, with columns, for heaven’s sake, and a circular driveway, and one hell of a lot of lawn. Keller, who had done his share of lawn mowing as a teenager, wondered what a kid would get for mowing a lawn like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard to say. The thing was, he had no frame of reference. He seemed to remember getting a couple of bucks way back when, but the lawns he’d mowed were tiny, postage stamps in comparison to the fat man’s rolling green envelope. Taking into consideration the disparity in lawn size, and the inexorable shrinkage of the dollar over the years, what was a lawn like this worth? Twenty dollars? Fifty dollars? More?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe non-answer, he suspected, was that people who had lawns like this one didn’t hire kids to push a mower around. Instead they had gardeners who showed up regularly with vehicles appropriate to the season, mowing in the summer, raking leaves in the fall, plowing snow in the winter. And charging so much a month, a tidy sum that actually didn’t cost the fat man anything to speak of, because he very likely billed it to his company, or took it off his taxes. Or, if his accountant was enterprising, both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller, who lived in a one-bedroom apartment in midtown Manhattan, had no lawn to mow. There was a tree in front of his building, planted and diligently maintained by the Parks Department, and its leaves fell in the fall, but no one needed to rake them. The wind was pretty good about blowing them away. Snow, when it didn’t melt of its own accord, was shoveled from the sidewalk by the building’s superintendent, who kept the elevator running and replaced burned-out bulbs in the hall fixtures and dealt with minor plumbing emergencies. Keller had a low-maintenance life, really. All he had to do was pay the rent on time and everything else got taken care of by other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe liked it that way. Even so, when his work took him away from home he found himself wondering. His fantasies, by and large, centered on simpler and more modest lifestyles. A cute little house in a subdivision, an undemanding job. A manageable life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat man’s house, in a swank suburban community north of Cincinnati, was neither cute nor little. Keller wasn’t too clear on what the fat man did, beyond the fact that it involved his playing host to a lot of visitors and spending a good deal of time in his car. He couldn’t say if the work was demanding, although he suspected it might be. Nor could he tell if the man’s life was manageable. What he did know, though, was that someone wanted to manage him right out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich, of course, was where Keller came in, and why he was sitting in an Avis car across the street from the fat man’s estate. And was it right to call it that? Where did you draw the line between a house and an estate? What was the yardstick, size or value? He thought about it, and decided it was probably some sort of combination of the two. A brownstone on East Sixty-sixth Street was just a house, not an estate, even if it was worth five or ten times as much as the fat man’s spread. On the other hand, a double-wide trailer could sit on fifteen or twenty acres of land without making the cut as an estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pondering the point when his wristwatch beeped, reminding him the security patrol was due in five minutes or so. He turned the key in the ignition, took a last wistful look at the fat man’s house (or estate) across the road, and pulled away from the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his motel room, Keller put on the television set and worked his way around the dial without leaving his chair. Lately, he’d noticed, most of the decent motels had remote controls for their TV sets. For a while there you’d get the remote bolted to the top of the bedside table, but that was only handy if you happened to be sitting up in bed watching. Otherwise it was a pain in the neck. If you had to get up and walk over to the bed to change the channel or mute the commercial, you might as well just walk over to the set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was to prevent theft, of course. A free-floating remote could float right into a guest’s suitcase, never to be seen again. Table lamps were bolted down in the same fashion, and television sets, too. But that was pretty much okay. You didn’t mind being unable to move the lamp around, or the TV. The remote was something else again. You might as well bolt down the towels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned off the set. It might be easy to change channels now, but it was harder than ever to find anything he wanted to see. He picked up a magazine, thumbed through it. This was his fourth night at this particular motel, and he still hadn’t figured out a good way to kill the fat man. There had to be a way, there was always a way, but he hadn’t found it yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose he had a house like the fat man’s. Generally he fantasized about houses he could afford to buy, lives he could imagine himself living. He had enough money salted away so that he could buy an unassuming house somewhere and pay cash for it, but he couldn’t even scrape up the down payment for a spread like the fat man’s. (Could you call it that-a spread? And what exactlywas a spread? How did it compare to an estate? Was the distinction geographical, with estates in the Northeast and spreads south and west?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, say he had the money, not just to swing the deal but to cover the upkeep as well. Say he won the lottery, say he could afford the gardener and a live-in maid and whatever else you had to have. Would he enjoy it, walking from room to room, admiring the paintings on the walls, luxuriating in the depth of the carpets? Would he like strolling in the garden, listening to the birds, smelling the flowers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNelson might like it, he thought. Romping on a lawn like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there for a moment, shaking his head. Then he switched chairs and reached for the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called his own number in New York, got his machine. “You. Have. Six. Messages,” it told him, and played them for him. The first five turned out to be wordless hangups. The sixth was a voice he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey there, E.T. Call home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made the call from a pay phone a quarter-mile down the highway. Dot answered, and her voice brightened when she recognized his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There you are,” she said. “I called and called.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was only the one message.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t want to leave one. I figured I’d tell What’s-her-name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ Andria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, and she’d pass the word to you when you called in. But she never picked up. She must be walking that dog of yours to the Bronx and back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I left a message, and here we are, chatting away like old friends. I don’t suppose you did what you went there to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not as quick and easy as it might be,” he said. “It’s taking time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Other words, our friend’s still got a pulse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or else he’s learned to walk around without one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” she said, “I’m glad to hear it. You know what I think you should do, Keller? I think you should check out of that motel and get on a plane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And come home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it in one, Keller, but then you were always quick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The client canceled?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not exactly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fly home,” she said, “and then catch a train to White Plains, and I’ll pour you a nice glass of iced tea. And I’ll explain all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t iced tea, it was lemonade. He sat in a wicker chair on the wraparound porch of the big house on Taunton Place sipping a big glass of it. Dot, wearing a blue and white housedress and a pair of white flip-flops, perched on the wooden railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just got those the day before yesterday,” she said, pointing. “Wind chimes. I was watching QVC and they caught me in a weak moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It could have been a Pocket Fisherman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It might as well be,” she said, “for all the breeze we’ve been getting. But how do you like this for coincidence, Keller? There you are, off doing a job in Cincinnati, and we get a call, another client with a job just down your street.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-25.html","bookId":2312,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM"}
