Conjuring up the dead relatives of Caesolian courtiers must only pay so much. It looks like Nigel supplements his income with a little blackmail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuentin was searching Nigel’s room, and doing a very efficient and professional job of it for a reformed thief. Someone had been staying in practice. He’d just discovered a compartment in the headboard of the bed containing a jumble of small boxes and papers. He took out a white stone box. The entire thing fit in the palm of his hand. It had been sealed with black wax, but the seal had been broken. Quentin opened the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world exploded. Or at least my corner of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself on all fours like I’d taken a giant fist to the gut. If there was any air in the alley, I couldn’t find it. My vision swam, and pain stabbed behind my eyes. I heard someone whimper. I think it was me. I pitched forward, my forehead landing in something I didn’t want to identify, its stench the only thing keeping me from passing out. I dimly felt Phaelan’s hands on my shoulders, lifting my face out of the muck. I was dizzy, nauseous, and had an urge to make my own contribution to the pile of scraps next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop,” I managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhaelan stopped lifting, but didn’t let go. I was grateful. I don’t think I could have stayed upright on my own. I raised my head slowly until my eyes were level with the street. I resisted the impulse to gulp air into my lungs. I took a few steady breaths. My vision began to clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Raine?” He sounded worried. That made two of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to answer, but my mouth was too busy breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about nodding, but decided against it. “Think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think Quentin just found what he was looking for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I was right. Sometimes I hate it when that happens. Quentin showed no signs of putting the whatever-it-was back in the box, and my head hurt too much to maintain contact with him until he did. Fine. I broke contact. He was on his own. I assumed he had done everything he came to do, and would be coming out soon. I sat back against the wall of the alley, watched the door where he had gone in, and concentrated on breathing. Breathing was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo alarms went off, no lamps were lit in the servants’ quarters or anywhere else in the house. The street was quiet. The few people who passed the alley with magical talent enough to see past my shields probably thought I was either drunk or had just been mugged. Either way, no one stopped to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s keeping him?” Phaelan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlass shattered. A lot of it. It sounded like it came from the back of Nigel’s house. This was followed by shouting. I recognized Quentin’s voice. It sounded like he had found his good friend Trouble, and they had made their own exit from Nigel’s bedroom. Phaelan helped me to my feet and then sprinted toward the back of the house. I ditched my cloak and followed as best I could. Considering how I felt, my idea of running more resembled a loping jog. No use worrying about waking the neighbors now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot surprisingly, Phaelan was the first to reach the back wall. He hoisted himself smoothly to the top and stopped, something my cousin rarely did. Phaelan only acknowledged one direction, and that was forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goblin shamans,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was unexpected. I heaved myself up beside him. As far as I was concerned, there were two types of goblin shamans—one good and one bad. These particular ones wore black robes lined in silver. Khrynsani. Quentin’s new acquaintances were the bad kind. Why wasn’t I surprised?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Khrynsani were an ancient goblin secret society and military order, with even more outdated political ideas. The Khrynsanic credo was simple. Goblins were meant to rule, and if anyone disagreed, they weren’t meant to live. Those who disagreed included every other race. Unfortunately, the minds behind the Khrynsani weren’t simple, or without influence. Some of the most powerful families of the goblin aristocracy were secret Khrynsani members. The new goblin king was a Khrynsani and proud of it. So it wouldn’t be long before the rest of the old blood nobility traded in their secret membership for openly fashionable affiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNigel hated all goblins, good or bad, so it was safe to say that these four weren’t invited houseguests. Then again, neither was Quentin. But there they all were on Nigel’s bedroom balcony. Quentin did the only thing a nonsorcerer and a human could do in his situation: he jumped. It wasn’t a bad distance. Not a good one, either. But it was survivable, and his chances were better than staying where he was. Fortunately, Nigel was fond of bushes. It gave Quentin something to flatten beside himself when he landed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shamans didn’t follow him, but four impeccably armed and armored goblins did. They effortlessly vaulted the railing and landed catlike on the ground below, missing the bushes entirely, covering the distance to the middle of the garden in about half the time as Quentin. The quartet obviously weren’t street thugs, and they had made no effort to conceal their uniforms. Khrynsani temple guards. When Quentin found trouble, he didn’t fool around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuentin was running toward the back wall, and us. He looked glad to see us. No surprise there. But the four goblins were gaining on him, and Quentin would never make it to the wall before they caught him. I swore and scrambled over the top, making a wobbly landing on the lawn below. Phaelan was right behind me. Quentin turned his back to us, leaving himself ample room to maneuver and drew a pair of long daggers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four goblins were larger and faster than I would have liked. But opponents, like family, were something you didn’t get the luxury of picking for yourself. Realizing that Quentin’s intention was to fight rather than escape, the goblins slowed, each leisurely drawing a scythelike saber. They saw Phaelan and me, but it didn’t seem to have a negative effect on their morale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoblins were generally tall, long limbed, and leanly muscled, like elves. This quartet was no exception. Their features were angular, their large eyes dark, and their upswept ears slightly more pronounced at the tip than elven ears. Their pale gray skin set off their most distinguishing feature—a pair of fangs that weren’t for decorative use only. Just because a goblin smiled at you didn’t mean he wanted to be friends. The danger didn’t detract from the race’s appeal—some would say it fueled it. I guess all that sinuous grace and exotic beauty can make you overlook a lot, and there were plenty of half-breed children running around to prove it. Some said that elves and goblins came from a common ancestor; a theory hotly denied by the old blood of both races.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe full moon provided more than ample light to fight by. I’m sure the goblins would try to maneuver us into the shadows of Nigel’s orchard. They could try, but the only place I was going was back over the wall when this was over. Not that I couldn’t see well in the dark, but goblins could see better. What looked pitch dark to an elf or human was as bright as day to a goblin, which of course meant the perfect time to cross blades with a goblin was high noon in full sun. I didn’t think the goblin who broke off from the group and was moving toward me would be willing to reschedule. Pity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fanned out to surround us. Two of the temple guards centered their attentions on Phaelan. Apparently they saw him as more of a threat. I don’t think he was flattered. The one who had chosen me for a dance partner grinned, exposing an alarmingly sharp pair of fangs. His face, framed by long, black hair, bore several scars. That told me he’d made mistakes in the past. Good. Hopefully I could help him make at least one more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe circled off and feinted a quick, stabbing attack. He wasn’t serious yet, and I didn’t take the bait. They didn’t intend to kill us quickly. As long as things stayed quiet, and their work uninterrupted, they would want to play first. I agreed with the silence, but I had no intention of being anyone’s evening entertainment. This toy had teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goblins wore tooled leather covered with a combination of blued-steel plate and scale armor. The single serpent of the Khrynsani insignia gleamed in vivid, red enamel over the heart. The etching in the steel made the armor look delicate, but I knew better. There were a few vulnerable points, but those were next to impossible to reach without getting yourself carved up in the process. Care and patience was called for here. Unfortunately, I wasn’t well known for either quality. I let my breath out slowly and willed myself to relax. Let the goblin make the first move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first cut came at my left side, near the ribs. It was meant to annoy and test my defenses, not inflict serious damage. I parried it with my dagger, but wasn’t lured into riposting. Not yet. The goblin was just out of my range, and I would have to completely turn my back on one of the two others circling Phaelan. I didn’t want to find out the hard way that goblins were willing to share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goblin’s grin dimmed. He lunged at my legs, but at the last instant flicked the blade’s point up toward my abdomen. I leapt back and managed to deflect the blade, but just barely. The goblin’s grin returned. He was playing again, but I wasn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI attacked, something he obviously didn’t expect. The temple guard retreated, but not fast enough. My rapier darted out, giving me just the reach I needed. Only the top inch of the blade penetrated, but it was enough. I struck where his armor buckled at the top of the leg near the groin. The goblin’s face blanched in pain and surprise, and a low hiss escaped from between his clenched teeth. His blade slashed down. He was aiming for my sword arm, but instead took a sizeable chunk out of one of Nigel’s prized rose bushes. I grabbed the falling branch in my gloved left hand, and lashed out with it. The hooked thorns raked furrows in the goblin’s unprotected face, and I was treated to language you wouldn’t expect he learned in the temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped back as the goblin’s blade sliced through the space I had just vacated. Pain and the sudden absence of his target threw him off balance, and I slipped the tip of my rapier under the section of armored scales connecting his chest and back plates. His forward momentum pushed the blade on through. A tug and a sharp twist of my wrist extracted my blade as the dead goblin slid to the ground. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-lost-trouble-found-raine-benares-1/page-3.html","bookId":1620,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:17 PM"}
