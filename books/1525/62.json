He simply guided her to a small staircase at the end of the hall. It was only six steps and led to a thick oak door banded in iron. A small crucifix etched in silver marked the door. Above the crucifix was a pair of crossed swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan remembered Henry remarking on such a symbol found on Friar de Almagro’s heraldic ring. She remembered its meaning. It was the mark of the Inquisition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNervousness became a clammy fear as Carlos backed her to the side at gunpoint and knocked on the door. His rap was clearly a code. A latch was slid open from inside, the grate of iron on wood loud in the empty, bare hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos stepped back as the door was swung open. Joan felt the heat of the next room flow out like the breath of a dragon. She was not allowed to back away. The 9mm Glock was pressed firmly into her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heavy figure, his bared chest gleaming with sweat, stood in the doorway. He had shrugged his monk’s robes from his shoulders and let it hang from his sashed belt. He ran a hand over his bald pate, which was also gleaming, and spoke in clipped Spanish. Carlos answered. The big monk nodded his head and waved them inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go,” Carlos ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith no other choice, Joan followed. The next room was something from old horror movies. To the left was a row of barred cells, straw-floored, with no beds. To the right was a wall upon which were hung neatly coiled chains. A row of leather whips hung from pegs. In the center of the room was a brazier, red hot with flickers of flames. Amid the glowing coals, three long iron poles were embedded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBranding irons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan glanced around the room. She was in a mock-up of a medieval dungeon. No, she corrected herself. She could smell a familiar scent. Something from her days at the emergency room. Blood and fear. This was no mock-up, no wax museum set. It was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why… why am I here?” Joan asked aloud, but in her heart she already knew the answer. Henry had made some mistake. As frightening as her surroundings were, Joan felt a twinge of worry for Henry. What had happened to him? She faced Carlos. “Am I to be punished?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” the friar said, his words as casual as if speaking of the weather. “You are to be killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan felt her knees weaken. The heat of the room suddenly sickened her. She could hardly breathe. “I… I don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you don’t need to,” Carlos answered. He nodded to the large monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing a pair of leather gloves, the thick man judged his irons. He pulled them from the coals and eyed their glowing tips. He pursed his lips, content, then spoke in Spanish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos raised his pistol. “Move to the far wall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan did not trust her legs. She glanced around the room, then back to Carlos. “Why all this? Why this way?” She weakly pointed at his gun. “You could have killed me in the room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos’s lips grew grimmer. He studied the tools of interrogation, the tools of the Inquisition, and answered, “We need the practice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stared down her rifle and squeezed the trigger. The pale face flew back, the mouth a bloody ruin. Pivoting on her toe, Maggie swung the barrel at her next target. The blasts of the Winchester had deafened her by now to the screeches and howls. She operated on instinct. She fired again, blowing back one of the pale scouts that had wandered too near. Its high-pitched squeal as it was set upon by its brethren managed finally to slice through her numb ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her rifle, wheezing between clenched teeth. The five beasts she had slain so far were at least keeping the throng momentarily occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething touched her shoulder. She butted the rifle’s stock at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa!” Sam yelled in her ear. “Hold on! It’s me!” He gripped her shoulder more firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie licked her dry lips, shaking slightly. “What are we going to do?” she moaned. The beasts still had them boxed in the center of the plaza and were not backing down. She had made no headway in blasting a path to freedom. For every creature she shot down, more would leap and scramble to fill the gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam released his grip. “I’ve been counting. You have only one more round left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie glanced at the rifle. “Jesus!” She raised the weapon. Her last shot had better be good. She forced her hands not to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam pushed her gun down. “Let me try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With what?” she hissed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his gold knife. “Remember the creatures at the necropolis?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sam, you’re gonna have to let them come damn close,” she argued, pulling the rifle free of his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe not.” Sam stepped in front of her. Taking off his Stetson, he lifted the gold dagger high and waved his hat with his other hand. He screamed a raw bellow of challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds of eyes lifted from their meals and growled back at Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Texan replaced his hat, leaving only the dagger held in an upthrust fist. The growls from the massed throats died down as gazes flicked to the gold knife. A trickle of whimpering sounded to one side. Sam seemed to have heard it, too. He swung toward the noise, the weak spot in the throng. He waved his dagger with long sweeping motions, repeating his bellow of anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall of pale forms began to pull back from him, breaking apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stick to my back,” Sam whispered at Maggie and Denal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie waved the naked boy ahead, then covered their rear with the Winchester. One bullet, she kept reminding herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam began a slow approach toward the throng, brandishing his dagger, jabbing, swiping, growling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith bleating cries, several of the beasts galloped out of his path. The standoff broke down. More and more of the beasts fled, dragging off the bloody chunks they had managed to scavenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s working,” Sam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, something lunged at Sam. Vestigial wings beat on its back, identifying it as one of the hunters. Sam stumbled back, tripping over Denal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie danced away, keeping her feet and swinging her rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was too slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam fell atop the boy as the creature leaped atop them. Denal screamed in terror. Sam shoved his only weapon up. The dagger. The screeching beast impaled itself on the blade. It seemed a small weapon compared to the hooked claws and shredding fangs of the attacker—but the effect was anything but small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tiny wings of the beast seemed suddenly to work. The creature appeared to fly straight up off Sam’s blade, squealing a noise that made even Maggie cringe. It rolled to the stones of the plaza and lay belly up. Small flames could be seen lancing from between the clawed fingers that clutched its wounded abdomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround them, the pale throng froze and became silent, eyes wide, unblinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flames spread from the beast’s belly. Like a wildfire in dry grass, the blaze blew through the creature. It arched and writhed; jaws stretched wide in a silent scream of agony. Flames shot out of its throat, flickering like some fiery tongue, and then its head was consumed. The creature’s bulk collapsed to the stone, dead. Flames still danced along its blackened form, a sick pyre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam and Denal were already on their feet. “Let’s go,” Sam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Texan threatened again with his dagger, but this time, there was no challenge. The remaining beasts in his path cleared out. Huddled in a tight group, they crossed toward the exit. All three held their breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie stared at the smoldering form of the attacker. Spontaneous combustion. She tried to add this piece to the growing puzzle. She shook her head. Now was not the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her attention forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam continued to threaten the few beasts who still hovered at the edges of their path. An especially large monster, all muscle and bone, still glared from one side. Its eyes were narrowed with wary hatred. Of all the creatures there, this one appeared well fed. It hunched on one knuckled fist, like some silverback gorilla, but naked and pale. Maggie recognized it as one of the rare “leaders” of the pack. She noticed it lacked any external genitalia. Like Pachacutec’s body, she realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Maggie’s eyes twitched as a horrible realization began to dawn. She was so shocked that she failed to notice what the hulking beast held in its other clawed fist. “Sam!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature swung his arm and threw a boulder the size of a ripe pumpkin at the Texan. Sam glanced over but could not move in time. The chunk of granite struck Sam’s fist. The dagger flew from his grip. It landed in the middle of a clutch of the beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant stone-thrower roared in triumph, raising on its legs and striking its barreled chest with one of its gnarled fists. Its triumphant bellow was echoed by others all across the plaza. Without the dagger, they had no defense now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie raised her rifle toward the howling gorilla. “Shut up, asshole!” She pulled the trigger, and the monster fell backward, crashing to the stones. Its legs tremored in death throes for a breath, then grew still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the echoes of her rifle blast died down, silence returned to the plaza. No one moved. With the death of the leader, the pack was momentarily cowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Maggie hissed, “Sam, that was my last shell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I’d say we’ve overstayed our welcome here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if hearing him, the creatures began to creep slowly toward them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Texan turned to Denal. “How fast can you run?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just watch me!” Denal flew down the empty street ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam and Maggie took off after the boy, racing together through the fouled village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngry screeches and hungry howls erupted behind them. The chase was on. With the prey on the run, the pack abandoned their wariness. Bloodlust overcame fear. Scouts ran along neighboring streets, white blurs between homes, tracking them. Behind them, hunters gave chase, howling their challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie struggled to keep up with Sam, fighting to get the Winchester over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave it,” Sam yelled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam slowed and grabbed the rifle from her. He whipped it over his head and threw it behind them. The prized Winchester clattered and skittered across the rock. “I’d rather save you, than a damned rusted rifle.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/excavation/page-62.html","bookId":1525,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM"}
