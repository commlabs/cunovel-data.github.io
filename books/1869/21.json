I connect with friends I\u0027ve not spoken to since my mother\u0027s arrest. I meet new guys and have the occasional one night stand. None of them are nothing like him, but I\u0027m glad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no physical or emotional binds with the guys I fuck once or twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I start getting clients. Personal shopper. Wardrobe consultant for music videos - country music but I\u0027ll take it because I absolutely adore my work. And every time someone hires me, I\u0027m told Kylie Wolfe referred them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got to give it to her, she\u0027s good for business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI speak to Tori every day, and I make it a point to contact Kylie at least once a week, either by phone or instant message. She asks me a million questions about work, Gram, and even Seth. I ask her about the guy she\u0027s been seeing - someone she met at an award show after party and why she picked her new hair color. It\u0027s fire engine red and white blonde now and I absolutely loathe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs when I tell her outright she looks like a Spice Girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot once does she mention Lucas and I don\u0027t ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, in the middle of July on a sticky night where Gram has gone to play Bingo, Kylie texts me at five minutes \u0027til nine, telling me to turn on my TV. Gives me the exact channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a music video station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a banner running across the bottom, advertising Lucas Wolfe\u0027s solo video premiere. My phone vibrates in my hand. I look down at it to find another text from Kylie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust . . . watch the damn video. Pretty please for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of those moments where I seriously consider changing my phone number again, but I roll my eyes and slide down in my grandmother\u0027s recliner. I place my cell phone on the coffee table. The video begins at exactly 9pm, and it\u0027s different from any Your Toxic Sequel video - almost poetic. Lucas is sitting on a stool, blindfolded. Instead of lip synching along to the music, he\u0027s holding up giant flash cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes me a few moments to realize the song, a moody, sexy ballad called \"10 Days\" uses the background music Lucas and I wrote together on the night he bent me over the piano. It takes me an additional couple seconds - because the sudden wetness in my thin cotton panties is a distraction - to comprehend that the words on the cards aren\u0027t words at all, but numbers that count down from 10 to 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, I finally understand that the cards he\u0027s holding up every two or three lines indicate a message within the song meant exclusively for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s an outrageous, Lucas-eque way of getting in touch with me. Keeping absolutely silent, I listen to the rest of the song, mentally repeating each line that contains a piece of the puzzle. And as the music pulses in my ears, I feel a thousand silk ribbons wrap around my heart and squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8. But you\u0027re probably saying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7. fuck me right now because I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. screwed you when you wanted to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. trust me. You\u0027ve still got two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. days left, so I\u0027m giving you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. the honest truth, saying sorry, making it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Just . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pit of my stomach aches with the familiar pang of longing and fear as I wait for him to hold up the final card, the missing piece of the message. That old, weak part of me tells me that I should turn off this video now; that I should I should forget Lucas because all he\u0027ll cause me is more hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell that part of me to shut the fuck up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m breathless when the music ends and then Lucas pulls down the blindfold and holds up the last flashcard to nothing but silence. Then, my front door is shaking. Someone drums hard on the wood, the tempo as fast as my heartbeat. Suddenly, I\u0027ve got this vivid image of the day in court months ago - how Lucas had drummed his long fingers on the table in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas pulls me into his arms the moment I open the door, closing his arms around me. I bury my face into his shoulder as he says finishes the song. \"Say that what happened isn\u0027t it for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t care about Sam or the skeletons in his closet because it\u0027s all shit that can be overcome. I only know that he\u0027s here. Holding me. Touching me. Devouring me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red ribbons constricting my heart slowly unravel, fall to the ground. Free me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not . . . Sir.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-21.html","bookId":1869,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:50 PM"}
