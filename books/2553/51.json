Boss say, Faster, faster! Beece cut fast as can. Still boss yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeece ver hot. Thirsty. Go sink for drink. Drink quick \u0027cause sink next boss office.

We have a different mandate, and at the moment we\u0027re looking for a lost sim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeece almost leave sink, now stay. Lost sim? Could be Meerm? Listen more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got all mine. I count \u0027em every morning. None missing, no extras.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. But from past experience we know that lost sims tend to seek out other sims, so we\u0027d greatly appreciate it if you\u0027d keep your eye out for any sim that might wander in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoss laugh. \"He does, I\u0027ll put him to work!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a female and if she shows up you should isolate her immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She may be sick.

I can barely make production quotas now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she shows she may look a little different than the average sim and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different? What is she, a new breed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Same as the rest, but she might look a little heavier...perhaps \u0027bloated\u0027 is a better term. She\u0027s sick and we can take care of her, but we have to find her first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeerm! Man talk about Meerm! Meerm sick but fraid doctor. Beece feel sorry Meerm.

He look Beece. \"Do you know something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sick sim come home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home?

Why so far?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s tons cheaper to bus them back and forth than rent space for them around here. Sorry if that\u0027s out of your jurisdiction, pal, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t you worry about that. Just give me the address of this place.
