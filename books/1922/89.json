Angus dropped us off at the curb and we headed inside. The place was hopping and the locker room crowded. I changed and stowed my stuff; then met Gideon in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved at Daniel, the trainer who\u0027d talked to me on my first visit to CrossTrainer, and got a smack on the ass for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I protested, swatting at Gideon\u0027s chastising hand. \"Cut it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tugged my ponytail and gently urged my head back, tilting my mouth up so he could mark his territory with a deep, lush kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he pulled my hair sent electricity sweeping across my skin. \"If this is your idea of a deterrent,\" I whispered against his lips, \"I have to say it\u0027s much more of an incentive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m quite willing to take it up a notch.\" He nipped my lower lip with his teeth. \"But I wouldn\u0027t suggest testing my limits that way, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I have other ways to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon hit the treadmill first, affording me the pleasure of seeing his body glistening with sweat...in public. As often as I saw him that way in private, it never ceased to be a major turn-on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd God, I loved the way he looked with his hair tied back. And the flex of his muscles beneath lightly tanned skin. And the graceful power of his movements. Seeing such an elegantly urbane man shed the suits and show off his animal side hit all my hot buttons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t stop staring and was happy I didn\u0027t have to. He was mine, after all; a fact that sent warm pleasure sliding through me. Besides, every other woman in the gym was checking him out, too. As he moved from station to station, dozens of admiring eyes followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he caught me ogling, I shot him a suggestive glance and ran my tongue along my lower lip. His arched brow and rueful half-smile made me tingly. I couldn\u0027t remember the last time I\u0027d been so motivated while working out. An hour and a half just flew by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we got back in the Bentley and headed to the penthouse, I was squirming in my seat. My gaze slid repeatedly to Gideon in silent invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe linked his fingers with mine. \"You\u0027ll wait for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat pronouncement startled me. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard me.\" He kissed my fingers and had the nerve to give me a wicked smile. \"Delayed gratification, angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would we do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think of how crazed we\u0027ll be for each other after dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned closer so Angus didn\u0027t overhear me, although I knew he was professional enough to ignore us. \"That\u0027s a given, waiting or not. I say we go with not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he wouldn\u0027t budge. Instead, he tortured us both. Having us undress one another for a steamy shower, our hands petting and caressing the curves and hollows of each other\u0027s bodies; then dressing for dinner. He went all out in black tie, but skipped the tie. His crisp white shirt was unbuttoned at the collar, revealing a flash of skin. The cocktail dress he selected for me was a champagne silk Vera Wang with a strapless bustier bodice, an open back, and a tiered skirt that ended a few inches above my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled when I saw it, knowing it was going to drive him nuts seeing me in that dress all night. It was gorgeous and I loved it, but it was a style meant for tall, slender models, not short curvy girls. In a pitiful bid for modesty, I left my hair down to hang over my br**sts, but it didn\u0027t help much if Gideon\u0027s expression was any indication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, Eva.\" He adjusted himself in his slacks. \"I\u0027ve changed my mind about that dress. You shouldn\u0027t wear it in public.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have time for you to change your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought there was more material than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged with a grin. \"What can I say? You bought it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m having second thoughts. How long could it possibly take to remove it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding my tongue along my lower lip, I said, \"I don\u0027t know. Why don\u0027t you find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes turned dark. \"We\u0027d never get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t complain.\" He looked so damn hot and I wanted him - as always - really damned bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t there a jacket or something you can put over that? A parka, maybe? Or a trench coat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, I grabbed my clutch off the dresser and wrapped my arm around his. \"Don\u0027t worry. Everyone will be too busy checking you out to even bother noticing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled as I tugged him out of the bedroom. \"Seriously. Have your tits gotten bigger? They\u0027re spilling out over the top of that thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m twenty-four years old, Gideon,\" I said dryly. \"I stopped developing years ago. What you see is what you get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I\u0027m the only one who\u0027s supposed to be seeing, since I\u0027m the only one who\u0027s allowed to be getting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe moved into the living room. In the short time it took us to pass through to the foyer, I relished the quiet beauty of Gideon\u0027s home. I loved how warm and inviting it was. The old world charm of the decor was so elegant, yet it was also remarkably comfortable. The stunning view out of the arched windows complemented the interior, but didn\u0027t distract from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mixture of dark woods, distressed stone, warm colors, and vivid jeweled accents was clearly expensive, as was the art hung on the walls, but it was a tasteful display of wealth. I couldn\u0027t imagine anyone feeling awkward about what to touch or where to sit. It just wasn\u0027t that kind of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe caught the private elevator and Gideon faced me as the doors closed. He immediately tried tugging my bodice up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re not careful,\" I warned, \"you\u0027ll expose my crotch instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-89.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
