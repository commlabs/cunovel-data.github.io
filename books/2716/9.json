That is such a relief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hailey was about to report Jay for being a vampire,” I say, giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was nervous!” Hailey cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz raises an eyebrow. “You think Jay is a vampire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not anymore,” she says. “Although he does kind of look like a vampire. Don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does a vampire look like exactly?” I ask, still giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know. Pale skin. Dark hair. Brooding eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz smiles. “Sounds sexy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vampires are sexy,” Hailey admits. “Brad Pitt? Sexy. Angel? Sexy. Edward? Super sexy. I would totally do it with a vampire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz pokes me. “Speaking of doing it…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tonight is your last chance,” she continues. “You are going to find your vampire boyfriend and tie him down until you’ve done it. Enough is enough. Got it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it,” I say, pounding my fists against the lounge’s handles. “Tonight is the night. No idea what I’m going to say to him but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you have to talk to him at all?” She wiggles her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get your mind out of the gutter.” I laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just try to get yours in the gutter, where it belongs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She has to say something to him,” Hailey says. “She can’t just start making out with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I very much doubt he would mind that,” Liz says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why you’re going to waste your virginity on him anyway,” Hailey says. “Sure he’s cute, but he seems like a jerk. In all likelihood he hooked up with at least two other girls in three days. He doesn’t sound like a catch. He sounds like a player.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz waves Hailey’s words away. “Players are the best choices. Trust me. He’s the one. You’ll have a lot more fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. I know she’s right. “So what should I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be fearless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do what you want,” Hailey says. “But if I were you I’d shy away from hickeys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I see him at the bar, I know the time is right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s sitting by himself. Waiting. For me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, fine, probably not for me, but he’s alone, isn’t he? Good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHailey and Liz are in our room. Liz told Hailey she could borrow an outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI square my shoulders and take a deep breath. I can do this. I can do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” I say, my heart pounding. “Can I buy you a drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me a gleaming smile. “You want to buy me a drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I offered, didn’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It must be my lucky night,” he says, eyes twinkling. Omigod, he smells amazing. Musky and salty and absolutely delicious. I knew he would!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s definitely your lucky night,” I say, my cheeks burning. I can’t believe I just said that. I wave the bartender over. “What would you like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Bloody Mary,” he says, and smiles at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally? People actually drink that? Liz would laugh out loud. Who knows, maybe it’s good. “I’ll have one too,” I tell the bartender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jay,” he says, and gulps down the drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I know,” I say brazenly. “I mean, nice to meet you. I’m Kristin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. Should I have told him my real name? Does it really matter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since it’s my lucky day, maybe we should hit the tables,” he says. His teeth are tinged red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe does look a little like a vampire. Not that he is. Of course he isn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart starts pounding. Can I really do this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could,” I say, and lean in toward him so he can see just a little bit down the top of my shirt. Hello, fearless me. “Or maybe you want to get out of here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes light up like candles. “Seriously?” He grins. “Yeah, I’m up for that. Wanna check out my room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a roommate?” I ask, my heart thumping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. But I have a balcony.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds good,” I say, downing the rest of my drink for liquid courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes my hand. “Come with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere we go! I did it! Okay, I didn’t do it yet, but I am in the ready position. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacations-from-hell/page-9.html","bookId":2716,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM"}
