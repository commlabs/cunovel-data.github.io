I got Nadia and her friends to do the scavenger hunt, and I got the drama kids to do a campfire story hour, but I still need judges for the costume contest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there’s the face-painting booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since freshman year, Rennie and I have manned the facepainting booth. We’d paint butterflies and stars and tiger stripes on the little kids’ faces. It was our thing. I think it will be a perfect opportunity for us to talk, away from Ashlin and Reeve and everybody else. Just me and Rennie, like it used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and say to her, “We’re still doing the face-painting booth, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRennie scrunches her face up. “I don’t think I can. Sorry.” Except she doesn’t look sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s okay,” I say. But it’s not. It’s far from okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need time to get into my costume. Fall Fest is at what, five? And over at eight? There won’t be enough time, even if I rush home after school.” Rennie shrugs. “Plus, some of us are going to pregame at Ash’s before we head over to the haunted maze.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? Everybody’s pregaming at Ashlin’s and nobody told me about it? I whip my head around to look at Ash, who’s suddenly preoccupied with her salad. “Does this mean you can’t do the dunk booth with Derek?” I demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair hanging in her face, she says softly, “No . . . sorry, Lil. Ren scored some spicy rum from her job, and she found this yum cocktail we can make with it and apple cider. You should come too!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How am I going to do that?” I cry out. “I’m supposed to run this thing, and you guys said you’d help me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so, so sorry,” Ashlin says, her eyes fluttery and regretful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the end of the table Alex says, “Lil, I’ll be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Alex,” I say. In a louder voice I say, “It’s nice to know that I can count on somebody.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlin pouts at me. “Forgive me, Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore her and cast a spiteful look in Reeve’s direction. For the past three years he’s come to Fall Fest dressed up like Jason in Friday the 13th. Back when we were freshmen the senior girls asked him to do it, and it became kind of a Jar Island tradition. Reeve wears a white hockey mask and chases the kids around with a chain saw. The kids love it. They love him. I’ve asked him repeatedly, but he won’t do it. Fine, he is on crutches, but he could at least show up in the costume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If Fall Fest sucks this year, it’s on us,” I warn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean it’s on you,” Reeve corrects me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at him. “It’s on all of us. Including and especially you. You know how much the kids love your Jason routine. I don’t get why you can’t at least—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s not to get?” Reeve snaps, pointing at his crutches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is he supposed to run around the gym chasing after kids on crutches?” Rennie asks, and then lets out a groan. “I mean, hello!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a shaky voice I protest, “He exercises, like, every day!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRennie leans over Reeve to say, “Yeah, in the pool and in the weight room! He can’t put weight on his leg, Lillia. Don’t talk about things you don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve puts his hand on Rennie’s shoulder and she relaxes back in her seat, shaking her head in disgust. Then she turns away from me and starts talking about her costume again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when it hits me. Rennie did this on purpose. She made it so no one would help me, so I’d be all alone. She convinced Ashlin to have people over when she knew I couldn’t make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally understand what’s been staring me in the face. Rennie doesn’t want to be my friend anymore. She is officially through with me. And if Rennie’s through with me, she’s going to make damn sure that everybody else is too. How many times have I seen her do this exact same thing? Ice somebody out of the group because they pissed her off in some way? I’ve seen it happen, and I’ve stood by and said nothing, because I was afraid, and it was easy. Never ever did I think it would be me on the receiving end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex is looking around the table in disbelief. “Are you guys serious? We can’t help Lil out for one night?” When nobody answers, he tosses his fork down on his tray. “You guys suck. Lil, what can I do? Tell me what you need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping my head down, I gather my stuff together as quickly as possible. Quietly I say to Alex, “If you have time this weekend, will you come over and help me put some candy bags together for the prizes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nods. “I’ll come over tonight, straight from practice.” He says it really loud, and gives everyone else a look. He turns back to me and grins. “But don’t worry, I’ll shower first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes a lot of effort to smile back, but I do. “You better,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I sneak out to the parking lot and cry in my car. So this is how it all ends, after everything Rennie and I have been through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia, Alex, and I have an assembly line set up in the dining room. Nadia is Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups and Sour Patch Kids and Snickers; Alex is FireBalls, Lemonheads, and Starbursts; I’m Nerds and lollipops, plus I tie the ribbon onto the bag in a bow. It’s the most boring Friday night ever, but I couldn’t be happier this task is getting done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold one up for inspection. “Does this one seem a little light on sweets to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alex didn’t put enough FireBalls in,” Nadia tattletales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Snitch,” he says, poking her in the side. “It’s fine. I’m doing the kid a favor, less cavities. Besides, you already tied the ribbon, Lil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I know.” I bite my lip, weighing the bag in my hand. “I don’t want the kids to feel cheated out of anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we should open up the Starburst packs to make the bags look fuller,” Nadia suggests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clap my hands together. “Perfect!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex gives her a high five and Nadia grins at both of us. “Alex, you be in charge of that,” I tell him, and he salutes me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I talked to my mom, and she said she was going to call Joy tonight,” Alex says, carefully opening up a candy bag. His hair is still wet from his shower. He really did come right over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s Joy?” Nadia wants to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s one of the owners of Milky Morning,” Alex tells her. “My mom knows her from book club. She says she can get her to donate as many cupcakes as you need.” He hands me another bag. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fire-with-fire-burn-for-burn-2/page-16.html","bookId":2727,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:21:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:21:33 PM"}
