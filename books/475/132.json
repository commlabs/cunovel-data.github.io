You have made your request of God, but the answer does not come. What are you to do?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eKeep on believing God\u0027s Word; never be moved away from it by what you see or feel, and thus as you stand steady, enlarged power and experience is being developed. The fact of looking at the apparent contradiction as to God\u0027s Word and being unmoved from your position of faith make you stronger on every other line.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOften God delays purposely, and the delay is just as much an answer to your prayer as is the fulfillment when it comes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the lives of all the great Bible characters, God worked thus. Abraham, Moses and Elijah were not great in the beginning, but were made great through the discipline of their faith, and only thus were they fitted for the positions to which God had called them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor example, in the case of Joseph whom the Lord was training for the throne of Egypt, we read in the Psalms:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The word of the Lord tried him.\" It was not the prison life with its hard beds or poor food that tried him, but it was the word God had spoken into his heart in the early years concerning elevation and honor which were greater than his brethren were to receive; it was this which was ever before him, when every step in his career made it seem more and more impossible of fulfillment, until he was there imprisoned, and all in innocency, while others who were perhaps justly incarcerated, were released, and he was left to languish alone.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThese were hours that tried his soul, but hours of spiritual growth and development, that, \"when his word came\" (the word of release), found him fitted for the delicate task of dealing with his wayward brethren, with a love and patience only surpassed by God Himself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo amount of persecution tries like such experiences as these. When God has spoken of His purpose to do, and yet the days go on and He does not do it, that is truly hard; but it is a discipline of faith that will bring us into a knowledge of God which would otherwise be impossible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　 五月十二日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“在信的人，凡事都能”（可九：23）。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　许多合理的祈求，有时被神故意延搁，原因是为了神要教导我们信心的功课。在信心大学中有许多必修课：信心的试验，信心的实习，信心的忍耐，信心的毅力，信心的得胜，等等。这些都是要花许多时间去学习的。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　人的坚韧性，是从信心训练中发展出来的。如果你向神祈求了，可是答应并不来临。你怎样呢？\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　继续相信神的话；不要因眼见或感觉摇动；在你这样站牢的时候，你的能力和经验都会增长的。即使你看到了对神的应许似乎发生了矛盾，你仍要丝毫不移动你的信心与立场，那是可以增加你的坚强。神往往故意迟延，这迟延就是对你的祷告的答复的一种，到你的所求实现的时候，其功效则并无二样。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　圣经中的伟人——亚伯拉罕，摩西，以利亚等——并非开始就是伟人，都是受过信心的训练以后，才能胜任神所为他们安排的地位的。姑以约瑟为例。诗篇一百零五篇十九节说：“耶和华的话试炼他”。试炼他的，并不是囚犯生活的苦楚，乃是早年神在梦中应许他的话——他将比他的哥哥们更高贵；这句话常在他面前；按照他一生的经历，这个应许的实现似乎是不可能了——现在他孤孤单单地被囚在牢狱里，受着冤枉；别人应该下狱的，倒得了释放。他在监中不知祈求过多少次：求神使他恢复自由，可是神故意把他的祈求延搁，好使他在绝望中多学习信心的功课。等到他的灵性长进了，“他所说的应验了”（诗一〇五：19），神看他有爱心和忍耐对付他的哥哥们了，神就把他放在首相的地位上。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　这样的经历是非常难受的。当神宣布了他的心意以后，过了好久，仍不实现，这实在是非常难忍的事情；但是这就是信心的训练，这训练能使我们更认识神。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“你们的信心既被实验，就比那被火试验，仍然能坏的金子，更显宝贵”（彼前一：7）。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5121.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:42:43 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:42:43 AM"}
