{"id":21303,"no":52,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"On reaching Odiam, Reuben did not go into the kitchen where his children were gathered, expectant and curious. He went straight upstairs. Caro, who caught a glimpse of him in the passage, ran away in terror—he looked so dreadful, his face all dabbled with blood and yolk of egg.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He went up to Albert\u0027s room. He had furiously given Ditch the lie in the Courthouse, but he had never trusted his son, and the accusation had poured over him a flood of shame which could be quelled only by its proof or its refutation. If Albert\u0027s guilt were proved—which Reuben, now bathing in this luminous shame, saw was quite probable—then he knew what to do to clean the smirch off Odiam; if, on the other hand, his innocence were established, then he would punish those swine who threw mud at him and his farm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Albert slept in one of the attics with Jemmy and Pete. Reuben had no intention of meeting him till he had something to confront him with, for he was pretty sure that the boy would lie to him. He began turning the room topsy-turvy, and had soon found in a drawer a[Pg 186] heap of papers scrawled over with writing. It was unlucky that he could not read, for he could not even tell whether the handwriting were Albert\u0027s—these might be some letters he had received. Suddenly, however, a word caught his eye which he had seen a hundred times on hoardings, letters, bills, and other documents—MacKinnon. He could trace it out quite clearly. What had Albert to do with MacKinnon? Reuben clenched the papers together in his fist, and went downstairs to the kitchen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Albert was not there. All the better! Reuben strode up to Tilly, unaware of how terrible he looked with the traces of his battle not yet washed from his face, and banged the papers down in front of her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot\u0027s all this?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tilly was frightened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s—it\u0027s only poetry, f?ather.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Read me some of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s only Albert\u0027s.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s why I want to hear wot it\u0027s about. You read it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tilly began to read in a faltering voice:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you\u0027d know what the Colonel is, pray travel over\n\u003cbr\u003e The Sluice at Scott\u0027s Float—and then drive on to Dover—\n\u003cbr\u003e You\u0027ll find yourself quickly brought up by a Gate....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben struck his fist on the table, and she dropped the paper with a little cry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s true, then! Oh Lard! it\u0027s true!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot, f?ather?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Them\u0027s Albert\u0027s verses right enough?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, f?ather, but——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fetch him here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tilly was more frightened than ever. She had never heard anything about the great Gate controversy, and could not understand why Reuben was so angry with Albert. The verses seemed to her quite harmless, they[Pg 187] were not even about love. However, she could not disobey her father, so she ran and fetched Albert out of the corn-chamber, begging him to be careful what he said, \"fur f?ather\u0027s unaccountable vrothered to-night about something.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How did the Election go?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I never asked.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, you gals! Well, I expect that\u0027s wot\u0027s the matter. The Liberal\u0027s got in.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But why should that m?ake f?ather angry wud you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Albert stuck out his chest and looked important, as he invariably did before an encounter with Reuben, in spite of the fact that these always ended most ingloriously as far as he was concerned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s bin reading some poetry of yours, Bertie,\" continued his sister, \"and he\u0027s justabout dreadful, all his cl?athes tore about, and a nasty mess of blood and yaller stuff on his face.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Albert suddenly began to look uneasy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh Lard! perhaps I\u0027d better bolt fur it.—No, I\u0027ll square him out. You\u0027ll stand by me, Tilly?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, but d?an\u0027t m?ake him angry—he might beat you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bertie\u0027s pride was wounded by this suggestion, which was, however, soundly based on precedent, and he entered the kitchen with something very like a swagger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben was standing by the table, erect, and somehow dignified in spite of the mess he was in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well,\" he said slowly, \"well—MacKinnon\u0027s hound!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Albert saw the heap of scribbled paper on the table, and blenched.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben walked up to him, took him by the shoulders, and shook him as a dog might shake a rabbit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You hemmed, scummy, lousy Radical!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Albert could not speak, for he felt as if his brains and teeth were rattling about inside his head. The rest of[Pg 188] the family hunched together by the door, the boys gaping idiotically, the girls in tears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, wot\u0027ve you got to say fur yourself before I kick you round the table?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll write wot I please, surelye,\" growled Albert, trying rather unsuccessfully to resume his swagger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, will you! Well, there\u0027ll be naun to prevent you when you\u0027re out of this house—and out you go to-night; I\u0027ll have no Radical hogs on my farm.

You\u0027ve allus treated me lik a dog, and laughed at my writing and all I wanted to do.
