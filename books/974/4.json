{"id":40383,"no":4,"title":"SHAY","content":"The siren faded behind her. It seemed like forever—or onlyseconds—that Tally fell, the gaping faces below becominglarger and larger.\n\u003cbr\u003e The ground hurtled toward her, a space opening in thepanicking crowd where she was going to hit. For a fewmoments it was just like a flying dream, silent and wonderful.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then reality jerked at her shoulders and thighs, thewebbing of the jacket cutting viciously into her. She wastaller than pretty standard, she knew; the jacket probablywasn’t expecting this much weight.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally somersaulted in the air, turning headfirst for a fewterrifying moments, her face passing low enough to spot adiscarded bottle cap in the grass. Then she found herselfshooting upward again, completing the circle, so that thesky wheeled above her, then over and downward again,more crowd parting in front.\n\u003cbr\u003e Perfect. She had pushed off hard enough that she wasbouncing down the hill away from Garbo Mansion, the jacketcarrying her toward the darkness and safety of the gardens.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally spun head over heels twice more, and then the jacketlowered her to the grass. She pulled randomly at straps untilthe garment made a hissing sound and dropped to the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e Her dizziness took a moment to clear as she tried tosort up from down.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Isn’t she . . . ugly?” someone asked from the edge ofthe crowd.\n\u003cbr\u003e The black shapes of two firefighting hovercars zoomedpast overhead, red lights flashing and sirens piercing her ears.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Great idea, Peris,” she muttered. “A false alarm.” Shewould really be in trouble if they caught her now. She’dnever even heard of anyone doing anything this bad.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally ran toward the garden.\n\u003cbr\u003e The darkness below the willows was comforting.\n\u003cbr\u003e Down here, halfway to the river, Tally could barely tellthere was a full-scale fire alert in the middle of town. Butshe could see that a search was underway. More hovercarswere in the air than usual, and the river seemed to be lit upextra bright. Maybe that was just a coincidence.\n\u003cbr\u003e But probably not.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally made her way carefully through the trees. It waslater than she and Peris had ever stayed over in New PrettyTown. The pleasure gardens were more crowded, especiallythe dark parts. And now that the excitement of her escapehad worn off, Tally was beginning to realize how stupid thewhole idea had been.\n\u003cbr\u003e 24 Scott WesterfeldOf course Peris didn’t have the scar anymore. The two ofthem had only used a penknife when they’d cut themselvesand held hands. The doctors used much sharper and biggerknives in the operation. They rubbed you raw, and you grewall new skin, perfect and clear. The old marks of accidents andbad food and childhood illnesses all washed away. A clean start.\n\u003cbr\u003e But Tally had ruined Peris’s starting over—showing uplike some pesky littlie who’s not wanted, and leaving him withthe bad taste of ugly in his mouth, not to mention coveredwith mud. She hoped he had another vest to change into.\n\u003cbr\u003e At least Peris hadn’t seemed too angry. He’d said they’dbe best friends again, once she was pretty. But the way he’dlooked at her face . . . maybe that was why they separateduglies from pretties. It must be horrible to see an ugly facewhen you’re surrounded by such beautiful people all thetime. What if she’d ruined everything tonight, and Periswould always see her like this—squinty eyes and frizzyhair—even after she had the operation?\n\u003cbr\u003e A hovercar passed overhead, and Tally ducked. She wasprobably going to get caught tonight, and never be turnedpretty at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e She deserved it for being so stupid.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally reminded herself of her promise to Peris. She wasnot going to get caught; she had to become pretty for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e A light flashed in the corner of her vision. Tally crouchedand peered through the hanging willow leaves.\n\u003cbr\u003e A safety warden was in the park. She was a middleUGLIES 25pretty, not a new one. In the firelight, the handsome featuresof the second operation were obvious: broad shouldersand a firm jaw, a sharp nose and high cheekbones. Thewoman carried the same unquestionable authority as Tally’steachers back in Uglyville.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally swallowed. New pretties had their own wardens.\n\u003cbr\u003e There was only one reason why a middle pretty would behere in New Pretty Town: The wardens were looking forsomeone, and they were serious about finding him or her.\n\u003cbr\u003e The woman flashed her light at a couple on a bench, illuminatingthem for the split second it took to confirm that theywere pretty. The couple jumped, but the warden chuckled andapologized. Tally could hear her low, sure voice, and saw thenew pretties relax. Everything had to be okay if she said it was.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally felt herself wanting to give up, to throw herself onthe wise mercy of the warden. If she just explained, thewarden would understand and fix everything. Middle prettiesalways knew what to do.\n\u003cbr\u003e But she had promised Peris.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally pulled back into the darkness, trying to ignorethe horrible feeling that she was a spy, a sneak, for notsurrendering to the woman’s authority. She moved throughthe brush as fast as she could.\n\u003cbr\u003e Close to the river, Tally heard a noise in front of her. A darkform was outlined in river lights before her. Not a couple, alone figure in the dark.\n\u003cbr\u003e 26 Scott WesterfeldIt had to be a warden, waiting for her in the brush.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally hardly dared breathe. She had frozen in midcrawl,her weight all poised on one knee and one muddy hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e The warden hadn’t seen her yet. If Tally waited long enough,maybe the warden would move on.\n\u003cbr\u003e She waited, motionless, for endless minutes. The figuredidn’t budge. They must know that the gardens were theonly dark way in and out of New Pretty Town.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally’s arm started to shake, the muscles complainingabout staying frozen for so long. But she didn’t dare let herweight settle onto the other arm. The snap of a single twigwould give her away.\n\u003cbr\u003e She held herself still, until all her muscles were screaming.\n\u003cbr\u003e Maybe the warden was just a trick of the light. Maybethis was all in her imagination.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally blinked, trying to make the figure disappear.\n\u003cbr\u003e But it was still there, clearly outlined by the ripplinglights of the river.\n\u003cbr\u003e A twig popped under her knee—Tally’s aching muscleshad finally betrayed her. But the figure still didn’t move. Heor she must have heard. . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e The warden was being kind, waiting for her to give herselfup. Letting her surrender. The teachers did that at school,sometimes. Made you realize that you couldn’t escape, untilyou confessed everything.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally cleared her throat. A small, pathetic sound. “I’msorry,” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e UGLIES 27The figure let out a sigh. “Oh, phew. Hey, that’s okay. Imust have scared you, too.” The girl leaned forward, grimacingas if she was also sore from remaining still so long.\n\u003cbr\u003e Her face caught the light.\n\u003cbr\u003e She was ugly too.\n\u003cbr\u003e Her name was Shay. She had long dark hair in pigtails, andher eyes were too wide apart. Her lips were full enough, butshe was even skinnier than a new pretty. She’d come overto New Pretty Town on her own expedition, and had beenhiding here by the river for an hour. “I’ve never seen anythinglike this,” she whispered. “There’s wardens and hovercarseverywhere!”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally cleared her throat. “I think it’s my fault.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay looked dubious. “How’d you manage that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, I was up in the middle of town, at a party.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “You crashed a party? That’s crazy!” Shay said, thenlowered her voice back to a whisper. “Crazy, but awesome.\n\u003cbr\u003e How’d you get in?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I was wearing a mask.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Wow. A pretty mask?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Uh, more like a pig mask. It’s a long story.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay blinked. “A pig mask. Okay. So let me guess,someone blew your house down?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Huh? No. I was about to get caught, so I kind of . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e set off a fire alarm.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Nice trick!”\n\u003cbr\u003e 28 Scott WesterfeldTally smiled. It was actually a pretty good story, nowthat she had someone to tell it to. “And I was trapped up onthe roof, so I grabbed a bungee jacket and jumped off. Ihover-bounced halfway here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “No way!”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, part of the way here, anyhow.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Pretty awesome.” Shay smiled, then her face went serious.\n\u003cbr\u003e She bit at one of her fingernails, which was one ofthose bad habits that the operation cured. “So, Tally, wereyou at this party . . . to see someone?”\n\u003cbr\u003e It was Tally’s turn to be impressed. “How’d you figurethat out?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay sighed, looking down at her ragged nails. “I’ve gotfriends too, over here. I mean, they were friends. SometimesI spy on them.” She looked up. “I was always the youngest,you know? And now—”\n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re all alone.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay nodded. “It’s sounds like you did more than spy,though.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yeah. I kind of said hello.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Wow, that’s crazy. Your boyfriend or something?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally shook her head. Peris had gone with other girls,and Tally had dealt with it and tried to do the same, buttheir friendship had always been the main thing in boththeir lives. Not anymore, apparently.\n\u003cbr\u003e “If he’d been my boyfriend, I don’t think I could havedone it, you know? I wouldn’t have wanted him to see myUGLIES 2930 Scott Westerfeldface. But because we’re friends, I thought maybe . . .”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yeah. So how’d it go?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally thought for a second, looking out at the ripplingwater. Peris had been so pretty, and grown-up looking,and he’d said they’d be friends again. Once Tally waspretty too . . . “Basically, it sucked,” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Thought so.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Except getting away. That part was very cool.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Sounds like it.” Tally heard the smile in Shay’s voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Very tricky.”\n\u003cbr\u003e They were silent for a moment as a hovercar wentover.\n\u003cbr\u003e “But you know, we haven’t totally gotten away yet,”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay said. “Next time you’re going to pull a fire alarm, letme know ahead of time.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Sorry about getting you trapped here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay looked at her and frowned. “Not that. I just meantif I’m going to have to do the running-away part, I might aswell get in on the fun.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally laughed softly. “Okay. Next time, I’ll let you know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Please do.” Shay scanned the river. “Looks a littleclearer now. Where’s your board?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “My what?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay pulled a hoverboard from under a bush. “You’vegot a board, right? What’d you do, swim over?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I . . . hey, wait. How’d you get a hoverboard totake you across the river?” Anything that flew had mindersall over it.\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay laughed. “That’s the oldest trick in the book. Ifigured you’d know all about it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally shrugged. “I don’t board much.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, this one’ll take both of us.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Wait, shhh.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Another hovercar had come into view, cruising downthe river just above the height of the bridges.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally waited for a count of ten after it had passed beforeshe spoke. “I don’t think it’s a good idea, flying back.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “So how did you get over?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Follow me.” Tally rose from her crouch onto handsand knees, and crawled a bit ahead. She looked back. “Canyou carry that thing?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Sure. It doesn’t weigh much.” Shay snapped her fingers,and the hoverboard drifted upward. “Actually, it doesn’tweigh anything, unless I tell it to.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s handy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Shay started to crawl, the board bouncing along behindher like a littlie’s balloon. Tally couldn’t see any string,though. “So, where’re we going?” Shay asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I know a bridge.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But it’ll tattle.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Not this one. It’s an old friend.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1847/53536.html","bookId":974,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM"}
