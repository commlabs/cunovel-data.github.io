In fact, since its founding, the ancient city had been the crossroads of the geographic world. To the north lay the Black Sea, to the south the Mediterranean. The Bosporus Strait, a major trade route and seaway, flowed between them. But more important to history, Istanbul straddled two continents. It had one foot in Europe, the other in Asia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same could be said about the city\u0027s place in the gulf of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne foot in the present, one in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForever at a crossroads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot unlike himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he pondered this, a cell phone chimed to the side. Vigor turned and fished his phone out of the backpack\u0027s front pocket. He studied the caller ID with a frown. \"It\u0027s a D.C. area code,\" Vigor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be Director Crowe,\" Gray warned. \"Don\u0027t mention anything. Stay on as short as possible to avoid any trace. In fact, we should pull the cell\u0027s battery afterward so it\u0027s not passively tracked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor rolled his eyes at his paranoia and flipped his phone open. \"Pronto,\" he greeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor listened for a few moments, his brow growing more and more furrowed. \"Chi \"Parla?\" he asked with a bit of heat. Whatever he heard seemed to shake him up. He turned and held the phone out for Gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it Director Crowe?\" he asked sotto voce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor shook his head. \"You\u0027d better take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray accepted the phone and lifted it to his ear. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice that came on the line was instantly recognizable, the Egyptian accent clear. Nasser\u0027s words drained all the heat from the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have your mother and father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatient Zero\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 6, 12:42 p.m. Aboard the Mistress of the Seas\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for his rescue efforts . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in the midship elevator, Monk balanced a lunch tray on an upraised palm. He carried his assault rifle over his other shoulder. From small speakers, an ABBA song played, an acoustic version. The ride from the ship\u0027s cramped kitchens to the top deck took long enough that he was humming along with the music by the time he reached his floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, dear God...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors finally opened, allowing Monk to escape. He tromped down the hall toward the guards who flanked the double doors at the end. He mumbled under his breath, practicing his Malay. Jessie had stolen some dye to stain Monk\u0027s face and hands to match the other pirates, similar to the disguise of the dead man in Lisa\u0027s cabin, whose body Monk had discreetly dumped overboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of sight, out of mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo finish his own disguise Monk kept his head scarf over the lower half of his face, playing the role to the hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen in Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past day and night Jessie had trained Monk in some of the more common Malay phrases, the official language of the pirates here. Unfortunately Monk hadn\u0027t learned enough to talk his way past the cordon of security established around Lisa. He and Jessie had scouted the ship and discovered that all the scientific heads and their immediate support staff had been herded to one floor, while the medical staff continued ministering to the sick throughout the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Lisa\u0027s background in physiology must have been discerned. She was isolated in the scientific wing, barricaded and under tight security. It seemed only the elite of the pirates, under the immediate supervision of their leader, a tattooed Maori named Rakao, manned these posts. The radio room was equally guarded. Jessie had learned that much by folding himself into the pirate\u0027s flock with his fluent use of their language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the interim Monk had become little more than Jessie\u0027s muscle. There was not much else he could do. Even if Monk tried a John Wayne assault on the scientific wing, how would he escape with Lisa? And go where? While still cruising at top speeds, they\u0027d have to make a jump overboard. Not the wisest plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier this morning Monk had studied the waters from an open deck. The Mistress of the Seas cruised deep among the Indonesian islands. They were lost in a maze of smaller atolls, a thousand jungle-frosted fingers pointing skyward. If they escaped, swam to one of those islands, they\u0027d be easily hunted down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is, if they made it past the tiger sharks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Monk had to bide his time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that didn\u0027t mean he couldn\u0027t accomplish something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServing lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good plan. He needed to open a means of communication with Lisa. To let her know she wasn\u0027t alone, but more importantly so they could coordinate whenever Monk was ready to take action. And as he could not reach Lisa directly, he needed an intermediary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk reached the double door. He lifted his tray toward the pair of guards and mumbled his way through the Malay equivalent of \"the lunch bell has rung.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them turned and pounded the butt of his rifle against the door. A moment later, a guard, who was stationed inside, opened the door. He spotted Monk and waved him into the Presidential Suite of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA butler in full tails and regalia met Monk at the entrance. He tried to take the tray from Monk, but playing up the pirate act, Monk tried a fierce Malay equivalent aaaargh, and shouldered the man roughly aside. The butler tumbled back, arms wheeling, which earned a chuckled grunt from the door guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk entered the main salon of the suite. A puff of smoke from a deck chair on the outside balcony alerted him to his target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder Blunt lounged in a ship\u0027s robe and flowered swim trunks, ankles crossed, his hair an unkempt blond mop. He was smoking a thick stogie, watching the steep islands slowly pass. Escape was so close, yet so far away. To match the ominous mood, a stack of dark clouds climbed the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Monk joined him, the billionaire didn\u0027t even bother to glance his way. It was the habit of the rich, ever a blind eye to their wait staff. Or maybe it was merely disdain toward the pirate serving his lunch. Ryder\u0027s butler had already set up a side table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilver and crystal and ironed napkins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be good to be king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk lowered the tray to the table and whispered in the man\u0027s ear as he bent down. \"Don\u0027t react,\" Monk said in English. \"I\u0027m Monk Kokkalis with the American envoy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only reaction from the billionaire was a more fierce exhalation of smoke. \"Dr. Cummings\u0027s partner,\" he sighed back. \"We thought you were dead. The pirates sent after youâ€”\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk didn\u0027t have time to explain. \"Yeah, about them . . . they caught a bad case of the crabs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler came to the doorway of the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyder waved him off, speaking loudly. \"That\u0027ll be all, Peter. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk unloaded the tray. He lifted one of the silver covers over the hot plate and revealed two small radios beneath it. \"An extra serving for you and Lisa.\" He covered it back up and revealed what was under the second plate. \"And of course, a bit of dessert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo small-caliber handguns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne for Ryder and one for Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe billionaire\u0027s eyes widened. Monk read the understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When . .. ?\" Ryder asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll coordinate with the radios. Channel eight. The pirates aren\u0027t using it.\" Monk and Jessie had been using that bandwidth all day, with no one the wiser. \"Can you get a radio and gun to Lisa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do my best,\" he said, but followed it with a determined nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk straightened. He dared not tarry any longer or the guards would get suspicious. \"Oh, and there\u0027s rice pudding under the last tray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk headed back to the main salon. He heard Ryder\u0027s mumbled comment: \"Bloody disgusting stuff... whoever thought to put rice in pudding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk sighed. The rich were never happier than when they had something to complain about. He reached the double doors and headed out. One of the guards asked him something in Malay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs answer, Monk dug a finger in his nose, looking very busy and determined, grumbled nonsensically, and continued down to the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, the cage was still there and the doors opened immediately. He ducked inside just in time to hear the next ABBA melody begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio at his side chirped. Monk freed it and brought it to his lips. \"What is it?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meet me in the room,\" Jessie said. \"I\u0027m heading down there now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them had found an empty cabin to share and made it their base of operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just heard. The ship\u0027s captain expects to reach some port today. They\u0027re spiking the engines to reach it before nightfall. Word from the weather band is that a storm cell, moving through the Indonesian islands, is escalating toward typhoon status. So they have to go to port.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meet you down at the room,\" Monk said, signing off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooking the radio to his belt, Monk closed his eyes. Maybe this was their first bit of luck. He calculated in his head, while reflexively mouthing the words to \"Take a Chance on Me\" by ABBA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a pretty good song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1:02 p.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stared down at her patient. The woman was dressed in a blue hospital gown, wired and tubed to all manner of monitoring equipment. A pair of orderlies waited in the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa had asked for a moment of privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood beside the bed, fighting a thread of guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa knew the patient\u0027s statistics by heart: Caucasian female, five-foot-four, no pounds, blond hair, blue eyes, an appendectomy scar on her left side. Radiographs had revealed an old healed break to her left forearm. The Guild\u0027s biographical background check even revealed the cause of the break: from a youthful accident between a skateboard and a broken curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa had memorized the woman\u0027s blood-test results: liver enzymes, BUN, creatinine, bile acids, cell blood counts. She knew her latest urinalysis and fecal culture results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo one side stood an instrument tray neatly arranged with examination tools: otoscope, ophthalmoscope, stethoscope, endoscope. She had used them all this morning. On a neighboring nightstand, the previous night\u0027s EKG and EEG printouts lay accordion-folded. She had examined every inch of strip. Over the past day, she had read through all the medical history of the patient and much of the findings by the Guild\u0027s virologists and bacteriologists. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-32.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
