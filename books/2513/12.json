{"id":108207,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003eOver the next three days Kalika grows to the approximate age of five, while Eric ages ten years. During this time she reads greedily and masters English, as well as many subtleties of conversation and social convention. I have tested her--her IQ appears off the charts. Her beauty flourishes as well. Her long dark hair is like a shawl of black silk, her face a fine sculpture of hidden mysteries. Even her voice is magic, filled with haunting rhythms. When she speaks, it is hard not to listen, to agree with her, to forget everything else. But it is seldom Kalika does speak, and what runs through her mind--besides her hunger for blood--I have no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is in the middle of night when my daughter wakes me in my bed. She does this by gently stroking my hair. I am forced to wake to confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait,\" she says. \"I need more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"He can\u0027t take it. You\u0027re going to have to wait till later in the day. I have to get you another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika is gently persistent. \"I can do it if you don\u0027t want to. I know how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown. \"Have you been watching me?\" Naturally, I have not let Eric see where his blood is going. Somehow I doubt it would lift his spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Kalika says. \"I watch you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit up. \"Has he seen you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She pauses and glances at Ray, who contin?ues to sleep. \"He hasn\u0027t seen either of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not listening to me. This boy can give no more blood. Already his heartbeat is erratic. In a few hours, when it is light, I will go out and find another supply. Until then you will have to be pa-tient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika stares at me with her dark blue eyes. Perhaps it is my imagination, but I catch a glimmer of red in their depths. She smiles slightly, showing her front teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been patient, Mother.\" That is her new name for me. \"I will just take a little of his blood, and then we can go for another supply. We can go in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort. \"You\u0027re not going with me. You\u0027re a little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika is unmoved. \"I will come with you. You will need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause. \"Do you know that for sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika loses her smile. \"I won\u0027t lie to you, Mother, if you don\u0027t lie to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t give me orders. You are to do what I say at all times. Is that clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods. \"As long as you don\u0027t lie to me.\" She adds, as if it were related, \"How is Paula doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer question confuses me. Kalika has never met Paula. How would I explain that I have given birth to a child and that she has grown to five years of age, all in a month? Of course, I have talked about Paula with Ray. Perhaps Kalika was listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you ask?\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika glances at Ray. \"I am curious about her. She means a lot to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s my friend. She\u0027s doing fine. One day you will meet her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitate. \"We\u0027ll see.\" I throw off the covers and put my feet on the floor. \"We can go out now, if you insist. But we\u0027re not disturbing Eric any?more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika puts a hand on my leg. It is still a small hand but I have to wonder if I would be able to stand if she didn\u0027t want me to. I doubt it, and do not try to brush her fingers away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a terrible thing to be afraid of one\u0027s own daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will take only a little of his blood,\" she repeats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight ounces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not a little, not for him. He is weak, don\u0027t you care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika is thoughtful. When she gets that way, she stares at the ground. I have no idea what she looks for. Her eyes close halfway, and her breathing seems to halt. The overall effect is disturbing. Finally she looks up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I care,\" she says. \"But not in the way you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am curious. She is still an enigma to me. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. \"I cannot explain, Mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalika leaves me to get dressed. Knocking lightly on Eric\u0027s door, I step in his room. I have not been able to untie him as I had hoped. As his strength has failed, his behavior has become more desperate. He thinks only of escape, or of his own impending death. I wish I could release him. An unhappy bundle of nerves stuffed in a stale corner, he twitches as I step into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he moans. \"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kneel by his side. \"I need just a little. Less than last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe weeps. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I can\u0027t tell you why. But it will be over soon, Eric, I promise. I\u0027m going out right now to--to get someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head sadly as he stares up at the ceiling. \"I\u0027m not stupid. You\u0027re never going to let me go. You\u0027re going to keep me here till I die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe speaks with passion. \"Yes. You\u0027re evil. You\u0027re a vampire. You have to kill me to keep your evil ways secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words hurt. \"I\u0027m not a vampire. I don\u0027t take this blood for myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is not listening. He continues to sob but grows more animated. \"You\u0027re some monster from another planet. You\u0027re going to rip me open and eat my guts. You\u0027re going to have a glass of wine and have my guts all over your face, dripping on your clothes, on the floor...\" He raises his voice. \"You\u0027re going to eat me alive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an alien monster!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help! The monster\u0027s got me! The aliens are coming!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am forced to strike him hard in the face to shut him up. My reflexes are still excellent, my martial art skills sharp. I believe I break his nose. Yet he continues to moan softly as I tighten the tourniquet. After I have drained away eight ounces--I know Kalika will count them--he dozes, probably out of sheer loss of blood. I kiss the top of his head before I leave the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will go home, Eric,\" I whisper. \"I am not a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Kalika has her breakfast, I dress in my bedroom, in black leather pants, a tight leather coat. Ray sits up in bed. I do not need to turn to feel his eyes on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going out?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You\u0027ve waited too long anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not an enjoyable task, you know, finding people to kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric\u0027s still alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find someone you don\u0027t like. A criminal, a rapist--you used to specialize in them if I remember correctly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn on him. \"I may not be able to handle a criminal or rapist nowadays, or does that concern you, my love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. \"Take your pistol. It has a silencer on it. Just get someone you\u0027re not going to go to pieces over every time you have to take blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI speak with thinly disguised bitterness. \"You didn\u0027t answer my question, my love. But I suppose that is answer enough. You know I enjoy this little family we have here. A gorgeous daughter who is a medical and historical first, and a supposedly loving boyfriend who has forgotten what the words friend and love mean. I mean, you\u0027ve got to admit, five thousand years of intense experience has really helped me create the perfect domestic environment. Wouldn\u0027t you agree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is unimpressed by my outburst. \"You create what you want You always have. If you don\u0027t like it, you can always leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort. \"Leave you with Kalika! She would starve in a day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that Kalika will need either of us soon. She\u0027s not a normal child, you know.\" He adds, \"Not like Paula\u0027s child will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop. \"Why did you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignores me. \"When is her baby due exactly? Soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown. Why were they both dropping remarks about Paula? \"She\u0027s not having a baby anymore,\" I say carefully. \"She lost it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waves his hand. \"Yeah, right, she got kicked by a donkey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA donkey, I think. \"Yeah, that is right.\" I turn away. \"Seymour was right about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay is instantly alert. \"You spoke to him. When did you speak to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach for my black boots. \"None of your busi?ness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at him. \"He said that Eddie Fender\u0027s blood has warped your mind. He told me not to trust you, which was probably good advice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay relaxes. \"Good old Seymour. Did you invite him down for a pleasant evening of food and conver?sation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have my boots on and stalk out the door. \"He is not interested in our problems,\" I lie. \"He has better things to do with his time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Ray\u0027s final remark makes me pause outside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you didn\u0027t tell him about Kalika. I really hope you didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance over my shoulder. \"Of course not. He would never have believed me if I had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay just nods and smiles. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-the-last-vampire-4/page-12.html","bookId":2513,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:17:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:17:35 PM"}
