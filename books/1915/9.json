Sore \u0026amp; fine:)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa: Gross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Heh heh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa: When I didn\u0027t hear from u I got freaked, went 2 that tattoo parlor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: ?!?!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa: I tried 2 find out where rush lives, but that asshole vincent wouldn\u0027t give it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: Oh, hon, I\u0027m sorry. I told u I\u0027d prob B out all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa: He was a real dick 2 me. Said some things...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: What did he say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa: When r u coming bk 2 the hotel? I really need 2 talk 2 u.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: WTF did he say, Lis???\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa: Just come, ok?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe: K. I\u0027ll b there in 1 hr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up. Rush is staring at me, all gorgeous and heavy-lidded and tousled hair, and wearing only his ink and a pair of black sweats that hang appetizingly on his hips. We\u0027re sitting on top of his sleek wood table outside on his massive deck. The sun is shining and a killer breeze is rolling off the desert. There\u0027s a bunch of food laid out between us: bagels and cream cheese and fruit. And right before I got Lisa\u0027s text, Rush was mentioning something about spreading that cream cheese on my stomach instead of his bagel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inhale deeply. I wish-really, really wish-I could pretend I didn\u0027t pick up my phone to check messages, stay in Rush \u0026amp; Addy Land all day. But my friend needs me, and we\u0027re supposed be driving back to L.A. in a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush lifts one eyebrow at me and my skin heats up instantly. The guy\u0027s just walking, talking, breathing sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friend okay?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick a grape from the bunch and roll it between my fingers. \"I don\u0027t know. Something\u0027s wrong. She went to Wicked Ink last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" His brows draw together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, even a confused frown on him is hot. Everything he does, every look, every word, I just melt. How the hell am I going to leave here, leave him, and go back to my life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy vanilla life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s worried about me,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She think I abducted you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis green eyes flash with equal parts heat and amusement. I die. Or sigh. Or both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\" I pop the grape in my mouth, and when the juice bursts inside me, all I can think about is us, Rush and me and what we have together. What\u0027s happened between us in the past twenty-four hours. How we\u0027ve fallen back into it, into each other. And it\u0027s like no time has passed. We joke and touch and tease so damn easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut does he see it? Or was this a kickass twenty-four hour reunion/sex marathon, and it\u0027s over now, and we both go back to our lives? Because he hasn\u0027t said anything. Not one word about me leaving or not wanting me to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had a run-in with Vincent,\" I say. \"Trying to get your address out of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe teases a couple of grapes from their stem. The thing relents way easily. I know the feeling, my purple friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m guessing that didn\u0027t go over well. Everyone at Wicked knows not to give out my personal information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he a bad guy, Vincent?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush shakes his head. \"No. Just a horny guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you?\" I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorts. \"Oh, baby, that dude is way worse than me. I\u0027m into one woman beneath me, on top of me, on her hands and knees in front of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery cell in my body reacts to the words, and the suggestive look he gives me while saying it. Cream freaking cheese, I want to cry out. What were you going to do with the cream cheese, dammit?!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Lisa\u0027s my friend, my bestie, my beeyotch, and I will always have her back. Especially when she needs me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wouldn\u0027t act stupid, would he?\" I ask. \"Force something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no.\" Rush gives me a serious look. \"The guy\u0027s a total slut, for sure, but he\u0027s not a pusher.\" He pops the grapes in his mouth one by one, and I\u0027ve never felt so jealous of fruit in my life. \"I don\u0027t know what went down, but if she went nuts wanting my address, he might\u0027ve told her to take a hike in bright colors, if you know what I\u0027m saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do. And Lisa, though fun and outgoing, a real free-spirit, has a hard time with conflict. She\u0027s never told me everything about her home life, but from what I gathered her parents were going at each other 24/7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes travel over the tattoos on Rush\u0027s arms and chest. Just the thought of not being able to touch him again makes me sick to my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes lift to meet his. \"She needs me,\" I tell him. \"And I\u0027ve got school in the morning. And a paper due.\" I laugh, but it comes out as more of a choke. \"Haven\u0027t even started it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes instantly lose their light, and my heart starts bleeding. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a ride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Course. But first...\" He drops down from the table, then helps me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can say a word, he takes my hands and leads me inside the house. I wonder what he\u0027s up to, hope stupidly that it involves his arms around me and his lips crushing against mine, but then he leads me into the bathroom and in front of the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me, brows raised. \"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis art. On me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe I\u0027ve gone all morning without thinking about it. Remembering it. I\u0027m suddenly nervous, clammy. Damn, I\u0027ve been wanting to see the design Rush inked into me so badly, but now...I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m scared of what it is and what it means. Or worse, doesn\u0027t mean. Maybe it\u0027s some thickly-lined tribal marking or a Hawaiian pin-up girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m wearing one of Rush\u0027s shirts, black and button down, and hits mid-thigh. And as I stand there in the middle of his gorgeous white and gray bathroom, I work buttons off with trembling hands for the second time in twenty-four hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I\u0027m done, I let him draw it off me. Wearing only a pair of his boxers, my nerves battering me, I look away from his hot, hungry eyes and glance over my shoulder. The moment my eyes connect with the stunning blast of color and form between my shoulder blades, I gasp, then cover my mouth with my hand. Eyes wide, I move around, seeing the piece from all different angles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to face him, slightly stunned by his choice. \"It\u0027s a compass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, his leaf-green eyes a little wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chew my lower lip. My heart is so close to the edge I\u0027m almost afraid to ask. But I have to. Especially now, with all that\u0027s happened between us. \"To find my way back home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes close and he inhales deep. When he opens them again, he looks calmer, more in control-more like Rush. He shrugs. \"You said you were lost, Ads. This\u0027ll help you find your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot to me. Not find your way back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain sears my insides, grief too, but I\u0027m not going to let him know it. Nothing was promised here. It was only forgiven, and isn\u0027t that why I came? Isn\u0027t that what I really want?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lie in that forced belief protects me, keeps me from bursting into tears, flinging myself into his arms and begging to stay. Or shit, begging him to ask me to stay. Because in truth, what I really want is him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes lift to his, but they don\u0027t stay long. \"I should get dressed. Get back to the hotel. To my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo reality. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/first-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-1/page-9.html","bookId":1915,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:02 PM"}
