He\u0027s waiting right outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was still covered with soot and ash. His clothes had been singed. There were bandages on his right arm, and yet everything about Zach was perfect. He had come through it all unscathed. Alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom pushed me toward him, but he didn\u0027t take my hand. We didn\u0027t hug or kiss.

The sun was shining, and she stretched herself out on a blanket by the lake, closed her eyes, then bolted upright again. \"Oooh . . . Geneva! My mom loves Geneva, Cam. I bet we can get my parents to -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geneva for what?\" I asked, trying to sit down beside her.

It was the prettiest day we\u0027d had in weeks, and practically the entire school was outside, rowing across the lake, jogging through the woods, or, like us, lying on blankets, studying in the sun. Fresh air filled my lungs, and I could almost forgot about the smoke and the tombs. Almost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh,\" Bex said. \"He appears.\" As she pointed across the grounds, she made it sound as if Zach\u0027s presence at the school at the was less visiting student and more ghost. Watching him walk through the woods, far out of earshot of the passing girls, I could easily see why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were in his pockets. His head was down. He seemed paler somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So . . .\" I started slowly, \"how is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey shrugged. \"We don\u0027t know.

A heavy dew was on the grass, and as the sun rose, it cast a sort of rainbow across the grounds. The world was beautiful and quiet and seemed utterly at peace as I climbed the stairs to the infirmary and pushed open Joe Solomon\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe machines still beeped and buzzed, but the bandages were fewer. The bruises seemed to have faded. Fresh flowers sat in a vase on the table, but the biggest change was the fact that, this time, my mother sat in the chair beside his bed. Her head rested on his pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers were laced with his as they both slept - both waiting for my teacher to come home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like I was spying on my mother (and not in the cool covert sense of the word), so I was easing back toward the door, trying to slip silently into the hall, when I ran into something tall, broad, and strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Zach blurted. He gripped my shoulders gently as if to keep me upright. We hadn\u0027t spoken - hadn\u0027t touched - in weeks. Standing there, I felt like we were still in the tombs, the walls closing in around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see you . . . Sorry,\" I blurted dumbly, then turned and ran away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach found me with the pigeons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone must have erased the boards, because Mr. Solomon\u0027s code was gone and I was alone, looking out across the countryside, staring across the grounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t turn when I heard him. I just said, \"He should be awake by now, shouldn\u0027t he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s never going to wake up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is never going to be over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cammie. listen to me. \"Don\u0027t talk - listen.\" There was fear his eyes. \"This isn\u0027t going to stop on its own.

I -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" he shook his head. \"I couldn\u0027t.

And yet we didn\u0027t touch. A charge coursed between us like a wire, a spark. We had already seen our share of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Solomon isn\u0027t waking up,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does everyone get hurt but me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And me,\" he said. He tried to laugh but faltered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t go to Nebraska this summer. It\u0027s not safe for Grandma and Grandpa to be near me.\" I ran my hand against the cold stone of the ledge. It crept dangerously close to his, and I whispered, \"I\u0027m not safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where will you go?\" He eased closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, found that his should was so close I wanted to rest there, but I didn\u0027t dare. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then his arms were around me.
