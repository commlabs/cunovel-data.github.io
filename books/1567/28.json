He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the mist line of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the hear, he remembered with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing ¨C and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron\u0027s and Hermione\u0027s arms, it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort\u0027s when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry\u0027s body, and he knew that their appearance had caused it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry seized Ron\u0027s wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to run. Even attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accio Cloak!\" roared one of the Death Eaters Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to escape. The Summoning Charm had not worked on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?\" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows. \"Spread now. He\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters\u0027 searching wands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just leave!\" Hermione whispered. \"Disapparate now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great idea,\" said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, \"We know you are here, Potter, and there\u0027s no getting away! We\u0027ll find you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were ready for us,\" whispered Harry. \"They set up that spell to tell them we\u0027d come. I reckon they\u0027ve done something to keep us here, trap us ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about dementors?\" called another Death Eater. \"Let\u0027em have free rein, they\u0027d find him quick enough!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027an dementors won\u0027t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter\u0027s life, nor his soul. He\u0027ll be easier to kill if he\u0027s been Kissed first!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel dementors they would have to produce Patronuses which would give them away immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!\" Hermione whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry\u0027s flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in - He raised his wand: He could not, would not suffer the Dementor\u0027s Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered \"Expecto Patronum!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The Dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a stag!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice said: \"Potter, in here, quick!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!\" muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into the street and slammed the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog\u0027s Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a trickery wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog\u0027s Head\u0027s barman, was the only person not wearing a hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what?\" he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. \"So what? You send dementors down my street, I\u0027ll send a Patronus back at\u0027em! I\u0027m not having\u0027em near me, I\u0027ve told you that. I\u0027m not having it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t your Patronus,\" said a Death Eater. \"That was a stag. It was Potter\u0027s!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stag!\" roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. \"Stag! You idiot ¨C Expecto Patronum!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged toward the High Street, and out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I saw\" said the Death Eater, though was less certainly \"Curfew\u0027s been broken, you heard the noise,\" one of his companions told the barman. \"Someone was out on the streets against regulations ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You set off the Caterwauling Charm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven\u0027t pressed your little Dark Marks, and summoned him. He\u0027s not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about us.\" said one of the Death Eaters, \"worry about yourself, breaking curfew!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub\u0027s closed down? What will happen to your little sidelines then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you threatening ¨C?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I keep my mouth shut, it\u0027s why you come here, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still say I saw a stag Patronus!\" shouted the first Death Eater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stag?\" roared the barman. \"It\u0027s a goat, idiot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, we made a mistake,\" said the second Death Eater. \"Break curfew again and we won\u0027t be so lenient!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry\u0027s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece: a small, rectangular mirror, propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barman entered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bloody fools,\" he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. \"What were you thinking, coming here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" said Harry. \"You can\u0027t thank you enough. You saved our lives!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face: trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a piercing, brilliant blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s your eye I\u0027ve been seeing in the mirror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sent Dobby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barman nodded and looked around for the elf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought he\u0027d be with you. Where\u0027ve you left him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead,\" said Harry, \"Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, \"I\u0027m sorry to hear it, I liked that elf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Aberforth,\" said Harry to the man\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get this?\" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius\u0027s mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bought it from Dung \u0027bout a year ago,\" said Aberforth. \"Albus told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The silver doe,\" he said excitedly, \"Was that you too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" asked Aberforth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven\u0027t I just prove my Patronus is a goat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" said Ron, \"Yeah... well, I\u0027m hungry!\" he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got food,\" said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front of the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was sound of chewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right then,\" said Aberforth when the had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. \"We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can\u0027t be done by night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness: Caterwauling Charm\u0027s set off, they\u0027ll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don\u0027t reckon I\u0027ll be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you\u0027ll be able to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He\u0027s been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not leaving,\" said Harry. \"We need to get into Hogwarts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid, boy,\" said Aberforth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you\u0027ve got to do,\" said Aberforth, leaning forward, \"is to get as far from here as from here as you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand. There isn\u0027t much time. We\u0027ve got to get into the castle. Dumbledore ¨C I mean, your brother ¨C wanted us ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth\u0027s glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,\" said Aberforth, \"and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He\u0027s gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don\u0027t owe him anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand.\" said Harry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t I?\" said Aberforth quietly. \"You don\u0027t think I understood my own brother? Think you know Albus better than I did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean that,\" said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. \"It\u0027s... he left me a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he now?\" said Aberforth. \"Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you\u0027d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-it\u0027s not easy, no,\" said Harry. \"But I\u0027ve got to ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to? Why got to? He\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t he?\" said Aberforth roughly. \"Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ¨C \" Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. \"But you\u0027re fighting too, you\u0027re in the Order of the Phoenix ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was,\" said Aberforth. \"The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who\u0027s won, it\u0027s over, and anyone who\u0027s pretending different\u0027s kidding themselves. It\u0027ll never be safe for you here, Potter, he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you.\" He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows they\u0027ve been working with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t leave,\" said Harry. \"I\u0027ve got a job ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give it to someone else!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. It\u0027s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry wanted him with all his heart to say \"Yes,\" but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips, Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother\u0027s knee. Secrets and lies, that\u0027s how we grew up, and Albus... he was a natural.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man\u0027s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Dumbledore\" said Hermione rather timidly. \"Is that your sister? Ariana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" said Aberforth tersely. \"Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,\" said Harry, trying to spare Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That old berk,\" muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of mead. \"Thought the sun shone out of my brother\u0027s every ocrifice, he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the looks of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby\u0027s grave, he had decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no desire to doubt again; he did not want o hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth\u0027s gaze, which was so strikingly like his brothers\u0027: The bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,\" said Hermione in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he now?\" said Aberforth. \"Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if he\u0027d left \u0027em well alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" asked Hermione breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never you mind,\" said Aberforth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s a really serious thing to say!\" said Hermione. \"Are you ¨C are you talking about your sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, by three Muggle boys. They\u0027d seen her doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn\u0027t control it, no witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she couldn\u0027t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione\u0027s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She wouldn\u0027t use magic, but she couldn\u0027t get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn\u0027t control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my father went after the bastards that did it,\" said Aberforth, \"and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he\u0027d done it, because the Ministry had known what Ariana had become, she\u0027d have been locked up in St. Mungo\u0027s for good. They\u0027d have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn\u0027t keep it in any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was her favourite,\" he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through Aberforth\u0027s wrinkles and wrangled beard. \"Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAberforth succored. \"He didn\u0027t want to be bothered with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn\u0027t do it for my mother, I could calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn\u0027t there.\" said Aberforth. \"If I\u0027d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn\u0027t as young as she was, and... it was an accident. Ariana couldn\u0027t control it. But my mother was killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that put paid to Albus\u0027s trip round the world with little Doge. The pair of \u0027em came home for my mother\u0027s funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the family. Ha!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAberforth spat into the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn\u0027t care about school, I\u0027d have stayed home and done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told me I had to finish my education and he\u0027d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant, there\u0027s no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks... till he came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as bright and talented he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But after a few weeks of it, I\u0027d had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go hack to Hogwarts, so I told \u0027em, both of \u0027em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now,\" and Aberforth looked downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, confronting his elder brother. \"I told him, you\u0027d better give it up now. You can\u0027t move her, she\u0027s in no fit state, you can\u0027t take her with you, wherever it is you\u0027re planning to go, when you\u0027re making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn\u0027t like that.\" said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses: They turned white and blind again. \"Grindelwald didn\u0027t like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother... Didn\u0027t I understand, my poor sister wouldn\u0027t have to be hidden once they\u0027d changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles their place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there was an argument... and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother\u0027s best friend ¨C and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn\u0027t stand it ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color was draining from Aberforth\u0027s face as though he had suffered a mortal wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" ¨C and I think she wanted to help, but she didn\u0027t really know what she was doing, and I don\u0027t know which of us did it, it could have been any of us ¨C and she was dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione\u0027s face was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash is mind clean of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so... I\u0027m so sorry,\" Hermione whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone,\" croaked Aberforth. \"Gone forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn\u0027t want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn\u0027t he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was never free,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\" said Aberforth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never,\" said Harry. \"The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn\u0027t there. \u0027Don\u0027t hurt them, please... hurt me instead.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did,\" said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana... It was torture to him, if you\u0027d seen him then, you wouldn\u0027t say he was free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said. \"How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn\u0027t more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren\u0027t dispensable, just like my little sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t he tell him to hide, then?\" shot back Aberforth. \"Why didn\u0027t he say to him, \u0027Take care of yourself, here\u0027s how to survive\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" said Harry before Hermione could answer, \"sometimes you\u0027ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you\u0027ve got to think about the greater good! This is war!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re seventeen, boy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m of age, and I\u0027m going to keep fighting even if you\u0027ve given up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who says I\u0027ve given up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Order of the Phoenix is finished,\" Harry repeated, \"You-Know-Who\u0027s won, it\u0027s over, and anyone who\u0027s pretending different\u0027s kidding themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t say I like it, but it\u0027s the truth!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it isn\u0027t.\" said Harry. \"Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I\u0027m going to keep going until I succeed ¨C or I die. Don\u0027t think I don\u0027t know how this might end. I\u0027ve known it for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get into Hogwarts,\" said Harry again. \"If you can\u0027t help us, we\u0027ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us ¨C well, now would be a great time to mention it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eye, that were so extraordinarily like his brother\u0027s. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and approached the portrait of Ariana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what to do,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, one of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er ¨C what ¨C?\" began Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s only one way in now,\" said Aberforth. \"You must know they\u0027ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow you expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies... well, that\u0027s your lookout, isn\u0027t it? You say you\u0027re prepared to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what...?\" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana\u0027s picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen. He appeared and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d come! I knew it, Harry!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-28.html","bookId":1567,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:12 PM"}
