Several moments later, she returned to the bedroom where we were watching television and said that some woman wanted to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up and walked to the front hall. The door was open and I saw a tall woman in her fifties standing on the porch. She was well dressed and holding a large, bulky envelope in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you Robert Nielsen?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her that I was and she held out the envelope. \"This is for you then,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at it suspiciously and inquired what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A communication from your brother,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy suspicions increased. \"What do you mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother Chris has dictated this manuscript to me,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words angered me. \"I don\u0027t know who you are,\" I told her, \"but if you possessed the least knowledge about my brother, you\u0027d know that he died more than a year ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman sighed. \"I know that, Mr. Nielsen,\" she said, tiredly. \"I\u0027m a psychic. Your brother has communicated this material to me from--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped as I began to close the door, then quickly added, \"Mr. Nielsen, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sound of such genuine urgency in her voice that I looked at her in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have just undergone six exhausting months transcribing this manuscript,\" she told me. \"I didn\u0027t choose to do it. I have my own affairs to deal with but your brother would not let me be until I wrote down every word of his communication and promised faithfully to bring it to you.\" Her voice took on a desperate tone. \"Now you have got to take it and give me peace.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, she thrust the envelope into my hands, turned and hurried down the path to the sidewalk. As I watched, she got into her car and drove off quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have never seen or heard from her again. I do not even know her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have read the manuscript three times now and wish I knew what to make of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not a religious man but, like anyone, would certainly like to believe that death is more than oblivion. Still, I find it difficult, if not impossible, to accept the story at face value. I keep thinking it is nothing more than that: a story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue, the facts are there. Facts about my brother and his family which this woman could not possibly have known-- unless one goes on the premise that she spent months of laborious--and expensive--research in uncovering them before writing the manuscript. In that case, what is the point of it? What could she have gained from such a course?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe questions, in my mind, about this book are manifold. I will not enumerate them but permit the reader to form his own. Of only one thing I am certain. If the manuscript is true, all of us had better examine our lives.
