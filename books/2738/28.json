I grasp her hips and thrust harder as I sink my teeth into her and suck her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I’d even known she existed before, I would have hunted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have caught and conquered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine mine mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrape her gently with my teeth and then suck again. A bubbling sound leaves her and she tightens her hold on my head. I smooth my tongue out to caress the spot in case it stings, and then I take it up again, sucking so it leaves a mark, so that she will feel it, feel me on her skin tomorrow. She shudders. I delve my hand to rub her beautiful little clit as I mark her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to mark her in every way I can. I want her to wear the clothes I give her, the food I get her, I want her to wear my ring, my body on hers, I want her to wear my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s going to be mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn every way possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRESENT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEATTLE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe church is small, hot, and, now, packed with attendees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp front, flowers line up against the wall beneath a massive cross that seems to watch over the churchgoers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I’d looked at a cross, it had been held over my head while I was tied and furious in my bed. Not for a moment had I stopped squirming. I was bleeding from the binds they’d used to strap me in various places. I don’t remember that directly. But I do remember waking up from a hypnosis session to be told exactly what I described, and what I said. Did it matter? No. Do I wonder about it? No. It’s as inconsequential as a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer family is here. Her friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cross. The circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever cared much for praying, but for my son and my wife’s safety, I pray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the door of the church behind me, I hear “Gah!” and I twist around and see him. Racer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously saw me, and his two chubby arms are flailing in the air and his dimple is aimed my way. Josephine shows him a toy, and he is immediately attracted to its bright red color. He grabs it and sticks it in his mouth. And my heart starts whacking when I see the closed doors behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all we’ve been through, my wife is finally here to marry me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, I’m going to get sentimental.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut it,” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurmurs surround us as the choir sets up. We discussed this for weeks. We didn’t want a wedding march.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, at the end of the day, Brooke actually did. She’d frowned as we stepped out of the shower and used her towel to dry her hair first, “Now that I think about it, it’s the only time in our lives we’ll hear that song. I’m only ever marrying you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dragged my towel over my chest, then I hooked it around her waist, using it to pull her against me. “What do you want? Tell me what you want so I can give it to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flattened her breasts to my diaphragm as I spread the towel to engulf us both. “I want a tiny little church where it’s almost just us,” she whispered, kissing my Adam’s apple and then reaching up to caress my dimples. “And I want the march, the white dress, white roses, and you. Every second after our vows, I want to be with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seized her chin and tipped her head back farther, my lips curling. “Then your wish,” I whispered, kissing her lips, “is mine to grant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePAST\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePHOENIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re hopping from location to location for the new season, and while Pete and I check us into our Phoenix hotel, something makes my hackles rise. I turn around to spot Brooke across the lobby, heatedly arguing with Riley, who’s heatedly arguing back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” I reach them in five steps and immediately grab Riley by the collar. “What the fuck are you doing?” I demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScowling, he pulls free and signals at Brooke, who’s scowling back at him. “I was trying to explain to Brooke, here, that things weren’t as happy when she was away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what Riley’s arguing about, but I do know this: I don’t like the look on Brooke’s face. I don’t like the way her lips look downturned at the corners, and I let the asshole know it. “It’s done with. You got that?” I angrily push my finger into his sternum until he stumbles back. “You got that?” I demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I got that,” he grumbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. I curl my fingers around the back of Brooke’s neck and I guide her into the elevator and then into our suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe head inside and she goes straight to the window, and I survey her round little ass. That ass is mine. “You like the room, little firecracker?” I wrap her in my arms I press into her body. “Want to hit the running trail when it gets dark?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI play with her neck with my lips, when she turns around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you fuck other women?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me with a new somber gleam in her eyes, and I stare back like a fucking idiot, not understanding what the fuck is going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I realize I have no right to ask you.” She surveys me, and I survey her. “We broke up, right? It was the end of it. But . . . did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt dawns on me that she’s jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy little firecracker. Jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It matters to you?” I ask her, smirking as my chest crams with all the shit only she makes me feel. “If I slept with anyone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabs a couch pillow and hurtles it into my chest, eyes flashing. “What do you think, you fucking jerk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing the pillow, I toss it aside, smiling in amusement. “Tell me how much it matters,” I croon, dodging another pillow and loving her cheeks this pink and pretty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me!” she screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” I demand. She’s backing away, but I’m coming right after her. “You left me, little firecracker. You left me with a sweet letter telling me, very nicely, to go fuck myself and to have a nice life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! I left you with a letter that told you I loved you! Something you hadn’t told me until I came back to you and begged you to tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so fucking cute like this. Come here.” I pull her into my arms but she struggles to pull free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remington. You’re laughing at me!” she cries wretchedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said come here,” I say, gathering her closer, and I’m fucking dying to kiss her senseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remy, tell me! Please tell me, what did you do?” she jealously begs, squirming to get free as she looks up at me. I swear I could look into her eyes all day, look into her face all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing my body to flatten her against the wall, I place my forehead against hers and look into her eyes. “I like that you’re jealous. Is it because you love me? Do you feel proprietary of me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let go,” she angrily breathes, squirming between me and the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, she’s so lovely. I cup her cheek and softly tell her, “I do. I feel completely proprietary of you. You’re mine. I’m not letting you go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said no to me,” she angrily grits out, her eyes burning with fury. “For months and months. I was dying for you. I was going crazy. I . . . came . . . like a fucking idiot! On your fucking leg! You withheld yourself from me until I was . . . dying a little inside with wanting you. You’ve got more willpower than Zeus! But the first women they bring to your door . . . the moment I’m gone, the first whores they happened to bring you . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What would you have done if you were here? Stopped it?” My dare comes out as a whisper, and I’m struggling not to remember how I felt when I realized she fucking LEFT ME!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes!” she cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But where were you?” I demand, my blood starting to simmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where were you, Brooke?” I demand. I curl my hand around her throat and caress the pulse point with my thumb, searching her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was broken,” she whispers. “You broke me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You. Your letter. Broke me.” Watching her, I trail my thumb along her throat and jaw, and then I watch as I trace her pink mouth, the only mouth I want. “What does it matter if I had to kiss a thousand lips to forget these?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hear a knock. I don’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body is tight and ready to claim hers. She’s my mate, and I want her to fucking tell me she’s jealous because I’m hers, and she’s mine, and that’s the end of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I want her to take me inside, I want to pound her hard and fill her with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she doesn’t speak. My stubborn little minx doesn’t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting her cool down, I open the door, tip the bellman, and pull in the suitcases on my own as fast as I can, one of my arms shooting out to stop her when she walks past me. “Come here, settle down now,” I command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she pushes my hand away, then steps out and says to the bellman, “Thank you. Would you send this duffel with that other suitcase to the other room?” she says, pointing at her suitcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, the guy pushes the cart back toward the elevators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns around and looks at me, breathing slowly, looking at me with wide, pained eyes. “I want to sleep with Diane tonight. I don’t feel so well and I’d rather we talk about it when I . . . when I . . . am settled down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI burst out laughing. “You can’t be serious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy laughter dies when she boards the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand there. My heart pounding for me to chase. But I’m too disbelieving to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator closes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy woman. Just fucking boarded. That shit elevator. And left me here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my suitcase and toss it across the room with a yell, then I slam the door behind me and go kick the shit out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“FUUCK!” Then I kick the pillow that is still on the floor, clamp my jaw and call Pete so he can give me Diane’s fucking room number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he answers, and I speak, I sound murderous. “Diane’s fucking room number.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wh-whaaat? Shit, Rem, Riley told me about the argument . . . please just count to fucking a hundred before you do anything,” Pete says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The room. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two–four–three–eight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slam the phone down and silently does as he says and count to a hundred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve got the phone in my hand by number 98, and by 99, I got my fucking finger on the numbers. I finally pound the keys, and when Diane’s voice answers I very softly, and very angrily growl, “I’m going down there for Brooke, so you can either open the door for me, or I can break it down. Your choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slam the phone and stop at the door, telling myself to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I can barely pull the air into my lungs I’m so agitated at the thought of not sleeping with her. I’m agitated remembering she left me. She could leave me. Any. Fucking. Day. Again. Until I win this championship and make her marry me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m so ready to make her my wife, my body preps me as if for a physical fight, and I’m ready to hunt and capture her. I squeeze my knuckles and focus on my breath as I head two floors down, and the instant I reach the door, Diane opens it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit, but I think I wanted to break that fucking door!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Diane,” I greet her, then I head straight for Brooke. She’s curled in a fucking ball, crying on that bed, and all my anger and frustration arrows to stiffen my cock up instantly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/remy-real-3/page-28.html","bookId":2738,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:37:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:37:43 PM"}
