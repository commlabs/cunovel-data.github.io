Is he a spy, a mercenary, a footloose adventurer, or simply a screwball sucker for hopeless causes? \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e(Actually he\u0027s a little bit of all of the above. Plus he never sleeps. Ever.) \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eOne thing\u0027s for sure: Tanner\u0027s a true romantic, which is why he can\u0027t refuse a distraught mother who begs him to rescue her lost, pure-as-driven-snow daughter. Phaedra Harrow (nee Deborah Horowitz) once shared Tanner\u0027s apartment but not his bed. And now the virginal beauty\u0027s been abducted by white slavers in the Afghan wilderness. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eFinding Phaedra will be difficult enough. Bringing her back alive and unmolested may be impossible. And first Tanner will have to swim the English Channel, survive trigger-happy Russian terrorists . . . and maybe pull off a timely assassination or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tanner-s-virgin-evan-tanner-6.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tanner-s-virgin-evan-tanner-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:57:15 AM"}
