{"id":33022,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XV","content":"\u0026nbsp;1 \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Two days subsequent to his mother\u0027s arrival at Chilworth Cove, Ronald Cavendish set out for London.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Aliette, masking her anxiety, drove him to the station; and for nearly an hour after the slow train left Chilton Junction he visualized nothing except her pale, exquisite face and the wistful smile in her brown eyes. Looking back, it seemed to him that those eyes had been very close to tears. Thinking of her, imagination roused all the tenderness, all the fighting instinct in him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But gradually, as the lush countryside slid by, Ronnie\u0027s mind recovered a little of its legal function; and he began to map out, as carefully as he could, his plan of campaign.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The fear lest Brunton should refuse to take any action still hardly troubled him. To one of his public school training, it appeared utterly incredible that a man in Brunton\u0027s position, childless and without religious scruples, should refuse to set free a wife who obviously did not care for him, and for whom (equally obviously, as it seemed) he did not himself care. Sheer caddishness of that description was the prerogative of rank outsiders like Carrington.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nevertheless, Ronnie\u0027s instinct dictated caution. It would he best, he thought, to see Jimmy immediately on his arrival in London; and to ascertain from Jimmy how far his flight with Aliette had become public knowledge. Possibly, if there had been no open scandal, Brunton might hold his hand till after the long vacation. Scandal, whether at the bar or elsewhere, never did any one any good.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And at that, Ronald Cavendish knew apprehension. His brain, hitherto blinded by the grand passion, began to see the ordinary point of view, the point of view he himself might have adopted towards their case a twelvemonth since. \"Rather sordid,\" he would have considered the whole business, \"rather hard luck on the husband.\" And so thinking, he imagined the bare legal tale as it might one day appear in the press. Commonplace enough! Mrs. Smith had left Mr. Smith, and was living in open adultery with Mr. Jones. Mr. Smith asked for a divorce; produced the usual evidence; secured the usual decree.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He tried to put apprehension away from him. He said to himself, \"As if a little publicity mattered; as if anything mattered except her freedom.\" All the same, he knew that publicity would matter, that publicity would hurt Aliette and hurt his mother. \"Damnable,\" he thought; \"damnable that the law should take so little cognizance of the personal equation!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And London, seen in the hot sunlight of a July afternoon as his taxi crawled over Waterloo Bridge, only intensified the unimportance of the individual. The isolation of Chilworth, the paradise of enchantment which love and Aliette had made for him at Chilworth, seemed a million miles removed from this peopled city. He recognized himself one of the herd again, forced to think as the herd, to act as the herd dictated. Moses Moffatt\u0027s face, smiling most confidential of welcomes at the green door in Jermyn Street, typified the herd point of view--the basement point of view--the feeling that, potentially, one was a mere co-respondent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While the man was unpacking for him in the bare ascetic bedroom, Ronnie rang up Wilberforce, Wilberforce \u0026amp; Cartwright; and got through to Jimmy. Jimmy on the telephone sounded cold, serious, dignified. Only after some persuasion would he consent to dine at the club.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And by the way,\" asked Ronnie, \"do you happen to know if Mollie Fullerford\u0027s in town?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ve got a letter for her.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"From her sister?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll give you her address this evening,\" said James Wilberforce, and replaced his receiver.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 2\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Lustrum is one of those semi-social, semi-political clubs which combine sound cookery, a cellar beyond reproach, and a chairman of the utmost distinction, with the architectural style of a Turkish bath and the gloom of a family mausoleum. A tape-machine ticks by the glass-doored porter\u0027s box in the hall; an enormous gold-framed oil of Mr. Asquith stares down the red marble staircase; English waiters--last of their breed--move in unhurried dignity through the vast dining-room; while \"members bringing guests\" are subject to rules so complicated that even the honorary secretary--who takes most of the credit for the paid secretary\u0027s work when he appears before a somnolent committee--has been known to infringe them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The constraint of this atmosphere weighed so heavily on the friends as to make immediate conversation impossible. Only after a bottle of the Lustrum\u0027s pre-war Pommard, a glass apiece of the Lustrum\u0027s \u002768 port, and the third of a cigar consumed over coffee in the stuffy guest-room, did Jimmy Wilberforce manage:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Old chap, I\u0027m afraid this is a devil of a mess. You\u0027ve seen your mater, I suppose!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Seen her!\" Ronnie smiled--and then, cautiously: \"Didn\u0027t you know that she was staying with us?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Us?\" Wilberforce repeated the word. \"You mean----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"With myself and Aliette.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wilberforce\u0027s eyes narrowed. He took the tawny cigar from under his auburn mustache, and scrutinized it a longish while before saying:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Tell me, then: why are you in town?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Primarily to see H. B. We\u0027ve waited quite long enough for him to make a move.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The matter-of-fact tone annoyed Wilberforce. Despite his resolves not to let the personal issue between himself and Aliette\u0027s sister cloud impersonal judgment, that issue had been recurring to his mind all through the dreary bachelor dinner. For six weeks Mollie had been on the defensive with him, unseizable if not unapproachable; for six weeks he had been wavering between the strong desire to \"go gently till this damn mess was cleared up,\" and the fear of what \"Society\" would think about the match. Therefore, it irritated him that Ronnie should speak about the whole affair as though running away with another man\u0027s wife were an every-day occurrence, as though he, Ronnie, were the injured party.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Rather an unwise move, don\u0027t you think?\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Unwise! One can\u0027t let him go on shilly-shallying like this.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you\u0027ve got it into your head that you\u0027re going to bully Hector Brunton into giving Mrs. Brunton her freedom,\" retorted Jimmy, \"I should give up the idea\"; and he added: \"I should have thought your best plan would be to lie doggo. After all, you must remember that he\u0027s the aggrieved party.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you feel that way about it,\" Ronnie\u0027s eyes kindled to anger, \"we won\u0027t discuss the matter further.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At that Wilberforce became the solicitor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My dear fellow,\" he began, assuming his father\u0027s blandness, \"do be reasonable. Don\u0027t think I fail to understand your feelings. I know you well enough to realize that you wouldn\u0027t have acted as you have acted without imagining yourself justified. Very possibly you are justified. Very possibly there are circumstances--I hold no brief for H. B. All I want to do is to help you and your mother. And so if you come to me for advice, I am bound to tell you exactly what I think. It\u0027s for Brunton to move, not you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027s had plenty of time. And I\u0027m sick of waiting.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then why don\u0027t you get some mutual friend to see him? That\u0027s the usual thing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie rose from the deep saddle-bag chair. His instinct was all for a row. Unreasonably, with the divine unreason of a lover, he had expected sympathy; instead he had met a wall, a wall of misunderstanding between himself and his best friend. \"Damn Jimmy,\" he thought. \"Jimmy\u0027s common sense ought to tell him that this isn\u0027t the usual thing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And suddenly Aliette\u0027s lover realized that Jimmy\u0027s common sense had told him nothing, that Jimmy\u0027s very common sense prevented him from understanding the peculiar relationship between Aliette and her legal owner. He wanted to tell Jimmy the truth about that relationship; but his training, the code of decent reticence, every tradition of public schooldom restrained him. Decency suggested that neither then to James Wilberforce, nor eventually in court, could he make public the matrimonial position between Aliette and Hector. \"Tongue-tied!\" he thought. \"Even if I were an orator, in her defense I should always be tongue-tied.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nevertheless, his anger relented.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Except yourself, Jimmy,\" he went on, \"there\u0027s no mutual friend who could act for us; and I can\u0027t ask you to act because of your firm\u0027s relations with him. Therefore, I\u0027m going to do the job myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was almost admiration in the other\u0027s \"You always were a plucky devil.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Plucky! I don\u0027t see anything plucky in it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Supposing H. B. cuts up rough?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why should he? He\u0027s in the wrong, and he knows it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All the more reason.\" Wilberforce, too, rose. Watching his friend carefully, he saw that their conversation had aroused him to fighting-pitch; and Ronnie at fighting-pitch--as Jimmy remembered from their Oxford days--was capable of being a rather desperate person.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you cut up rough, old man,\" he continued. \"There\u0027ll be quite enough trouble without a police-court case into the bargain.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You needn\u0027t be afraid, Jimmy.\" Ronnie controlled himself. \"I\u0027ll manage to keep my temper with the fellow. By the way, you don\u0027t feel there\u0027s any chance of his refusing to file his petition, do you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hardly. H. B. isn\u0027t a religious chap, or anything of that sort. He might go for damages, of course.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We could settle that before we went into court.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They simmered down; sat down; relit cigars; and began to discuss the legal aspect of the case which each felt sure that Brunton must eventually bring; finally deciding that Wilberforce, Wilberforce \u0026amp; Cartwright could not, under the special circumstances, act for either party.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"J. J. W. would be your best man,\" said James.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So interested did they become in the professional issue that it was nearly midnight before Ronnie said, \"By the way, I\u0027d almost forgotten to ask you for Mollie Fullerford\u0027s address\"; and Wilberforce, \"Do you really think it\u0027s advisable for you to go and see her?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Advisable! How do you mean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two friends faced one another in silence, each constrained by the peculiar diffidence of their class, the diffidence which makes the discussion of women, and especially of their own women, so terribly difficult to decent Englishmen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At last Wilberforce said: \"You see, old chap, if this case comes on, I\u0027m afraid it will be a big shock to her. H. B. might call her as a witness. Pretty rough on a girl, being dragged into\"--he hesitated--\"this sort of thing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, rotten. We\u0027ll have to keep her name out.\" Ronnie, too, hesitated. \"She hasn\u0027t said anything to you, I suppose?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, but I feel she knows.\" The red man nearly blushed. \"I say, you\u0027ll be decent about breaking things, won\u0027t you? You\u0027ll let her down lightly. Mollie\u0027s jolly fond of her sister, and--er--you mustn\u0027t mind my saying it--her sister hasn\u0027t behaved over-well in this business--leaving her all by herself at Brunton\u0027s.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My fault, Jimmy. It was I who persuaded Aliette not to wait. But I promise you, I\u0027ll see that Brunton keeps Mollie Fullerford\u0027s name out of the affair.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By the way,\" added Ronnie casually, \"you remember something you said to me just before we went into court in the Ellerson case?\" A pause. \"Does that still hold good? What I mean is this. I should never forgive myself if I thought that this--this trouble of mine----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m not that sort of cad,\" retorted James Wilberforce hotly. But all the same, walking home through the night, he realized once more--with revolting clarity--himself. Which self-knowledge is no bad discipline for the James Wilberforces of this world!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 3\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie, too, walked home from the Lustrum. The interview with Wilberforce had clarified his mind; he foresaw now exactly how his world would regard the case. The foreknowledge hardened his determination to see Brunton. He must see Brunton. Brunton must be brought to immediate action. Otherwise----\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Resolutely the man strove to put that \"otherwise\" away from him. But the \"otherwise\" kept on intruding. Suppose Aliette\u0027s legal owner refused to take any action at all? Carrington had waited five years.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And that night, his first bereft of her, alone and sleepless at Jermyn Street, Aliette\u0027s lover began to conceive a hatred of Aliette\u0027s legal owner. The Wixton imagination, always most active in darkness, showed him pictures of Brunton, of the sandy hair, the cold gray eyes, the feet in their big boots. Tossing sleepless on his tumbled pillows, imagination bade him remember that once--long ago though it must have been--Brunton had actually----\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Horrors, physical horrors, capered and sarabanded before his eyes, rousing the blood-lust in him--the old blood-lust experienced four years since. He remembered, just as sleep overtook him, the face of a Turk he had killed. His squadron was charging. Behind him, he heard the galloping stamp of shod hoofs on desert, the creak of saddlery, the jingle of accoutrements, the curses of his men; in front of him rose a face, the face of the Turk, bearded above dirty linen. The face was afraid; he could see the face twitch as he fired. Only as he fired, the face changed--became the face of Hector Brunton.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 4\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m afraid you didn\u0027t sleep very well last night, sir,\" said Moses Moffatt, serving the usual faultless rashers in Ronnie\u0027s beige-papered sitting-room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What makes you say that?\" Ronnie, clear-eyed after his morning tub, looked across the breakfast-table.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, sir,\" Moses Moffatt smiled deprecatingly, \"if you don\u0027t mind my mentioning it, the missus and me heard you calling out in your sleep.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is that so? I\u0027m sorry if I disturbed you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie, remembering his dream only very vaguely, ate his breakfast; skimmed through the \"Morning Post\"; took his top-hat, and sauntered downstairs into Jermyn Street.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It had not yet struck ten. Fishmongers were still swilling down their marbles. The usual early morning crowd had emerged into sunshine from the Piccadilly Tube. Ronnie swung past them down the Haymarket.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The asphalt of London, the cars, the buses, and the taxicabs seemed more than ever alien after the sea and the solitude of Chilworth Cove. He felt like a stranger in a strange, hostile city. Only as he emerged through Northumberland Avenue upon the Embankment did London seem home again; only as he turned leftward from the river into the Temple did there come over him the full realization of the issue at stake.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In his chambers at Pump Court nothing had altered. Tho other three barristers were, as usual, away; Benjamin Bunce, as usual, pottering among the foolscaps. The little clerk\u0027s watery eyes lit with curiosity at sight of the returning wanderer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There were papers,\" hinted Benjamin, \"there was correspondence.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Benjamin\u0027s employer glanced at the taped documents on the table, at the unopened letters. \"They can wait,\" he said. \"Has Mr. Brunton\u0027s clerk inquired for my address?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Quite sure, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very good. I\u0027ll ring when I want you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The clerk--a thousand unanswered questions seething in his soul--withdrew.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie hung his hat behind the door, and began striding up and down the book-shelved room. Here, he remembered, he had first tried to reason out his feelings for Aliette. Here, just before the Ellerson case, he had almost decided it his duty to give her up. And now, now--in fact if not in law--Aliette was actually his.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For a little while he dreamed of her, but soon the professional atmosphere of Pump Court infected him; and he began to see their case impersonally--as a \"case.\" In law, unless Brunton acted, they had no remedy. His whole career, Aliette\u0027s whole happiness, their whole future lives depended on the clemency of Aliette\u0027s legal owner. Neither the old divorce-laws nor the proposed divorce-reforms could help them. Whatever wrongs Aliette might have suffered at her husband\u0027s hands in the past, she had forfeited those rights by running away; and only her husband could set her free. Would Brunton set her free? That was the whole issue. Best face it out of hand!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie pressed the bell on his desk, and the clerk popped through the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Bunce, I want you to go over to Mr. Brunton\u0027s chambers. Ask Mr. Brunton\u0027s clerk if he can see me before he goes into court. You can say that it is on a private matter, and rather important.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bunce--Ms curiosity satisfied--sidled out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Waiting for Brunton\u0027s decision, Cavendish knew both curiosity and fear. Suppose Brunton refused even to discuss the matter?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Brunton did refuse. The message Benjamin brought back was perfectly definite, perfectly courteous. He, Benjamin, had seen Mr. Brunton\u0027s clerk, David Patterson, and Mr. Brunton had sent word by Mr. Patterson to say that he was very sorry not to be able to see Mr. Cavendish, but that he was extremely busy and would be busy all day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Funk!\" thought Ronnie; and remembered suddenly how Brunton had avoided the war. Brunton\u0027s refusal to see him was sheer cowardice. Rage kindled in his mind. For the flash of a second, he saw red. He would see Brunton. Damn it all, he would see him. How dared Brunton shelter behind a clerk! But it would be no use trying to force his way into Brunton\u0027s chambers. Brunton would be in court. Very well, then, he would wait for him; wait till the court adjourned; wait, if necessary, all day.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Won\u0027t you look through your letters, sir?\" reminded Bunce.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie tried to look through his letters; tried to examine the few briefs which had come in during his absence. But his legal mind refused to concentrate. Between his mind and his correspondence, between his mind and his briefs, rage hung a scarlet and impenetrable curtain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 5\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That morning, yet another legal brain refused to concentrate on its immediate business.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All through the long hours in the stuffy court-room, Hector Brunton, K.C., was conscious of the Furies. \"Cavendish,\" whispered the Furies, \"Cavendish has come back.\" He tried to dismiss the fellow from his mind, to attack the case in hand. But again and again the witnesses under cross-examination eluded him. Instead of the faces in the witness-box, he saw Cavendish\u0027s face--the face of his wife. And when--his cross-examinations concluded--the court adjourned for luncheon, those two faces were still before his eyes, mocking him, mocking him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"God\u0027s curse on them,\" he thought. \"God\u0027s curse on both of them. I\u0027ll not see Cavendish. Let them lie in the bed they made for themselves. Let the adulterer and the adulteress rot together.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Angrily Brunton disrobed; angrily he left the law courts and made across Fleet Street toward King\u0027s Bench Walk. Even David Patterson, dour, heavy-jowled as the K.C. himself; who followed, brief-bag slung over his shoulder, at a respectful distance; was awed at his employer\u0027s obvious fury.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The K.C. strode rapidly, his hands behind his back, his head lowered, down Middle Temple Lane, through Elm Court, through Fig Tree Court, into the big graveled square of the Walk, and diagonally across the Walk to his chambers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Suddenly his head lifted. There, at the steps of his chambers, waiting for him, obviously waiting for him, stood Cavendish. For the fraction of a second Brunton, K.C., hesitated in his stride.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie, watching, saw that hesitation; saw his man come on again, head low, eyes on the pavement; and knew instinctively that Brunton would pretend not to recognize him, would try to push past him up the stone stairway. Resolutely, he planted himself across the stairway; and in that one second of time before they met face to face, the vision he had seen in the darkness of overnight flashed through his mind. Then he had his enemy in front of him, and was saying quietly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d like a word with you, Brunton.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The K.C. tried to pass; but Ronnie stood his ground.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m too busy to see you to-day, Cavendish.\" The voice sounded courteous enough; but a glance, a glance of insane rage, darted snake-like from behind the gray pupils. Brunton\u0027s great jowl twitched; the veins on his forehead were steel cords.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The matter is rather urgent.\" Ronnie, watching the approach of David Patterson, lowered his tone. \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t keep you a minute. Unless, of course,\" the tone rose, \"you prefer that our discussion should take place in public.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The fire in his blue eyes beat down the snake in Brunton\u0027s gray; and, without another word, Ronnie accompanied his man up the stairway, along the corridor into his chambers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n David Patterson made as if to follow, but Brunton barked over one shoulder, \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t need you,\" and the two of them were alone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And now,\" began the K.C., standing foursquare in front of his empty fireplace, \"I shall be glad to know the reason of this unwarrantable intrusion.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You know the reason as well as I do.\" The red mist still hung before Ronnie\u0027s eyes. He had forgotten the \"legal position\": he wanted to strike Brunton; to strike him across the sneering face. Only the code, the public school code of restraint, held him back.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I haven\u0027t the slightest idea why you should force your way into my chambers. Perhaps you will condescend to explain.\" Brunton, too, felt the code on him--heavy, like a net hampering his limbs. He wanted to free himself from the net; wanted to lash out at the man who had stolen Aliette, to destroy him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I came to ask you,\" Ronnie\u0027s lips hardly moved, \"how much longer you intend to delay.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Delay what?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your petition.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What petition?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your petition for divorce.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s my business.\" Brunton laughed--a harsh, bitter laugh, low in the throat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And mine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I fail to see the connection.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie\u0027s fists clenched. \"Apparently you take me for a fool.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Brunton laughed again. \"No. Only for a thief.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With an effort, Ronnie thrust his hands into his pockets. \"I didn\u0027t come here to bandy words with you. All I want to know is how soon you intend filing your petition.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When I choose.\" Rage mastered Aliette\u0027s husband. \"And if I don\u0027t choose--never.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now Ronnie laughed--contemptuously. \"You may be able to browbeat a woman in the box, but you can\u0027t browbeat me. I want an answer to my question. How soon do you intend to file your petition? This isn\u0027t only your business. It\u0027s mine--mine and----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Kindly keep my wife out of this discussion,\" snarled Brunton. \"Your question is a damned insult, and your presence here an infernal outrage. Neither you nor God Almighty can make me file the petition you refer to.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For a full minute the pair faced each other, tense, wordless, self-control fighting against instincts, instincts fighting against self-control. Then Brunton\u0027s nerve snapped.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hate the very sight of you,\" he shouted. \"Will you get out? Or have I got to throw you out?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t make a fool of yourself,\" said Ronnie; and his voice was ice. \"If it comes to violence I sha\u0027n\u0027t be the one who\u0027ll get the worst of it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took a step forward, and the K.C. recoiled before him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Answer my question, Brunton.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll see you to hell first, Cavendish.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And suddenly the red mist thickened to blood-color before Ronnie\u0027s eyes. He wanted to kill Brunton. Killing would be the easiest way to deal with Brunton--far the easiest way. His hands clenched in his trouser-pockets; he itched to take his hands out of his pockets, to dash them in those cold gray eyes, to seize that heavy jowl, to tear the life out of it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then, in a flash, his legal mind saw the consequences of that killing. The blood-red mist vanished. Swiftly his mood changed. He began to plead, to plead desperately, not for his own sake, but for Aliette\u0027s. He said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We\u0027re being selfish. It isn\u0027t of ourselves we have to think. Think of her position if you don\u0027t take action.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She should have thought of my position before she ran away with you,\" retorted the other. \"I tell you, I\u0027m not going to be hustled; and I\u0027m not going to be bullied. I\u0027ll take action when I choose; and not a minute before. Nothing that you, nothing that she, nothing that anybody else can do will persuade me to say one word further on this subject. Now, will you go?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And Ronnie went, realizing himself powerless. As he passed through the doorway he gave one glance at his adversary. His adversary still stood, like a bull at bay, against the empty grate; but the look in his adversary\u0027s eyes--a look which Ronnie could not fathom--was not the brave look of the bull; rather was it compound of fear and obstinacy, of injured pride and of determination for revenge; the look of the weak man who knows himself in the wrong, yet means to persist in his wrongdoing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Surely as night follows day in the firmament, so surely does reaction follow action in imaginative man. Ronald Cavendish\u0027s mind, as he crossed King\u0027s Bench Walk after his interview with Hector Brunton, was almost a blank. Reaction wiped out every detail of that interview. He remembered only Brunton\u0027s words, \"I\u0027ll take action when I choose.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Twice--the mad purpose of killing Brunton mastering him once more--he tried to turn back. But his feet carried him on, carried him away from Brunton, across the Walk to his own chambers. There, at least, was sanctuary--sanctuary from crime against the herd.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the herd, even his dazed mind knew, would not countenance his killing Brunton. Brunton was within his herd-rights, within the law; while they, he and Aliette, having broken the herd-rights, were outlaws. Still weak from reaction, he visioned the consequences of that outlawry; visioned Brunton relentless, Aliette without a friend.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till gradually, thinking of Aliette, his manhood came back to him. Let Brunton do his damnedest. Let them be outlaws. Even in their outlawry they would possess one another. Soon, Brunton would be brought to reason. Meanwhile, even if he were not soon brought to reason, they, the outlaws, would find people to stand by them; people like his mother. And at that, abruptly, Ronnie remembered the letter Aliette had written to her sister, the promise he had made to Jimmy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Somehow it needed more courage than he had required in facing Aliette\u0027s husband to lift the telephone and make his appointment with Mollie!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 6\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Over a snack of luncheon--snatched late and hastily at a little uncomfortable coffee-shop near the Griffin--Ronnie\u0027s usual calm returned. He realized that he had made a fool of himself in going to see Brunton; that Jimmy, after all, had been right. Confound Brunton! Brunton\u0027s \"dog-in-the-manger\" attitude would not endure, could not endure. Even Carrington had given way in the long run. It was only a question of patience. Still, he would have to break things very gently to Aliette\u0027s sister.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Betty Masterman was out; and Mollie received her sister\u0027s lover alone in the little red-papered sitting-room which seemed so cozy to the Philistine mind of James Wilberforce.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s nice of you to call,\" she said perfunctorily. The voice might have been that of Aliette, of the socially poised Aliette as Ronnie first remembered her: but the girl\u0027s violet eyes were stern with suspicion; her red lips showed unsmiling, uncompromising.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Won\u0027t you sit down?\" she went on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thanks. I sha\u0027n\u0027t keep you very long.\" Always impossibly shy with women, the man did not know how to begin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ve got some message for me,\" the girl prompted \"Some message from----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"From your sister.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She seated herself, avoiding his eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your sister and I,\" he began bruskly----\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in those four words--even without the halting explanation which followed--it seemed to Mollie Fullerford that she knew the whole story. But she was not going to help him out. Why should she? The story--carefully though he told it--revolted her. She felt hot; hot and dirty and ashamed. Hurt, too, as though the healed scars of her bodily wounds were opening afresh. All the suspicions of the past weeks, all her still-smoldering resentment that Aliette should have let her return unwarned to Hector\u0027s house, all her balked love for James Wilberforce, harshened Mollie\u0027s judgment. She saw Cavendish no longer a \"sober-sides\" but a hypocrite; and so seeing, hated him for his imagined hypocrisy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You see,\" he concluded, \"it wasn\u0027t Aliette\u0027s fault. I mean the running away in a hurry. You mustn\u0027t condemn her. I was to blame for that. I was to blame, from beginning to end.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course,\" said that Mollie who had once thought \"most women rotters.\" \"It\u0027s always the man who\u0027s to blame.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nevertheless her judgment softened. \"After all,\" she thought, \"he isn\u0027t beating about the bush. He\u0027s being perfectly straight with me.\" And she discovered to her great surprise that it was not their having run away together which had been hurting her, but their omission to take her into their confidence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie, trying to guess the verdict behind those averted eyes, drew Aliette\u0027s letter from his pocket; and handed it over without another word. Watching her open the envelope, watching her as she read, he saw her fingers tremble, her violet eyes suffuse.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And have you seen Hector?\" she asked at last.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. I saw him this morning.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did he say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie hesitated to tell the brutal truth; and the girl repeated her question, adding:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course he\u0027s going to divorce her.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m afraid, Miss Fullerford, that it\u0027s not going to be quite so easy as that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You don\u0027t mean to say that he isn\u0027t going to----?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He says he hasn\u0027t made up his mind----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But\"--the girl was stammering now--\"that\u0027s absolutely caddish. Hector\u0027s a gentleman. Alie\u0027s been perfectly straight with him. Besides, even if he had been badly treated, he couldn\u0027t, couldn\u0027t possibly----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And suddenly the full possibilities of Hector\u0027s persisting in a refusal to take action grew visible to the girl\u0027s mind. She braced herself to meet those possibilities; the personal consequences of them. She forced herself to ask:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you seen Mr. Wilberforce?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. Last night.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you ask his advice?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What was it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To do nothing. To wait.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At that, thought of her own love affair obsessed the girl\u0027s mind. She visualized James, there, in the very chair which Cavendish occupied. Remembering a thousand unspoken hesitancies of James, she saw only too clearly the reason of those hesitancies.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How long has Mr. Wilberforce known about--about you and my sister?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Some weeks, I believe.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re sure?\" The wounds hurt again, hurt desperately. James ought to have told her. \"He never said a word--to me.\" She could have borne it better from James than from Cavendish.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course he couldn\u0027t tell you anything about it, Miss Fullerford. It was a secret, a professional secret. My mother told him----\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your mother?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, my mother. She\u0027s with Aliette now.\" His voice softened. \"She\u0027s on our side. You\u0027ll be on our side, too? Won\u0027t you? You won\u0027t let this--this contretemps come between you and your sister? I\u0027m not asking anything for myself--but it\u0027s pretty rough luck on Alie.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mollie\u0027s decision crystallized. \"I can\u0027t go back on Alie,\" she thought. \"Whatever happens I mustn\u0027t go back on Alie.\" She remembered their conversation at Moor Park; remembered herself saying, \"I don\u0027t believe divorce is wrong.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" she said, and held out her hand. \"I shall stand by Alie whatever happens. Will you tell her that? And say I\u0027ll write in a day or two. I don\u0027t feel like--like writing to her at the moment.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie clasped her hand, and rose to go. He would have liked to thank her; he would have liked to say something more about Jimmy. But instinct restrained him. Perhaps, after all, she didn\u0027t care for Jimmy; perhaps the pallor of her cheeks, the drooped corners of her full red mouth were all for Alie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 7\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And next day Ronald Cavendish went back to Chilworth Cove. All the long train journey he was aware, growingly aware, of Aliette. Brunton and the herd, Wilberforce and Mollie receded into the background of his thoughts. He said to himself:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let Brunton do his worst. Aliette and I have our love, each other.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Love, all said and done, was the only issue. As for Brunton, they would face him together, face him with courage high and hearts unflinching. Courage! Courage and love! Weaponed with those two defenses, he and his mate, his mother at their side, could battle down the onslaught of any disaster.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3316/90609.html","bookId":400,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 4:36:23 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 4:36:23 AM"}
