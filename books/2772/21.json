I\u0027m just frustrated. I love you, but sometimes you have to trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. Not when it comes to Caleb. His family is still struggling to bounce back from the pain and suffering he caused all of us. You were the one physically hurt by his reckless stupidity. How can you protect him? Because he\u0027s a good-looking boy? There are plenty of them out there, honey. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t listen anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back later,\" I say as I walk out of the kitchen. I turn around before I leave and say, \"I love you, Mom. You know that, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. I love you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then trust me. I don\u0027t stick up for Caleb because he\u0027s good-looking. I stick up for him because he doesn\u0027t deserve all the bad things that have happened to him.\" I hold my hand up when I think she\u0027s going to cut me off. \"He made a mistake. Mom, we all make mistakes. Don\u0027t we all deserve a second chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head for Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 house in the Cadillac she gave me in her will. I miss her so much. She was the person who urged me to forgive Caleb, and she was right. I didn\u0027t want to at first. Just looking at Caleb when he came back from jail made my pulse race and my body shiver with anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then we talked. A lot. Before I realized he wasn\u0027t the one who hit me, I forgave him. And fell for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull up to the house, expecting it to be vacant. Lou, Mrs. Reynolds\u0027 son and my mom\u0027s boyfriend, is standing out front watering the grass. There\u0027s a For Sale sign out front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he sees me pull up, he smiles. \"Hiya, Maggie,\" he says. \"What brings you to this side of town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted to check the daffodils out back,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some are still blooming. I\u0027ve been trying to sell this place for months now, without a bite. Market is dead out here, so I\u0027m probably not going to be able to sell it any time soon.\" He sighs. I know he grew up in this house and it has sentimental value. His mom, Mrs. Reynolds, is gone, but her spirit is still here. \"Where\u0027s your mom?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At home.\" I guess I should let him know about the drama back home. \"She got mad because I never told her Caleb had joined the Re-START trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She called me about that a few hours ago,\" he tells me. \"Care to talk about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\" We walk to the backyard, side by side. My dad never walked with me anywhere. He was too busy going out of town for work or watching television. He didn\u0027t have an interest in me, or my mom. I used to pray he\u0027d come back. The last time we talked was months ago. He said he\u0027d come see me graduate from high school, but he never did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t even get a congratulatory call on graduation day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop thinking about my dad when I catch sight of the gardens in the backyard. I\u0027m surprised to see the daffodils are still thriving, the bright rainbow of colors immediately raising my spirits. It\u0027s breathtaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Mrs. Reynolds were alive, she\u0027d love them. She gave me meticulous directions on how to plant each bulb even though she knew she was dying and would never see them come up to display themselves with such radiance and, strangely enough, pride. Each variety seems to have an attitude all its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish Caleb were here to see them. He made the gazebo while I planted the daffodil bulbs, both of us slaving away to please Mrs. Reynolds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom\u0027s mad that I didn\u0027t quit the trip when I found out Caleb was on it,\" I tell Lou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to admit she has reason to distrust him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get it, but...\" I don\u0027t know how much to tell him. If he finds out Caleb didn\u0027t hit me with the car, he\u0027ll have to tell my mom. If she knows, she\u0027ll try and find out who really did hit me. And the vicious cycle would repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want that to happen. Since Caleb won\u0027t be coming back to Paradise, it\u0027s not worth the havoc it would cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like he\u0027s coming back to Paradise. He\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou sits one of the rocking chairs his mother used to sit in. \"How do you feel about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" I look over at Lou, rocking away. He reminds me of his mom. \"We kinda got close on the trip. It was nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I ask how close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit in the rocking chair beside him. We rock for a while, neither of us talking. The fresh summer air is warm even as the sun moves lower in the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou chuckles. \"You know, my mother would be giving us a piece of her mind right now. She\u0027d call us lazy, then she\u0027d give us chores and wouldn\u0027t be satisfied until we were working and sweating our butts off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I loved her,\" I tell him. I try not to think about losing her too much, or I\u0027ll break down and cry. Mrs. Reynolds was a strong lady and wouldn\u0027t want me to cry for her. \"Even when she made me work my butt off, I appreciated it. She was the first person after I got home from the hospital who didn\u0027t treat me as if I had a disability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She loved you, too. And I figure she liked Caleb,\" he says, gesturing toward the gazebo he knows Caleb built all by himself. He was assigned to work here to finish out his community service obligations. \"My mom always said I shouldn\u0027t hold grudges. Said they\u0027d ruin your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish my mom felt the same way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want me to talk to her about it?\" he asks. \"Maybe I can smooth the waters some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the guy who has not only been my mom\u0027s boss and the owner of Auntie Mae\u0027s diner, but also the only man who\u0027s made my mom smile again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mom\u0027s a sweet woman. She\u0027s just protective of you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" I wipe away an invisible piece of lint as I look down at my jeans. I used to hate that Lou was dating my mom. But now I can\u0027t help but be thankful he\u0027s in her life. And mine. \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve ever told you, but my mom\u0027s a new person since she started dating you. She needs you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat makes him smile. He clears his throat and says, \"I\u0027ve been meaning to ask you this for a while now, but I didn\u0027t gather up enough nerve before you left for the ReSTART program and now that you\u0027re here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clears his throat again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to ask your mother to marry me. Would that be okay with you, Maggie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewalk toward my house, the biggest one on the entire block. Maggie\u0027s house, next door, is practically dwarfed by ours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow the brick sidewalk that my dad and I laid three years ago up to the front door. My house looks familiar and yet ... in some ways totally foreign to me. I notice the paint peeling off of the wood trim. One of the gutters is falling off, and no flowers have been planted out front. My mom used to plant them every summer. She said it made our house look like a home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and focus on the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you come back home after running away? If I open the door and just walk in like I used to, they\u0027ll think I\u0027m an intruder. A stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill they treat me like one once they take a look at me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back down the street, wondering if I should retreat and forget coming home. I can just retrace my steps and disappear again. Nobody would know, and it would be easier than dealing with the drama about to unfold. But disappearing would be the coward\u0027s way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not a coward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot anymore, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my duffle down and ring the doorbell. My pulse is racing a billion times a second, like I just ran a marathon. Different scenarios about how my parents and sister will react are flying through my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear footsteps. Is it my mom, dad, or Leah? I don\u0027t have time to think about it too long because the door opens and my sister is standing in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy twin sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one I went to jail for. She\u0027s still got dyed-black hair, light brown at the roots, but her clothes aren\u0027t as freaky as when I left. Instead of chains dripping off her jeans, she\u0027s wearing normal jeans. Her shirt is black to match her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I saw her she looked like death. Her hair was black, her nails were black, and her mood matched her black clothes. It freaked me out at first, but then it pissed me off. I was the one who went to jail so she\u0027d live an easy life at home. How dare she become a recluse and change her appearance and attitude and live like the dead? She had no right ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least her nails aren\u0027t black, and she\u0027s not wearing black eyeliner and black lipstick. It\u0027s a big improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat goes dry at the same time tears flood her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb,\" she squeaks out. \"You came back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a little while, at least,\" I manage to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came home from jail, Leah had catapulted herself into my arms and hugged me tight. Not this time. She\u0027s definitely keeping her distance. Does she think I\u0027m a ghost or that I\u0027ll suddenly disappear if she gets close?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie said she was going to urge you to come home, but I didn\u0027t believe her.\" Her hands are stiff at her sides. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, believe it.\" I crane my head to see if there\u0027s anyone else home. \"Yeah, so, uh ... can I come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens the door wider and steps back. \"Yeah,\" she says slowly. \"Umm, Dad\u0027s not home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\" I ask as I step into the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah starts biting on one of her fingernails nervously. \"He went to visit Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Visit Mom? She\u0027s in rehab right now?\" Oh, hell. Maybe it\u0027s worse than I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been there awhile. It\u0027s not her first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a slow breath. \"All right.\" I can deal with this, but... \"Anything else I need to know about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Leah.\" I\u0027m on edge and want answers. Will she give them to me? \"Is Dad coping with things okay? What\u0027s your story these days?\" Man, why did I say that? I don\u0027t want to confront her when I haven\u0027t even been back for five minutes. \"Forget I asked that last part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah opens her mouth to say something, then closes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I invited a friend to stay over,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name\u0027s Lenny. If a guy who needs a haircut and wears a green T-shirt that says I\u0027m Your Daddy rings the doorbell, assume it\u0027s him.\" I couldn\u0027t leave Lenny out on the streets. When he isn\u0027t trying his best to be a complete asshole, he\u0027s not so repulsive. He even insisted on giving me a couple hours to get reacquainted with my family before he came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take my duffle and head up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\" Leah asks, her voice clearly in a panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" Leah yells, but it\u0027s too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the door to my room. Or what used to be my room. It\u0027s been turned into an office. No bed, no curtains, no closet full of clothes. Wow, they even got rid of my trophies. No sign of me anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn eight months all evidence of my life has been erased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a feeling coming back here was the biggest mistake of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ey mom is getting married.
