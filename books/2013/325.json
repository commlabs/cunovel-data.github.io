Financial collapse.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The empire reels. The Liberty Consign is mortally wounded. When the people learn that there have been other riots, in city after city-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Tiste Edur will be stirred awake.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrbyn’s eyes fixed on Venitt Sathad’s. ‘There are rumours of war in the west.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘West? What do you mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn invasion from the sea, that seems to be focused on the Tiste Edur themselves. Punitive, in the wake of the fleets. A distant empire that did not take kindly to the murder of its citizens. And now, reports of the Bolkando and their allies, massing along the border.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tight smile from Venitt Sathad. ‘The alliance we forged.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed. Another of Letur Anict’s brilliant schemes gone awry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hardly his exclusively, Orbyn. Your Patriotists were essential participants in that propaganda.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I wish I could deny that. And so we come to that single word, the one that filled my mind in the place of “honour”. I find you here, in Drene. Venitt Sathad, understand me. I know what you do for your master, and I know just how well you do it. I know what even Karos Invictad does not-nor have I any interest in enlightening him. Regarding you, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You wish to speak for yourself, now? Rather than the Patriotists?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To stay alive, yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then the word is indeed not honour.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrbyn Truthfinder, the most feared man in Drene, drained his cup of wine. He leaned back. ‘You sit here, amidst carnage. People hurry past and they see you, and though you are, in features and in stature, barely worth noting, notice you they do. And a chill grips their hearts, and they do not know why. But I do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou comprehend, then, that I must pay Letur Anict a visit.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, and I wish you well in that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Unfortunately, Orbyn, we find ourselves in a moment of crisis. In the absence of Overseer Brohl Handar, it falls to Letur Anict to restore order. Yes, he may well fail, but he must be given the opportunity to succeed. For the sake of the empire, Orbyn, I expect you and your agents to assist the Factor in every way possible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course. But I have lost thirty-one agents since yesterday. And those among them who had families… well, no-one was spared retribution.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is a sad truth, Orbyn, that all who have been rewarded by tyranny must eventually share an identical fate.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You sound almost satisfied, Venitt.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Indebted servant of Rautos Hivanar permitted a faint smile to reach his lips as he reached for his cup of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrbyn’s expression flattened. ‘Surely,’ he said, ‘you do not believe a mob is capable of justice?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They have been rather restrained, thus far.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You cannot be serious.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Orbyn, not one Tiste Edur has been touched.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because the rioters are not fools. Who dares face Edur sorcery? It was the very inactivity of the local Edur that incited the mobs to ever more vicious extremes-and I assure you, Letur Anict is well aware of that fact.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, so he would blame the Tiste Edur for this mess. How convenient.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am not here to defend the Factor, Venitt Sathad.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, you are here to bargain for your life.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will of course assist Letur Anict in restoring order. But I am not confident that he will succeed, and I will not throw away my people.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Actually, you will do just that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrbyn’s eyes widened. Sweat was now trickling down his face. His clothes were sticking patchily to the folds of fat beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Truthfinder,’ Venitt Sathad continued, ‘the Patriotists have outlived their usefulness, barring one last, most noble sacrifice. As the focus of the people’s rage. I understand there is a Drene custom, something to do with the season of storms, and the making of seaweed fisher folk-life-sized dolls with shells for eyes, dressed in old clothes and the like. Sent out to mark the season’s birth, I believe, in small boats. An offering to the sealords of old-for the storms to drown. Quaint and unsurprisingly bloodthirsty, as most old customs are. The Patriotists, Orbyn, must become Drene’s seaweed fisher folk. We are in a season of storms, and sacrifices are necessary.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruthfinder licked his lips. ‘And what of me?’ he asked in a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, that particular session of bargaining is not yet complete.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-325.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
