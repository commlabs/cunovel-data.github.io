You don\u0027t strike me as the kind of woman who wants bullshit and flattery instead of the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I want is to be seen as having more to offer than an inflatable sex doll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCross\u0027s brows shot up. \"Well, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we done?\" I stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping my wrist with his fingers, he pulled me back down. \"Hardly. We\u0027ve established some talking points: We have an intense sexual attraction and neither of us wants to date. So what do you want - exactly? Seduction, Eva? Do you want to be seduced?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was equally fascinated and appalled by the conversation. And, yes, tempted. It was hard not to be while faced with such a gorgeous, virile male so determined to get hot and sweaty with me. Still, the dismay won out. \"Sex that\u0027s planned like a business transaction is a turnoff for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Establishing parameters in the beginning makes it less likely that there\u0027ll be exaggerated expectations and disappointment at the conclusion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\" I scowled. \"Listen to yourself. Why even call it a f**k? Why not be clear and call it a seminal emission in a preapproved orifice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pissed me off by throwing his head back and laughing. The full, throaty sound flowed over me like a rush of warm water. My awareness of him heightened to a physically painful degree. His earthy amusement made him less sex god and more human. Flesh and blood. Real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed to my feet and backed out of reach. \"Casual sex doesn\u0027t have to include wine and roses, but for God\u0027s sake, whatever else it is, sex should be personal. Friendly even. With mutual respect at the very least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis humor fled as he stood, his eyes darkening. \"There are no mixed signals in my private affairs. You want me to blur that line. I can\u0027t think of a good reason to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to do jack shit, besides let me get back to work.\" I strode to the door and yanked on the handle, cursing softly when it didn\u0027t budge. \"Let me out, Cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt him come up behind me. His palms pressed flat to the glass on either side of my shoulders, caging me in. I couldn\u0027t think of my own self-preservation when he was so close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strength and demand of his will exuded an almost tangible force field. When he stepped close enough, it surrounded me, closing me in with him. Everything outside of that bubble ceased to exist, while inside it my entire body strained toward his. That he had such a profound, visceral effect on me while being so damn irritating had my mind spinning. How could I be so turned on by a man whose words should\u0027ve turned me completely off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn around, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes closed against the surge of arousal I felt at his authoritative tone. God, he smelled good. His powerful frame radiated heat and hunger, spurring my own wild desire for him. The uncontrollable response was intensified by my lingering frustration with Stanton and my more recent aggravation with Cross himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted him. Bad. But he was no good for me. Honestly, I could screw up my life on my own. I didn\u0027t need any help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy flushed forehead touched the air-conditioned glass. \"Let it go, Cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. You\u0027re too much trouble.\" His lips brushed behind my ear. One of his hands pressed flat to my stomach, the fingers splaying to urge me back against him. He was as aroused as I was, his c**k hard and thick against my lower back. \"Turn around and say good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisappointed and regretful, I turned in his grip, sagging against the door to cool my heated back. He was curved over me, his luxurious hair framing his beautiful face, his forearm propped against the door to bring him closer. I had almost no room to breathe. The hand he\u0027d had at my waist was now resting on the curve of my hip, tightening reflexively and driving me mad. He stared, his gaze searingly intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiss me,\" he said hoarsely. \"Give me that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanting softly, I licked my dry lips. He groaned, tilted his head, and sealed his mouth over mine. I was shocked by how soft his firm lips were and the gentleness of the pressure he exerted. I sighed and his tongue dipped inside, tasting me in long leisurely licks. His kiss was confident, skilled, and just the right side of aggressive to turn me on wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI distantly registered my purse hitting the floor; then my hands were in his hair. I pulled on the silky strands, using them to direct his mouth over mine. He growled, deepening the kiss, stroking my tongue with lush slides of his own. I felt the raging beat of his heart against my chest, proof that he wasn\u0027t just a hopeless ideal conjured by my fevered imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed away from the door. Cupping the back of my head and the curve of my bu**ocks, he lifted me off my feet. \"I want you, Eva. Trouble or not, I can\u0027t stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pressed full-body against him, achingly aware of every hot, hard inch of him. I kissed him back as if I could eat him alive. My skin was damp and too sensitive, my br**sts heavy and tender. My cl*t throbbed for attention, pounding along with my raging heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was vaguely aware of movement, and then the couch was against my back. Cross was levered over me with one knee on the cushion and the other foot on the floor. His left arm supported his torso while his right hand gripped the back of my knee, sliding upward along my thigh in a firmly possessive glide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath hissed out when he reached the point where my garter clipped to the top of my silk stocking. He tore his gaze away from mine and looked down, pushing my skirt higher to bare me from the waist down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Eva.\" A low rumble vibrated in his chest, the primitive sound sending goose bumps racing across my skin. \"Your boss is damned lucky he\u0027s g*y.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-13.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
