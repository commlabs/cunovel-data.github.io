His brothers, his whole team, stared at him as he trotted behind the protective barrier between home plate and the viewing stands and headed straight for Charlotte. Excitedly, she launched herself into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason grabbed her around her waist, lifted her from the bleachers and swung her down. Her eyes shone with happiness and Jason thought he’d never seen a more beautiful woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte threw back her head and laughed. It wasn’t for several minutes that Jason was even aware of the crowd that had gathered around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bit self-conscious now, he lowered Charlotte to the ground, but kept his arm around her. Paul and Rich were the first to congratulate him, followed by several other teammates, who slapped him heartily on the back. One suggested Jason bring Charlotte again, since she was definitely his good-luck charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were wonderful,” Charlotte said, smiling at him proudly. Jason found it difficult to pull his gaze away. The urge to kiss her was so strong, he had to fight to restrain himself. He would’ve done it, too, would’ve kissed her in front of everyone and ignored the consequences, if only his brothers hadn’t been present. He held back more to protect Charlotte from embarrassment than to ward off any razzing he’d get from his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m hungry,” Ryan, one of the twins, announced once the excitement had died down. “When are we gonna eat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soon,” Leah promised. Paul headed toward the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be right back,” Jason said and, without thinking, did the very thing he’d decided against. He kissed Charlotte briefly, before trailing after his brother to get the picnic basket in the trunk of his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason couldn’t believe he’d done that. Neither could Charlotte, judging by the look of surprise that flashed in her blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to fess up?” Paul asked, holding a heavy cooler with both hands, studying Jason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To what?” he demanded, narrowing his eyes, hoping his brother would take the hint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Charlotte.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t go all defensive on me. I was just wondering how you met.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason relaxed a little. He was being too touchy. “She lives in the complex.” He didn’t think it would sound good if he admitted Carrie had offered him money to take her mother out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She seems nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is. Lay off her, though, will you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul’s eyes went solemn, as if he was offended by Jason’s remark. Then he nodded. “Whatever you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul must’ve said something to Rich, too, because when they sat down to eat, after pushing three picnic tables together, no one gave Charlotte more than a glance. It was as though she’d been part of the family for years. Which was just the way Jason wanted everyone to treat her. Heaven forbid she figure out how special she was to him. He’d already made a big enough fool of himself, simply by inviting her and Carrie to this outing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte’s daughter had won a few hearts all on her own, Jason saw, secretly pleased. Ryan and Ronnie had clamored to sit next to her at lunch, beating out Bethany, who cried with disappointment until Carrie agreed to hold the little girl on her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think Carrie’s made a conquest,” Jason said to Charlotte, munching on a chocolate chip cookie. His fourth, and he was ready for another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She loves children. She’s the type of kid who’d prefer to be the oldest of ten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason watched as a sadness, however brief, flashed in Charlotte’s eyes. It told him she wasn’t speaking only for Carrie, but herself, as well. She must’ve wanted so much more from her marriage than she’d gotten. He remembered something else then, something Carrie had told him about Charlotte wanting more children. At the time he’d decided to stay away. A woman with marriage and children on her mind was someone he planned to avoid. Strangely, the thought didn’t terrify him nearly as much now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, he had to admit that the fleeting look of pain got to him. He’d experienced the desire to protect her in the past, to guard her from hurt, but only when she was in his arms. Only when he feared he might hurt her. Now, the need to keep her safe burned in his chest. He wanted to block out anything that would cause her pain. Most of all, he wanted to meet the ex-husband who’d walked away from his family, and he’d prefer it be in a dark alley some night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he didn’t know any details of the divorce, Carrie had told him she never heard from her father. What kind of man would desert his family? What kind of man would turn a warm, vivacious woman like Charlotte into a near-recluse?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like your family,” Charlotte said, smiling up at him, distracting him from his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did Leah and Jamie bombard you with questions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A few, but they’re so nice, I didn’t mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you tell them?” Jason was eager to know, partially because it might clear up a few questions he had himself. Maybe Charlotte could put into perspective what he was feeling and was unable to define.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, causing the others to momentarily look their way. “Are you worried?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” The question surprised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For a moment there, you looked as if you were afraid I might’ve told them something you’d rather I didn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can tell them anything you want,” he said decisively, meaning it. If she chose to imply that they were madly in love, then fine, he’d deal with it. On the other hand, if she’d chosen to let his family believe they’d only just met, which wasn’t so far from the truth, then he’d live with that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told them we’re friends…special friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason approved. He couldn’t have said it better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Jase,” Ronnie shouted, clutching a Frisbee. “Are we ready to play?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Play?” Jason didn’t need to be invited twice. His favorite part of these family get-togethers was the time after lunch that he spent with his nieces and nephews. Chasing after Ronnie and Ryan and a Frisbee kept him young at heart, he told himself. Though he didn’t care to admit out loud just how much he liked running around with a pair of eight-year-olds. The boys enjoyed it, too, and before the afternoon was over Rich and Paul invariably joined in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they did now. The two brothers against Jason and a handful of youngsters in a game of Frisbee football. A few minutes into the competition, Jason dived to catch a wild throw, catapulting himself into the air and latching triumphantly on to the disk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonnie and Ryan cheered, and Jason felt as pleased with his small feat as he’d been with the home run. After an hour, the two teams took a break. Breathless, he reached for a cold soda, pulled back the tab and guzzled it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, looking for Charlotte. The last time he’d seen her she was with Leah and Jamie cleaning up the remains of their picnic. He saw her sitting on a blanket under a madrona tree, bouncing Jeremy on her knee. Bethany and Kelsey were sprawled out, napping, beside her. She was playing a game with the baby, nuzzling his neck and making cooing sounds. Her eyes radiated a happiness he’d never seen. A joy that transfixed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jason, are you in or out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason barely heard the words, his gaze on Charlotte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In,” he decided, tossing the empty can in the garbage and heading back to the field. A couple of minutes later he was completely engrossed in the game. Carrie had sided with his brothers against him and was proving to be a worthy opponent. Ronnie caught the Frisbee and lobbed it to his twin. Jason glanced toward Charlotte again and saw her lift Jeremy above her head and laugh up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason’s heart constricted. Watching Charlotte with his brother’s child did funny things to his chest. She was smiling, happy. A powerful emotion seized his heart in a way that was almost painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne pain was followed almost immediately by another as the Frisbee hit him hard. The wind momentarily knocked out of him, he doubled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Jase!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jason!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul and Ronnie were the first to reach him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You all right?” Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason’s eyes moved toward Charlotte and he shook his head. “No,” he muttered, “I don’t think I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this was what it meant to be part of a family, Charlotte mused, as Jason drove her and Carrie home from the ball field. This profound sense of belonging, of acceptance. She’d never experienced anything like it before. It was as though Jason’s family had known and loved her for years. As though they genuinely cared for her. Charlotte couldn’t recall a time when she’d felt anything as uplifting as she had that afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the game they’d gathered together for a picnic. Charlotte didn’t think she’d ever laughed more. There’d been good-natured teasing, jokes, games. Even now, driving home, laughter echoed in her ears. The cousins were as close as brothers and sisters, the older ones watching out for the smaller children. They fought like brothers and sisters, too, mostly over Carrie, each wanting her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrie had beamed, loving every minute of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the initial round of questions, Leah and Jamie had treated Charlotte like…well, like family. The women were obviously good friends, yet included Charlotte in all their conversations. Jason’s brothers, too, had tried to make her feel comfortable. Neither Paul nor Rich had asked a single question about her relationship with Jason, probably content to have their wives fill in the gaps later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re very quiet,” Jason said, taking his eyes off the road for a second. “Anything wrong? My brothers didn’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she assured him with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only sound was the hum of the road. Carrie, usually filled with boundless energy, was exhausted after chasing the children around for most of the afternoon. She’d enjoyed herself as much as Charlotte had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd perhaps her daughter was thinking the same thing Charlotte was—that she’d missed out on something important because they only had each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason parked the car, then carried the near-empty picnic basket into her kitchen. He hesitated after setting it on the counter. “You’re sure nothing’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte nodded. “Positive. I had a wonderful time. A fabulous time. Thank you for asking Carrie and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t seem to believe her. “Did Leah and Jamie hound you with questions?” he asked for the second time that day, a pensive frown on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jason,” she murmured, resting her hands on his forearms and gazing up at him. “I meant it. Every word. This day with you and your brothers and their families was one of the happiest of my life. If I’m being introspective it’s because…well, because I’ve never realized until now how much I’ve missed in life.” Jason’s questioning eyes sought hers, as if he wasn’t sure he understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed to meet his eyes. She felt close to Jason just then, closer than she had to anyone, and that confused her. She was falling in love with this man and that was something she couldn’t allow. Was it Jason she loved, or his family? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-manning-grooms-those-manning-men-0/page-12.html","bookId":1982,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:50 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:50 AM"}
