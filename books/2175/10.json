Peeping through them at fitful intervals, waiting for the demon master and his cohorts to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours later. Footsteps on the stairs. My heart almost stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanting. Eyes wide. Remembering the carnage - Mum, Dad, Gret. Praying it\u0027s quick. I don\u0027t want to suffer. Maybe I should take the blade of the axe to my throat before the demons...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhistling - Dervish!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moan with relief. The footsteps stop, then start towards my room. I scurry underneath the covers and draw them up around my chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish opens the door and sticks his head in. \"You OK, Grubbs?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I answer weakly. \"Just a bad dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can sit with you if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m fine.

I want to rush to it and slam it all the way shut, but I don\u0027t dare step off the bed - afraid Vein or Artery might be lying beneath, waiting to snap at my ankles and drag me off into their world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn takes an age to come, but eventually the sun rises and burns my fears away with its cleansing rays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sun clears the horizon and chases the shadows of night westward, I crawl out of bed, over to the window, and throw it open. The morning air is chilly but welcome. I gulp it down like water, my head clearing, my shakes subsiding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid the painting really talk to me or did I just imagine it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI honestly don\u0027t know. I think it was real. But I was extra tense. Overreacting to everything. It could have been a hallucination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was definitely real - the werewolf photos. I didn\u0027t imagine them. They\u0027re what I must focus on. The Lord Loss mystery can wait. I went down the cellar to find evidence of a werewolf. And I believe I found it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to call in the expert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paging Bill-E Spleen...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI phone while Dervish sleeps. Ma Spleen answers, even grumpier than usual. \"It\u0027s seven twenty-three!\" she snaps. \"He\u0027s still asleep and so was I!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" I say calmly. \"This is important.

Find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the phone down before he can ask any further questions, confident that his curiosity will entice him. Start thinking about what I\u0027m going to tell Dervish to explain Bill-E\u0027s being here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arrives at 09:17, schoolbag slung across his back, left eye squinting suspiciously, black hair slick with sweat - he must have run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t come any earlier or Gran would have been suspicious,\" he says, entering by the huge front doors, which I hold open for him like a butler. He looks around like a detective. \"Where\u0027s Dervish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In his study. I told him you were coming to work on a school project with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He believed that?\" Bill-E snorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d no reason not to. He doesn\u0027t know we know about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E looks at me smugly. \"So you think I\u0027m telling the truth now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lead him through to the kitchen before answering. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coolio! What changed your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit down. So does Bill-E. \"I\u0027ve seen his lair,\" I mutter, and proceed to tell him everything about the deer, my exploration of the wine cellar and the sub-cellar beyond (only leaving out the section relating to Lord Loss - that\u0027s personal).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:15. Bill-E arguing that Dervish doesn\u0027t pose a threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you see?\" he groans with exasperation. \"The cage is for him! He knows the change is upon him. That\u0027s why he caught the deer and stuck it in there. Tonight he\u0027ll lock himself in, and when he changes he\u0027ll feed upon the deer and stay caged there until morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will he get out?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meera. That must be why she\u0027s here. She knows about his sickness and probably comes every month to help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think back,\" I urge him. \"You say you\u0027ve been watching Dervish every time there\u0027s been a full moon. Has Meera been here? Or anybody else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E shifts uncomfortably. \"Well, no, not every time. But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how does he get out?\" I interrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E thinks a moment. \"He must hang the key nearby,\" he says. \"He lets himself out when the change has passed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s to stop him using it when he transforms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E rolls his eyes. \"Have you ever heard of a wolf that can use a key?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He used it the other night. When he brought the deer back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he hadn\u0027t transformed then,\" Bill-E notes. \"You said he looked the same as always.\" He stands and paces around the kitchen as he outlines his thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the way it must work. During the lead-up to the full moon - and for a few nights after -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dervish\u0027s hormones are all over the place. I don\u0027t think he physically changes, but he isn\u0027t in full control of himself, which is why he wanders about the forest, hunting animals. At the same time, he\u0027s human enough not to attack people. He doesn\u0027t kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the night of the full moon, it\u0027s different. The beast comes to the fore. It takes over. He can\u0027t risk loosing it on the world. It would kill at random - animals, humans... whatever it found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he chains himself up.\" Bill-E clicks his fingers with excitement. \"He locks himself in the cage, ensuring there\u0027s a live animal for the beast to rip to pieces and feed on. He stays there all night, howling, transformed, wild. In the morning, when the phase passes, he lets himself out and carries on as normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E stops and smiles warmly. \"I\u0027ve always admired Dervish, but never as much as I do right now. He\u0027s dealing with his curse. Living as normal a life as he can, yet protecting the world from the monster within him, locking himself away when he must, enduring the loneliness and hardship...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop,\" I remark sarcastically. \"You\u0027ll make me cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E whirls on me angrily. \"What did you call me for?\" he barks. \"If it was just to sneer, I can leave as quickly as I came!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t to sneer,\" I mumble. \"I asked you here to help.\" I stare miserably at him. \"I\u0027m scared. If he changes tonight and comes after me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t,\" Bill-E says confidently. \"The cage is there to prevent that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I nod. \"But I\u0027m not sure I want to run the risk. I was thinking I could maybe come stay with you for a night or two...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E blinks. \"I\u0027ve never had a friend over to stay,\" he says. \"I don\u0027t think Gran and Grandad would like it. Especially not after you woke them up this morning.\" His face brightens. \"Tell you what. I\u0027ve a better idea - I\u0027ll come and stay here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will that achieve?\" I frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fatter than you,\" he laughs, patting his stomach. \"If the werewolf gets free, it\u0027ll go for me first, since I\u0027m so tasty-looking. That\u0027ll give you a chance to run for freedom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crazy,\" I huff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I am,\" he smiles. \"After all, I\u0027m a Grady!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long, tense day. Bill-E, despite his good-humoured assertions that we have nothing to be afraid of, is just as nervous as me. In some ways he\u0027s worse - he looks very pale and has been sick a couple of times. He says it\u0027s some bug he\u0027s had for the last few days, but I\u0027m sure it\u0027s nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should go home,\" I suggest as he returns from his latest vomit trip to the toilet. \"You won\u0027t be much use throwing up all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be too sure,\" he smiles thinly. \"Perhaps I can repel the werewolf with puke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one I never saw in the movies!\" I laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E has to leave in the afternoon, to check in with Ma and Pa Spleen and pretend he\u0027s been to school. \"I\u0027ll have a quick meal, do some homework, then tell Gran I\u0027m coming here for the night -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027ll say it\u0027s part of a nature project, that I\u0027m doing an essay on the habits of nocturnal creatures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so far from the truth,\" I grimace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my room. Alone. A knock on the door - Dervish. \"Where\u0027s Bill-E?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a shame - I was going to cook pancakes. I\u0027ve a sudden craving for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to tell Dervish that Bill-E\u0027s returning to stay the night. Before I can, he says, \"I have to head out later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m meeting Meera. We\u0027re going to see some old friends. I could be gone all night. You\u0027ll be OK by yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod wordlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you a shout before I go,\" he promises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the phone to Ma Spleen, asking for Bill-E. \"He just got home from school,\" she says frostily. \"He\u0027s eating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything seems to be important today,\" she grumbles, but calls him to the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you return, enter by the back door and try not to let Dervish see you,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just told me he\u0027s going out for the night. He thinks I\u0027m going to be here by myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s quit with the seen it all, done it all act,\" I snap. \"If Dervish is what we think, there could be trouble tonight - real trouble. If he doesn\u0027t know you\u0027re in the house, he won\u0027t expect to find you if he gets free later. That might work in our favour in case of an attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There won\u0027t be an attack,\" Bill-E insists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe - but come in by the back anyway, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment\u0027s pause. Then, in a subdued tone, Bill-E mutters, \"OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E sneaks in without Dervish spotting him. Hides in my room. We keep the door shut and our voices low when we speak - which isn\u0027t often. I keep a firm hold on the axe I\u0027ve been lugging about for the past few nights. Bill-E still doesn\u0027t believe we\u0027re in any danger, but he has a short sword lying on the bed close by, which I fetched for him from downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s in a terrible state, white and shivering. He\u0027s been sick three times in the space of the last couple of hours. I see now that it isn\u0027t nerves - he really is ill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be home in bed,\" I whisper as he wraps blankets around himself and gulps down a glass of warm milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like death,\" he groans, eyes watering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head firmly. \"Not until morning. I\u0027m going to see this through with you, to prove that Dervish isn\u0027t a killer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops me with a quick cutting motion. \"He\u0027s coming!\" he hisses, and tumbles off the bed, dragging his blankets and empty glass with him, lying flat on the floor, holding his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit up in bed and open a comic, which I pretend to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, Dervish knocks and enters. \"Coming for dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks - not very hungry tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sniffs the air, nose crinkling. \"It smells of sick in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" I laugh sheepishly. \"I threw up earlier. Think it was something I ate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have told me.\" He walks over and lays the back of his hand against my forehead. If he bends forward just a few centimetres more, he\u0027ll spot the prone Bill-E Spleen...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No fever,\" Dervish says, stepping back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. Like I said - something I ate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope that\u0027s all it is.\" He looks troubled. Checks his watch, then glances out the window. \"If you get sick again later, I won\u0027t be here to drive you to the doctor. Maybe I should take you into the Vale for the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s OK,\" I say quickly. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross my heart and smile blithely. \"Never felt better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm...\" He doesn\u0027t look happy, but takes me at my word. \"Want me to drop you up anything from the kitchen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks - I\u0027ll wander down later and grab something light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you tomorrow then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow,\" I smile, and hold the smile in place until he exits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phew!\" I gasp when the coast is clear. \"You can get up now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E rises from behind the bed like a ghost, grinning sickly. Then his face blanches, he clutches his stomach and rushes for the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my eyes to the heavens and sigh. Of all the nights he could have picked to be sick, why this one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight. The moon rising. A roar from the corridor - \"I\u0027m off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye!\" I shout in reply. A quick shared glance with Bill-E, then we both rush to the room behind this one - with a view of the rear yard - and press up against the circle of stained glass, watching to see what Dervish does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bet he heads straight down the cellar,\" Bill-E says confidently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so,\" I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later Dervish emerges and walks to the sheet of corrugated iron close to the sheds. He carefully removes it, unlocks the chains and casts them aside. Bill-E\u0027s smiling knowingly - but the smile fades when Dervish drags the sheet of corrugated iron back over the doors, turns and heads off in the direction of the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do now?\" I ask quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might just be going to...\" Bill-E starts, but hasn\u0027t the heart to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two choices,\" I growl. \"We let him go - or we follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to go into the forest after him?\" Bill-E asks uncertainly. \"If he transforms out there and the beast spots us...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least we know what to expect, and we\u0027re prepared,\" I grunt, hefting my axe. \"Nobody else knows what he is. If we let him go and he kills...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill-E rolls his eyes, but says sullenly, \"We\u0027ll follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurrying from the room. In the hall downstairs, Bill-E stops to grab a sword, longer and sharper than the one I gave him earlier. While he\u0027s at it, he plucks a couple of knives, sticks one in his belt, hands the other to me. \"Double security,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your thinking,\" I grin shakily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we\u0027re gone - frightened, courageous, crazy - tracking a werewolf. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-10.html","bookId":2175,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:41:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:41:32 PM"}
