My vision shifted, blurred, and tingled. My head cocked to the side. Static filled the air, devouring oxygen. Blake gagged, dropping to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arum rose up, spinning around and rushing the door. Their black tendrils reached out, knocking off furniture and sending picture frames to the floor. They drew up short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leaving so soon?” a deep, furious voice said from the doorway. “I’m offended.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon shifted into his true form and took out the first Arum with one blast followed by another…and then another. Pieces of it broke away and floated up and up, disappearing into thin wisps before they reached the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew Residon, the one who’d wanted Dee, back to me. He was caught between Daemon and me, like a ping-pong ball. My light pulsed. Daemon’s flared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResidon roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me what has happened, Daemon’s voice whispered among my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him everything about Blake and Vaughn while we worked on Residon, tearing him down. But movement caught my attention. Vaughn was trying to work the window open. When he got nowhere with that, he grabbed the floor lamp and swung it toward the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze the lamp and then whipped it out of his hands. Vaughn spun around, dashing behind Daemon. In the chaos, Blake had made it outside somehow. So had Daemon and Residon. Three forms streaked into my house. I heard a wailing sound, and it drove deep inside me, darkening a part of me. There was a crack and one of the large oaks came down, landing near the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh was in her human form, tugging on her brother’s lifeless body, pulling him into her lap. Her head was tipped back, her mouth open as she keened and wept. Dee was moving beside her, growing stronger and stronger. And I knew her wail would soon join Ash’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaughn? Blake? They wouldn’t escape this. I glided out of the living room, my feet on the ground, but I didn’t feel the steps. I passed Matthew as he rushed into the living room; the startled cry he let out splintered my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon burned brighter than I’d ever seen. A pure, concentrated white light tinged in red as he darted down the driveway toward the mass of shadows gathering. His light flared intensely, and I threw up my arm, shielding my eyes. I thought of the DOD officers he’d turned to ash…and again I thought of an atomic bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light had turned that bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bolt of lightning shot from Daemon and slammed into Residon, spinning him into the air. Suspended, the Arum flickered from shadows to human form and then froze, his upper body human and his lower body nothing more than smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he broke into a thousand shards with a loud crack that sounded like thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snow fell heavier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of my eye, I saw Vaughn leaping from behind my car—the spot he had been cowering in. Gun in hand, he rushed toward his Expedition at the same moment Blake spun toward the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could even move, Daemon threw out a light-encased arm and the Expedition lurched into the air, flipping over Vaughn, exposing him. The roof gave with a crunch. Glass exploded in every which direction as metal snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn awe of such power, I froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon whipped toward Blake, catching him by the throat. A heartbeat later, he had the boy against the hood of my car, and in his human form, he was no less frightening or powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea how painful I’m going to make this for you,” Daemon said, eyes like orbs of white light. “For every bruise you gave Kat, I’m going to return to you tenfold.” He lifted Blake off my hood. The boy’s feet dangled in the air. “And I’m going to seriously enjoy this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaughn made his move then. Rushing forward, he raised the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daemon!” I shot toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaughn pulled the trigger. Once. Twice. Three times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s head jerked around and he smiled—he actually smiled. And the bullets…they stopped inches from Daemon’s face. They just hovered there, as if someone had pressed pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really shouldn’t have done that,” Daemon growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComprehension showed in Vaughn’s pale face. “No—no!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullets flipped over and returned to the sender with an alarming speed. They hit Vaughn in the chest and that was that. There was no chance for any more reactions. The man’s legs crumpled and he was nothing but a lifeless heap beside the twisted metal of the Expedition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed spread across the snow in a stream of scarlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake tore free, hitting the side of my bumper, and then he was up, running toward the woods. He was fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot as fast as Daemon, and not as fast as me. Wind and snow blew back at me as I gave chase. Blood didn’t pump. Light did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught up to Blake by a pine tree. He spun around, sending a blast of light at me. It struck my chest, knocking me back a few steps. Pain shimmied down my body, but I straightened…and I tracked forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw another pulse of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt ricocheted off my shoulder. Liquid warmth cascaded down my arm, but I pressed on, stalking him, taunting him. Another took my leg out from underneath me, but I picked myself back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were shaking. “I’m sorry…” he said. “Katy, I’m sorry. I didn’t have a choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were always choices. I’d made a string of bad ones myself. At least I could admit that. Part of me felt bad for him. He was a product of his family, but he had choices. He just made the wrong ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike me…?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeautiful light approached from behind, moving out to my right. He had gone back to his true form. What do you want to do with him? Daemon asked calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe…he killed Adam. My power flickered with that, and I could see skin beneath my hands. They were covered in red. A switch had been thrown inside me. Everything left me, and I swayed on the ground, my boots sinking through snow. I couldn’t do this anymore. “He killed him. And hurt Dee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s form burned as bright as the sun, and for a moment, I thought that it was for Blake, but he dimmed out, taking human shape. Mutated or not, Daemon would have a problem with killing another human, especially after Vaughn. I knew this. The wound left over from the two officers he’d taken out still festered. Add Blake to the list, and he might never heal. The wound would gape forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a breath, I said, “So many have died tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake’s eyes darted to me. “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry. I never wanted any of this happen. I only wanted to protect Chris.” He drew in a ragged breath, wiping at the blood under his nose. “I’m—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” Daemon growled. “Go. Go now before I don’t give you a choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock rippled over Blake’s face. “You’re letting me go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon glanced at me, and I lowered my head, exhausted and shamed. If I’d only listened to Daemon in the beginning, trusted that his instinct regarding Blake had not been off. But I hadn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go and never, ever come back here,” Daemon said, his words carrying on the wind. “If I ever see you again, I will kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake hesitated for only a moment, and then he spun and ran. I doubted he would make it very far, because once Nancy—whoever she really was—and the DOD realized he’d failed, they’d kill Chris like Blake feared. And that would be the end of Blake. Maybe that was why Daemon was letting him go. Blake was as good as dead anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr neither of us could kill anymore. I was done. Daemon was done. Too many had died tonight. My legs folded under me, and I knelt in the snow. Using the Source had weakened me and fighting Blake, the injuries inflicted, caused my thoughts to run together in an endless stream of confusion and regret. I doubted I’d ever feel strong enough again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipping in and out of consciousness, I was vaguely aware of someone holding me. There was this incredible warmth cascading through my veins. When I opened my eyes again, I was bathed in light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a buzzing through the connection and then… I told you we couldn’t trust him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain I felt couldn’t be healed by his touch, couldn’t be erased in his light. I squeezed my eyes shut, but the tears leaked out. I’m sorry. I thought…I thought if I learned how to fight, I could keep you safe, all of you safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis light pulled back and then it was Daemon staring down at me, eyes a brilliant shade of white. His body shook with the force of his anger, which was so at odds compared to the gentleness of his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daemon, I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t apologize. Just don’t apologize.” Daemon lifted me out of his lap and sat me on the cold ground. Climbing to his feet, he drew in a ragged breath. “Did you know he was working with the DOD this entire time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I climbed to my feet, swaying to the side as my legs got used to working again. He reached out, cupping my elbow until I stopped moving, then he let go. “I didn’t know until a few nights ago. And even then I wasn’t sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit,” he spat, taking a step back. “Was that the night you went to Vaughn’s on your own?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but I wasn’t sure.” I lifted my hands, surprised to see them covered in blood. Mine? Someone else’s? “I should’ve told you then, but I didn’t know for sure, and I didn’t want to add anything for you to worry about.” My voice cracked. “I didn’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked away, jaw clenching. “Adam is dead. My sister almost lost her life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in a painful breath. “I’m so—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t! Don’t you dare apologize!” he yelled, eyes glowing through the darkness, through me. “Adam’s death will destroy my sister. I told you we couldn’t trust Blake, that if you wanted to learn how to fight, I would’ve shown you! But you didn’t listen. And you’ve brought the DOD into your life, Kat! Who knows what they know now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t tell him anything!” My chest was rising rapidly. My breath came out short. “I never told him you healed me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s eyes narrowed. “Do you think he didn’t guess?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced, at a loss what to say. “I’m sorry,” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flinched. “And those times you were covered in bruises? That was him, wasn’t it? He was hurting you during training, wasn’t he? And never once did you think there may be something wrong with him? God dammit, Kat! You’ve lied to me. You didn’t trust me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do trust—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bullshit!” Daemon was in my face. “Don’t say you trust me when it’s apparent you never did!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing I could say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burst of energy left him, slamming into an ancient oak. It cracked with a loud snapping sound and then folded into a tree beside it. I jumped, gasping for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of this could’ve been prevented. Why couldn’t you trust me?” His voice cracked, and the sound reverberated through me like a barb-tailed whip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I had. My trust should’ve been placed in the one person I’d always trusted. I’d been fooled. Worse yet, I’d let myself be fooled. Tears streamed down my cheeks, a never-ending river of remorse. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-51.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
