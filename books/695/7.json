Alice got behind a tree, for fearof being run over, and watched them go by.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers souncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something orother, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, sothat the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Then came the horses. Having four feet, these managed ratherbetter than the foot-soldiers: but even THEY stumbled now and then;and it seemed to be a regular rule that, whenever a horse stumbled therider fell off instantly. The confusion got worse every moment, and Alicewas very glad to get out of the wood into an open place, where she foundthe White King seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　`I\u0027ve sent them all!\u0027 the King cried in a tone of delight, on seeingAlice. `Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you camethrough the wood?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　`Yes, I did,\u0027 said Alice: `several thousand, I should think.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　`Four thousand two hundred and seven, that\u0027s the exact number,\u0027 theKing said, referring to his book. `I couldn\u0027t send all the horses, you know,because two of them are wanted in the game.

Suddenlyshe brightened up. `Look, look!\u0027 she cried, pointing eagerly. `There\u0027s theWhite Queen running across the country!
