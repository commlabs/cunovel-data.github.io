Little Fatty’s Power (3)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terrifying Destruction-attribute attack had been so powerful that not even Heavenly Kings would’ve been able to tolerate it. And yet, the attack began to dissipate with incredible speed, revealing the unharmed figure of someone who should’ve been burnt to a crisp. A dazzling golden light had formed a membrane around his body, preventing any of the terrifying destructive power of the Heavenly Core Nucleus detonation from bypassing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“T-this is impossible...” the Blood Red Hell’s Heavenly King rasped hoarsely. His disbelieving eyes were about to pop out of their sockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilver light flashed. A light swishing sound could be heard, followed by the head of the first (and heavily-injured) Heavenly King being severed from his neck. Silver Emperor Wing Slash!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way that Zhou Weiqing would make the second mistake twice. He chose to start with killing the first wounded Heavenly King, who was also in a state of disbelief. He certainly wasn’t able to endure a second Heavenly Core Nucleus detonation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fiery light and the golden light vanished at the same time. Zhou Weiqing released his two wings which had been wrapped around Shangguan Bing’er, a strange smile appearing at the corner of his lips. It seemed as though his opponent was now unable to fight back. In fact, the Blood Red Hell’s Heavenly King was no longer even able to staunch his blood loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve always been a really kind person.\u0026nbsp;I know you are very puzzled, so I’ll won’t let you die and become an ignorant ghost.\u0026nbsp;The thing I used to block your self-detonation was a defensive technique included in my cultivation technique which is known as the Immortal Deity Shield.\u0026nbsp;See ya.”\u0026nbsp;As his final words came out, he remorselessly struck out with the crying-head hammer and smashed the Heavenly King’s head into a pulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er stared at the gruesome sight before her, her face rather pale. Her eyes, however, were only filled with amazement. She turned to stare disbelievingly at Zhou Weiqing: “T-they were Heavenly King powerhouses?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t be blamed for her disbelief.\u0026nbsp;It must be remembered that her most important memories were of the Zhou Little Fatty who had become a Jewel Master alongside her!\u0026nbsp;Back then, he had known nothing about Jewel Masters at all and needed to be taught so many things.\u0026nbsp;But now, just a few short years later, he had eradicated two Heavenly King powerhouses with his Dual Hammers as easily as cutting cabbage.\u0026nbsp;Not even a Heavenly Core Nucleus explosion had been able to injure him in the slightest.\u0026nbsp;What sort of power was this?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing panted loudly as he listened to her question, a streak of blood trickling out of his mouth.\u0026nbsp;He was every bit as shocked as she was!\u0026nbsp;Before this battle just now, if anyone had told him that he would be able to dominate and defeat a pair of low level Heavenly Kings, he would’ve thought that person to be insane.\u0026nbsp;And yet, the truth was right in front of them.\u0026nbsp;Those two low level Heavenly Kings hadn’t even given him too much pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eW-was this the power of Saint Energy? A sense of deep understanding slowly began to rise within Zhou Weiqing’s heart as a marvelous feeling suffused his entire body. He ignored the two corpses and shouted, “Bing’er, let’s go. You control the horse!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er immediately released the Ghost Demon Horse.\u0026nbsp;The two once more mounted the horse, with Zhou Weiqing handing over control of the horse to Shangguan Bing’er.\u0026nbsp;He himself held onto her slender waist, eyes closed as he entered a state of meditation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat battle had seemed to be very fast and very simple, with Zhou Weiqing gaining a complete victory, but in truth he had immediately used all his power from the very start.\u0026nbsp;This had allowed him to catch his opponents off-guard.\u0026nbsp;Otherwise, there was no way he could’ve so easily defeated a pair of Heavenly Kings attacking in concert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other reason for his victory had been the Dragon Silencing Seal.\u0026nbsp;He hadn’t needed to accumulate power, nor was a Heavenly Skill Image manifested.\u0026nbsp;And yet, it wouldn’t be exaggerated to say that its power had increased tenfold.\u0026nbsp;The two Dragon Silencing Seals had caused the two Heavenly Kings to temporarily lose their Consolidated Equipment and their Stored Skills.\u0026nbsp;This was what had swung the fight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his Saint Energy was able to form a continuous loop, Zhou Weiqing realized that when he used the energy it gained some different properties, especially when activating techniques which produced a Heavenly Skill Image.\u0026nbsp;Right!\u0026nbsp;Even the Destruction-attribute members of the Dan Dun Battle Team had been able to avoid their Heavenly Skill Images clashing.\u0026nbsp;What he was using was Saint Energy.\u0026nbsp;Of course he could do the same!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carefully meditated on everything.\u0026nbsp;Soon, he discovered that his powerful skills could apparently be used in two different modes.\u0026nbsp;The first mode was the old mode which could be used after accumulating energy.\u0026nbsp;The second was instant mode!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstant mode wasn’t very powerful and it was roughly on par with his previous level of power, but its advantage lay in how the skills could be instantly used!\u0026nbsp;Skills like the Dragon Silencing Seal might only be able to affect the foe for five seconds when instantly cast, but that was more than enough to gain victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason why the two Heavenly Kings had died by Zhou Weiqing’s hands was all thanks to his Saint Energy. As a nine-Jeweled master, when he converted his Saint Energy and used it to cast techniques there were only strengths and no weaknesses when compared to actual Heavenly Kings. Saint Energy didn’t conflict with any attributes while dramatically strengthening all techniques. Although Zhou Weiqing had yet to form a Saint Core Nucleus, as a nine-Jeweled expert with Saint Energy he was able to fight Heavenly Kings as equals. This was why Saint Energy was described as the most powerful type of energy in the world!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the self-detonating Heavenly Core Nucleus of that Heavenly King of the Blood Red Hell, it had brought Zhou Weiqing quite a bit of trouble.\u0026nbsp;Alas, that attack had primarily been fire-based, while Zhou Weiqing himself had fire immunity.\u0026nbsp;Moreover, this was the first time he realized just how powerful the Immortal Deity Shield was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had first gained the Immortal Deity Shield, he had felt that it was nothing more than an ordinary defensive technique.\u0026nbsp;After upgrading it to the second stage, it didn’t seem to become that much more powerful either.\u0026nbsp;But… after he had fully mastered the Immortal Deity Shield, he discovered that its defensive prowess was so great that it could actually compare to the Assembly Set Shield of Lin TianAo!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be remembered that when a Heavenly King self-detonated his Heavenly Core Nucleus, even other Heavenly Kings would have to flee the attack.\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing had actually taken the strike head-on.\u0026nbsp;He might have been injured, but his injuries were light.\u0026nbsp;Just a short while later, he had already recovered considerably.\u0026nbsp;His intrinsically strong body now healed faster than ever thanks to the Saint energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing began to carefully evaluate his current level of power.\u0026nbsp;He felt certain that based on his current strength, he was actually able to compare to a middle level Heavenly King!\u0026nbsp;In fact, he even had a chance to fight against high level Heavenly Kings.\u0026nbsp;Didn’t this mean that once he formed his Saint Core Nucleus, he would be able to battle even Heavenly Emperors?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin this brief span of half a year, he truly had undergone some earth-shaking changes.\u0026nbsp;It was precisely because Shangguan Tianyang saw all of this that he had so stubbornly chosen for Zhou Weiqing to go to the Xuantian Continent as their best agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, Zhou Weiqing didn’t realize that his skyrocketing power had an important connection to the great dragon Hui Yao. If it hadn’t been for the great dragon using his own Dragon Soul to enhance their spiritual strength, how could Zhou Weiqing have improved so quickly? He might not even be able to control his energies! Alas, he didn’t have enough time to overhaul all of the Consolidated Equipment he could now use. Otherwise, given how his strength was being multiplied so much by the Hate Ground No Handle set, he truly would be able to face high level Heavenly Kings without being at a disadvantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, after leaving the Lustre Spatial Realm Zhou Weiqing could now be considered a powerhouse of this era.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er leaned into Zhou Weiqing’s warm embrace as she sent the Ghost Demon Horse galloping forwards, her heart filled with serenity and warmth. Only one thought was in her mind: her Little Fatty had actually become very powerful!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the next half month of travel, the two rarely dismounted to rest. It was all thanks to the Ghost Demon Horse’s endurance that they were able to continue traveling at a gallop for such long periods of time. During this half month, Zhou Weiqing spent most of his time in a rather dazed state as he continued to ponder and meditate. Shangguan Bing’er didn’t disturb him, simply ensuring that he was fed and clothed properly. What caused her to not know whether to laugh or cry was the fact that although he spent all his days in a meditative state, every single night he would immediately become as active and eager as a lusty dragon or a lively tiger…\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-25-chapter-234-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-25-chapter-235-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-25-chapter-234-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
