The suite was normally one hundred Armageddon dollars a night. For Platinum members it was only sixty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer trudged the ten blocks from the armory to his old neighborhood. He wanted to find his old house before nightfall. A few people passed him on the street. Nobody said hello, but nobody seemed terrified either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome houses looked perfectly normal. Others were clearly abandoned, and a few had been burned down to the foundation. But there was something else. Mortimer couldn\u0027t quite put his finger on it. He stood in the middle of the street, turned three hundred and sixty degrees trying to figure it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo cars. None driving, none parked in the driveways or along the streets. The gas might have gone stale, but where did the cars go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned onto his street, spotted his house about halfway down. It came into focus as he trudged closer. The windows were dark, but so were all the windows along the street. No power. His house looked dirty and unpainted. The shrubs grown long and wild. It hadn\u0027t been such a bad house, three bedrooms, two baths, a fireplace. Now the gutters hung loose at one end. He stood watching the house for ten minutes but didn\u0027t see or hear any signs of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed the three steps to the front porch. The wood creaked under his boots. Someone had painted graffiti on the front door, a blue circle with a triangle of three dots inside. Some gang?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcern for Anne suddenly welled up inside him. What had happened to her? Did she make it okay when the world went crazy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocked on the door. It felt strange, even after all this time, to knock before he entered his own home. He pushed the door open and entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe living room was nearly barren, a sofa with stuffing oozing out of the cushions and a beanbag. He stood there trying to remember the good times with Anne, long nights in front of a cozy fire. Mortimer\u0027s eyes grew misty as the past formed a picture in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old screaming woman with the frying pan in her hand broke the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa!\" Mortimer flinched, backed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wild eyed, gray hair exploding in all directions. She rushed at Mortimer, the frying pan swinging savagely. Mortimer threw up his arms, tried to duck away. A glancing blow on the tip of his elbow shot hot pain up his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady, please. Jesus!\" Mortimer attempted flight, tripped backward over the beanbag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old lady loomed over him, mouth a feral, toothless grimace, ragged dress billowing around her like the tattered cape of some obsolete superhero. \"My house. The place was empty, so I puts my mark on the door. Them\u0027s the rules.\" She lifted the pan over her head for a killer blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry.\" He reached into his pocket, came out with a handful of coins and tossed them at the old woman\u0027s feet. \"Here, take them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped back, blinked at the glittering coins on the floor. \"Are those...?\" She knelt, picked one up and held it in the light. \"It is. Armageddon dollars!\" She scooped them into her trembling hands. \"Thank you. Oh, my God. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head came up suddenly and she met Mortimer\u0027s gaze, one eye half-milky with cataracts. \"Wait a minute. I know what this is about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not about anything.\" Mortimer struggled to his feet. \"I\u0027m sorry I barged in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A strapping young buck like you. I know what you want from a woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit.\" He backed away, headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman ripped open the front of her dress, buttons flying. \"Take me, you randy bastard. I\u0027m bought and paid for.\" Her breasts flopped into the open like deflated hot-water bottles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer screamed and dashed for the door, made it outside and kept running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You goddamn pussy,\" she called after him. \"Come back here and deliver the sausage!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXI\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the Emperor\u0027s Suite, Mortimer found Bill\u0027s vodka bottle. Empty. He sniffed, and the fumes scorched the inside of his nose. \"Hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill walked in from the other room, tucking in his shirt. He looked alert and no longer smelled like a campfire after his shower. \"Sorry, all gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good. Let me get my boots on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer squinted at the empty vodka bottle. \"You can handle it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never get sick,\" Bill said. \"Or hung over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went downstairs. Things had changed with evening. Half the scruffy men along the far wall now pedaled stationary bikes while the other half sat on them and leaned on the handlebars. All huffed breath. Sweaty. Christmas tree lights zigzagged the ceiling of the hall. It looked like a dystopia-themed high school prom. Music leaked tinnily from unseen stereo speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds familiar,\" Mortimer said. \"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Tony Orlando,\" Bill said. \"\u0027Knock Three Times.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer shook his head. \"Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Tony Orlando.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bell went off, like a doorbell chime. The resting guys on the stationary bicycles started pedaling, and the half who\u0027d been pedaling rested. The Christmas tree lights dimmed momentarily during the changeover, Tony Orlando\u0027s voice stretching into slow motion, then picking up speed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalk about a shitty day job, thought Mortimer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man appeared in front of them wearing the worst tuxedo in history, neon orange with a ruffled shirt. He sported a handlebar moustache, and his slicked-down hair was meticulously parted in the middle. It looked like he\u0027d escaped from a psycho ward\u0027s barbershop quartet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentlemen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to get a drink,\" Mortimer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sniffed. \"We\u0027re switching over to our dinner shift. You\u0027ll have to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill stuck a finger in his face. \"Who the hell are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Emile, the ma\u0026amp;icirc;tre d\u0027, and I\u0027m sorry, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show him the card.\" Bill elbowed Mortimer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer produced the Platinum card. \"This?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile\u0027s eyes widened; the ends of his moustache twitched. \"Sir!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ma\u0026amp;icirc;tre d\u0027 turned abruptly, snapped his fingers. Burly men appeared from nowhere. They frantically prepared a table down near the stage, white tablecloth, a candle. Emile ushered them to the table. There was much bowing and hand wringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I humbly and abjectly apologize most profusely,\" Emile said. \"I didn\u0027t recognize you, Mr. Tate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, of course. You are obviously a most generous and forgiving-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told you to forget it, friend,\" Bill said. \"Now rustle us up a bottle before I stomp your foppish ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile\u0027s smile strained at the edges. \"Yes. Certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring us some vodka and some clean glasses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile left, bowing and muttering under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be so hard on the help,\" Mortimer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you\u0027re an important guy now. You can\u0027t let these peons piss on your boots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer blew out a ragged sigh. \"I need that drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill leaned forward on the table, lowered his voice. \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to my house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill nodded. \"Let me guess. Your wife wasn\u0027t there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A toothless old lady wanted me to fuck her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile the neon ma\u0026amp;icirc;tre d\u0027 returned with a bottle of vodka and two mismatched glasses. He poured as he bowed. He was obsequious as hell. \"The waitresses have yet to come on duty, but it is my delight to bring your bottle myself so you don\u0027t have to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer tossed back the vodka. It burned his throat. He tried to thank the ma\u0026amp;icirc;tre d\u0027 but erupted into a coughing fit instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mort says thanks, now fuck off,\" Bill told Emile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile left the bottle on the table, rolled his eyes as he walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This tastes like kerosene,\" Mortimer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous. Did you ever drink kerosene before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer admitted he hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then don\u0027t talk crazy.\" Bill tilted the bottle, filled up Mortimer\u0027s glass again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both drank, winced, filled their glasses again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know where my wife is,\" Mortimer said. \"If she\u0027s even alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill nodded, slurped booze. \"It\u0027s tough to keep track of kinfolk in the new world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKinfolk. Bill\u0027s cowboy act got cornier the more he drank. Mortimer didn\u0027t mind. He liked Bill. He liked drinking with someone again. If he let his eyes glaze over and listened to the music and forgot how toxic the vodka was, Mortimer could almost believe he was enjoying happy hour after work with coworkers from the insurance company, that he\u0027d go home a little drunk, make love to his wife. Anne. Where was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed the bottle. Shook it. Empty. \"Damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill snapped his fingers. \"Another bottle, you greasy bastard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile returned. A frown had replaced his strained smile. He wasn\u0027t even pretending anymore. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill returned the frown. \"Keep a civil tongue, you...you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Varmint,\" Mortimer suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah! You motherfucking varmint asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" demanded Emile. His moustache had drooped. The ma\u0026amp;icirc;tre d\u0027s haughty air had been completely defeated by the Platinum card. All he could do was endure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Booze!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile slunk away, and Mortimer watched him go. He couldn\u0027t summon any pity for the man. Mortimer was too wrapped up in his own thoughts, too enamored by the fuzzy Christmas tree lights, too light-headed from the vodka. What would he do now? How long could he sit here drinking poison before he was forced to determine what happened next? Mortimer Tate had not considered what his life would be at the bottom of the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile paused to talk to a skinny, dark-eyed man leaning in the doorway. Mortimer thought him familiar. Emile nodded at the newcomer, pointed toward Mortimer\u0027s table. Had Buffalo Bill\u0027s rude behavior caused trouble? Where the hell was that bottle? Mortimer still thought the skinny man looked somewhat familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wife might not even be alive,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer flinched at the statement. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember getting lost in the food riots back then. It was rough. I found my way home, found my dad in the living room, blood all over the place. Somebody had smashed his head in with a pipe or something. The house had been ransacked. I waited and waited by his body for my mom to come home, you know? I never did find out what happened. Never.\" Bill\u0027s eyes were focused someplace far away, years into the past. \"I thought later, you know, what if she\u0027d come home and found Dad dead? What if she\u0027d just left and saved herself and didn\u0027t wait for me? I always thought-\" Bill\u0027s voice caught; he shook his head, cleared his throat. \"Where\u0027s that fucking bottle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile came back just in time, filled their glasses from the new bottle. Bill drank quickly, eyes down, face clouded with dark memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer could see Bill didn\u0027t want to talk about it, but Mortimer couldn\u0027t help himself. He peppered the cowboy with questions. How many had died? Was anything being done? What was this world they now lived in? Did people still vote? Was there still an America? The answers were all the same. Everything had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile bent to speak softly into Mortimer\u0027s ear. \"Professor Coffey wonders if he could join you for a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer lifted an eyebrow. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The owner, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name, the face. So damn familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lanky man came over and sat in between Bill and Mortimer. \"Hello, Mort. I thought it was you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecognition snapped into focus. \"Pete Coffey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill raised an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Pete Coffey,\" Mortimer said. \"We were on the baseball team in high school together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill nodded. \"How do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last I heard you were an English professor at Georgetown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoffey shrugged. \"I taught classics. Georgetown is radioactive rubble now. I was home for my mother\u0027s funeral, or I\u0027d have bought it with the rest of my department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to hear it,\" Mortimer said. \"Your mother, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the owner of this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile flickered across the professor\u0027s face. \"Half owner. Joey Armageddon owns half of all the places. Some local guy-in this case, me-owns the other half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the government?\" Mortimer blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once in a while we get something on the short-wave,\" Coffey said. \"Some air force general in Colorado Springs claims to represent the government. Then other times we hear about some low-level cabinet secretary holed up in Omaha saying she\u0027s constitutionally in charge.\" A shrug. \"It doesn\u0027t really matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter?\" Mortimer poured vodka, shook his head. \"I can\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re drinking that?\" Coffey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s-hic-good,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not,\" Coffey said. \"It\u0027s a shortcut to the Hershey squirts. Like washing out your bowels with battery acid.\" He waved at Emile, and the ma\u0026amp;icirc;tre d\u0027 was at Coffey\u0027s elbow in an instant. \"Bring the Bombay from the safe in my office. And the lime juice. Silas knows the combination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill gaped. \"You got limes? Where\u0027d you get limes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody has limes,\" Coffey said. \"We got six little cans of lime juice in trade last month, and I\u0027ve hoarded them for myself. The Bombay too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss oranges.\" Bill sounded wistful. \"Any citrus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing comes up from Florida,\" Coffey said. \"Not for a year now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile arrived with a half-full bottle of Bombay Sapphire, a can of lime juice and a bucket of ice cubes. Coffey mixed the drinks, poured the gin like he was handling nitroglycerin, careful not to spill a drop. He made sure not to pour Bill or Mortimer any more than he poured for himself. At last, they drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContented sighs. All three men closed their eyes, let the booze ease down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, that\u0027s a hell of a lot better than the vodka, all right,\" Bill said. \"I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m going to die at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat quietly. The gin demanded respect, so they sipped, didn\u0027t talk. Mortimer glanced around; more patrons had crowded into Joey Armageddon\u0027s. The song playing now was \"Things to Do in Denver When You\u0027re Dead\" by Warren Zevon. Above the stage, men lowered what looked like shark cages on steel cables. The Christmas tree lights began to blink. Mortimer noticed something else. Something important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScantily clad women moving among the tables, taking drink orders. Some wore tank tops with the hems tied into a knot above the navel. Others wore bikini tops or lace bras. Tight cutoff jeans seemed to be standard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer Tate had not had a woman in nine years. Something stirred in his pants, fluttered in his gut. He gawked openly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoffey told his story. He\u0027d survived the worst times, helped hold the town together. It was a small town, people knew one another. They\u0027d banded together, fended off marauders from without, despair from within. Coffey was mayor now. More important, he was half-owner of the Spring City Joey Armageddon\u0027s. He might as well have been royalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anne,\" Mortimer said. \"Is she...do you know what happened to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoffey nodded slowly. \"Of course. I\u0027d forgotten. Naturally you\u0027d want to know. Sorry, Mort. I really am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no. Mortimer\u0027s heart froze. She\u0027s dead. How? What happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m truly sorry,\" Coffey said again. \"But I had to sell her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no. It can\u0027t be true. It can\u0027t...\" Mortimer blinked. \"Did you say...sell her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it wasn\u0027t my idea,\" Coffey said. \"Believe me, I wanted to keep her. The customers loved her. She could really shake her ass in the cage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was reflex. Mortimer shot out of his chair, knocked it over behind him. His fists came up. This son of a bitch was talking about his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer froze when he felt the cold metal under his right ear. He turned slightly, saw the big man with the shotgun pushed up against him. Where did he come from? He felt something else sticking hard into his ribs on the left side. He unclenched his fists and held his hands up. \"No problem here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have a seat, sir. Nice and calm.\" It was Emile, who held a small silver revolver against Mortimer\u0027s ribs. \"There\u0027s a good gentleman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer eased down, and somebody slid his chair underneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmile looked at his boss, raised an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027re okay here,\" Coffey said. \"Mort, you\u0027ll behave, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer nodded, his teeth clenched. The gunmen withdrew. Bill eased his grip on one of the six-shooters. Mortimer noticed Coffey\u0027s fist on the table next to his drink. It clutched a little nickel derringer. The saloon owner slowly tucked the pistol back into his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was insensitive,\" Coffey admitted. \"I forgot you don\u0027t know how things work now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer glared outrage. \"Selling women as sex slaves? Is that how it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think of it that way. It\u0027s like when the Red Sox trade an outfielder to the Yankees. The new location needed an experienced girl. Anne was happy, Mort. It was a promotion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did she go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a liar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoffey frowned, sighed. \"I\u0027m going to try to understand how you feel. I\u0027m going to overlook that you\u0027re rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiss my ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoffey sighed and stood. \"Things have changed, Mort. Adjust.\" The Christmas lights went wacky, and the music cranked a notch. \"Looks like the show\u0027s about to start,\" Coffey said. \"You boys enjoy. I have to make the rounds. Check with you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shark cages lowered from the ceiling, and the music boomed. \"Raspberry Beret.\" There were women in the shark cages. Dancing women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaked women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey thrashed and shook and tossed their hair, an hourglass blonde with big tits in the close cage. Across the stage in the other cage a willowy, athletic redhead undulated and twisted. Joey Armageddon\u0027s had filled with hooting, drunken men. It had become hot, a musty, boozy smell filling the place, mixing with musk and tobacco smoke. Mortimer\u0027s head swam. Sensory overload. He fumed, but naked women demanded his attention. He reached for his glass of gin, found it empty. The Bombay had disappeared, replaced by another bottle of the lethal vodka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer drank. The world blurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Bill shouting at him; his voice seemed so far away. Mortimer squinted, looked at the cowboy. One of the waitresses had found her way into Bill\u0027s lap. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said loan me some of them Armageddon dollars,\" Bill shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer went into his pockets, came out with a handful of coins and shoved them across the table. He reached for the vodka bottle, couldn\u0027t quite grab it. His depth perception was in the toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortimer felt himself floating, felt he was leaving his body, drifting amid the swirling colors of the Christmas tree lights. He could not make his eyes focus, could not hear specific sounds, the noise and music and conversation all boiling into a single, messy soup. But on some level his brain was working, reaching a new plateau of knowing and understanding and determination. He knew what he would do. He was having an epiphany, a spiritual awakening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced again at Bill, made his eyes focus. Bill had the waitress\u0027s top down, one erect nipple in his mouth. The waitress\u0027s hand reached below the table into Bill\u0027s lap, pumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo hell with spiritual awakening, Mortimer thought. I want a hand job. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/go-go-girls-of-the-apocalypse/page-4.html","bookId":1578,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:01:17 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:01:17 AM"}
