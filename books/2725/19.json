Instead he pulled his phone out of his pocket and said, “I’m starving.” I could feel a little knot in my stomach. Was he mad at me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s get some pictures by the garden first,” my mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fisher clapped his hands and rubbed them together. Putting his arms around Jeremiah and Conrad, he said, “I want a picture with the Fishermen!” which made us all laugh—this time Jeremiah, too. That was one of Mr. Fisher’s oldest and corniest jokes. Whenever he and the boys would come back from fishing trips, he would yell, “The Fishermen have returned!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Susannah’s rose garden, we took pictures of Jeremiah and Mr. Fisher and Conrad, then one with Steven, too, then one with me and my mother and Steven and Jeremiah—all sorts of combinations. Jere said, “I want one of just me and Belly,” and I was relieved. We stood in front of the roses, and right before my mother snapped the picture, Jeremiah kissed me on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a nice one,” my mother said. Then she said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s have one of all the kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood together—Jeremiah, Conrad, me, Steven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad slung his arm around Jeremiah’s and my shoulders. It was all like no time had passed. The summer kids together again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rode with Jeremiah to the restaurant. My mother and Steven took one car, Mr. Fisher and Conrad both drove separately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we shouldn’t tell them today,” I said suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we should wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah turned down the music. “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Maybe today should just be about Susannah, and family. Maybe we should wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to have to wait. You and me getting married is about family. It’s about our two families coming together. As one.” Grinning, he grabbed my hand and lifted it in the air. “I want you to be able to wear your ring, right now, loud and proud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am loud and proud,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then let’s just do it like we planned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we pulled into the restaurant parking lot, Jeremiah said to me, “Don’t have hurt feelings if—you know, if he says anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. “Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dad. You know how he is. You can’t take it personally, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked into the restaurant holding hands. Everyone else was already there and seated at a round table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down, Jeremiah on my left and my brother on my right. I grabbed the bread basket and took a roll. I smeared it with butter before I stuffed most of it into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven shook his head at me. Pig, he mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaring at him, I said, “I didn’t eat breakfast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I ordered a bunch of appetizers,” Mr. Fisher told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Mr. Fisher,” I said, my mouth partly full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “Belly, we’re all adults here. I think you should call me Adam now. No more Mr. Fisher.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderneath the table, Jeremiah gave my thigh a squeeze. I almost laughed out loud. Then I had another thought—like, was I going to have to call Mr. Fisher\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad” after we were married? I would have to talk to Jeremiah about that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll try,” I said. Mr. Fisher looked at me expectantly, and I added, “Adam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven asked Conrad, “So why don’t you ever leave California?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here, aren’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, for, like, the first time since you left, practically.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven nudged him and lowered his voice. “You got a girl out there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Conrad said. “No girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe champagne arrived then, and when all our glasses were full, Mr. Fisher tapped his knife to his glass. “I’d like to make a toast,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother rolled her eyes just barely. Mr. Fisher was famous for making speeches, but today actually called for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to thank everyone for coming together today to celebrate Susannah. It’s a special day, and I’m glad we can share it together.” Mr. Fisher lifted his glass. “To Suz.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, my mother said, “To Beck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all clinked glasses and drank, and before I could put mine down, Jeremiah gave me this look like, Get ready, it’s happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach lurched. I took another gulp of my champagne and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have something to say,” Jeremiah announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile everyone was waiting to hear what it was, I snuck a look over at Conrad. He had his arm draped over the back of Steven’s chair, and they’d been laughing about something. His face was easy and relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had this wild impulse to stop Jeremiah, to clap my hand over his mouth and keep him from saying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody was so happy. This was going to wreck it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll just go ahead and warn you—it’s really good news.” Jeremiah flashed a smile at everyone, and I braced myself. He was being too glib, I thought. My mother wouldn’t like that. “I asked Belly to marry me, and she said yes. She said yes! We’re getting married this August!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like the restaurant got really quiet all of a sudden, like all the noise and chatter got sucked out of the room. Everything just stopped. I looked across the table, at my mother. Her face was ashen. Steven choked on the water he was drinking. Coughing, he said, “What the?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Conrad, his face was completely blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all so completely surreal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter came by then with the appetizers—calamari and cocktail shrimp and a tower of oysters. “Are you guys ready to order your entrees?” he asked, rearranging the table so there was room for everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice tight, Mr. Fisher said, “I think we need a few more minutes,” and glanced at my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked dazed. She opened, then closed, her mouth. Then she looked right at me and asked, “Are you pregnant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt all the blood rush to my cheeks. Beside me, I could feel rather than hear Jeremiah choke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother’s voice shook as she said shrilly, “I don’t believe this. How many times have we discussed contra-ception, Isabel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not have been more mortified. I looked at Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFisher, who was beet red, and then I looked at the waiter, who was pouring water for the table next to ours. Our eyes met. I was pretty sure he’d been in my psychology class. “Mom, I’m not pregnant!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-19.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
