More adjectives appear, including adjectives of colour. Although she can have no sensuous knowledge of colour, she can use the words, as we use most of our vocabulary, intellectually, with truth, not to impression, but to fact. This letter is to a school-mate at the Perkins Institution.\n\u003cbr\u003eTO MISS SARAH TOMLINSON Tuscumbia, Ala. Jan. 2nd 1888.\n\u003cbr\u003eDear Sarah I am happy to write to you this morning.
