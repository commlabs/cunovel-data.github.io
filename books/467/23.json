Whether he succeeded in doing this was by no means certain. On the whole, he and Ben got along very well together. He did not undertake to control his young secretary, but left him very much to his own devices. There were times when he seemed irritable, but it generally happened when he had been losing money at the gaming-table, for he was fond of play, not so much because he was fascinated by it as because it served as a distraction in lieu of more serious pursuits. On the whole, he did not lose much, for he was cool and self-possessed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [201]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n One thing was unsatisfactory to Benâ€”he had little or nothing to do. He was private secretary in name, but what use Major Grafton had for a private secretary Ben could not divine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Why Ben need have concerned himself, as long as he received his salary, may excite the wonder of some of my readers, but I think most people like to feel that they are doing something useful.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben, however, found a use for part of his time. In his travels through France, Switzerland, and Italy, he had oftentimes found himself, when alone, at a loss on account of a want of knowledge of the French language.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why should I not learn it?\" he asked himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He procured some elementary French books, including a grammar, dictionary, and tourist\u0027s guide, and set himself to the task with his usual energy. Having little else to do, he made remarkable progress, and found his studies a source of great interest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What are you doing there, Philip?\" asked Major Grafton, one afternoon.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [202]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am trying to obtain some knowledge of French. I suppose you have no objection?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not the least in the world. Do you want a teacher?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir; I think I can get along by myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Major Grafton was rather glad that Ben had found some way of passing his time. He did not want the boy to become homesick, for his presence was important to him for reasons that we are acquainted with.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben supplemented his lessons by going into shops, pricing articles, and attempting to hold a conversation with the clerks. This was a practical way of learning the language, which he found of great use.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Again they found themselves in Geneva, which Ben thought, on the whole, a pleasant place of residence. Here, too, he could make abundant use of his new acquisition, and did not fail to avail himself of his opportunity. So he enjoyed his stay in the charming Swiss city until one day he made an astounding discovery.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The most interesting walk in Geneva is [203] along the borders of the lake. Near it are placed seats on which the visitor may sit and survey the unequalled view.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben had seated himself one day, with a French book in his hand, which he was studying, when he observed a couple of ladies seat themselves near him. He would have given them no further thought if by chance the name of Major Grafton, spoken by one of them, had not reached his ears.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I see that Major Grafton is here,\" said one. \"You know we met him at Florence.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, the one who had the sick boy with him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The same.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was his son, was it not?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I thought so at the time, but I have since learned that I was mistaken. He was the boy\u0027s guardian.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The boy died, did he not?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, and it must have been a serious calamity to him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You mean that he was very much attached to the boy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I don\u0027t mean that. On the contrary, [204] he appeared to care very little for him. It was the pecuniary loss I was thinking of.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Explain yourself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You must know, then, that the boy was heir to a large fortune, the income of which, during his minority, was payable to Major Grafton for his benefit. No doubt the guardian made a good thing out of it. He probably made it pay both the boy\u0027s expenses and his own.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then, on the boy\u0027s death, he would lose this income?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Precisely.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is strange,\" said the younger lady; \"but he still has a boy with him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He has?\" inquired the other, in surprise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The name he calls him is Philip.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That was the name of the boy who died.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you sure that he died? Are you sure that this is not the same boy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Positive.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is very singular. A strange idea has occurred to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What if he is passing off this boy for the [205] first, in order to retain the liberal income which he received as guardian?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But that would be fraudulent.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is true; but I think Major Grafton would be capable of it. I hear from my brother that he gambles, and a gambler is not apt to be overburdened with principle.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If this is so, he ought to be exposed. To whom would the boy\u0027s fortune go, if it were known that he was dead?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To three cousins, who, I understand, are living in poverty in New York. There are two young girls and a brother, named Beaufort. They were cut off by the grandfather, from whom the fortune was inherited. For what reason I am not aware. However, the will stipulated that if the boy should die, the fortune should go to these children.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then they ought to be enjoying it now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Exactly. If all is true that I suspect, they are being kept out of it by a conspiracy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who is the boy that Major Grafton has with him now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know. Possibly it is a relative of [206] his own. He calls him Philip to deceive the public, if all is as I suspect.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you think we ought to do something in the matter, Clara?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I never meddle with matters that don\u0027t concern me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not even to right such a wrong as this?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I suppose matters will come right after awhile. The deception will be discovered, you may depend upon it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If I knew the boy I would speak to him about it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You would have your labor for your pains. The boy is probably in the conspiracy. I think he is a nephew of Major Grafton. If anything were said to him, he would no doubt put the major on his guard, and that would be the end of it. My dear, we shall do much better not to interfere in the matter at all.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The younger lady looked dissatisfied, but did not reply.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The feelings with which Ben heard this revelation may be imagined. He never for a moment doubted the truth of the story. It [207] made clear to him what had seemed singular hitherto. He had never been able to understand why Major Grafton should pick him up, and without any inquiry into his capacity offer him an engagement as private secretary. He had found that the office was merely nominal, and that there were no duties to speak of connected with it. Major Grafton had shown no particular interest in him, and evidently cared nothing for him, save as he served his purpose. But if his presence enabled Grafton to remain in possession of a large income, there was no need to inquire further. Ben saw that he was made an important agent in a wicked conspiracy to divert a large fortune from its lawful owners.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What ought he to do?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80921.html","bookId":467,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM"}
