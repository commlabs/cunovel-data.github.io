Two of the four propellers had already stopped working, with one that was currently stopping, the last one ready to give out soon as well. The oil tank was already empty, the entire airplane only relying on the last bit of fuel left in the fuel path to fly. The night was extremely dark, only a faint outline of the great earth visible. Ruins were scattered about like lotus flowers over the boundless earth, silently recounting the olden era’s glory.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, this land didn’t lack life, on the contrary, the aura of life was shockingly rich. The countless small creatures had long adapted to the powerful radiation, changing their own bodies, but the process of evolution didn’t stop here. Their biological activity were increased hundreds to thousand of times, their lifespans correspondingly shortened to just a few years, a few months, or even a few days, the process of evolution that used to take millions of years was similarly shortened to within a century. Radiation no longer signaled inevitable death, to the extent where it became some new life forms’ nourishment. In an era that lacked sunlight, many herbaceous species already began to absorb radiation as a means to replenish energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was an era of change. For the human race, the age of turmoil was full of hunger, bloodiness, and death. The war, as well as the few years after it, originally caused over 90% of humans to die, calling it the end of the world wasn’t too much of an exaggeration. However, if one looked down on this world from above, one would discover that this world was full of life, everything destroyed by the world currently recovering hundreds to thousands of times faster. Life, was incomparably tenacious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhat if it was just a change of the masters of the world? Apart from the human race, intelligent creatures’ numbers and species were currently growing at unprecedented speeds. Meanwhile, the human race, at the very least, already stepped down from the divine altar.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhile sitting in the airplane’s cockpit, Su’s eyes were closed, his body not moving at all like a lifeless sculpture. However, the temperature on the surface of his body was currently climbing at a rhythmic pace, his skin that was white like jade also producing a bit of redness. Compared to a year ago, Su’s appearance didn’t change all that much, only as his abilities increased, his skin began to release a glow, thus giving him a bit of a mysterious feel, his charm also becoming more deadly. His beautiful appearance had previously brought Su many problems, but his body tenaciously continued in this direction, not even Su himself understanding why this was.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen the last propeller began to slow, Su suddenly knew that it was already time. This didn’t come from his intuition, but rather a fury that had long been suppressed within the depths of his heart. It merged with an ice-cold murderous intent, producing some type of mental state even Su himself couldn’t explain clearly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis… will tentatively be called eruption.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe slowly opened his eyes. Under the heavy darkness of night, the two emerald-like lights were extremely clear. He suddenly stood up, his head smashing heavily into the roof of the cockpit.

The old-fashioned plane suddenly sunk, and then smashed towards the ground several hundred meters out, immediately erupting with a dazzling sphere of flames on the great earth, completing its final mission.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s body moved recklessly through the air.

At the limits of his view, he saw Westwood, Snow, and Helen.

During the era of Blood Colored Dusk, everyone knew that the calm Westwood, was the most terrifying Westwood. All of Snow’s compound eyes suddenly lost radiance, completely stopping their movements. Westwood who was holding Snow gave it a look, feeling a bit surprised inside. He obviously saw that Snow was scared, moreover giving up all resistance due to its extreme fear, but it clearly wasn’t scared of him. However, even a terrifying biological form like Snow knew fear? Westwood raised his head, his deep gaze meeting Su’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone still looked languid and beautiful, to the extent where she didn’t even sense Su’s arrival, only wantonly enjoying the final moment’s peace and happiness. Helen remained silent for a bit, put away her gun, wiped at the blood at her lips, and then recollected her machine-like icy coldness and trademark expression. Meanwhile, in the distance, Lafite and Curtis who returned after leaving, the moment they stepped into the Panoramic View’s range, the two of them became sluggish, coincidentally stopping their footsteps at the same time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Why do I feel like someone is looking at us?
