Ben, too, although they were hit with the news about David’s baby the minute they got home, which upset them both.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s too bad,” Grace said, her voice grim. She blamed David, maybe not for the pregnancy, since both partners had played a role in that, but he’d clearly lied to the poor girl about his intentions. And his behavior afterward had been appalling—his refusal to acknowledge the baby or accept his responsibilities as a father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think this is the final straw as far as Ben is concerned,” Olivia said, smoothing her napkin across her lap. “Apparently he’s only spoken to David once since they got home from the cruise. He told Mom that if David phones again, he doesn’t want to talk to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can understand why Ben’s so upset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So can I,” Olivia said. “He’s taking this hard. Ben’s such an honorable man that his son’s behavior—deceiving and deluding a sweet girl like Mary Jo—makes it all the more painful.” She shook her head. “I didn’t stop by to discuss David, though. The subject depresses me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I tell you what Mom’s been doing lately?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean other than visiting you?” Grace joked. It was common knowledge that Charlotte made a habit of checking up on Olivia every few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s been collecting all her favorite recipes for Justine’s tearoom. Which means she’s writing some of them down for the very first time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had driven past the construction site that morning and was astonished by the progress that had been made in the past month. “The building’s really coming along, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When my daughter wants something, she tends to get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s another Charlotte in the making.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That and more,” Olivia said. “She’s starting a brand-new business, balancing that with looking after her family and getting ready for the baby….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s she feeling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well, she says. She’s just begun to show. I hope she has a girl this time.” Olivia hesitated as if she’d suddenly realized what she’d said. “Of course we’d welcome another grandson with equal enthusiasm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are your girls?” Olivia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maryellen and Kelly are doing great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened at that moment and in walked Sheriff Troy Davis. He touched the brim of his hat when he saw them, a habitual gesture of his, then stepped up to the counter and ordered coffee to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Grace was filling Olivia in on the latest news about her grandchildren, Troy came to their table, clutching his take-out mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice to see you both,” he said. He frowned at the wool cap Olivia wore, then quickly glanced away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace could see that Olivia was trying to squelch a smile. “Hey, Sheriff, don’t be so worried. I’ll live.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glad to hear it. So, what are you two doing here at—” he looked pointedly at his watch “—the middle of the afternoon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m on leave,” Olivia said, although she knew he was well aware of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m having a late lunch,” Grace added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motioned toward the front window. “Is that your vehicle in the disabled parking space?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah…my car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess you didn’t see the sign.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, dear. Did you give me a ticket?” Usually she was more observant than this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but I’d advise you to move it before one of my deputies does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace scooped up her purse, grateful for the warning. “I’ll be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take your time,” Troy said. He seemed to be watching her as she left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace saw that as soon as she was out the door, Troy slid into her seat. Not until she reached her vehicle did she realize the disabled space was one down from where she’d parked. She was perfectly legal exactly where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t like Troy to make that kind of mistake, and she started back toward the deli. Then it dawned on her that Troy had purposely sent her on a wild-goose chase because he wanted time alone with Olivia. Assuming that was the case, she’d accommodate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace slid inside the car and circled the block twice, then located another slot close by. She figured that would give Troy ample opportunity to divulge whatever he had on his mind. Naturally she intended to drill Olivia the instant they were alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she returned to the deli, their soup and tea had been served, together with a basket of sourdough bread. When Troy saw her, he stood and made his farewells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment the door closed behind him, Grace said, “I wasn’t parked in a disabled space.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Troy just wanted to get rid of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia’s spoon hovered over her soup. “I know that, too. He asked me to apologize.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace waited for an explanation that didn’t seem to be forthcoming. She couldn’t understand why her friend was suddenly so tight-lipped. “Aren’t you going to tell me why he found it necessary to speak to you alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t decided,” Olivia answered with an exaggerated sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Olivia! Don’t hold out on me now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, all right,” Olivia said, doing her best to hide a smile. “He wanted some advice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About what?” Grace narrowed her eyes. “I didn’t realize you and Troy were such bosom buddies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We aren’t. He just knows me better because of my years on the bench.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He knows me, too! Good grief, we all went through twelve years of school together. What could he possibly say to you that he couldn’t say to me?” She felt a bit hurt that Troy had sought out Olivia and not her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, if you must know,” Olivia said, “he wanted to ask me about Faith Beckwith.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace shook her head. “Faith’s our tenant, remember? If he needed to find anything out, he could’ve asked me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he told me the two of them had a thing going, and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not news! Although they don’t seem to be dating now. I wonder what happened….” She let the rest fade, hoping Olivia would fill in the blanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unfortunately Troy didn’t have time to go into detail,” Olivia said. She looked at Grace with mock disdain. “It might have taken you a bit longer to find a parking spot, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had no intention of responding. She wanted facts—now. “Okay, so they had a ‘thing’ going and then what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t really say other than that he broke it off, regretted it and, when he wanted to get back together, Faith wasn’t interested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s understandable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe, but we both know Troy isn’t fickle. Faith should give him a bit of leeway, don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace considered that. “Depends.” She didn’t want to get caught up in a debate about the right or wrong of his decision, not when there was obviously more to the story. “So what else?” she pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said, he didn’t have time to give me any details.” She raised her eyebrows, which Grace ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now Troy’s upset because he loves Faith and wants her back.” How like a man!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia took Troy’s side. “She broke his heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace pretended to be sympathetic, but in her opinion he got what he deserved. “Poor Troy,” she said in a perfunctory tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That wasn’t exactly what he wanted to talk me about, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh! This was getting interesting. “He didn’t want advice about Faith?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, sort of. Something else happened that’s got him in a real state.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Olivia didn’t immediately continue, Grace snapped, “For heaven’s sake, don’t stop there! What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last night, on his way home, Troy saw Faith having dinner with another man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace picked up her spoon, then put it down again. This was far more intriguing than cream of broccoli soup. “What do you mean, he saw her with someone else? What did he do, drive his patrol car through a restaurant door?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not. He was hungry and felt like some Chinese food, so he ordered takeout from Wok ’n’ Roll. He walked inside to pick up his order—and who should he see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Faith,” Grace answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Faith, and she was with…a man. She had her back to him but Troy knew it was her and she seemed to be having the time of her life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had another question. “So, who was he?” she asked, lowering her voice. “This man she was with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia acted as if Grace hadn’t even spoken. “Poor Troy was devastated. He said it was all he could do not to march up to the table and tell…this other man to stay away from Faith.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a smart idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said the same thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what did he do?” Grace asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing much. He paid for his dinner, left and then seethed for the rest of the night. Judging by his expression, I’d say it’s still bothering him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did Faith see him?” Grace wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He thinks she might have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In that case, they probably both feel bad. Because Faith would know he was upset, and she isn’t the kind of woman who enjoys hurting someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, so tell me who Faith’s hot date was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia paused, and Grace’s heart sank. “He’s married, isn’t he? That’s why you don’t want to tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that’s not it. In fact, once I say his name it won’t surprise you at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Olivia was going to make her guess. That wasn’t fair—and then it came to her. Shocked, she pressed both hands against the table and half stood. “No way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia knew immediately that Grace had figured it out. Slowly, with her eyes closed, she nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your brother, Will Jefferson, is dating Faith?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia exhaled sharply. “So it seems.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well…he’s divorced and she’s a widow. So I guess there’s nothing really wrong with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the last I heard,” Olivia said, “he was interested in Shirley Bliss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace tore a piece of bread. “I know Will’s your brother and you love him, but I also know a basic fact about him. He’s not a one-woman man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia sighed. “I certainly can’t deny it, at least going by previous experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to say anything to Faith?” Grace asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I won’t, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEleven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was so embarrassing. Unfortunately, Christie didn’t have any alternative. She needed a vehicle; otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to get to work except by walking or biking. A bicycle might be okay once spring arrived, and she could probably buy one secondhand, but that didn’t help her now. So far, winter had set all kinds of records for cold and snowfall. Slogging through slush and fierce wind left much to be desired. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/92-pacific-boulevard-cedar-cove-9/page-14.html","bookId":1951,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:11 AM"}
