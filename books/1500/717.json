Meanwhile, Serendela’s stellar stream was unexpectedly dragged by him into the distance as well.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBehind Su, the death stars were currently increasing, but he only saw Serendela depart into the distance, disappearing. He was powerless to chase after her, nor did he dare to chase after her. This great battle of spiritual worlds concluded with this type of unexpected situation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Su withdrew from the spiritual world, he watched as his body collapsed and dissipated under the powerful energy radiance. The moment before his complete destruction, Su’s innermost instincts suddenly activated, a white-colored symbol appearing. The moment he saw it, Su understood its function. As a result, in that short instant that was nearly impossible to quantify, all of Su’s memories, all of his genetic secrets, to the extent where everything he had seen, everything he had experienced, all turned into various mediums and were stored inside of this symbol. This symbol was three-dimensional, unknown just how many layers overlaid on top of each other to form it, almost as if it could be endlessly differentiated. No matter how great the amount of information, it could still easily store it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen all of the information was completely stowed, this mysterious symbol turned a light golden color, and then disappeared without a trace. Meanwhile, Su’s last memory was completely occupied by a boundless white radiance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThen, what followed was an ice-cold, dark ocean floor world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu gradually strengthened himself from nothing, all the way until he saw light again. In that instant, Su’s right eye was regenerated, moreover activating. When his right eye successfully activated, in the vast ocean floor world, several hundred thousand individual parts that were simultaneously undergoing evolution stopped that process at that instant, all of them completely dying.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn his memories, in that instant, Su clearly recalled a clear fear from three different directions. However, it was only momentary. These three feelings disappeared one after another, gradually vanishing into the backdrop of this world. Even though Su was a bit shocked, he didn’t pay too much attention to it. Survival and evolution occupied all of his attention. In the serene and hidden right eye’s depths, a bit of redness never disappeared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt the center of the blood sea, was the young lady in eternal rest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was precisely because this memory was about to fade that Su’s comprehensive rebound was finally activated, once again seizing control over his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe drifting in the sea would come to an end. No matter how great the wind and waves were, even if there truly was the existence of a formless black hand, natural power was still boundless and irresistible. This sea area’s ocean current still drew near the continental shelf via trade winds. Several tens of days later, dry land finally appeared. Su brandished his sole right arm, and then began swimming for the first time. This distance he could see with his naked eye, actually used up half a day of time, and only then did he borrow the last tide to drag his tattered body onto the sandy shore.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis was a quiet beach, all of the clamshells’ outer shells tightly closed as they submerged into their nests’ innermost depths. Meanwhile, in the distance, sea crabs of all different sizes were frantically running, currently leaving this sandy shore.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe same old method of cutting off food supply? Su released a cold laugh. His right hand supported himself on the sandy shore. He raised his eye, and then his deep right eye locked onto the coconut trees growing at the edge of the beach.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s right arm brandished forcefully, dragging his body to the side of the coconut grove. He grabbed a tree trunk, and then climbed to the top in one go, biting open coconuts one after another. A moment later, all of the tree’s coconuts were eaten. However, Su was far from satisfied. He bit down on the tree leaves, and following chewing noises, an enormous palm leaf quickly disappeared. In the blink of an eye, only a bare tree trunk remained. After eating all of this, Su’s vigor clearly improved by quite a bit, only spitting out a small mouthful of scorched black residue. The waste products had already been charred black, almost no water content or organic matter left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu’s right hand brandished about, jumping to another coconut tree, starting to eat the coconuts again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRight at this moment, an ice-cold thought emerged from the depths of his consciousness.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe efficiency of eating with this type of mouth is too low.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;Immediately afterwards, a completely new set of mouthparts appeared in his consciousness. It was similar to a sandworm’s mouth, able to automatically lengthen and shorten, more than ten layers of sharp teeth densely packed inside, able to easily crush apart any food easily. Meanwhile, the powerful and forceful muscle fibers would even allow it to bit through the tree trunk in one move. If this type of mouth was produced, the current eating process would be much easier. The coconuts would definitely be devoured in one gulp, and the palm leaves could be devoured as well, the efficiency indeed becoming much higher as a result.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePah!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;Su fiercely spat out a mouthful of black residue, using this as his response.
