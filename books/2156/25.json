It continually astonished me how people hide from their ancestral memories, shielding themselves behind a thick barrier of mythos. Ohhh, I do not expect them to seek the terrible immediacy of every living moment which I must experience. I can understand that they might not want to be submerged in a mush of petty ancestral details. You have reason to fear that your living moments might be taken over by others. Yet, the meaning is there within those memories. We carry all of our ancestry forward like a living wave, all of the hopes and joys and griefs, the agonies and the exultations of our past. Nothing within those memories remains completely without meaning or influence, not as long as there is a humankind somewhere. We have that bright Infinity all around us, that Golden Path of forever to which we can continually pledge our puny but inspired allegiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals \"I HAVE summoned yon, Moneo, because of what my guards tell me,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood in the darkness of the crypt where, Moneo reminded himself, some of the God Emperor\u0027s most painful decisions originated. Moneo, too, had heard reports. He had been expecting the summons all afternoon and, when it came shortly after the evening meal, a moment of terror had engulfed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it about... about the Duncan, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it\u0027s about the Duncan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m told, Lord... his behavior...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terminal behavior, Moneo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo bowed his head. \"If you say it, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long until the Tleilaxu could supply us with another one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They say they have had problems, Lord.

If the God Emperor had learned about this latest... No! Even the Fish Speakers were terrified by the affront.

This universe will not permit it. The things you attempt will not endure if you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Lord! You do no wrong!\" -\"Poor Moneo. You cannot see that I have created a vehicle of injustice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo could not speak. He realized that he had been diverted by a seeming return to mildness in the God Emperor. But now, Moneo sensed changes moving in that great body, and at this proximity...Moneo glanced around the crypt\u0027s central chamber, reminding himself of the many deaths which had occurred here and which were enshrined here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it my time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto spoke in a musing tone. \"You cannot succeed by taking hostages. That is a form of enslavement. One kind of human cannot own another kind of human. This universe will not permit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words lay there, simmering in Moneo\u0027s awareness, a terrifying contrast to the rumblings of transformation which he sensed in his Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Worm comes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Moneo glanced around the crypt chamber. This place was far worse than the aerie! Sanctuary was too remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Moneo, do you have any response?\" Leto asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo ventured a whisper: \"The Lord\u0027s words enlighten me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enlighten? You are not enlightened!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo spoke out of desperation. \"But I serve my Lord!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You claim service to God?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who created your religion, Moneo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a sensible answer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t thank me!

At last, he had encountered the question without answer. Failure to answer would precipitate his death. He waited for it, head bowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will tell you, poor servant,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo dared to hope. He lifted his gaze to the God Emperor\u0027s face, noting that the eyes were not glazed... and the hands were not trembling. Perhaps the Worm did not come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Religious institutions perpetuate a mortal master-servant relationship,\" Leto said. \"They create an arena which attracts prideful human power-seekers with all of their nearsighted prejudices!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo could only nod. Was that a trembling in the God Emperor\u0027s hands? Was the terrible face withdrawing slightly into its cowl?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The secret revelations of infamy, that is what the Duncans ask after,\" Leto said. \"The Duncans have too much compassion for their fellows and too sharp a limit on fellowship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo had studied holos of Dune\u0027s ancient sandworms, the gigantic mouths full of crysknife teeth around consuming fire. He noted the tumescence of the latent rings on Leto\u0027s tubular surface. Were they more prominent? Would a new mouth open below that cowled face?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Duncans know in their hearts,\" Leto said, \"that I have deliberately ignored the admonition of Mohammed and Moses. Even you know it, Moneo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an accusation. Moneo started to nod, then shook his head from side to side. He wondered if he dared renew his retreat. Moneo knew from experience that lectures in this tenor did not long continue without the coming of the Worm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What might that admonition be?\" Leto asked. There was a mocking lightness in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo allowed himself a faint shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, Leto\u0027s voice filled the chamber with a rumbling baritone, an ancient voice which spoke across the centuries: \"You are servants unto God, not servants unto servants!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo wrung his hands and cried out: \"I serve you, Lord!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moneo, Moneo,\" Leto said, his voice low and resonant, \"a million wrongs cannot give rise to one right. The right is known because it endures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo could only stand in trembling silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had intended Hwi to mate with you, Moneo,\" Leto said. \"Now, it is too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words took a moment penetrating Moneo\u0027s consciousness. He felt that their meaning was out of any known context. Hwi? Who was Hwi? Oh, yes-the God Emperor\u0027s Ixian bride-to-be. Mate... with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto spoke with infinite sadness: \"You, too, shall pass away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill all your works be as dust forgotten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any warning, even as he spoke, Leto\u0027s body convulsed in a thrashing roll which heaved him from the cart. The speed of it, the monstrous violence, threw him within centimeters of Moneo, who screamed and fled across the crypt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moneo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto\u0027s call stopped the majordomo at the entrance to the lift \"The test, Moneo! I will test Siona tomorrow!\" -\u003d The realization of what I am occurs in the timeless awareness which does not stimulate nor delude. I create a field without self or center, a field where even death becomes only analogy. I desire no results. I merely permit this field which has no goals nor desires, no perfections nor even visions of achievements. In that field, omnipresent primal awareness is all. It is the light which pours through the windows of my universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals THE SUN came up, sending its harsh glare across the dunes. Leto felt the sand beneath him as a soft caress. Only his human ears, hearing the abrasive rasp of his heavy body, reported otherwise. It was a sensory conflict which he had learned to accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Siona walking behind him, a lightness in her tread, a gentle spilling of sand as she climbed to his level atop a dune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longer I endure, the more vulnerable I become, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis thought often occurred to him these days when he went into his desert. He peered upward. The sky was cloudless with a blue density which the old days of Dune had never seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was a desert without a cloudless sky? Too bad it could not have Dune\u0027s silvery hue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIxian satellites controlled this sky, not always to the perfection he might desire. Such perfection was a machine-fantasy which faltered under human management. Still, the satellites held a sufficiently steady grip to give him this morning of desert stillness. He gave his human lungs a deep breath of it and listened for Siona\u0027s approach. She had stopped. He knew she was admiring the view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto felt his imagination like a conjurer calling up everything which had produced the physical setting for this moment. He felt the satellites. Fine instruments which played the music for the dance of warming and cooling air masses, perpetually monitoring and adjusting the powerful vertical and horizontal currents. It amused him to recall that the lxians had thought he would use this exquisite machinery in a new kind of hydraulic despotism-withholding moisture from those who defied their ruler, punishing others with terrible storms. How surprised they had been to f-and themselves mistaken!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy controls are more subtle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, gently, he began to move, swimming on the sand surface, gliding down off the dune, never once looking back at the thin spire of his tower, knowing that it would vanish presently into the haze of daytime heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona followed him with an uncharacteristic docility. Doubt had done its work. She had read the stolen journals. She had listened to the admonitions of her father. Now, she did not know what to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this test?\" she had asked Moneo. \"What will he do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is never the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did he test you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be different with you. I would only confuse you if I told you my experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto had listened secretly while Moneo prepared his daughter, dressing her in an authentic Fremen stillsuit with a dark robe over it, fitting the boot-pumps correctly. Moneo had not forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo had looked up from where he bent to adjust her boots. \"The Worm will come. That is all I can tell you. You must find a way to live in the presence of the Worm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had stood then, explaining about the stillsuit, how it recycled her body\u0027s own waters. He made her pull the tube from a catchpocket and suck on it, then reseal the tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will be alone with him on the desert,\" Moneo had said. \"Shai-Hulud is never far away when you\u0027re on the desert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I refuse to go?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will go... but you may not return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis conversation had occurred in the ground-level chamber of the Little Citadel while Leto waited in the aerie. He had come down when he knew Siona was ready, drifting down in the predawn darkness on his cart\u0027s suspensors. The cart had gone into the ground level room after Moneo and Siona emerged. While Moneo marched across-the flat ground to his \u0027thopter and left in a whispering of wings, Leto had required Siona to test the sealed portal of the ground-level chamber, then look upward at the tower\u0027s impossible heights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only way out is across the Sareer,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led her away from the tower then, not even commanding her to follow, depending on her good sense, her curiosity and her doubts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto\u0027s swimming progress took him down the dune\u0027s slipface and onto an exposed section of the rocky basement complex, then up another sandy face at a shallow angle, creating a path for Siona to follow. Fremen had called such compression tracks \"God\u0027s gift to the weary.\" He moved slowly, giving Siona plenty of time in which to recognize that this was his domain, his natural habitat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came out atop another dune and turned to watch her progress. She held to the track he had provided and stopped only when she reached the top. Her glance went once to his face then she turned a full circle to examine the horizon. He heard the sharp intake of her breath. Heat haze hid the spire\u0027s top. The base might have been a distant outcropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is how it was,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something about the desert which spoke to the eternal soul of people who possessed Fremen blood, he knew. He had chosen this place for its desert impact-a dune slightly higher than the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a good look at it,\" he said, and he slipped down the dune\u0027s other side to remove his bulk from her view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiona took one more slow turn, looking outward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto knew the innermost sensation of what she saw. Except for that insignificant, blurred blip of his tower\u0027s base, there was not the slightest lift of horizon-flat, everywhere flat. No plants, no living movement. From her vantage, there was a limit of approximately eight kilometers to the line where the planet\u0027s curvature hid everything beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto spoke from where he had stopped, just below the dune\u0027s crest. \"This is the real Sareer. You only know it when you\u0027re down here afoot. This is all that\u0027s left of the bahr bela ma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ocean without water,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, she turned and examined the entire horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no wind and, Leto knew, without wind, the silence ate at the human soul. Siona was feeling the loss of all familiar reference points. She was abandoned in dangerous space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto glanced at the next dune. In that direction, they would come presently to a low line of hills which originally had been mountains but now were broken into remnant slag and rubble. He continued to rest quietly, letting the silence do his work for him. It was even pleasant to imagine that these dunes went on, as they once had, without end completely around the planet. But even these few dunes were degenerating. Without the original Coriolis storms of Dune, the Sareer saw nothing stronger than a stiff breeze and occasional heat vortices which had no more than local effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of these tiny \"wind devils\" danced across the middle distance to the south. Siona\u0027s gaze followed its track. She spoke abruptly: \"Do you have a personal religion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto took a moment composing his reply. It always astonished him how a desert provoked thoughts of religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dare ask me if I have a personal religion?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetraying no surface sign of the fears he knew she felt, Siona turned and stared down at him. Audacity was always an Atreides hallmark, he reminded himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she didn\u0027t answer, he said: \"You are an Atreides for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that your answer?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it you really want to know, Siona?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you believe!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ho! You ask after my faith. Well, now-I believe that something cannot emerge from nothing without divine intervention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer puzzled her. \"How is that an...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Natura non facit saltus,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, not understanding the ancient allusion which had sprung to his lips. Leto translated:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nature makes no leaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What language was that?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A language no longer spoken anywhere else in my universe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you use it then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To prod your ancient memories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any! I just need to know why you brought me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To give you a taste of your past. Come down here and climb onto my back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated at first, then seeing the futility of defiance, slid down the dune and clambered onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto waited until she was kneeling atop him. It was not the same as the old times he knew. She had no Maker hooks and could not stand on his back. He lifted his front segments slightly off the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why am I doing this?\" she asked. Her tone said she felt silly up there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to taste the way our people once moved proudly across this land, high atop the back of a giant sandworm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to glide along the dune just below the crest. Siona had seen holos. She knew this experience intellectually, but the pulse of reality had a different beat and he knew she would resonate to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhhh, Siona, he thought, you do not even begin to suspect how I will test you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto steeled himself then. I must have no pity. If she dies, she dies. If any of them dies, that is a required event, no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had to remind himself that this applied even to Hwi Noree. It was just that all of them could not die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sensed it when Siona began to enjoy the sensation of riding on his back. He felt a faint shift in her weight as she eased back onto her legs to lift her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove outward then along a curving barracan, joining Siona in enjoyment of the old sensations. Leto could just glimpse the remnant hills at the horizon ahead of him. They were like a seed from the past waiting there, a reminder of the self-sustaining and expanding force which operated in a desert. He could forget for a moment that on this planet where only a small fraction of the surface remained desert, the Sareer\u0027s dynamism existed in a precarious environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe illusion of the past was here, though. He felt it as he moved. Fantasy, of course, he told himself, a vanishing fantasy as long as his enforced tranquility continued. Even the sweeping barracan which he traversed now was not as great as the ones of the past. None of the dunes were that great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis whole maintained desert struck him suddenly as ridiculous. He almost stopped on a pebbled surface between the dunes, continuing but more slowly as he tried to conjure up the necessities which kept the whole system working. He imagined the planet\u0027s rotation setting up great air currents which shifted cold and heated air to new regions in enormous volume-everything monitored and ruled by those tiny satellites with their Ixian instruments and heat-focusing dishes. If the high monitors saw anything, they saw the Sareer partly as a \"relief desert\" with both physical and cold-air walls girdling it. This tended to create ice at the edges and required even more climatic adjustments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not easy and Leto forgave the occasional mistakes for that reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he moved once more out onto dunes, he lost that sense of delicate balance, put aside memories of the pebbly wastelands outside the central sands, and gave himself up to enjoyment of his \"petrified ocean\" with its frozen and apparently immovable waves. He turned southward, parallel to the remnant hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that most people were offended by his infatuation with desert. They were uneasy and turned away. Siona, however, could not turn away. Everywhere she looked, the desert demanded recognition. She rode silently on his back, but he knew her eyes were full. And the old-old memories were beginning to churn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came within three hours to a region of cylindrical whaleback dunes, some of them more than one hundred and fifty kilometers long at an angle to the prevailing wind. Beyond them lay a rocky corridor between dunes and into a region of star dunes almost four hundred meters high. Finally, they entered the braided dunes of the central erg where the general high pressure and electrically charged air gave his spirits a lift. He knew the same magic would be working on Siona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here is where the songs of the Long Trek originated,\" he said. \"They are perfectly preserved in the Oral History.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not answer, but he knew she heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto slowed his pace and began to speak to Siona, telling her about their Fremen past. He sensed the quickening of her interest. She even asked questions occasionally, but he could also feel her fears building. Even the base of his Little Citadel was no longer visible here. She could recognize nothing manmade. And she would think he engaged now in small talk, unimportant things to put off something portentous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Equality between our men and women originated here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Fish Speakers deny that men and women are equal,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice, full of questioning disbelief, was a better locator than the sensation of her crouched on his back. Leto stopped at the intersection of two braided dunes and let the venting of his heat-generated oxygen subside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things are not the same today,\" he said. \"But men and women do have different evolutionary demands upon them. With the Fremen, though, there was an interdependence. That fostered equality out here where questions of survival can become immediate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you bring me here?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look behind us,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her turn. Presently, she said: \"What am I supposed to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have we left any tracks? Can you tell where we\u0027ve been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a little wind now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has covered our tracks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so... yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This desert made us what we were and are,\" he said. \"It\u0027s the real museum of all our traditions. Not one of those traditions has really been lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto saw a small sandstorm, a ghibli, moving across the southern horizon. He noted the narrow ribbons of dust and sand moving out ahead of it. Surely, Siona had seen it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why won\u0027t you tell me why you brought me here?\" she asked. Fear was obvious in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I have told you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-25.html","bookId":2156,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM"}
