He also found a crystal at one point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crystal?\" Verity tilted her head inquiringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug nodded. \"I saw it myself about five years ago. Digby showed it to me shortly after he found it. He was sure it was a key of some kind. It\u0027s green, about two inches long. It\u0027s egg-shaped and very smooth, with tiny, odd-shaped little facets cut into the bottom. It disappeared a couple of years ago along with Uncle Digby. He either hid it somewhere or had it on him when he disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas sat forward, finally, showing real interest. \"He believed the crystal was genuine Renaissance work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes,\" Elyssa said. Her bracelets jingled as she turned to Jonas. \"He may have been senile there at the end, but at one time Digby Hazelhurst had quite a reputation in academic circles. Thirty years ago he was considered an expert on Renaissance history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hazelhurst?\" Jonas repeated. \"Your uncle was Digby Hazelhurst?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you heard of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember running across some early papers he did on Renaissance scientific learning,\" Jonas said slowly. \"They were gathering dust in an old library file at Vincent College. I found them by accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid that by the time he died, Uncle Digby\u0027s academic reputation had been shot to pieces,\" Doug said. \"His work got more and more bizarre during the last twenty years, I\u0027m told. His colleagues ignored him, he couldn\u0027t get teaching positions, and academic journals stopped publishing him entirely. He eventually retired to his island to spend the last years of his life searching for the treasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said your uncle died a couple of years ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug nodded. \"Lost at sea. The old man had no business sailing on the Sound alone at his age. But old Digby always was independent. He\u0027d had a bad heart for years. The authorities concluded he probably had a heart attack and fell overboard. They never recovered the body, although the boat eventually washed ashore on a neighboring island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re left with the diary, the reconstructed villa, and a missing piece of crystal,\" Jonas concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyssa laughed and her earrings tinkled. \"Doug\u0027s right. We really do have to sell the villa, there\u0027s no way we can afford to keep it. But I can\u0027t bear not to try to find the treasure before we do. It should be fun, if nothing else. I\u0027m inviting a few friends to help in the hunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas narrowed his eyes. \"What kind of friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, they won\u0027t get in your way,\" she assured him hastily. \"There\u0027s plenty of room. Digby\u0027s housekeeper, a Miss Frampton, is still at the villa. She\u0027ll see to all the cooking and cleaning for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, it sounds like fun,\" Verity said brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arched his brows and gave her a wry glance. \"When it comes to business,\" he said to the Warwicks,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I leave everything to my business manager. Looks like we\u0027ll be seeing you in Seattle in a day or two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" Doug took a small, leatherbound volume out of his pocket. \"I might as well let you have a look at the diary.\" He paused. \"I don\u0027t suppose you happen to know Latin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been a while, but I can manage,\" Jonas said with an air of dignified modesty. \"Italian humanist scholars made a big deal out of learning Latin. It was considered the only suitable language for recording really important work. Looks like Digby felt the same way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In this day and age, it makes for an excellent secret code,\" Doug observed. \"No one reads Latin anymore. There are a few pages missing from the back of the diary. You can see where they\u0027ve been torn out. I don\u0027t know what happened to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyssa leaned toward Jonas as he reached for the book. Her jeweled fingers flashed light. \"Mr. Quarrel, I have a personal questionâ€¦ \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas,\" he corrected absently, examining the small volume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas, then.\" She smiled with obvious delight. \"Forgive me for prying, but I\u0027m dying of curiosity. Is it true that you have a talent for psychometry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity saw the anger flare in Jonas\u0027s eyes and was suddenly afraid that the whole deal was going to end right then and there. She could have kicked Elyssa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The editor of the journal that published your article mentioned that you once had a reputation for authenticating items for museums and collectors,\" Elyssa explained, apparently unaware of the narrow line she was walking. \"From his description of your work, my friend Preston Yarwood speculated that you might have a psychic ability called psychometry. Is that true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pure bullshit,\" Jonas said with clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Preston said that you might not even be aware of how and why you can identify objects from the past,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElyssa went on innocently. \"He said the talent might be very elusive, something you just take for granted, and don\u0027t even understand yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Preston Yarwood?\" Jonas demanded grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Yarwood is a friend of hers, Jonas,\" Verity cut in. \"He\u0027s the one who contacted the journal editor who published your piece on Renaissance fencing techniques. The editor recommended you for this assignment.\" She gave Jonas her most brilliant smile. \"Funny how things work out, isn\u0027t it? If you hadn\u0027t published that piece, the Warwicks would never have learned about you, and we wouldn\u0027t be on our way to Washington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas tapped the Hazelhurst diary thoughtfully. \"Funny isn\u0027t exactly the word for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What an ugly pile of rock. No wonder Doug said it was called Hazelhurst\u0027s Horror.\" Verity\u0027s disappointment was obvious. She stood in the stern of the small launch Doug Warwick was piloting and studied the grim island fortress ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas grinned. \"Well, it sure as hell doesn\u0027t approach the architectural genius of Bramante or Brunelleschi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What style is it, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas shrugged and surveyed the rugged structure dominating the cliff that rose from the cold waters of Puget Sound. It was a plain, solid-looking stone mass, two stories high. The rough, unattractive facade was studded with tiny windows and capped by a thick, bulky cornice that outlined the roof. \"I\u0027d say it\u0027s late fifteenth century, probably Milanese, judging by the overall style. The architect will most likely remain anonymous forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And deservedly so,\" Verity retorted. \"When the Warwicks talked about an Italian villa, I imagined something a little grander.\" The noise of the launch engine kept her complaints from being overheard by their host, who was busy guiding the boat into a small cove. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-14.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
