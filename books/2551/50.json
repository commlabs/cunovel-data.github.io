They sat together in awkward silence as soldiers and porters followed directions and came back onto the train, bustling back and forth through the aisles as they came and went to their stations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the train finally jerked itself forward in the first tentative steps toward moving, Inspector Portilla spoke again. “The army won’t part with the gold. We cannot suggest that they leave it behind so the Rebels will leave the train alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger pointed a finger at him and said, “You’re right. I thought of that myself. I don’t mind telling you that I even thought of doing it myself—if everything important was tied up in that rear car, I might have cut the thing’s couplers and ditched it along the track, somewhere before we hit the mountain pass. I don’t mean to disrespect anybody’s war dead, but in this instance, the problems of the living ought to take precedence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercy said, “But the gold’s up front, and they’re still coming, aren’t they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo which the ranger replied, “Yeah, they’re still coming. The Shenandoah is burning up track, trying to beat this machine to the pass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The . . .” Inspector Galeano struggled to wrap his English skills around the word. “Shenandoah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a train. Or it’s an engine,” Horatio Korman explained. “It’s a damn fast one, too—one of the fastest the ’federates have pulling for them. We designed it and outfitted it in Houston a couple of years ago, and it’s been running the cracker line back and forth through Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia ever since. She’s a V-​Twin runner; the first of her kind, but not the last. And the engine system gives the thing a real boost, sending her gliding along the tracks like she’s barely touching them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can it catch us?” Mercy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In my opinion?” The ranger lifted his hat up with one finger and scratched a spot under its rim. “Maybe. And if they beat us to the pass, they’ll dynamite the tracks to keep us. They know that most of the civilians are off the train now, and they figure anyone left is fair game. That’s the friendly warning Jesse gave me, anyhow. They’re going to come at us hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For money,” she said, as if she could hardly believe it of her own kinsmen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her surprise, Horatio Korman said, “No. That’s not the whole of it. There’s plenty your captain friend left out of his story. There’s more going on in that front car than plain old money. That deed you pulled, do you remember it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was blank, and you know why? Because they don’t know who they’re going to give it to yet. They’re taking this load along the coast and down through California, recruiting all the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspector Portilla asked with a frown, “They are going to buy soldiers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re gonna try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But folks out West,” Mercy said, “they don’t give a damn about what’s going on back East. Who in their right mind, all settled someplace quiet and safe, would go to war for a few dollars and a few acres of land?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger brightened, pointing at her now, because she’d asked exactly the right question. “I’ll tell you who: Chinamen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercy and the inspectors sat up and back in surprise. “Chinamen?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chinamen,” he confirmed. “Out on the West Coast, they’ve got ’em by the thousands. By the tens of thousands, and counting—and they don’t want them there, that’s a sure fact. Some places even done passed laws to keep them from bringing their women and children here, that’s how much they want to be rid of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspector Galeano leaned forward again, steepling his fingers as he braced his elbows on his knees. He said, “The West doesn’t want its Chinamen, and the East wants more soldiers. The Chinamen want to stay here as citizens, and the Union can make them citizens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re the only folks on the coast who might be able to be bought,” the ranger said. “And there’s a surplus of ’em, and they’ll do just about anything for a little respect. That’s what the Union’s offering them. Thirty acres and start-​up capital for farming, out in the middle of noplace where they won’t bother no one but the Indians. Once they’re out there, they can fight each other or make best friends, for all the shit the Union gives. I don’t expect the government has thought that far ahead, to tell you the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re probably right,” Mercy mused. “It’s a bold plan, though. If it works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you can guess, the Rebs would just as soon it doesn’t work. I can hardly blame them; and I sympathize with their plight, I really do; but I don’t know what to tell them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will you do if they take the train?” Mercy asked. “You’re not going to fight them, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “No,” and then, as casually as if he were telling her what he had for breakfast, he said, “If they blow up the tracks and we don’t stop, I’ll die like everybody else, like as not. But if they cut us off and we’re able to halt ourselves in time, well . . . I sent word along to Bloody Bill’s old crew that I was still riding the train. I also mentioned that there was a woman here who they ought to look out for. I meant you, but I wasn’t real specific.” The ranger gave her a look that implied he’d told them she was a Confederate nurse, but he wasn’t going to air that extra bit in front of the inspectors. “As for you fellas, I don’t think they’d bother you none. You’re obviously not Yankees, so if you keep your head low and wait out the trouble, I bet you’ll mostly be all right, no matter how it falls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercy said, “Thank you, I think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome. Anyway, here’s why you boys are in on this talk,” he said to the inspectors. “The Rebs have told me they think they’ve seen your troops, and they’re scared just plain shitless, if you catch my speaking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inspectors made noises indicating that yes, they got the unpleasant gist of shitless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ve made it way far north, fellas. They’re well outside of everybody’s jurisdiction now—mine, yours, the U.S. government’s. We’re so far gone from Texas, or any part of any state that might have been Texas, or might be Texas one day, that it’s just plain ludicrous. Nobody but those oddball Mormons are in charge out there, and they’re just barely afloat. But those troops are definitely working their way through Utah. When we leave this train, you fellas and me, I want us to make some kind of arrangement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of arrangement?” asked Inspector Portilla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A gentleman’s arrangement. Which is to say: I don’t like you, and I don’t want to be your friend any more than you want to be mine. But somebody’s got to vouch for each of us, you get me? When we find out what’s going on, I can’t have you accusing my government of something it didn’t do, and you won’t have me accusing your government of something it didn’t do, either. We’ll sort this out, make a statement, agree on it, and present it to both sides so nobody gets all up in arms about it, however the cards fall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few brief seconds of consultation in Spanish, the inspectors decided they were amenable to this and offered their hands. They shook on it. Then Horatio Korman told them, “I’ve got the latest rough estimate of the mob’s position. When we get off the train at Salt Lake City, we’ll go out there together and see what we can find out. It looks to me like they’re too damn close for comfort, if they’re . . .” He hesitated, then said, “. . . sick, or whatever they are. They’re coming up on cities, and people. Bigger places than they met out in West Texas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInspector Galeano said, “And the more people they meet, the more the trouble grows. Yes, Ranger Korman,” he said, using the formal title like he’d known it all along. “Your terms are reasonable. And you are right: If we do not sort this out together, there could be more war, based on misunderstanding. And I will not have it on my watch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nor I on mine,” said the Texian. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to have a little chat with the nurse here in private.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inspectors made polite excuses and withdrew, ostensibly to the caboose, leaving Mercy and Horatio Korman alone in the deserted sleeper car. She rose and took the seat across from him, so they could face each other more directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “This is the part where you tell me what you were up to an hour ago, when I saw the edge of your pretty blue cloak fluttering on top of the caboose. Gave me a hell of a start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Korman!” she exclaimed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t play dumb with me; it’s too late for that. What’d you turn up back there? What did you and . . . Was it that uppity Yankee woman? That Clay woman, riding with her auntie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercy sighed and did not argue, which he took for a yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What were the two of you doing up there, if not heading up and over, into that rear car? What did you find?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was her idea. And we found bodies,” she told him. “And drugs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bodies? Drugs? Well, I guess I already knew about the bodies—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Ranger Korman, I don’t think you understand. All of this is tied up together. Your missing Mexicans; the dead men in the back of the train; the army scientist who’s off his rocker, scaring everyone away from the caboose exit with his Winchester . . . All of this is part of the same thing; I can feel it in my bones,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she told him the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first few days of the ride to Salt Lake City were tense and dark, overshadowed by a cluster of clouds that never quite dropped snow but never quite went away, either. The train rolled, darkened and patched, along the rails and out of the prairies and plains of the Midwest, climbing in and around the edges of the Rockies, and then up, and around, and through the narrow places and the frightening black tunnels. Gradually the train took on elevation. Sometimes the going was easy and the train chugged with something like merriment, as if it were a dog being taken for a swift sprint around a yard. But sometimes when the sky hung low and the train’s course took it higher up against the clouds, every firing of every piston felt like a horrendous chore that it didn’t wish to perform. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dreadnought-the-clockwork-century-2/page-50.html","bookId":2551,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:29:04 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:29:04 AM"}
