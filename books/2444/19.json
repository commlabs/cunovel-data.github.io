As we stood awaiting the onslaught, the huge door behind Hooky opened and four more vampaneze stepped through to join the others. That made it twenty-eight to six. We hadn\u0027t a hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so pleased with yourselves now, are you?\" Hooky jeered, hobbling forward a few gleeful paces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about that,\" Vancha sniffed. \"This just means more of you for us to kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooky\u0027s smile vanished. \"Are you arrogant or ignorant?\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither,\" Vancha said, gazing calmly at our foes. \"I\u0027m a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really think you stand a chance against us?\" Hooky sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Vancha answered softly. \"Were we fighting honest, noble vampaneze, I\u0027d think otherwise. But a vampaneze who sends armed humans to fight his battles is a coward, without honour. I have nothing to fear from such pitiable beasts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful what you say,\" the vampaneze to the left of Hooky growled. \"We don\u0027t take kindly to insults.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re the ones who\u0027ve been insulted,\" Vancha replied. \"There\u0027s honour in dying at the hands of a worthy foe. If you\u0027d sent your best warriors against us and killed us, we\u0027d have died with smiles on our lips. But to send these... these...\" He spat into the dust of the floor. \"There\u0027s no word low enough to describe them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampets bristled at that, but the vampaneze looked uneasy, almost ashamed, and I realized they were no fonder of the vampets than we were. Vancha noticed this too and slowly loosened his belts of shurikens. \"Drop your arrow guns,\" he said to Steve, Harkat and Debbie. They stared at him dumbly. \"Do it!\" he insisted gruffly and they complied. Vancha held up his bare hands. \"We\u0027ve put our long-range weapons aside. Will you order your pets to do the same and engage us honourably - or will you have us shot down in cold blood like the curs I think you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot them!\" Hooky screamed, his voice laced with hatred. \"Shoot them all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampets raised their weapons and took aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" the vampaneze to Hooky\u0027s left bellowed and the vampets paused. \"By all the shadows of the night, I say no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooky whirled on him. \"Are you crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beware,\" the vampaneze warned him. \"If you cross me on this, I\u0027ll kill you where you stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooky stepped back, stunned. The vampaneze faced the vampets. \"Drop your guns,\" he commanded. \"We\u0027ll fight with our traditional weapons. With honour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampets obeyed the order. Vancha turned and winked at us while they were laying their weapons aside. Then he faced the vampaneze again. \"Before we start,\" he said, \"I\u0027d like to know what manner of creature this thing with the hooks is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a vampaneze!\" Hooky replied indignantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Vancha smirked. \"I\u0027ve never seen one with mismatched eyes before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooky\u0027s eyes twitched exploratively. \"Damn!\" he shouted. \"It must have slipped out when I fell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What slipped out?\" Vancha asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A contact lens,\" I answered softly. \"He\u0027s wearing red contact lenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No I\u0027m not!\" Hooky yelled. \"That\u0027s a lie! Tell them, Bargen. My eyes are as red as yours and my skin\u0027s as purple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampaneze to Hooky\u0027s left shuffled his feet with embarrassment. \"He is a vampaneze,\" he said, \"but he\u0027s only been recently blooded. He wanted to look like the rest of us, so he wears contacts and...\" Bargen coughed into a fist. \"He paints his face and body purple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Traitor!\" Hooky howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBargen looked up at him, disgusted, then spat into the dust of the floor as Vancha had moments before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What has the world come to when the vampaneze blood maniacs like this and recruit humans to fight for them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha asked quietly and there was no mockery in his voice - it was a genuine, puzzled query.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Times change,\" Bargen answered. \"We don\u0027t like the changes, but we accept them. Our Lord has said it must be so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what the great Lord of the Vampaneze has brought to his people?\" Vancha barked. \"Human thugs and crazy, hook-handed monsters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not crazy!\" Hooky shouted. \"Except crazy with rage!\" He pointed at me and snarled. \"And it\u0027s all his fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha turned and stared at me, as did everybody else in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren?\" Mr. Crepsley asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what he\u0027s talking about,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liar!\" Hooky laughed and started dancing. \"Liar, liar, pants on fire!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know this creature!\" Mr. Crepsley enquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I insisted. \"The first time I saw him was when he attacked me in the alley. I never-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lies!\" Hooky screamed, then stopped dancing and glared at me. \"Pretend all you like, man, but you know who I am. And you know what you did to drive me to this.\" He held up his arms, so the hooks glinted in the light of the candles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly,\" I swore, \"I haven\u0027t a clue what you\u0027re on about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\" he sneered. \"It\u0027s easy to lie to a mask. Let\u0027s see if you can stick to your lie when faced with-\" he removed the balaclava with one quick sweep of his left hooks, revealing his face \"- this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a round, heavy, bearded face, smeared with purple paint. For a few seconds I couldn\u0027t place it. Then, putting it together with the missing hands, and the familiarity of the voice that I\u0027d previously noted, I nailed him. \"Reggie Veggie?\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me that!\" he shrieked. \"It\u0027s R.V. - and it stands for Righteous Vampaneze!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry. R.V. was a man I\u0027d run into not long after joining the Cirque Du Freak, an eco-warrior who\u0027d devoted his life to the protection of the countryside. We\u0027d been friends until he found me killing animals to feed the Little People. He set out to free the Wolf Man - he thought we were mistreating him - but the savage beast bit his arms off. The last time I\u0027d seen him, he\u0027d been fleeing into the night, screaming loudly, \"My hands! My hands!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was here. With the vampaneze. And I began to understand why I\u0027d been set up and who was behind it. \"You sent those forms to Mahler\u0027s!\" I accused him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned slyly, then shook his head. \"With hands like these?\" He waved the hooks at me. \"They\u0027re good for chopping and slicing and gutting, but not for writing. I played my part to get you down here, but it was one with a lot more cunning than me who dreamt the plan up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" Vancha interrupted. \"Who is this lunatic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll tell you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Optimistic to the last,\" Vancha chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped closer to R.V., ignoring the threat of the vampaneze and vampets, until I was only a metre or so away. I studied his face silently. He fidgeted but didn\u0027t back off. \"What happened to you?\" I asked, appalled. \"You loved life. You were gentle and kind. You were a vegetarian!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not any more,\" R.V. chuckled. \"I eat plenty of meat now and I like it bloody!\" His smile faded. \"You happened to me, you and your band of freaks. You ruined my life, man. I wandered the world, alone, frightened, defenceless, until the vampaneze took me in. They gave me strength. They equipped me with new hands. In turn, I helped give them you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head sadly. \"You\u0027re wrong. They haven\u0027t made you strong. They\u0027ve turned you into an abomination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face darkened. \"Take that back! Take that back or I\u0027ll-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before this goes any further,\" Vancha interrupted dryly, \"could I ask one more question? It\u0027s my final one.\" R.V. stared at him in silence. \"If you didn\u0027t set us up, who did?\" R.V. said nothing. Nor did the other vampaneze. \"Come on!\" Vancha shouted. \"Don\u0027t be shy. Who\u0027s the clever boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence held a few moments more. Then, from behind us, somebody said in a soft, wicked voice, \"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whirled around to see who\u0027d spoken. So did Vancha, Harkat and Mr. Crepsley. But Debbie didn\u0027t whirl, because she was standing still, a knife pressed to the soft flesh of her throat. And Steve Leopard didn\u0027t whirl either, because he was standing beside her - holding the knife!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe gawped wordlessly at the pair. I blinked twice, slowly, thinking maybe that would restore sanity to the world. But it didn\u0027t. Steve was still there, holding his knife on Debbie, grinning darkly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take off your gloves,\" Mr. Crepsley said, his voice strained. \"Take them off and show us your hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve smiled knowingly, then put the fingertips of his left hand - which was wrapped around Debbie\u0027s throat - to his mouth, gripped the ends of the glove with his teeth, and pulled his hand free. The first thing my eyes went to was the cross carved into the flesh of his palm, the cross he\u0027d made the night he vowed to track me down and kill me. Then my eyes slid from his palm to the end of his fingers, and I understood why Mr. Crepsley had asked him to remove the glove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were five small scars running along his fingertips - the sign that he was a creature of the night. But Steve hadn\u0027t been blooded by a vampire. He\u0027d been blooded by one of the others. He was a half-vampaneze! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allies-of-the-night-the-saga-of-darren-shan-8/page-19.html","bookId":2444,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:09 PM"}
