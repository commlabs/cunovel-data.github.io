The forest around us was so silent that when I spoke the sound of my own voice startled me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No,” she said — and her voice was smooth as flowing water, “I have not lost my way. Will he come to me, your beautiful dog?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before I could speak, Voyou crept to her and laid his silky head against her knees.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But surely,” said I, “you did not come here alone.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Alone? I did come alone.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But the nearest settlement is Cardinal, probably nineteen miles from where we are standing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I do not know Cardinal,” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ste. Croix in Canada is forty miles at least — how did you come into the Cardinal Woods?” I asked amazed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Into the woods?” she repeated a little impatiently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She did not answer at first but stood caressing Voyou with gentle phrase and gesture.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your beautiful dog I am fond of, but I am not fond of being questioned,” she said quietly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My name is Ysonde and I came to the fountain here to see your dog.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I was properly quenched. After a moment or two I did say that in another hour in would be growing dusky, but she neither replied nor looked at me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This,” I ventured, “is a beautiful pool — you call it a fountain — a delicious fountain: I have never before seen it. It is hard to imagine that nature did all this.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is it?” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don’t you think so?” I asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I haven’t thought; I wish when you go you would leave me your dog.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My — my dog?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you don’t mind,” she said sweetly, and looked at me for the first time in the face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For an instant our glances met, then she grew grave, and I saw that her eyes were fixed on my forehead. Suddenly she rose and drew nearer, looking intently at my forehead. There was a faint mark there, a tiny crescent, just over my eyebrow. It was a birthmark.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is that a scar?” she demanded drawing nearer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That crescent-shaped mark? No.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No? Are you sure?” she insisted.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perfectly,” I replied, astonished.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A— a birthmark?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes — may I ask why?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As she drew away from me, I saw that the color had fled from her cheeks. For a second she clasped both hands over her eyes as if to shut out my face, then slowly dropping her hands, she sat down on a long square block of stone which half encircled the basin, and on which to my amazement I saw carving. Voyou went to her again and laid his head in her lap.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is your name?” she asked at length.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Roy Cardenhe.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mine is Ysonde. I carved these dragon-flies on the stone, these fishes and shells and butterflies you see.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You! They are wonderfully delicate — but those are not American dragon-flies —”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No — they are more beautiful. See, I have my hammer and chisel with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She drew from a queer pouch at her side a small hammer and chisel and held them toward me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are very talented,” I said, “where did you study?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I? I never studied — I knew how. I saw things and cut them out of stone. Do you like them? Some time I will show you other things that I have done. If I had a great lump of bronze I could make your dog, beautiful as he is.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her hammer fell into the fountain and I leaned over and plunged my arm into the water to find it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is there, shining on the sand,” she said, leaning over the pool with me . . . “Where,” said I, looking at our reflected faces in the water. For it was only in the water that I had dared, as yet, to look her long in the face.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The pool mirrored the exquisite oval of her head, the heavy hair, the eyes. I heard the silken rustle of her girdle, I caught the flash of a white arm, and the hammer was drawn up dripping with spray.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The troubled surface of the pool grew calm and again I saw her eyes reflected.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Listen,” she said in a low voice, “do you think you will come again to my fountain?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will come,” I said. My voice was dull; the noise of water filled my ears.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then a swift shadow sped across the pool; I rubbed my eyes. Where her reflected face had bent beside mine there was nothing mirrored but the rosy evening sky with one pale star glimmering.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I drew myself up and turned. She was gone. I saw the faint stars twinkling above me in the afterglow, I saw the tall trees motionless in the still evening air, I saw my dog slumbering at my feet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sweet scent in the air had faded, leaving in my nostrils the heavy odor of fern and forest mould. A blind fear seized me, and I caught up my gun and sprang into the darkening woods.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The dog followed me, crashing through the undergrowth at my side. Duller and duller grew the light, but I strode on, the sweat pouring from my face and hair, my mind a chaos. How I reached the spinney I can hardly tell. As I turned up the path I caught a glimpse of a human face peering at me from the darkening thicket — a horrible human face, yellow and drawn with high-boned cheeks and narrow eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Involuntarily I halted; the dog at my heels snarled. Then I sprang straight at it, floundering blindly through the thicket, but the night had fallen swiftly and I found myself panting and struggling in a maze of twisted shrubbery and twining vines, unable to see the very undergrowth that ensnared me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was a pale face, and a scratched one that I carried to a late dinner that night. Howlett served me, dumb reproach in his eyes, for the soup had been standing and the grouse was juiceless.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n David brought the dogs in after they had had their supper, and I drew my chair before the blaze and set my ale on a table beside me. The dogs curled up at my feet, blinking gravely at the sparks that snapped and flew in eddying showers from the heavy birch logs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “David,” said I, “did you say you saw a Chinaman today?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I did sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What do you think about it now?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I may have been mistaken sir —”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But you think not. What sort of whiskey did you put in my flask today?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The usual, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is there much gone?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “About three swallows, sir, as usual.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don’t suppose there could have been any mistake about that whiskey — no medicine could have gotten into it for instance.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n David smiled and said, “No sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well,” said I, “I have had an extraordinary dream.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When I said “dream,” I felt comforted and reassured. I had scarcely dared to say it before, even to myself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “An extraordinary dream,” I repeated; “I fell asleep in the woods about five o’clock, in that pretty glade where the fountain — I mean the pool is. You know the place?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I do not, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I described it minutely, twice, but David shook his head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Carved stone did you say sir? I never chanced on it. You don’t mean the New Spring —”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, no! This glade is way beyond that. Is it possible that any people inhabit the forest between here and the Canada line?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nobody short of Ste. Croix; at least I have no knowledge of any.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course,” said I, “when I thought I saw a Chinaman, it was imagination. Of course I had been more impressed than I was aware of by your adventure. Of course you saw no Chinaman, David.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Probably not, sir,” replied David dubiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I sent him off to bed, saying I should keep the dogs with me all night; and when he was gone, I took a good long draught of ale, “just to shame the devil,” as Pierpont said, and lighted a cigar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then I thought of Barris and Pierpont, and their cold bed, for I knew they would not dare build a fire, and, in spite of the hot chimney corner and the crackling blaze, I shivered in sympathy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ll tell Barris and Pierpont the whole story and take them to see the carved stone and the fountain,” I thought to myself; “what a marvelous dream it was — Ysonde — if it was a dream.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then I went to the mirror and examined the faint white mark above my eyebrow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/lizhi/1023/30786.html","bookId":248,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:51:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:51:33 AM"}
