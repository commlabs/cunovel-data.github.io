But still, he\u0027d stop if she wanted him to. “What is it, Ree?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I fear I need a bath.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barked out a laugh. “A bath, is it? This is your great confession?” Nuzzling and nipping at her neck, he inhaled with exaggerated deliberation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe yelped, squirming beneath him. “Stop that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ree. Lovely Ree.” He pinned her beneath him, chuckling. “A bath you shall have. After. But for now, you\u0027re perfect.” He nestled himself over her, coming to rest in his rightful place, in the cleft of her thighs. “Och, Ree,” he whispered, his voice hoarse. “You\u0027re so perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was. Marjorie had taken him to a place he thought he\u0027d lost, and he\u0027d be forever grateful, forever hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled onto his back, swooping her up onto his belly, and she gave a little cry of pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cormac… “ She pulled up, tracing a seductive finger along her lacy neckline. “Don\u0027t you think I\u0027d be more perfect if I were naked, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My thoughts precisely, love.” He made quick work of the laces up her back, and she wriggled eagerly out of her gown. The moment her breasts bobbed free of her tight bodice, his breath caught. Perfection indeed. Would he ever get used to the sight of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come to me, Ree,” he said, his voice low with desire. He pulled her up so she straddled him, and then he eased her slowly down onto him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Always,” she whispered, and the word made his heart clench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a deep, shuddering sigh, her eyes fluttered shut. But he kept his own eyes riveted to her, straining to take in her every aspect in the dying light. Her slim shoulders beneath the wavy curtain of her hair. The blush of her nipples, dusky in the twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached up to knead her breasts. They stiffened under his palms, and she moaned, mindlessly parting her lips with her pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you closer,” he said, his voice husky. He shifted onto his elbows, kissing his way up her torso, until he sat upright with her in his lap. “You\u0027re never close enough.” He rubbed his hands up and down her back, and then eased her backward so that he could taste each breast. She writhed over him, and he pumped and ground her closer, until she flung back her head, crying out. Raking his hand in her hair, he kissed her, the thrust of his tongue echoing the rhythm of his cock, until his climax pulsed deep inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey collapsed sideways, lying in a tangle on the bed. Marjorie idly traced the damp hair from Cormac\u0027s cooling brow, until their heartbeats gradually slowed. “I know what we must do now,” she said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I permitted to guess?” He playfully swept his hand down to fondle her backside. But he quickly grew intent, kissing along her neck, down to her breasts, his body stirring again already. “If you must have it again just now, love, we\u0027d best get started.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she remained serious, and Cormac grew serious, too, sensing her resolve. He pulled away and sighed, meeting her gaze. “Out with it, Ree. What is it we must do now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ship.” She gave a slight nod, and the distant look in her eye worried him. “We must destroy the Oliphant.” Chapter 29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We?” He disentangled himself from her, moving to sit on the edge of the bed. “We must destroy the ship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course we. I can\u0027t very well do it by myself.” Marjorie extracted the sheet from the rumple of bed linens and covered herself, her body chilled without him. “Have I upset you?” He appeared to give the question thorough consideration, and then, inexplicably, he began to laugh. His easy, lopsided grin put her at her ease. “Not in the slightest, actually,” he said, standing up. “I\u0027m feeling difficult to upset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat straight up. “Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t fash yourself, Ree. I\u0027ll not leave the premises.” He stepped into his trews and then strolled to the side table. “Unless you wish me to race down to the docks immediately and set fire to the ship. Or were you of a mind for something more along the lines of, say, an explosion? With black powder perhaps?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hadn\u0027t considered something so spectacular as all that. Where would someone even get black powder?” He gave her an amazed look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was joking. She pouted back at him. “Cormac, be serious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I am.” He retrieved a chipped white and blue basin. “We have terribly serious business to attend.” His body was taut, and she stared, enthralled by the minute flex of muscles in his back and arms as he walked to the door. She regretted mentioning the ship. She should\u0027ve held her tongue and kept him in her bed a while longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he couldn\u0027t get far with his shirt trapped beneath her leg. “What business? What are you doing?” He paused in the doorway. “Earlier, you\u0027d asked for a bath. Before we pursue any nonsense pertaining to ships or smugglers, I\u0027d honor your request.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But Humphrey doesn\u0027t know you\u0027re here. You can\u0027t just—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door, and somebody gasped and stumbled backward. Marjorie swiftly pulled her sheet higher, covering her shoulders, and craned her neck to peek. It was one of the girls Fiona kept about to help with the washing, a young dark-haired wisp of a thing, and she\u0027d been listening in the doorway. How Cormac knew the girl would be standing there, she had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body altered slightly, and Marjorie was mesmerized to watch his metamorphosis from lover into threat. “You work for Fiona?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCowering, the girl gave a panicked nod. The poor creature was likely no older than twelve. Marjorie rolled her eyes — it was a young age at which to be exposed to the full force of Cormac MacAlpin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you value this work, do you not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him another fretful nod, this time accompanied by a curtsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you\u0027ll fetch us water. Warm, mind.” He handed her the basin. She reached for it, but he held it in place as he added, “And if anyone becomes aware of my presence here, I\u0027ll know it was you who told them. Just as I knew you were listening outside this door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding frantically now, she edged backward before spinning and dashing down the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut the door, saying with a smile, “You\u0027ll have your bath directly. Well, not a full bath, but I\u0027ve my ideas.” Stalking to the bed, he peeled the sheet from her torso and ran a possessive hand down her body. “I assure you, it will be a thorough one, at the very least.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spied the thick bulge in his trews, and goose bumps rippled across her skin. All thoughts of the Oliphant fled to the back of her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the girl returned, Cormac had found a linen washcloth, a new cake of Marjorie\u0027s favorite rose soap, and he had her spread across the bed like a holiday meal on the table. Before the maid had a chance to knock, he opened the door, just a crack this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put the bowl down. Aye, that\u0027s the way,” Cormac said in a low voice. His body blocked the door, and Marjorie could only imagine the terror on the poor girl\u0027s face. “I\u0027ve told you what\u0027ll happen if folk find out I\u0027m here, but would you like to know what will happen if they don\u0027t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a rustling, a pause, and then he continued, “Your mistress Marjorie is a good woman. I\u0027m only here because she needs help. She\u0027s done no wrong, and you do no wrong if you choose to help her, too. If you mind me, I\u0027ve a thruppence in my sporran, and it\u0027ll be just for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarjorie heard a childlike gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But heed this,” he added sternly. “If I catch you listening at this door one more time, the thruppence is mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the pattering of bare feet as the girl dashed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your touch with children is magical,” Marjorie said with a laugh. “All glowering and bribes. How\u0027d I not think of it myself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy, lass. I ken you\u0027re not above bribery.” He came to the edge of the bed, basin in hand. “I\u0027ve seen you dole out your wee packets of steak pie to the Saint Machar lads, who, by the by, could do with a fair spot of glowering besides.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStripping off his trews, he knelt before the bed, and excitement thrummed through her. Whatever did he have in mind? Slipping his hands beneath her calves, he pulled her to the edge of the bed. The thrumming intensified to fire crackling in her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked his hands up her legs, and with a gende squeeze, parted them. She lay naked before him, and the cool air on her bare skin made her breasts pull tight. The wickedness of it made her heart skip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, enough of your ships and your plans and your sass.” He rubbed his thumbs in languid circles on the insides of her thighs. “You\u0027d longed for a bath, and I\u0027ll not allow anyone to say I\u0027m not a good man to my woman.” His woman. She thought her soul would burst from her body, so exhilarating did that sound. “Your woman, am I?” Rather than answer, he studiously dipped the cloth in the water, a wicked grin cocking the corner of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to lie back, Ree. For the full effect, aye?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did as he told her, the thrill of it bringing a secret smile to her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tensed at the first shocking touch of wet washcloth on skin. But the water was warm, his touch confident, and soon she relaxed into the bed. He began at her feet, massaging them, and the cloth was just rough enough not to tickle yet soft enough so as not to abrade. She gave a little hum of contentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCormac methodically washed, rinsed the rag, and washed some more, and she gladly let him. She felt love in his touch, even if he hadn\u0027t yet spoken the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis woman. He\u0027d called her his woman. But for how long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s to come of us, Cormac?” she asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the tinkling of water wrung into the bowl. He rose and sat on the bed, swabbing the cloth along the side of her hip. “Come of us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When all this is done.” Her skin was cool where the damp cloth had touched her, but her blood pumped hot, her body responding to the rhythmic stroking of his hand along her torso. “We can\u0027t just go on as before.” His eyes met hers, held them. “No,” he agreed at last, his voice a low rasp. “Not the same as before.” She saw hesitation in his eyes. “But… ?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-highlander-clan-macalpin-1/page-41.html","bookId":2656,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:59 AM"}
