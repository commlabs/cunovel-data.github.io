He wants more, and reaches for it, but I push him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" I whisper. \"The night is still young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s almost morning,\" he says, recalling my line from the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn away. \"I want to gamble first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a degenerate gambler, I know, dice are better than sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re talking, Lara,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe go down to the casino. It\u0027s only a few days before Christmas but the place is packed. The image of a nuclear bomb exploding on the Strip haunts me. Of course, that will never happen. Even if we set a\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;nuclear warhead to go off at the compound, it would not affect Las Vegas, except for slight fallout--if the wind is blowing the wrong way. I wonder if Seymour\u0027s dream means I will succeed in my mission or fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glowing angel, flying above the world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe play craps, dice, and I am the designated roller. Without trying, I throw ten passes in a row and the table cheers me on. Andy bets heavily, wins plenty, and drinks even more. Before we leave the first table, he is drunk. I scold him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be a scientist when you keep killing off your brain cells?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, throwing an arm over my shoulder. \"I\u0027d rather be a lover than a scientist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk down the Strip to another casino, the Excalibur. Here it is even more crowded. It is a fact that the town never sleeps. We play blackjack, twenty-one. I count cards, only betting heavily when the deck favors the player. But the advantage from even perfect counting is limited, and we don\u0027t win any money. Andy drags me back to the dice table--his favorite. The dice come to me, and again I throw another six passes in a row. But I don\u0027t want Andy to win too much and be free of debt. Just as the sun begins to color the sky, I drag him back to the Mirage, to my hotel suite. Once there, he falls on my bed, exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate what I do,\" he mutters to the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate that I can\u0027t read his mind. It must be the booze. I sit beside him. \"Another hard night at work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shouldn\u0027t talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can. Don\u0027t worry--I\u0027m good at keeping secrets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My boss is crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The general?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He\u0027s stark raving mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean? What is he doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy sits up and glances at me with bloodshot eyes. \"Remember I told you we were working on an amaz?ing discovery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You said it was one of the greatest discoveries of modern time.\" I smile. \"I thought you were trying to impress me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. \"I wasn\u0027t exaggerating. We\u0027re playing with explosive genetic material, and that\u0027s putting it mildly. This general has ordered us to artificially done it. Do you know what that means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. \"You\u0027re going to make more of it--in a test tube.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. That\u0027s a layman\u0027s view, but it is essentially correct.\" He stares out the window, at the glitter that is the Strip. When he speaks again, his voice reflects the horror he feds. \"We are going to try to duplicate something that, if it got out, could affect all of mankind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s worse than I thought. The charade must end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has given me an opening. I must seize it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy?\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me. I catch his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Lara?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not push him, not yet, but I do not let him turn away either. A narrow tunnel of whirling blue fog exists between us. He is at one end, chained to a hard wall, and I am steadily rushing toward him, shadows at my back. I hold his attention but slightly blur his focus. Since ingesting Yaksha\u0027s blood, my mind-altering abilities are more refined, more powerful. I have to be careful I don\u0027t destroy his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is not Lara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tries to blink, fails. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. I am not who I appear to be.\" I pause. \"I know what you are working on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitates. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know your prisoner. He is a friend of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I lied to you last night, and I\u0027m sorry. I won\u0027t lie to you anymore. I came to Las Vegas for the purpose of freeing my friend.\" I touch his knee. \"But I didn\u0027t come to hurt you. I didn\u0027t know I would end up caring for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has to take a breath, \"I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to relax my hold on him. The pressure inside his skull is building. Sweat stands out on his forehead. Standing, I turn my back to him and walk to the window to look out at the Strip. The Christmas decorations glitter even amid the neon in the faint light of the dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you do understand,\" I say. \"You are holding a prisoner, Joel Drake. He is an FBI agent, but since you have begun to examine him you have come to see that he\u0027s much more than that. His blood is different from that of most humans, and this difference makes him very strong, very quick. That\u0027s why you keep him locked up in a special cell. Your general tells you he is dangerous. Yet this same general makes you and your partners work night and day so that you can change more people\u0027s blood to match that of the supposedly dangerous prisoner.\" I pause. \"Is this not accurate, Andy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is a long time answering. His voice comes out hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know these things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to face him. \"I told you. I am his friend. I am here to rescue him. I need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy can\u0027t stop staring at me. It\u0027s as if I\u0027m a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They said there was another,\" he mumbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you the one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winces. \"Are you like him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts a hand to his head. \"Oh God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more, I sit beside him on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are not evil,\" I say. \"I know what you must have been told, but it is not true. We only fight when threatened. The men and woman who died-on L.A. trying to arrest us--we didn\u0027t want to harm them. But they came after us, they cornered us. We had no choice but to defend ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head is buried in his hands. He is close to weeping. \"But you killed many others before that night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not true. The one who did the killing--he was an aberration. His name was Eddie Fender. He accidentally got a hold of our blood. I stopped him, but Eddie is a perfect example of what can happen if this blood gets out. You said it yourself a moment ago--it could affect all of humanity. Worse, it would destroy all of humanity. I am here to stop that. I am here to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peers up at me, his fingers still covering much of his face. \"That\u0027s why you can throw the dice the way you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else can you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. All that matters is that more people are not allowed to become like me and my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many are there of you?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought there were just two of us left. But I suspect you have another at the compound.\" I pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns away. \"I can\u0027t tell you. I don\u0027t know who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you know me better than anyone. You\u0027ve seen what my DNA is like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands and walks to the far wall. He puts a hand on it for support, breathing rapidly. \"The man you speak of--Joel--he\u0027s ill. He has fever, severe cramps. We don\u0027t know what to do with him.\" Andy struggles. My revelation is too much for him. \"Do you know?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Have you kept him out of the sunlight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He\u0027s in a cell, in a basement. There is no sun\" He pauses. \"Is he allergic to the sun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy frowns. \"But how does it make him ill? I told you, he doesn\u0027t see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sun is not what makes him ill. I was only ruling out a possibility. He is sick because he is hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we have fed him. It doesn\u0027t help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not feeding him what he needs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy almost crumbles. \"No,\" he moans. \"You\u0027re like vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and approach him cautiously, not wishing to scare him worse than I already have. \"We are vam?pires, Andy. Joel has been one only a few days. I changed him in order to prevent him from dying. Eddie had mortally wounded him. Believe me, I don\u0027t go around making vampires. It\u0027s against my-- principles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy struggles to get a grip on himself. \"Who made you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A vampire by the name of Yaksha. He was the first of our kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When was this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\" he demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five thousand years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy revealing my age does not help the situation. The strength goes out of Andy, he slides to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRolling into a ball, he recoils as I come closer. I halt in midstride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want from me?\" he mumbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your help. I need to get into your compound and get my friend out before the world is destroyed. It is that simple. The danger is that great. And you know I\u0027m not exaggerating. Our blood in the hands of your general is more dangerous than plutonium in the hands of terrorists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy nods weakly. \"Oh, I believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you will help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy question startles him. \"What? How can I help you? You\u0027re some kind of monster. You\u0027re the source of this danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI speak firmly. \"I have walked this world since the dawn of history. In all that time, there have been only myths and rumors of my existence, and the existence of others like me. And those myths and rumors weren\u0027t based on fact. They were just stories. Because in all this time none of us has set out to destroy humanity. Yet your general will do this, whether he wants to or not. Listen to me, Andy! He has to be stopped and you have to help me stop him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! Do you want him to clone Joel\u0027s blood? Do you want that material shipped to a weapons plant in the heart of the Pentagon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger shakes Andy. \"No! I want to destroy the blood! I don\u0027t need your lectures. I know what it can do. I have studied it inside out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move closer, kneel on the floor beside him. \"Look at me, Andy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowers his head. \"You might cast a spell on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need spells to convince you of the truth. I am not the enemy. Without my assistance, you won\u0027t be able to stop this thing from progressing to the next level. Try to imagine a society where everyone has our vampire strength and appetites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visions I conjure make him sick. \"You really drink human blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I need it to live. But I do not need to kill or even harm the person I drink from. Usually, they don\u0027t even know what has happened. They just wake up the next day with a headache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy remark causes him to smile unexpectedly. \"I woke up with a headache this evening. Did you drink some of my blood without my knowing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle softly. \"No. Your headaches are your problem. Unless you cut down on the booze, your liver is going to give out. Listen to the advice of a five-thousand-year-old doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally looks at me, \"You\u0027re not really that old, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was alive when Krishna walked the earth. I met him in fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was he like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Krishna was cool?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He didn\u0027t kill me. He mustn\u0027t have thought I was a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy is calming down. \"I\u0027m sorry I called you that. It\u0027s just--well, I\u0027ve never met a vampire before, I mean, I was never in a hotel room with one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you glad you didn\u0027t sleep with me last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously forgot that small point \"Would I have been changed into a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It takes more than sex with an immortal to make you immortal.\" I speak delicately. \"But you may know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is grim. \"There has to be a blood transfer to bring about the change. I imagine a lot of blood is involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that is correct. Have your experiments estab?lished that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have established a few things. But the human immune system reacts violently to this kind of blood. It embraces it and at the same time tries to destroy it. We have postulated that a large infusion of this DNA code would transform the entire system. Actually, we think your DNA would just take over, and replicate itself throughout every cell in the body.\" He pauses. \"Is that what happened when Yaksha changed you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitate. I don\u0027t want to give him information that could be used later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he changed me, I was young. I cried through most of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is dead now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did he die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few days ago.\" I add, \"He wanted to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile faintly, sadly. \"He wanted to be with Krishna. That was all that mattered to him. He was evil when he changed me. But when he died--he was a saint. He loved God very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy stares at me, mystified. \"You\u0027re telling me the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod weakly. The thought of Krishna always shakes me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Maybe I should have told you from the beginning. You see, I was going to try to hypnotize you. I was going to seduce you and offer you money and set your head spinning--until you didn\u0027t know what you were doing.\" I touch his leg gently. \"But none of that is necessary now. You are a true scientist. You seek the truth. You don\u0027t want to harm people. And you know that this blood can harm many people. Give it back to me. I know how to care for it, to keep it out of harm\u0027s way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I help you into the compound, they will lock me away for the rest of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vehicles go in and out of the compound all day. I\u0027ve observed them from a distance. You can bring me ride in your trunk. When no one is looking, I will climb out, and no one will blame you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy\u0027s not convinced. \"Your friend is in a cell in a basement of our main lab. The walls of the cell are of a special metal alloy--even you couldn\u0027t walk through. I know for a fact your partner can\u0027t, watched him try. Also, your friend is under at surveillance. Cameras watch him twenty-four hours a day. Then, there is the security of the camp itself. It is surrounded by towers. The soldiers inside these towers are well armed. The place is a fortress. There are tanks and missiles behind every building.\" He pauses. \"You won\u0027t be able to break him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This special cell where Joel is being held--how does the door to it open?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a button on a control panel just outside the cell. Push it and the door swings aside. But it is a long way from my car trunk to that button. It is a longer way back outside the compound. To escape with your friend, you\u0027ll have to become invisible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. \"We can go over, point by point, the security of the camp. But for now, answer my earlier question. Is there another vampire in the place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitates, lowers his head. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long has he been there? A month?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he captured in Los Angeles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He\u0027s a black youth. He lived in South Central L.A. before he was changed.\" Andy looks up. \"But he never said anything about an Eddie. The person who changed him was someone else. I forget the name right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy theory was correct. \"That other person was changed by Eddie. Trust me--I know the ultimate source of this other vampire. Where is he located in relation to Joel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the cell beside Joel\u0027s. But he\u0027s virtually coma?tose. He has the same disease as your friend--cramps and fever.\" Andy shakes his head. \"We didn\u0027t know what to do for him. He never asked for blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your people must have captured him right after he was changed. No one told him what he is now.\" It isn\u0027t pleasant to contemplate the pain this poor soul is going through. \"I\u0027ll have to take him out as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to carry him then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can do that, if I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy studies me. \"You say you are so old. That must mean you\u0027re smarter than we short-lived mor?tals. If you are, you must know how the odds are stacked against you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have always managed to beat the odds. Look how well I do at the dice tables.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will probably die if you do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not afraid to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is impressed. \"You really aren\u0027t a monster. You\u0027re much braver than I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take his hand. \"I was wrong a minute ago when I said your helping me would not put you at risk. It will take a brave man to sneak me inside the compound in the trunk of his car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezes my hand. \"What\u0027s your real name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sita.\" I add, \"Few people have known me by that name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touches my red hair. \"I was wrong only to say your blood scares me. It fascinates me as well.\" He pauses and a sly grin crosses his face. \"Sex is not enough to make me immortal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It hasn\u0027t worked in the past. But these days are filed with mysterious portents.\" An unexpected\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;warmth for him flows over me. His eyes--they have me hypnotized, with their uncanny depth, their gentle kindness. Smiling, I lean over and hug him and whisper in his ear, \"The dawn is at hand. In ancient times, it was considered a time of transformation, of alchemy. I\u0027ll stay with you, for now.\" I pause. \"Who knows what may happen?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/red-dice-the-last-vampire-3/page-11.html","bookId":2512,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:36 PM"}
