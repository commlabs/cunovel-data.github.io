Millionaire rock star Lucas Wolfe is just as surprised to find the outspoken redhead glaring at him from across a courtroom. Both infuriated and intrigued, he still can\u0027t forget the night Sienna spent with him, and the chemistry between them is as undeniable as ever. Now, Lucas is determined to do whatever it takes to lure Sienna into his bed, even if that means making a deal with her: if she spends ten days with him, playing by his rules, he\u0027ll hand over the deed to her grandmother\u0027s home. Though she agrees to the arrangement for her family\u0027s sake, Sienna struggles with the promises she\u0027s made to herself and a past that still haunts her. Soon, as Lucas\u0027s game of seduction continues and Sienna is introduced to his dark, erotic world, she realizes that at any moment, she could be devoured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/devoured-devoured-1.jpg","author":"Emily Snow","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:08 PM"}
