Even the pursuing guard ships, far behind The Shooting Starr, too far off to get completely accurate fixes on their mass detectors, were perturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCouncilman Wessilewsky contacted Lucky Starr. \"Space, Lucky,\" he said, \"where\u0027s he going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saturn itself, it seems,\" said Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you suppose a ship might be waiting for him on Saturn? I know it has thousands of miles of atmosphere with million-ton pressures, and without Agrav\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emotors they couldn\u0027t... Lucky! Do you suppose they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave Agrav motors and forcefield bubbles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he may be simply crashing to keep us from catching him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWess said dryly, \"If he\u0027s all that anxious to die, why doesn\u0027t he turn and fight, force us to destroy him and maybe take one or two of us with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" said Lucky, \"or why not short-circuit his motors, leaving Saturn a hundred million miles off course? In fact, it bothers me that he should be attracting attention to Saturn this way.\" He fell into a thoughtful silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWess broke in! \"Well, then, can you cut him off, Lucky? Space knows we\u0027re too far away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman shouted from his place at the control panel, \"Sands of Mars, Wess, if we rev up enough ion beam to catch him, well be moving too fast to maneuver him away from Saturn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Space, there\u0027s an intelligent order,\" said Bigman. \"Real helpful. \u0027Do something\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Just keep on the move, Wess. I\u0027ll do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke contact and turned to Bigman. \"Has he answered our signals at all, Bigman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not one word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget that for now and concentrate on tapping his communication beam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s using one, Lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He may at the last minute. He\u0027ll have to take a chance then if he has anything to say at all. Meanwhile we\u0027re going for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missile. Just a small pea-shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his turn to bend over the computer. While The Net of Space moved in an unpowered orbit, it required no great computation to direct a pellet at the proper moment and velocity to strike the fleeing ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky readied the pellet. It was not designed to explode. It didn\u0027t have to. It was only a quarter of an inch in diameter, but the energy of the proton micro-pile would hurl it outward at five hundred miles a second. Nothing in space would diminish that velocity, and the pellet would pass through the hull of The Net of Space as though it were butter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky did not expect it would, however. The pellet would be large enough to be picked up on its quarry\u0027s mass detectors. The Net of Space would automatically correct course to avoid the pellet, and that would throw it off the direct course to Saturn. The time lost by Agent X in computing the new course and correcting it back to the old one might yet allow The Shooting Starr to come close enough to make use of a magnetic grapple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all added up to a slim chance, perhaps vanishingly slim, but there seemed no other possible course of action. Lucky touched a contact. The pellet sped out in a soundless flash, and the ship\u0027s mass-detector needles jumped, then quieted rapidly, as the pellet receded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky sat back. It would take two hours for the pellet to make (or almost make) contact. It occurred to him that Agent X might be completely out of power; that the automatic procedures might direct a course change which could not be followed through; that the pellet would penetrate, blow up the ship, perhaps, and in any case leave its course unchanged and still marked for Saturn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dismissed the idea almost at once. It would be incredible to suppose that Agent X would run out of the last bit of power at the moment his ship took on the precise collision course. It was infinitely more likely that some power was left him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hours of waiting were deadly. Even Hector Gonway, far back on Earth, grew impatient with the periodic bulletins and made direct contact on the sub-ether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where in the Saturnian system do you suppose the base might be?\" he asked worriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there is one,\" said Lucky cautiously, \"If what Agent X is doing is not a tremendous effort to mislead us, I would say the most obvious choice is Titan. It\u0027s Saturn\u0027s one really large satellite, with three times the mass of our own Moon and over twice the surface area. If the Sirians have holed up underground, trying to dredge all of Titan for them would take a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard to believe that they would have dared do this. It\u0027s virtually an act of war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe so, Uncle Hector, but it wasn\u0027t so long ago they tried to establish a base on Ganymede [3].\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman called out sharply, \"Lucky, he\u0027s moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky looked up in surprise. \"Who\u0027s moving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Net of Space. The Sirian cobber.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said hastily, \"I\u0027ll get in touch with you later, Uncle Hector,\" and broke contact. He said, \"But he can\u0027t be moving, Bigman. He can\u0027t possibly have detected the pellet yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look and see for yourself, Lucky. I tell you he\u0027s moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky, in one stride, was at the mass detectors of The Shooting Starr. For a long time now it had had a fix on the fleeing quarry. It had been adjusted for the ship\u0027s unpowered motion through space, and the blob that represented the detectable mass had been a small bright star mark on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now the mark was drifting. It was a short line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s voice was softly intense. \"Great Galaxy, of course! Now it makes sense. How could I think his first duty would be merely to avoid capture? Big-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eman...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Lucky. What?\" The little Martian was ready for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re being outmaneuvered. We\u0027ve got to destroy him now even if it means crashing into Saturn ourselves.\" For the first time since the ion-beam jets had been placed aboard The Shooting Starr the year before, Lucky added the emergency thrusts to the main drive. The ship reeled as every last atom of power it carried was turned into a giant thrust backward that all but burned it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman struggled for breath. \"But what\u0027s it all about, Lucky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not Saturn he\u0027s headed for, Bigman. He was just making use of the full power of its gravitational field to help him keep ahead of us. Now he\u0027s cutting around the planet to get into orbit. It\u0027s the rings he\u0027s headed for. Saturn\u0027s rings.\" The young Councilman\u0027s face was drawn with tension. \"Keep after that communication beam, Bigman. He\u0027ll have to talk now. Now or never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman bent over his wave analyzer with a quickening heartbeat, though for the life of him he could not understand why the thought of Saturn\u0027s rings should so disturb Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Shooting Starr\u0027s pellet came nowhere near its mark, not within fifty thousand miles. But now it was The Shooting Starr itself that was a pellet, striving for junction; and it, too, would miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky groaned. \"We\u0027ll never make it. There\u0027s not enough room left to make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturn was a giant in the sky now, with its rings a thin gash across its face. Saturn\u0027s yellow globe was almost at the full as The Shooting Starr burned toward it from the direction of the Sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Bigman suddenly exploded, \"Why, the dirty cobber! He\u0027s melting into the rings, Lucky. Now I see what got you about the rings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe worked furiously at the mass detector, but it was hopeless. As a portion of the rings came into focus, each of the countless solid masses that composed them formed its own star mark on the screen. The screen turned pure white and The Net of Space was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky shook his head. \"That\u0027s not an insoluble problem. We\u0027re close enough to get a visual fix now. It\u0027s something else that I\u0027m sure is coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky, pale and engrossed, had the visiplate under maximum telescopic enlargement. The Net of Space was a tiny metal cylinder obscured but not hidden by the material of the rings. The individual particles in the rings were no larger than coarse gravel and were only sparkles as they caught and threw back the light of the distant Sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"Lucky! I\u0027ve got his communications beam... No, no, wait now... Yes, I have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a wavering voice crackling in the control room now, obscured and distorted. Bigman\u0027s deft fingers worked at the unscrambler,.trying to fit it better and ever better with the unknown characteristics of the Sirian scrambling system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words would die out, then come back. There was silence except for the faint hum of the recorder taking down permanently whatever came through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... not... wor... hither...\" (Quite a pause while Bigman fought frantically with his detectors.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... on trail and... couldn\u0027t shake... done for and I must transmit... rn\u0027s rings in normal orb... dy launch... sties of or... follow... co-ordinate read thus...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt broke off altogether at that precise point; the voice, the static, everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman yelled, \"Sands of Mars, something\u0027s blown!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing here,\" said Lucky. \"It\u0027s The Net of Space\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had seen it happen two seconds after transmission ceased. Transmission through the sub-ether was at virtually infinite velocity. The light that he saw through the visiplate traveled at only 186,000 miles a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took two seconds for the sight of it to reach Lucky. He saw the rear end of The Net of Space glow a cherry-red, then open and spatter into a flower of melting metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman caught the tail end of it, and he and Lucky watched wordlessly until radiation cooled the spectacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky shook his head. \"That close to the rings, even though you\u0027re outside the main body of them, space has more than its share of speeding material. Maybe he had no further power to run the ship out of the way of one of those bits. Or maybe two pieces converged at him from slightly different directions. In any case, he was a brave man and clever enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t get it, Lucky. What was he doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you see even now? While it was important for him not to fall into our hands, it wasn\u0027t enough for him to die. I should have seen that earlier myself. His most important task was to get the stolen information in his possession to Sirius. He didn\u0027t dare risk the sub-ether for reeling off what may have been thousands of words of information-with ships in pursuit and possibly tapping his beam. He had to restrict his message to the briefest essentials and see to it that the capsule was placed bodily in the grip of the Sirians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could he do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we caught of his message contains the syllable \"orb\"-probably for \"orbit\"-and \"dy launch,\" meaning \"already launched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman caught at Lucky\u0027s arms, his small fingers pinching tightly on the other\u0027s sinewy wrists. \"He launched the capsule into the rings; is that it, Lucky? It\u0027ll be a piece of gravel along with a zillion other pieces, like-a pebble on the Moon-or a water drop in an ocean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or,\" said Lucky, \"like a piece of gravel in Saturn\u0027s rings, which is worst of all. Of course he was destroyed before he could give the co-ordinates of the orbit he had chosen for the capsule, so the Sirians and we start even, and we had better make the most of that without delay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Start looking? Now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now! If he was ready to give the co-ordinates, knowing I was hot after him, he must also have known the Sirians were close by... Contact the ships, Bigman, and give them the news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman turned to the transmitter but never touched it. The reception button was glowing with intercepted radio waves. Radio! Ordinary etheric communication! Obviously someone was close by (certainly within the Saturnian system), and someone, moreover, felt not the least desire for secrecy, since a radio beam, unlike sub-etheric communication, was childishly simple to tap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Let\u0027s receive, Bigman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came through with that trace of accent, that broadening of vowels and sharpening of consonants. It was a Sirian voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt said, \"-fy yourselves before we are forced to place a grapple on you and take you into custody. You have fourteen minutes to acknowledge reception.\" There was a minute\u0027s pause. \"By authority of the Central Body, you are ordered to identify yourself before we are forced to place a grapple on you and take you into custody. You have thirteen minutes to acknowledge reception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said coldly, \"Reception acknowledged. This is The Shooting Starr of the Terrestrial Federation, orbiting peacefully in the spatial volume of the Terrestrial Federation. No authority other than that of the Federation exists in these spaces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a second or two of silence (radio waves travel with only the speed of light) and the voice retorted, \"The authority of the Terrestrial Federation is not recognized on a world colonized by the Sirian peoples.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which world is that?\" asked Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The uninhabited Saturnian system has been taken possession of in the name of our government under the interstellar law that awards any uninhabited world to those who colonize it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not any uninhabited world. Any uninhabited stellar system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer. The voice said stolidly, \"You are now within the Saturnian system and you are requested to leave forthwith. Any delay in acceleration outward will result in our taking you into custody. Any further ships of the Terrestrial Federation entering our territory will be taken into custody without additional warning. Your acceleration out of the Saturnian system must begin within eight minutes or we will take action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman, his face twisted with unholy glee, whispered, \"Let\u0027s go in and get them, Lucky. Let\u0027s show them the old Shooter can fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Lucky paid no attention. He said into the transmitter, \"Your remark is noted. We do not accept Sirian authority, but we choose, of our own will, to leave and will now do so.\" He snapped off contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman was appalled. \"Sands of Mars, Lucky! Are we going to run from a bunch of Sirians? Are we going to leave that capsule in Saturn\u0027s rings for the Sirians to pick up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Right now, Bigman, we have to.\" His head was bent and his face was pale and strained, but there was something in his eyes that was not quite that of a man backing down. Anything but that. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-rings-of-saturn-lucky-starr-6/page-4.html","bookId":1759,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:35 AM"}
