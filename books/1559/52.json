All to the good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey touched swords, and the man in black immediately began the Agrippa defense, which Inigo felt was sound, considering the rocky terrain, for the Agrippa kept the feet stationary at first, and made the chances of slipping minimal. Naturally, he countered with Capo Ferro which surprised the man in black, but he defended well, quickly shifting out of Agrippa and taking the attack himself, using the principles of Thibault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInigo had to smile. No one had taken the attack against him in so long and it was thrilling! He let the man in black advance, let him build up courage, retreating gracefully between some trees, letting his Bonetti defense keep him safe from harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his legs flicked and he was behind the nearest tree, and the man in black had not expected it and was slow reacting. Inigo flashed immediately out from the tree, attacking himself now, and the man in black retreated, stumbled, got his balance, continued moving away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInigo was impressed with the quickness of the balance return. Most men the size of the man in black would have gone down or, at the least, fallen to one hand. The man in black did neither; he simply quickstepped, wrenched his body erect, continued fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were moving parallel to the Cliffs now, and the trees were behind them, mostly. The man in black was slowly being forced toward a group of large boulders, for Inigo was anxious to see how well he moved when quarters were close, when you could not thrust or parry with total freedom. He continued to force, and then the boulders were surrounding them. Inigo suddenly threw his body against a nearby rock, rebounded off it with stunning force, lunging with incredible speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst blood was his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had pinked the man in black, grazed him only, along the left wrist. A scratch was all. But it was bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately the man in black hurried his retreat, getting his position away from the boulders, getting out into the open of the plateau. Inigo followed, not bothering to try to check the other man’s flight; there would always be time for that later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the man in black launched his greatest assault. It came with no warning and the speed and strength of it were terrifying. His blade flashed in the light again and again, and at first, Inigo was only too delighted to retreat. He was not entirely familiar with the style of the attack; it was mostly McBone, but there were snatches of Capo Ferro thrown in, and he continued moving backward while he concentrated on the enemy, figuring the best way to stop the assault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black kept advancing, and Inigo was aware that behind him now he was coming closer and closer to the edge of the Cliffs, but that could not have concerned him less. The important thing was to outthink the enemy, find his weakness, let him have his moment of exultation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, as the Cliffs came ever nearer, Inigo realized the fault in the attack that was flashing at him; a simple Thibault maneuver would destroy it entirely, but he didn’t want to give it away so soon. Let the other man have the triumph a moment longer; life allowed so few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cliffs were very close behind him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInigo continued to retreat; the man in black continued advancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Inigo countered with the Thibault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the man in black blocked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blocked it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInigo repeated the Thibault move and again it didn’t work. He switched to Capo Ferro, he tried Bonetti, he went to Fabris; in desperation he began a move used only twice, by Sainct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing worked!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black kept attacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Cliffs were almost there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInigo never panicked—never came close. But he decided some things very quickly, because there was no time for long consultations, and what he decided was that although the man in black was slow in reacting to moves behind trees, and not much good at all amidst boulders, when movement was restricted, yet out in the open, where there was space, he was a terror. A left-handed black-masked terror. “You are most excellent,” he said. His rear foot was at the cliff edge. He could retreat no more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-52.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
