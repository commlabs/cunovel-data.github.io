If you\u0027d like to come with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! I would! Just a minute!\" She crossed the room and got the little pink bag from atop a dresser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way out they went through another ward toward the rear of the hospital, and in passing the man spoke to the patients, calling their names, giving some encouragemcul, throwing a joking remark here and there. Arden couldn\u0027t help but see how the patients-even the very, very sick ones-perked up at this man\u0027s presence. She saw their faces, and she saw that not one of them flinched or showed any degree of distaste. It dawned on her that they didn\u0027t see his scars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArden followed him away from the house and along another fieldstone path that led toward a grove of pecan trees. \"I hear you had a time findin\u0027 us,\" the man said as they walked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did.\" She figured Dr. Felicien or somebody had gotten the whole story from either Dan or Train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good sign, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely,\" he said, and he smiled again. \"It\u0027s not far, right Avrletta\u0027s Island through here.\" He led her under a canopy of interlocking tree branches, and just on the other side was a small but immaculately kept white clapboard house with a screenedin front porch. Off to one side was a flower garden, and a Plot Of vegetables as well. Arden felt faint as the man walked up the front steps and opened the door to the screened porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have noticed her condition, because he said, \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine. Just a little light-headed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breathe deep a few times, that oughta help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did, standing at the threshold. And suddenly she realized who this fire-scarred man must be. \"What\u0027s ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat\u0027s your name?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pearly Reese.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had known it, but still it almost knocked her knees out from under her. She remembered the prostitute at the cafe in St. Nasty saying that the Bright Girl was an old wovnan who came to Port Fourchon to see my mama\u0027s cousin. His name was Pearly, he was seven years old when he got burned up in afire. Near thirty years ago, she\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bright Girl took him with her in a boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know meT\u0027 Pearly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes I do,\" she said. \"Your second cousin helped me get here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" He nodded, even if he didn\u0027t quite understand. I-I @ that must be a good sign, too. You ready to meet her.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" Arden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bfl!ght Girl (:)nce inside the door, Pearly called, \"Miz McKay7 I brought her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on back, then! I know I look a fright, but come on back anyway!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been the raspy voice of an old woman, yes. Dan had been right, Arden realized as the first hard punch of reality hit her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no such thing as a woman who could stay young forever. But even if Jupiter had been mistaken about that part of it, the Bright Girl could still have the healing touch in her hands. She was terrified as she followed Pearly through a sitting room, a short hallway, and then into a bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was the Bright Girl, propped up on peachcolored pillows in bed. Sunlight spined through lacecurtained windows across the golden pine-plank floor, anct above the bed a ceiling fan politely murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, \" Arden whispered, and as tears came to her eyes her hand flew up to cover her mouth so she wouldn\u0027t say something stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bright Girl was, indeed, an elderly woman. Maybe she was eighty-five, possibly older. If her hair had ever been blond, it was all snow now. Her face was heavily lined and age-spotted, but even so, Arden could tell that in her long-ago youth this woman had been lovely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing a white gown, and now she reached to a bedside tale for a pair of wire-rimmed eyeglasses. The movement was slow, and her mouth tightened with pain. The fingers of her hand were all twisted and malformed, and she had difficulty picking the glasses up. At once Pearly was at her side, but he didn\u0027t put the glasses on her face for her. He steadied her hand so her gnarled fingers could do the work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she got the glasses on, and Arden saw that behind the lenses there was still fire in the Bright Girl\u0027s pale amber eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike lamps, Arden thought. Like shining lamps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit.\" The Bright Girl lifted her other hand, the fingers just as twisted, and motioned toward a flower-print armchair that had been turned to face the bed. The elderly woman\u0027s voice trembled; either from palsy or being nervous, Arden didn\u0027t know. Arden sat down, her hands clutching the pink bag in her lap, her heart galloping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"lzmonade,\" the Bright Girl said. Her breathing, too, looked painful. \"Want a glass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... think I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can put a shot of vodka in it for you.\" The Bright Girl, surprisingly, had a midwestern accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh ... no. Just lemonade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pearly, would you? And I will take a shot of vodka in mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women were silent. The Bright Girl stared at Arden, but Arden wasn\u0027t sure where to park her eyes. She was so glad to have found this person, so glad to finally be there, but she was feeling a crush of disappointment, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bright Girl wasn\u0027t who Jupiter had said she was. The as ai Bright Girl could not cheat time, and she wasn\u0027t a f th healer. If she had a healing touch, then why hadn\u0027t she been able to smooth the scars on Pearly\u0027s face? Tears burned Arden\u0027s eyes again; they weir the bitter tears of knowing she had been wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bright Girl-at least the time-cheating, never-aging, faith-healing part of her-was a myth. The truth was that the Bright Girl was a rather small, frail, white-haired eighty-five-year-old woman who had gnarled fingers and labored breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT \"Don\u0027t cry,\" the Bright Girl said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all right. Really.\" Arden wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. \"I\u0027m-\" She stopped. The floodgates were about to burst. It had all been wrong. It had been a cruel, cruel trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead if you want to cry. I cried my eyes out, too, that first day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears had begun trickling down Arden\u0027s cheeks. She sniffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean ... you cried, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I came here and found out.\" She paused, her breathing stntined. \"Found out the Bright Girl couldn\u0027t just put her hands on me and take it all away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArden shook, her head. \"I\u0027m not ... I don\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake what away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman smiled slightly. \"The pain. The Bright Girl couldn\u0027t heal me of the pain. That I had to do for myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But ... you\u0027re the Bright Girl, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a Bright Girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ... are you a nun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, a nun? Unh-unh! I raised too much hell when I was a young girl to be a nun now! The thing is, I enjoyed raising hell. Seeing my father\"-again, she had to pause to regulate her breathing-\"squirm when the police brought me home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t get along so very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePearly came in, bringing a plain plastic tray with two jelly-jar glasses of lemonade. \"Take this one,\" he said, giving Arden a glass, \"unless you want your head lmocked off. Miz McKay @s the occasional libation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you would quit that! Over thirty damn years,\" she said, speaking to Arden, \"and he still calls me Miz McKay!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003d idmim .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I\u0027m some weak little old flower that j m the\"-a breath, a breath-\"slumps in the noonday sun!

We have to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI.There he goes with that southern-fried crap again! Go out and pee on the flowers or something!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePearly left the room. The Bright Girl gripped her glass with both hands, drew it to her wrinkled mouth, and sipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhhh,\" she said. \"That\u0027s better.\" She glanced up at the ceiling fan that turned above them. \"I never could get used to this heat down here. For a time I thought I couldn\u0027t stand it, that I was going to have to get back\"-a breath, then another-\"to Indiana. That\u0027s where I\u0027m from. Evansville, Indiana.

You didn\u0027t come here to\"breathing again, her lungs making a soft hitching noise\"listen to an old woman spit and snort, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Arden had to admit. \"I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to be healed, too. My \u0027condition,\u0027 as my father put it\"-she nodded toward a walker by the bed-\"used to be able to get around on a cane, but ... I can hardly stand up on the walker now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve had severe arthritis since I was a young girl. About your age, maybe younger. My father was from old money.

Doesn\u0027t know what she ought to be being paid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKathleen McKay drank from the glass once more, her gnarled fingers locked together. \"That woman of color ... was born in Thibodoux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s about fifty miles up Highway One from Grand Isle.

Some wicked deformity or another, I\u0027m sure. Are you positive you don\u0027t want a shot of vodka?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure,\" Arden said. Her heart had stopped pounding, but her nerves were still raw. \"How many ... how many Bright Girls have there been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cemetery\u0027s not far. You can go count for yourself. But I think the first two were buried at sea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArden still felt @ crying. She felt like having a cry that would break the heart of the world. Maybe she would, later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not right now. \"Who was the first one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The woman who founded the hospital.

There\u0027s a photograph of her over there. She was a beautiful young blond woman. But her eyes ... you can tell she had fire in her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArden sighed.
