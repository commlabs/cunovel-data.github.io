Now it was my turn. Sixty percent capacity wouldn’t cut it with her. Hell, one hundred percent may not even be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI worked the table while Echo settled onto a stool. “Zeus enjoyed affairs with nymphs on earth and his wife, Hera, didn’t quite approve of his extracurricular activities. So he sent Echo, a beautiful wood nymph, to distract and entertain Hera while he did a little entertaining of his own. Hera finally figured it out and punished Echo by taking her voice, cursing her to only repeat what others said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After this happened, Echo fell in love with a jerk who didn’t love her back. Echo wandered the woods, heartbroken, crying until there was nothing left to her but her voice, which still haunts the earth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of us were named after Bible personalities, others from a dart thrown at a baby book. Echo was named after a psychotic Greek myth. I sank two balls into the right pocket. “She didn’t like the names from normal fairy tales?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho laughed. “Those were my fairy tales. I grew up understanding the story behind every constellation. What Greek god was mad at whom. Love, lust, anger, revenge. I slept with the light on for a long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI missed my shot and swallowed the curse. Echo pranced to the table with a wicked grin on her lips. I craved nothing more than to kiss that pretty little smirk off her face. Instead, I yanked one of her silky red curls. Her laughter tickled my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your turn to answer a question,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shoot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you want to see your file?” She aimed for the eight ball and sank the shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one, except Keesha or Mrs. Collins, had asked me a question that personal in years. I placed two more quarters into the table. “Are you going to tell me why you want to see yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho arranged the balls again. “You already know most of it. You break this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling off balance, I leaned on the pool stick. “I have two younger brothers. Jacob’s eight and Tyler’s four. We were separated after my parents died. They’re in a shitty home. I want to prove it and hopefully win custody of them after I graduate. That file lists where they live. If I can catch these bastards hurting my brothers, then I can get them out, and make us a family again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke the balls with more strength than I’d intended. I couldn’t get the picture of Tyler’s bruised face out of my head. My brothers wouldn’t become victims like Beth or turn into hard-asses like me. The cue ball bounced several times after hitting the group of balls. “Solids. Your turn to answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mom hurt me and I don’t remember it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded detached, but I knew she wanted in her file as much as I wanted in mine. I’d told her my story, I wanted hers. “Tell me what you do know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho rolled the pool cue in her hand. “I don’t know you well enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow the hell would I get her to trust me? On some level, she did. But not like I wanted her to. My reputation with girls at school preceded me like cheerleaders in front of a marching band. Shit, what if she did trust me? What would I do with it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested my hip against the pool table. “What if we only have one shot at those files? I’m not telling you my personal shit because I’m into group therapy, I’m telling you because if you have the opportunity to get into the files, I need you to find my brothers’ foster parents’ information. Last name, address and phone number. If I get a crack at yours, what am I looking for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn if she didn’t turn into a vampire. Absolutely no blood remained in her gorgeous face. “Swear you won’t tell anyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could be worse than being called a cutter? “Whatever it is …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swear it,” she hissed. The tilt of her head, the way her eyes flashed a deep green and narrowed like a savage animal’s warned me that a joke may not be the smartest move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I swear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho left her pool stick against the wall and walked to the table. It appeared all games were over for the night. She picked up the cue ball. “My mom is bipolar. You know, manic depressive. There are two types of bipolar and my mom is number one. Not like one is the bottom, one as in Category 5 hurricane, 10.0 earthquake. She was misdiagnosed for years and then when I was six …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho rolled the cue ball onto the table, hitting multiple balls. “She had a major breakdown and got help. My mother was great when she stayed on her meds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrapped her arms around herself and stared down at the table. Her foot tapped against the floor. “I only know what little my dad and my friends told me. She came off her meds, went into a manic episode, I went to her apartment and she tried to kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was terrified to move, breathe, exist in this moment. On TV, teenagers were portrayed as happy, carefree. Echo and I would never know such a life. My parents died. I got screwed by a system supposedly in place to protect me. Echo … Echo was betrayed by the person who should have laid down her life to protect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her hand like a claw to her forehead. “Do you know what it’s like to not remember something? My mother loved me. She wouldn’t hurt me. Do you know what it’s like to have horrifying nightmares night after night? I go to bed one night, my life perfect, and then wake up in agony two days later in a hospital and my whole world is torn apart. I need to know. If I know, maybe I’ll feel whole again. Maybe …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho reminded me of the statue of a saint my mother had once placed in her flower garden. Arms outstretched, seeking an answer from a God that hated us both. “Maybe I’ll find normal again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me about Aires.” I grasped for any straw to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy pure miracle, my statement snapped her out of misery. She blinked, coming back to the beeping and ringing of the video arcade. “Aires loved cars. He salvaged this 1965 Corvette and spent years working on it. That’s why I’m tutoring you. I need to make money to finish fixing it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she wasn’t some nerd looking for extra credit or service hours. She wanted to honor her brother—her family. Echo and I were more alike than I’d thought. “What’s wrong with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up her pool cue and placed it back on the rack. “I have no idea. For all I know, it needs twenty dollars in gas and new spark plugs. Or it could need something huge and expensive. I got a mechanic to come and look at it today, but I have a feeling he’s going to take me to the cleaners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know a guy who’s a genius with cars. He’d love to be in the same zip code as a ‘65 Vette. Would you mind letting him have a crack at it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer siren smile appeared and her eyes lit up the room. “Yes. Totally. Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d probably lose some of that excitement once she met Isaiah. “Isaiah’s a little rough around the edges, but a good guy. I don’t want you to be shocked when someone like me shows up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer laughter sounded like music. “What, you don’t hang out with missionaries in your downtime? When the rest of us go home and slip into sweatpants and T-shirts, you kick back in a polo shirt and khakis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one but Isaiah and Beth teased me. People ran from me. Yet this little nymph thoroughly enjoyed this game. “Keep it up, Echo. I’m all about foreplay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed so loudly, she slapped a hand over her mouth, yet the giggles escaped. “You are so full of yourself. You think because girls swoon over you and let you into their pants on the first try that I’ll follow suit. Think again. Besides, I have your number now. Every time you try to look all dark and dangerous, I’ll picture you wearing a pink striped polo, collar up, and a pair of pleated chinos.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way. I stalked over to Echo, feeling like a tiger after its prey. She backed up against the wall, but I kept up my approach. I pressed against her, feeling each sensual curve. I wanted to touch every inch of her body. Her sweet smell intoxicated me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes kept their laughter, but her smile faded as she bit her lower lip. Damn, did she have any idea what she was doing? For a girl hell-bent on keeping me away, she sure did everything to turn me on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were saying?” I lowered my head and inhaled the warm cinnamon scent at the nape of her neck, allowing my nose to skim along her inviting skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chest rose and fell at a faster pace. My hand melted on the curve of her stomach, centimeters from her hip. I reeled with the decision of moving up or down, both areas I’d dreamed of touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noah,” she breathed out, unknowingly fulfilling one of my many fantasies involving Echo. If I played my cards right, maybe she’d fulfill a couple more. I barely brushed my lips down her cheek as I moved toward her mouth. Her nails tickled my chest, driving me insane. Kissing her became my single reason for breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands applied pressure to my chest and her lips moved against mine. “I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed me away. “I … I … can’t.” Any traces of humor were gone, her eyes wide. “I’m on a date with Luke and this—” she motioned with her hand between us “—cannot happen. You’re Noah Hutchins and I’m not the girl that does ‘it’ with … with …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes to regain some control over my body. I finished for her. “Me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes … no … I don’t know. I want normal, Noah. Can you give me normal?” Funny, she talked about normal as she tugged at the gloves on her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When are you going to figure out that doesn’t exist for people like us?” I wasn’t sure who I wanted to hurt more, myself or her. She could pretend, but she’d never return to the girl without scars. Hell, maybe I said it to remind me that a guy like me could never have Echo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whipped around, the same anger spewing from her that I’d seen that first day in Mrs. Collins’s office. “What should I do, Noah? Give up like you? Get stoned, skip school? Say fuck it to everything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a hell of a lot better than pretending to be someone I’m not. Why’s it so important to be with some guy who’d dump you to see a damn movie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho rubbed her face with both of her hands, her anger dying out. “Are you going to take me to the Valentine’s Dance? Am I going to be more than another girl in the backseat of your car or will I be a joke between you and your friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know. The truth stuck in my throat. I wanted to tell her that she’d be more, but I couldn’t. I didn’t do attachments and here was this amazing creature, asking me for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran a hand through her hair. “It’s fine. Don’t blow a blood vessel over it. I’m your tutor and you … you need help. We’ll work together to get into our files and you’ll live your life and I’ll live mine. I’ve gotta go. Thanks for the meal and the game.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEcho brushed past me, bringing me to life. “Wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over her shoulder. Dark circles hung under her eyes and her shoulders slumped forward. How come I’d never seen the exhaustion before? She talked about nightmares. When was the last time she’d slept? Not my concern—my silence confirmed that. When I said nothing, the best thing that happened to me in three years left. Damn, I was an idiot. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pushing-the-limits-pushing-the-limits-1/page-18.html","bookId":2752,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:34 PM"}
