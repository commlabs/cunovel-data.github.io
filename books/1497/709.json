The autumn wind blew past, lifting a couple of fallen leaves as it carried a chilly killing intent that caused one to involuntarily huddle one’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose Misty Cloud Sect’s Elders who were solemnly waiting all over the Misty Cloud Sect since some time ago slowly revealed the Dou Qi wings on their backs after hearing Yun Shan’s chilly cry. They moved their hands and sharp weapons that contained cold glints leaped out. Numerous piercing, glowing eyes shot at the human crowd in the sky which possessed a similarly strong lineup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan looked at Yun Shan’s face, which faintly carried a savage smile. The corner of his mouth had similarly slowly turned dark and dense. He glanced toward Yun Yun by the side of the wedding stage whose face had become anxious because of the fighting atmosphere before softly saying, “Yun Shan, you need not use such vicious words. Old dog, you have caused my father to be missing and destroyed my Xiao clan. The Misty Cloud Sect and I are already in a state where neither would rest until the other parishes. Today, either your Misty Cloud Sect is eliminated from the Jia Ma Empire or I, Xiao Yan, will die here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan was so furious at being repeatedly called an old dog by Xiao Yan that the corner of his mouth twitched. Yun Shan inhaled a deep breath of air a moment later in order to calm himself. He spoke in a sinister manner, “Little bastard, your father is not is my hands. Otherwise, I would have tortured him properly in order to extinguish the hatred in my heart!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not in your hands?” Xiao Yan immediately narrowed his eyes when he heard this. The fist under his sleeve tightened as he laughed, “Old dog, you have finally admitted that my father’s disappearance is related to your Misty Cloud Sect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glow in Xiao Yan’s eyes suddenly became stern after his laughter sounded before he looked at Yun Yun under the stage. It was the first time that he had opened his mouth to speak to her ever since he had appeared, “Do you now understand? Back then, did you not open your mouth to prove that the Misty Cloud Sect had nothing to do with the matter regarding my father?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun’s pretty face turned pale. She could clearly hear the anger and ridicule within Xiao Yan’s voice. Back then, she had sworn that he must have misunderstood the Misty Cloud Sect. However, the words that were spoken today from Yun Shan’s mouth were just like a slap that violently hit her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So… so you really did that?” Yun Yun’s face was filled with disbelief. Her red lips trembled as her mood began to fluctuate. Yun Yun’s gaze turned toward Yun Shan and eventually could not resist roaring out angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yun Yun! Remember that you are also a member of the Misty Cloud Sect! Now, you actually dare to shout at me because of a little bastard who thinks of eliminating our Misty Cloud Sect all day! Where have you thrown the many years of my teachings away?” Yun Shan softly roared out furiously. His face was filled with anger. Clearly, Yun Yun had caused him to lose all his face by publically roaring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun let out a grieved smile. Originally, she had always thought that it was because of Xiao Yan’s moment of anger back then that caused him to perform a reckless act that turned the Misty Cloud Sect into his enemy. However, from the looks of it now, the most naive person was actually herself…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Misty Cloud Sect caused Xiao Yan’s father to be missing; therefore, Xiao Yan would definitely feel extremely sad about such a situation. Yet, she had insisted on being partial to the Misty Cloud Sect back then. It was likely that his heart must have been completely disappointed with her back then…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Yun’s delicate hand under her sleeves gripped with all her might. A heart-wrenching pain appeared as her fingernails pierced into her palm. Now,she recalled the ice-cold eyes of the young man who was chased by the Misty Cloud Sect for a great distance, Yun Yun was able to understand that he should have gained an extreme hatred for her since the beginning…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough they were a great distance apart, Xiao Yan was able to see Yun Yun’s suddenly swaying and unsteady body. His eyebrows twitched and he immediately hardened his heart and turned his gaze away before coldly speaking to Yun Shan, “If my father isn’t at the Misty Cloud Sect, where is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is in a place that you will never know. Moreover, even if you do know, you won’t have the slightest ability to rescue him…” Yun Shan laughed in a dark, cold fashion. Since his words had already revealed everything, there was no longer any need for him to hide anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He should be in the hands of the ‘Hall of Souls’ right…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan’s eyes suddenly shrank when he heard the name that caused one’s hair to stand on end softly floating out of Xiao Yan’s mouth. His voice had also become more hoarse and denser than before, “You actually know about the ‘Hall of Souls’? Oh, that’s right, it should be the spiritual body within you that told you about them!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan’s words had similarly caused Xiao Yan’s expression to change slightly. He was actually aware of Yao Lao’s existence… it seemed that this old dog was collaborating with the ‘Hall of Souls’. Looks like today… he must be additionally careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will naturally settle the issue of my father. However, before this, I will need to finish off you, old dog…” Xiao Yan gradually calmed the fluctuation within his heart. A powerful Dou Qi gradually surged onto his palm as he slowly spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan smiled. However, a thread of cold darkness seeped from his smile. He waved his large hand and spoke with a dense smile, “This time, I will cause your Xiao clan to completely disappear from the Jia Ma Empire!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone from the Misty Cloud Sect, listen up! Kill!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tense spreading atmosphere was immediately broken after Yun Shan’s final word sounded. He looked at the flapping wings on the backs of the many Misty Cloud Sect’s Elders suspended in the air before they swished into the sky and faintly encircled Jia Xing Tian and the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t allow them to form their formation. Attack!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHai Bodong also let out a stern cry just as all the Elders from the Misty Cloud Sect moved. The icy wings on his back were flapped and powerful Dou Qi surged out explosively from his body. Having already consumed the ‘Spiritual Recovery Purple Pill’, his strength had gradually approached his peak within a short few days. Although he still possessed a gap compared to someone at the peak of the Dou Huang class, like Jia Xing Tian, he was not far from that. Hence, his powerful aura caused the faces of quite a number of people to change the moment it erupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHai Bodong was the first to rush out after his aura erupted. An icy-cold blade-like Dou Qi pillar spread apart and locked onto a strong old person among the many Elders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the saying goes, an action would affect the situation as a whole. Hai Bodong’s initiative to attack immediately caused a large scale commission. Behind him, Jia Xing Tian, Fa Ma, Old Yin Gu, Zi Yan, and the others instantly followed close behind. They unleashed their frightening Dou Qi one after another, spreading it throughout the sky of the Misty Cloud Mountain. The might that the Dou Qi created covered the entire mountain peak. Some of those weaker individuals felt short of breath just by being under this kind of pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kill!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elders of the Misty Cloud Sect refused to be outdone by the attacking momentum of Hai Bodong’s group. Their eyes revealed a fierce glow as they let out a stern cry. Under the many shocked gazes from below, they circulated the Dou Qi within their bodies to the extreme before violently charging forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two terrifying lineups instantly collided in the sky. Immediately, numerous thunder-like energy explosions and energy ripples resounded and surfaced in the sky…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was suspended alone in the air outside of the chaotic battle circle. Not a single Misty Cloud Sect’s Elder came over to strike at him. This was because they knew that they were prepared to leave this person to Yun Shan to personally settle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan’s gaze swept over the extremely intense fighting in the battleground before he turned his eyes toward the black-robed, young man in the sky who had folded his arms together. He let out a cold smile before striding forward. When he walked toward the edge of the wedding stage, he suddenly glanced at Yun Yun below before crying out coldly to a Misty Cloud Sect disciple at the side, “Look after her properly!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the Misty Cloud Sect’s disciples hurriedly responded respectfully after hearing Yun Shan’s order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will come and teach you a lesson after I finish off this little bastard!” Yun Shan coldly glanced at Yun Yun before he immediately turned his body. After which, he suspended himself in the air and gently stepped forward with his feet. It was as though he was slowly ascending a flight of stairs. However, the stairs in this case were agglomerated from invisible air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn elite Dou Zong could soar into the sky as though one was walking on flat land without relying on a pair of Dou Qi wings. This kind of battle without restraint naturally caused their agility and reaction time to increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan’s footsteps stepped on the empty air. A moment later, he was suspended at an area not far from Xiao Yan in front of the eyes of the many people in the open ground below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo dark, cold gazes, that were filled with killing intent, intertwined together as the two people faced off against each other. Sparks instantly shot out as the killing intent spread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little fellow, you have fled from this place three years ago. Today, this ancestor (refers to a Dou Zong) shall let your life end in this place!” A savage smile surfaced on Xiao Yan’s face as Yun Shan spoke in a sinister manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I coincidentally need a skeleton belonging to an elite Dou Zong. Although I really hate you old dog, I shall just improvise and use you.” Xiao Yan laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have not seen you for three years but your mouth is still this stubborn. Since that is the case, this ancestor shall personally see just how much you have improved during these three years.” Yun Shan smiled in a dark manner. He waved his sleeves and a majestic deep-green Dou Qi pillar erupted from the surface of his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green-colored Dou Qi that surged out of Yun Shan’s body was a color of extreme depth. At a glance, it seemed similar to the viscous like pressurized Glazed Lotus Core Flame from earlier. However, Xiao Yan had used all of his strength in order to pressurize and form a little of it earlier while this layer on the surface of Yun Shan’s body was of an extremely deep color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to Yun Shan’s deep-green colored viscous Dou Qi being too powerful, it resulted in the surrounding space around Xiao Yan to fluctuate repeatedly. Seeing this scene, a solemness also surged up Xiao Yan’s face as he quietly spoke within his heart: an elite Dou Zong was indeed frightening…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYun Shan laughed out in a ferocious manner. He slowly lifted his hand horizontally and pointed it toward Xiao Yan from a distant. Energy was extended and formed on the surface, appearing much like an energy cannonball that was about to be spat out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s hand also slowly began to form a couple of seals as he sensed the increasingly powerful force within Yun Shan’s body. He immediately let out a deep cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Skyfire Three Mysterious Change: Glazed Change!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dou Qi within Xiao Yan’s body suddenly became violent after his cry sounded. Along with it, his aura had suddenly soared at this instant. A moment later, he was basically able to contend with a genuine elite Dou Huang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Secret Technique to raise one’s strength huh?” Yun Shan might have felt a little surprised when he saw the sudden soaring of Xiao Yan’s aura but he immediately let out a savage smile. The deep-green energy within his palm had become much denser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This ancestor (refers to a Dou Zong) shall use my strength to tell you that any fake things will be annihilated in front of the strength of a Dou Zong!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Today, regardless of how many tactics you have, this ancestor (Dou Zong) shall let you regret returning once again!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-708\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-710\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-709","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM"}
