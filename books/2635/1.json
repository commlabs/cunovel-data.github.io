He gained a triple first at Oxford and was a Fellow and Tutor at Magdalen College 1925-54. In 1954 he became Professor of Mediaeval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge. He was an outstanding and popular lecturer and had a lasting influence on his pupils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC. S. Lewis was for many years an atheist, and described his conversion in Surprised by Joy: \u0027In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God ... perhaps the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.\u0027 It was this experience that helped him to understand not only apathy but active unwillingness to accept religion, and, as a Christian writer, gifted with an exceptionally brilliant and logical mind and a lucid, lively style, he was without peer. The Problem of Pain, The Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity, The Four Loves and the posthumous Prayer: Letters to Malcolm, are only a few of his best-selling works. He also wrote some delightful books for children and some science fiction, besides many works of literary criticism. His works are known to millions of people all over the world in translation. He died on 22nd November, 1963, at his home in Oxford. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mere-christianity/page-1.html","bookId":2635,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:21 PM"}
