Aubrey and the mystery cat jerked their heads up, surprised at my sudden movement. On the other side of the living room, the little girl sat on the floor beside an end table with sharp corners, a small hand pressed to her forehead. Tears streamed down her checks as she wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash, my dream-self was on her knees and had wrapped the little girl up in a tight embrace. I could feel what the other Georgina felt, and I nearly wept as well over the feel of that soft, warm body in my arms. My dream-self rocked the girl, murmuring soothing, nonsensical words as she brushed her lips against the silken hair. Eventually, the girl\u0027s sobs stopped, and she rested her head against my dream-self\u0027s chest, content to simply be loved and rocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes and stared at Seth\u0027s plain white ceiling. He lay beside me, curled up near my body and still smelling like the massage oil. Even awake, the dream\u0027s images were still strong and so real. I knew exactly how my daughter\u0027s hair had felt, the way she smelled, the rhythm of her heart. My own heart pined so much for her that I could almost ignore the fact that last night\u0027s energy was now gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was turning into a real problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, gently pushing Seth off of me. But as I tried to figure out what to do about this latest dream, a strange thought kept pressing into the back of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik. I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about Erik. It was nothing in particular, either. No specific problem. But, whenever I tried to think about something else - my job, the energy loss, Seth - it was Erik\u0027s face that appeared in my head. I didn\u0027t understand it, but it worried me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth\u0027s arms reached for me as I slipped out of bed, but I skillfully avoided them. Grabbing my cell phone out of my purse, I headed off toward the living room. No one answered when I dialed Arcana, Ltd. It was almost ten...usually he was open by then. I called information in search of Erik\u0027s home number, but it appeared to be unlisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sense of dread was building in me. Desperate, I dialed Dante\u0027s store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dante, I think something\u0027s happened to Erik, but I don\u0027t have his home number and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, whoa, succubus. Slow down. Start from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBacking up, I explained how I\u0027d dreamed again and woken up obsessed with Erik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s nothing, but after the drowning thing...I don\u0027t know. Do you have his home number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Dante said after several moments. \"I do. I\u0027ll...I\u0027ll check on him for you and give you a call back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Dante. I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI disconnected as a sleepy Seth stepped out of the bedroom. \"Who\u0027s Dante? Was that a collect call to the Inferno?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t accept the charges,\" I murmured, still troubled. Seth\u0027s face turned serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, not because I was afraid to tell him about Dante but because I didn\u0027t know if I wanted him caught up in all of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It involves immortal intrigue,\" I warned. \"And the higher workings of the universe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I live for those things,\" he said wryly, settling into an armchair. \"Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I did. He knew about my first energy loss but not the rest. I didn\u0027t tell him about the content of the dreams, merely that they drained me of energy. I also explained about the self-fulfilling prophecies and how I\u0027d woken up damp one morning and thinking about Erik today. When I finished, I stared at the cell phone accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it. Why isn\u0027t he calling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you always tell me this at the last minute?\" asked Seth. \"It\u0027s been giving you trouble for a while. I thought it had been a one-time thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want to bother you. And I know how funny you are about immortal stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things that affect you - that may be harming you - don\u0027t bother me. I mean, well, they do, but that\u0027s not the point. This all goes back to commun - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dante?\" I asked eagerly. I hadn\u0027t even bothered to check the number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was him. His voice sounded grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to come over here. To Erik\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The store?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, his house. It\u0027s close to my place here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just come over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante rattled off an address and directions. With quick shape-shifting, I was dressed and ready to bolt out the door in an instant. Seth told me to wait, and in less than a minute - not as good as me, though still good - he was ready too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never thought much about Erik having a home of his own. To me, he just always sort of existed in his store. The address was about a mile from Dante\u0027s, in an old, yet well-maintained neighborhood. Erik\u0027s house was one of the small bungalow types so common in Seattle neighborhoods, and the front yard was filled with roses gone dormant for the winter. As we walked up the steps, I entertained a brief vision of Erik out there tending the flowers in the summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante opened the door before I could knock. I wondered if he\u0027d sensed me or had simply seen us through the window. He displayed no particular reaction to Seth\u0027s presence and ushered us in toward the house\u0027s one bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house\u0027s interior looked like it hadn\u0027t been updated in a while. In fact, a lot of the furniture reminded me of mid-twentieth-century styles. A plaid sofa with rough fabric. A worn velvet armchair in seventies gold. A TV that dubiously looked capable of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of that triggered any sort of reaction in me, though. What startled me was one framed picture sitting on a bookshelf. It showed a much younger Erik - maybe in his forties - with fewer wrinkles in his dark skin and no gray in his black hair. He had his arm around a thirty-something brunette with big gray eyes and a smile as large as his. Dante nudged me when I stopped, an odd look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik lay in bed. To my relief, he was alive. I didn\u0027t realize until that moment just how worried I\u0027d been. My subconscious had feared the worst, even though I\u0027d refused to let it surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut alive or not, he really didn\u0027t look so great. He was sweating and shaking, eyes wide and face pallid. His breathing was shallow. When he saw me, he flinched, and for half a second, I saw terror in his eyes. Then, the fear faded, and he attempted a weak smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Kincaid. Forgive me for not being able to receive you properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" I gasped, sitting on the bed\u0027s edge. \"What happened? Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied him, trying to piece together what had taken place. \"Were you attacked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze flicked over to Dante. Dante shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a manner of speaking,\" Erik said at last. \"But not in the way you\u0027re thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante leaned against the wall, appearing a little less grave than he had earlier. \"Don\u0027t waste her time with riddles, old man. Spill it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik\u0027s eyes narrowed, a bit of fire flaring in their depths. Then, he turned back to me. \"I was attacked...mentally, not physically. A woman came to me tonight...wraithlike, inhuman...wreathed in energy. The kind of beauteous, enthralling energy I see you glow with sometimes.\" It was a sweet way to describe my post-sex glamour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she bat-winged and flame-eyed?\" I asked, recalling Dante\u0027s long-ago joke about the mythological description of succubi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a succubus, I\u0027m afraid. That might be easier. No, this...I believe...was Nyx.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did...did you say Nyx?\" Of course that was what he\u0027d said, but I\u0027d been waiting for him to launch into a discussion of Oneroi, not their mother. Nyx made no sense. It was one thing for dream spirits to appear in your bedroom and in your dreams. It was an entirely different matter for a monstrous primordial entity of chaos who had been instrumental in creating the world as we know it to appear in your bedroom. It was like saying God had stopped by for waffles on the way to work. Maybe Erik was still delirious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nyx,\" he confirmed, no doubt guessing my thoughts. \"Chaos herself. Or, more accurately, Night herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the corner, Dante laughed softly. \"We\u0027re all fucked now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s the mother of the Oneroi,\" Erik reminded me. \"And, although dreams aren\u0027t her sole domain, she too is connected to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then...\" I tried to grasp the implications. \"Are you saying she\u0027s been responsible for what\u0027s been happening to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It almost makes sense,\" said Dante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik apparently agreed. \"She\u0027s linked to time and all the myriad potential fates that exist for the universe. Fate and time are forever moving closer to chaos - to entropy - and that\u0027s what she feeds off of. She\u0027s trying to create more of it in the world, to bring us that much nearer to ultimate disintegration. But she\u0027s a long way from bringing anything like that about, so she settles for small acts of chaos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t following. \"My dreams and energy loss are acts of chaos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Erik glanced at Dante again. \"We believe you\u0027re her instrument. Since she\u0027s connected to time as well as space, she has the ability to see pieces of the future. And there is no greater way to cause chaos in this world than by revealing the future to mortals. Such visions prove consuming, and if crafted in a certain way, they can drive a person to madness. That person will obsess on it, struggling to either stop it or bring it about in a way it\u0027s not actually meant to unfold. Both acts are futile. The future plays out as it is meant to. In trying to alter it, we only make it happen that much more quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like the Oedipus story,\" noted Seth. \"His father\u0027s attempts to change the prophecy\u0027s outcome are what actually made it happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded. \"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood now too. \"Just like the cop who saw his partner getting shot. And the man who saw his family benefiting by him swimming the Sound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s how Nyx operates. Everything she shows them is true...just not true in the way they expect. The ensuing madness and destruction brought about by showing mortals their futures - futures that they end up bringing about - feeds her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where do I fit in?\" I demanded. \"She isn\u0027t showing me my future or making me do crazy things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where the theory ends, succubus,\" Dante said. \"You\u0027re part of it, absolutely. And she needs you to do all this...but we don\u0027t know the mechanics of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is insane,\" I said blankly. \"I\u0027m the instrument of an all-powerful primordial deity\u0027s wave of chaos and destruction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s kind of extreme,\" said Dante jovially. \"It\u0027s not like you work for Google or anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth gently touched my shoulder. \"Can I ask a question here? I\u0027m confused by...like, how is it possible that you\u0027re just now realizing that this...Nyx...is out there? I mean, if she\u0027s as powerful as you claim...I don\u0027t know. Why didn\u0027t you think of her right away? Why hasn\u0027t this happened before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she\u0027s locked up,\" I said. \"Or well, she\u0027s supposed to be. Heaven and Hell have their own agendas for the world; they don\u0027t want her running loose and messing it all up. If this is her, I have no idea how she got loose. She\u0027s supposed to be guarded by angels, and if there was ever a group that could - \" I let out a gasp that turned into a groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others stared at me. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" asked Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why they\u0027re here,\" I said. \"I\u0027m such an idiot. There\u0027s a monstrous regiment of angels in town. I knew they were looking for something, but I didn\u0027t know what.\" That would also explain Vincent\u0027s interest in local news - he was looking for Nyx-patterns that would provide them with a trail. He\u0027d even started to pursue my knowledge of the cop story, but Seth\u0027s shooting and his outing as a nephilim had distracted us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, they\u0027re doing a bang-up job,\" said Dante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose from Erik\u0027s bedside. \"I have to tell them what we know. Maybe they\u0027ll understand what she\u0027s doing to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful,\" Erik warned. \"She\u0027s suspicious now...I think that\u0027s why she came after me. I was looking into this, and she didn\u0027t want me to succeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething else suddenly occurred to me. \"Erik...did she show you a vision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was it?\" It must have been horrible, whatever it was. He\u0027d clearly been in shock when Dante had found him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik looked at me, and for an instant, I saw a flash of the terror he\u0027d shown when I first walked into the room. Then, it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter, Miss Kincaid. She wanted to scare me, to stop me from helping you...but it didn\u0027t work. The future will unfold as it\u0027s meant to.\" Seeing my doubtful look, he smiled again and pointed toward the door. \"Stop worrying about me. I will be fine. Go find your angel friends before anything worse happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a quick hug before stepping into the other room with Seth and Dante. Once again, I paused to study the picture of Erik and the woman. Just as I\u0027d always imagined Erik living in his store, I\u0027d also never pictured him having any sort of personal life. Obviously, that was a foolish thought on my part. Who was this woman? Wife? Lover? Just a friend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside me, Dante held out his hand to Seth and introduced himself. The two men sized each other up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard so much about you,\" said Dante cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never heard of you until this morning,\" remarked Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes were still on the picture. Near the edge of the frame, I noticed a crease in the photograph. I don\u0027t know what made me do it, but I picked the frame up and pulled the picture out. The right-hand third of the photo had been folded, obscuring another person who had been with Erik and the woman. Dante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up in surprise. Dante took the picture and frame from me and reassembled them. \"There\u0027s no time for this, succubus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have more important things to deal with than your own curiosity right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cast an uneasy look at Erik\u0027s closed bedroom door. Dante was right. \"Do you think you could maybe...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante sighed, anticipating my question. \"Yes, succubus. I\u0027ll check in on him today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I thought I saw something in his face...something that wasn\u0027t just him grudgingly humoring me. Like that maybe - maybe - he cared about Erik too. It was weird, but then, they\u0027d all looked pretty happy in the photograph. The worst enemies were often those who had been friends. This Erik-Dante puzzle just got weirder and weirder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to turn away, then Dante called, \"Oh, hey. I can probably make your charm, now that we know what this is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope surged up in me at the thought of finally having safe dreams again. \"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you still want me to,\" he added warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI presumed he was subtly referencing my skepticism - which hadn\u0027t entirely abated. Still, now that I had a name for my predator, I was more anxious than ever to take whatever protection I could get. \"Definitely. If you think it\u0027ll work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In theory, at least. Nyx isn\u0027t exactly a run-of-the-mill spirit. I\u0027ll see what I can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove Seth back to his condo, anxious to let him off, so I could do some searching. \"I have to go find the angels,\" I told him. \"I\u0027ll catch up to you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...no movie tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - what? Oh, damn it.\" I\u0027d forgotten about the plans we\u0027d made. He\u0027d gotten tickets for an indie movie that was showing one night only here. \"I\u0027m sorry...I really am...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Seth wryly, \"considering life and death are literally on the line, I think I can forgive it this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what you should do? You should take Maddie. You still owe her a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I have the best girlfriend in the world, always trying to push me into the arms of another woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious! She\u0027s feeling unwanted. She thinks you don\u0027t like her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like her a lot. The whole thing is just weird, that\u0027s all. I think I\u0027m going to see if Terry can go to the movie. Don\u0027t give me that look,\" he warned. \"I\u0027ll still take her somewhere. Just not to this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kissed good-bye, and Seth promised to check on me later. Once he was gone, I set out to find my guardian angels. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3/page-18.html","bookId":2056,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:56:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:56:54 PM"}
