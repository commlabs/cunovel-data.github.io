There was a reason I wasn\u0027t supposed to kill them unless I saw them change, a reason I\u0027d forgotten. Mistakes could be made, even by the most dedicated agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I killed an innocent human being, that would make me no better than the animals I hunted. I hated them, but right now I hated myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" Damien lowered his hand to my shoulder, gave it a reassuring squeeze. Why he was being so nice to me I had no idea. I certainly didn\u0027t deserve it - even without the gun in my pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You went white. Are you sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The light\u0027s just too bright. Hurts my eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll change the bulb for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released me and stepped back so I could enter the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much to it.\" He swept out an arm. \"Bed, television, bath through there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, taking in the tiny sink, refrigerator, and coffeepot that made up the kitchen. Good thing I didn\u0027t cook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll just get that low-watt bulb.\" He moved toward the door. \"It\u0027s downstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Damien?\" He paused in the doorway. \"I appreciate your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, though the expression didn\u0027t reach his eyes. Now that I thought of it, his smile was rare and always a little bit sad - as if he had memories he couldn\u0027t quite shake. Like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. The new kids in town have to stick together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened. \"You\u0027re new?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just moved in about three few weeks ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the dead wolves had started to appear. Coincidence? My eyes fell to the ring on his right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you owned this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only work here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The owner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lives in Tucson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted his head and his hair swung free. My fingers itched to tuck it behind his ear. Why did I always have to tidy everything? The man, his hair, the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like Crow Valley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t been in town long enough to decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not so bad. I\u0027ve seen worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You travel a lot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes had gone dark and haunted again. I wanted to ask what enough was, but the way he held himself, as if he was waiting for a blow or warding off a memory, made me stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get that bulb,\" he said, and practically ran from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI seemed to have that effect on men since I changed occupations. Once I\u0027d been popular, pretty, the annoy-ingly pert cheerleader type. Hell, I\u0027d been a cheerleader, in both high school and college. I\u0027d dated the quarterback, planned on marrying him, too. Until he\u0027d gotten his throat ripped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a whole lot of things had changed. I\u0027d started killing for a living, and men avoided me like a lifetime commitment. Sometimes I wondered if what I did clung to me like a bad odor, or a permanent blot on my creamy white skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly I didn\u0027t care. I didn\u0027t want sex any more than I wanted friendship. A relationship? Ha. I had better things to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why was I thinking of how delectable Damien Fitzgerald had looked barefoot and bare chested beneath the silver light of the moon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I\u0027d lost what was left of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he wasn\u0027t a werewolf, but that didn\u0027t make him fair game. Any connection with me could get him killed - badly. It had happened before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite his taut pecs and bulging biceps, he was out of his league in my world. He\u0027d be meat to them, and I couldn\u0027t let that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I heard his steps on the stairs, I went out and took the bulb from his fingers. \"Thanks. I\u0027ll take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sharp dismissal in my voice caused a flicker of hurt to cross his face, before he squashed it and let the stoic mask drop. With a nod, he returned to the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to force myself not to call him back, not to follow him and apologize. He\u0027d been nothing but kind to me and I\u0027d blown him off. Even though it was for his own good, I still felt like a shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI changed the bulb, for appearances\u0027 sake, then glanced at my watch. Midnight.\u0026nbsp; The bar beneath my feet was starting to rock. No one would notice me slipping away. No one would care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after what had happened tonight, I was nervous. Had I lost my touch? My edge? Maybe I should take some time off, as Will had suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, I felt naked without all my guns, so I hurried to my car, retrieved every one that I had, as well as my travel bag, then hustled up to my apartment. As I reached the landing, the distant, eerie cry of a wolf split the night. I slammed the door and locked it behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I locking them out or myself in? I wasn\u0027t sure, and that worried me. I\u0027d spent a little time on the other side of sane, and I didn\u0027t want to return. I stowed my rifle, my bag, then sat down and had a good long talk with myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had almost screwed up. It happened. However, if I got sidetracked, if I got spooked, they would win and a whole lot of innocent people would lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d take tonight off. Get some sleep. Go back to work tomorrow with a clear head and a clearer plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat decided, I checked the locks, the windows, my ammo. I should have checked my dreams - at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t mean to fall asleep before the sun came up. I planned to do some Internet research, make a few calls, catch up on my paperwork. But the traveling, the stress, the steady beat of the music from the bar downstairs must have combined to lull me from my intentions. Once asleep, I went where I hadn\u0027t been in quite a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNightmares were nothing new to me. I lived with them even in the daytime. But I usually hunted the darkness away, slept in the light. I\u0027d found that this kept the bloody trips down memory lane to a minimum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this dream, I was twenty-two again. Fresh out of school with a brand-new job teaching ABCs. I loved everything about kids - their innocence, their interest, their trusting cherubic faces. I loved them and I wanted some of my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was where Jimmy Renquist came in. We\u0027d met as juniors at Northern Kansas University. I\u0027d been leading the cheer \"Go, fight, win. Yay,\" when Jimmy had been thrown out-of-bounds by a Neanderthal defensive lineman from Fresno. He\u0027d landed on top of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry,\" he kept repeating as he helped me up and brushed me off. \"Are you all right? I didn\u0027t hurt you, did I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Renquist, get your ass back in the game!\" the coach shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d shrugged, winked, and smiled at me. I was lost from that moment on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy was sweet, strong, smart. He loved kids, too. He planned to become a phys ed teacher. He would have if he hadn\u0027t fallen in love with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in the dream my mind shied at the memory of what I\u0027d done to bring the horror down upon us. In the way of nightmares, the scene shifted to Sunday dinner at my parents\u0027 house. Telling them the wedding date, showing Mom the ring, having her weep with joy and hug me tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last sight of Jimmy - whole - had been of him smiling that smile I loved as he shook hands with my dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy little sister - Mom and Dad\u0027s midlife oops - was five years old. My seventeen-year-old brother was home, too. Everyone was grinning when the first wolf crashed through the picture window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy shoved my dad aside, threw himself in front of me. The wolf, a huge white male, hit him in the chest and tore out his throat in a single, practiced motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of us might have been OK if we\u0027d run immediately - blockaded a door, found a gun, maybe some silver bullets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho am I kidding? We were goners from the moment the window shattered, if not before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s hard to move when something like that happens in your dining room. Normal people don\u0027t react well to sudden death, and we were so normal it was pitiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood there watching as the great white wolf ate Jimmy. We stood there in shock as the room filled with others. Later I understood that the pack had behaved with true pack mentality. Cull the herd, survival of the fittest, only the good die young. My sister went next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nightmare continued as I watched my family die one by one. I was too shocked to wonder why I was left for last. Too horrified and sick to notice that the wolves didn\u0027t look exactly like wolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the white wolf, fur pink with blood, turned to me. The others parted, let him come. I stared into his eyes, and I knew who he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-6.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
