Until then I hadn’t realized he’d moved, but he was on the other side of Daemon. “But if you want to put him out of commission for the next week after that comment, I’ll help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gee, thanks, brother.” Andrew scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTense silence followed, and then Daemon’s light faded and he settled back into his human form. He glanced down to where my hand curved around his wrist, and then his gaze flicked up, meeting mine. Charged air passed from his skin to mine, shocking me with a crack. I let go of his wrist and stilled under his intense stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the kind of display we cannot afford.” Mr. Garrison drew in a deep breath. “I think that’s enough for this evening. Both of you need to cool down and keep in mind that they are here. We need to be careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left after that, including Dee. She wanted to spend time with Adam and also make sure he didn’t end up mauling Andrew, which left Daemon and me alone. I should’ve left, but after Andrew’s thoughtless comment, I needed to know that Daemon was okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him into the kitchen. “I’m sorry about what Andrew said. That was wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s jaw worked as he grabbed two cans of Coke, handing me one. “It is what it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still not right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes searched my face in a way that made me feel exposed to the core. “Are you worried about the DOD being here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. “Yeah, I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Harder said than done.” I played with the tab on the can. “It’s not me I’m worried about. They think you’re responsible for what happened—the crazy energy thing. What if they think you’re…a danger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon didn’t answer for several moments. “It’s not just me, Kitten. Even if I had done that, it’s never been about me. It’s about all the Luxen.” He paused, lowering his gaze. “You know what Matthew believes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cynical grin pulled at his full lips. “He believes that one day, probably not in our generation, but some day, my kind and the Arum will nearly outnumber yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? That’s kind of…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Scary?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tucked my hair back. “I don’t know if it’s scary. I mean, the Arum thing is, but your kind—the Luxen—freaky powers aside…you’re not very different from us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the fact we’re made of light?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled a little then. “Well, besides that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It got me thinking,” he said, “that if some of our kind believes this, how come the DOD isn’t worried?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a good point. And I was trying not to let my fear for him take over, but my brain was throwing out all kinds of wild scenarios. All of them ended with him being taken in by the DOD. “What happens if they think you are a threat? And don’t beat around the bush about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I was at the compound before, there were Luxen who didn’t assimilate.” The muscle in his jaw started ticking. “Mostly they didn’t want to be kept under the thumb of the DOD. Others I guessed were viewed as a threat because they asked too many questions. Who really knows?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth felt dry. “What happened to them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral moments passed before Daemon answered. Each second that went by, the unease in my stomach grew. Finally, he nodded. “They killed them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorror rolled through me. The extreme emotion triggered the static that rushed over my skin so fast I couldn’t stop it. The burst of energy smacked around the room. I dropped the unopened can of soda as wood scrapped over tile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chair flew out from under the table, slamming into my knee with such force that my leg collapsed under me. I yelped in pain and buckled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon strung together a truckload of f-bombs and appeared next to me, grabbing me a second before I hit the floor. “Whoa, there, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing the hair out of my face, I lifted my head. “Holy crap…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped me stand up, easing a shoulder under my arm for support and pulling me close. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m peachy.” I wiggled out of his embrace and tentatively placed my weight on my leg. Wet warmth trickled down my leg. I rolled up my jeans, finding blood. “Great, I’m a natural disaster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I might have to agree with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a dark look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a cocky grin, he winked. “Come on, get up on the table and let me look at that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t argue with me about it. One second I was standing—er, hobbling—and then air rushed me and I was sitting on the table. My mouth dropped open. “What…how did you do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Skill,” he said, placing my foot on the chair. His fingertips brushed against my skin as he rolled my pants above my knee. Electricity danced along my leg, and I jerked. “Wow, you really are a disaster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh, it’s bleeding all over the place.” I swallowed at the sight. “You’re not going to heal me, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, no, because who knows what would happen then? You might turn into an alien.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha. Ha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon quickly grabbed a clean towel and dampened it. He came back, not quite meeting my eyes. I reached for the cloth, but he knelt and started to gently blot at the blood. He was careful not to touch my skin this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What am I going to do with you, Kitten?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See? I didn’t even want to move the chair and it flew at me like a heat-seeking missile.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon shook his head as he continued to dap at the blood. “When we were younger, things like this would happen all the time, before we could control the Source.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Source?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “The energy in us—we call it the Source, because it links us back to our home planet, you know? Like the source of it all. At least, that’s what our elders say. Anyway, when we were kids and learning how to control our abilities, it was crazy. Dawson had this habit of moving furniture, like you. He’d go to sit down and the chair would fly out from under him.” He laughed. “But he was young.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. So I’m operating at the level of a toddler?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s lustrous eyes met mine. “Basically.” The dark graphic shirt strained against his chest when he laid the bloodied towel aside and leaned back. “Look, it’s stopped bleeding already. Not that bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down and saw the fresh gash on my knee. Other than looking gross, it was salvageable. “Thank you for cleaning it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem. I don’t think you’ll need stitches.” He lightly brushed his fingertips around the cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked at the contact. Little tingles shimmed up my leg. Daemon’s hand stilled as he lifted his head. His eyes went from a cool green to liquid fire within seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you thinking about?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding into his arms, kissing him and touching him—things I shouldn’t think about. I blinked. “Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon rose slowly, holding my gaze. My whole body tensed as he neared and placed his hands on either side of me. Then he bent over the chair between us, resting his forehead against mine. He inhaled deeply and it came out in an unsteady rush. When he spoke, his voice was rough. “Do you know what I’ve been thinking about all day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith him, it was anyone’s guess. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips brushed the skin of my cheek. “Finding out if you look as good in striped socks as you do in reindeer ones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head slanted and his smile was lazy, arrogant. Predatory. “I knew it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn’t let this happen. There was a whole slew of complications: his attitude, the connection between us, and my new kindergarten-age abilities. Funny, the fact Daemon was an alien was the complication I considered the least important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was Blake. That is, if Blake ever spoke to me again, which was debatable. But due to Daemon’s interruption at dinner, I didn’t get to talk to Blake. Irony was a bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing all of that, I still didn’t pull away. And neither did he. Oh no, he was moving closer. His pupils started to glow and his breath seemed to have stalled in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have any idea what you do to me?” he asked gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not doing anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon shifted his head just enough that our lips brushed once…and then twice before he increased the pressure. This kiss…it was nothing like the other times, which seemed to be angry and challenging. As if we’d kissed to punish each other. But this was gentle and soft, feather light. Infinitely tender. Like the kiss we’d shared in the clearing the night he’d healed me. Light swept through me as we kissed, but soon the kisses, they weren’t enough. Not when a slow fire was burning under my skin—and under his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCupping my cheeks, he exhaled a soft groan, and his lips scorched mine as he deepened the kiss until we both were breathless from its intensity. Daemon moved as close as he could with the chair between us. Gripping his arms, I held onto him, wanting him closer. The chair prevented all but our lips and hands from touching. Frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMove, I ordered restlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt trembled under my foot, and then the heavy oak chair slid out from under me, dodging our leaning bodies. Unprepared for the sudden void, Daemon lurched forward, and I was unable to carry the unexpected weight. I collapsed backward, bringing Daemon along with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe full contact of his body, flush against mine, sent my senses into chaotic overdrive. His tongue swept over mine as his fingers splayed across my cheeks. His hand slid down my side, gripping my hip as he urged me closer. The kisses slowed and his chest rose as he drank me in. With one last lingering exploration, he lifted his head and smiled down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart skipped a beat as he hovered over me with an expression that tugged deep in my chest. He moved his fingers back up, along my cheek, trailing an invisible path to my chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t move that chair, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m assuming you didn’t like where it was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was in your way,” I said. My hands were still curled around his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see that.” Daemon smoothed a fingertip over the curve of my bottom lip before taking my hand, pulling me up. Letting go, he watched me carefully and waited. Waited for…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened slowly sank in beyond the fog in my brain. I’d just kissed him. Again. And right after he’d taken over my date with another guy—the guy I should be kissing. Or not. I didn’t know anything anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t keep doing this.” My voice shook. “We—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We like each other,” he said, stepping forward, grasping the edges of the table on either side of me. “And before you say it, we were attracted to each other before I healed you. You can’t say that’s not true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned in, his nose brushing my cheek. A shudder rolled through me. His lips pressed against the spot under my ear. “We need to stop fighting what we both want.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-19.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
