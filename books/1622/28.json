She had heard it said that if you could look far enough into the direction that Great A\u0027Tuin was staring, you would see the end of the universe. Maybe it was just the set of its beak, but Great A\u0027Tuin looked vaguely hopeful, even optimistic. Perhaps the end of everything wasn\u0027t as bad as all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreamlike, she reached out and tried to Borrow the biggest mind in the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped herself just in time, like a child with a toy toboggan who expected a little gentle slope and suddenly looks out of the magnificent mountains, snow-covered, stretching into the icefields of infinity. No one would ever Borrow that mind, it would be like trying to drink all the sea. The thoughts that moved through it were as big and as slow as glaciers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the Disc were the stars, and there was something wrong with them. They were swirling like snowflakes. Every now and again they would settle down and look as immobile as they always did, and then they\u0027d suddenly take it into their heads to dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReal stars shouldn\u0027t do that, Esk decided. Which meant she wasn\u0027t looking at real stars. Which meant she wasn\u0027t exactly in a real place. But a chittering close at hand reminded her that she could almost certainly really die if she once lost track of those noises. She turned and pursued the sounds through the stellar snowstorm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the stars jumped, and settled, jumped, and settled ....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she swooped upward Esk tried to concentrate on everyday things, because if she let her mind dwell on precisely what it was she was following then she knew she would turn back, and she wasn\u0027t sure she knew the way. She tried to remember the eighteen herbs that cured ear-ache, which kept her occupied for a while because she could never recall the last four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA star swooped past, and then was violently jerked away; it was about twenty feet across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she ran out of herbs she started on the diseases of goats, which took quite a long time because goats can catch a lot of things that cows can catch plus a lot of things plus that sheep plus catch plus a complete range of horrible ailments of their very own. When she had finished listing wooden udder, ear wilt and the octarine garget she tried to recall the complex code of dots and lines that they used to cut in the trees around Bad Ass, so that lost villagers could find their way home on snowy nights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was only as far as dot dot dot dash dot dash (Hub-byTurnwise, one mile from the village) when the universe around her vanished with a faint pop. She fell forward, hit something hard and gritty and rolled to a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grittiness was sand. Fine, dry, cold sand. You could tell that even if you dug down several feet it would be just as cold and just as dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk lay with her face in it for a moment, summoning the courage to look up. She could just see, a few feet away from her, the hem of someone\u0027s dress: Something\u0027s dress, she corrected herself. Unless it was a wing. It could be a wing, a particularly tatty and leathery one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes followed it up until she found a face, higher than a house, outlined against the starry sky. Its owner was obviously trying to look nightmarish, but had tried too hard. The basic appearance was that of a chicken that had been dead for about two months, but the unpleasant effect was rather spoiled by warthog tusks, moth antennae, wolf ears and a unicorn spike. The whole thing had a selfassembled look, as if the owner had heard about anatomy but couldn\u0027t quite get to grips with the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was staring, but not at her. Something behind her occupied all its interest. Esk turned her head very slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon was sitting cross-legged in the centre of a circle of Things. There were hundreds of them, as still and silent as statues, watching him with reptilian patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something small and angular held in his cupped hands. It gave off a fuzzy blue light that made his face look strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther shapes lay on the ground beside him, each in its little soft glow. They were the regular sort of shapes that Granny dismissed airily as jommetry-cubes, many-sided diamonds, cones, even a globe. Each one was transparent and inside was ....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk edged closer. No one was taking any notice of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside a crystal sphere that had been tossed aside on to the sand floated a blue-green ball, crisscrossed with tiny white cloud patterns and what could almost have been continents if anyone was silly enough to try to live on a ball. It might have been a sort of model, except something about its glow told Esk that it was quite real and probably very big and not - in every sense - totally inside the sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put it down very gently and sidled over to a ten-sided block in which floated a much more acceptable world. It was properly discshaped, but instead of the Rimfall there was a wall of ice and instead of the Hub there was a gigantic tree, so big that its roots merged into mountain ranges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA prism beside it held another slowly-turning disc, surrounded by little stars. But there were no ice walls around this one, just a red-gold thread that turned out on closer inspection to be a snake - a snake big enough to encircle a world. For reasons best known to itself it was biting its own tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk turned the prism over and over curiously, noticing how the little disc inside stayed resolutely upright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon giggled softly. Esk replaced the snake-disc and peered carefully over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was holding a small glass pyramid. There were stars in it, and occasionally he would give it a little shake so that the stars swirled up like snow in the wind, and then settled back in their places. Then he would giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd beyond the stars ....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the Discworld. A Great A\u0027Tuin no bigger than a small saucer toiled along under a world that looked like the work of an obsessive jeweller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJiggle, swirl. Jiggle, swirl, giggle. There were already hairline cracks in the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk looked at Simon\u0027s blank eyes and then up into the hungry faces of the nearest Things, and then she reached across and pulled the pyramid out of his hands and turned and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Things didn\u0027t stir as she scurried towards them, bent almost double, with the pyramid clasped tightly to her chest. But suddenly her feet were no longer running over the sand and she was being lifted into the frigid air, and a Thing with a face like a drowned rabbit turned slowly towards her and extended a talon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re not really here, Esk told herself. It\u0027s only a sort of dream, what Granny calls an annaloggy. You can\u0027t really be hurt, it\u0027s all imagination. There\u0027s absolutely no harm that can come to you, it\u0027s all really inside your mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if it knows that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe talon picked her out of the air and the rabbit face split like a banana skin. There was no mouth, just a dark hole, as if the Thing was itself an opening to an even worse dimension, a place by comparison with which freezing sand and moonless moonlight would be a jolly afternoon at the seaside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk held the Disc-pyramid and flailed with her free hand at the claw around her. It had no effect. The darkness loomed over her, a gateway to total oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicked it as hard as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was not, given the circumstances, very hard. But where her foot struck there was an explosion of white sparks and a pop -which would have been a much more satisfying bang if the thin air here didn\u0027t suck the sound away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thing screeched like a chainsaw encountering, deep inside an unsuspecting sapling, a lurking and long-forgotten nail. The others around it set up a sympathetic buzzing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk kicked again and the Thing shrieked and dropped her to the sand. She was bright enough to roll, with the tiny world hugged protectively to her, because even in a dream a broken ankle can be painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thing lurched uncertainly above her. Esk\u0027s eyes narrowed. She put the world down very carefully, hit the Thing very hard around the point where its shins would be, if there were shins under that cloak, and picked up the world again in one neat movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature howled, bent double, and then toppled slowly, like a sackful of coathangers. When it hit the ground it collapsed into a mass of disjointed limbs; the head rolled away and rocked to a standstill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that all? thought Esk. They can hardly walk, even! When you hit them they just fall over?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nearest Things chittered and tried to back away as she marched determinedly towards them, but since their bodies seemed to be held together more or less by wishful thinking they weren\u0027t very good at it. She hit one, which had a face like a small family of squid, and it deflated into a pile of twitching bones and bits of fur and odd ends of tentacle, very much like a Greek meal. Another was slightly more successful and had begun to shamble uncertainly away before Esk caught it a crack on one of its five shins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt flailed desperately as it fell and brought down another two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy then the others had managed to lurch out of her way and stood watching from a distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk took a few steps towards the nearest one. It tried to move away, and fell over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey may have been ugly. They may have been evil. But when it came to poetry in motion, the Things had all the grace and coordination of a deck-chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk glared at them, and took a look at the Disc in its glass pyramid. All the excitement didn\u0027t seem to have disturbed it a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been able to get out, if this indeed was out and if the Disc could be said to be in. But how was one supposed to get back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomebody laughed. It was the sort of laugh\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, it was p\u0027ch\u0027zarni\u0027chiwkov. This epiglottis-throttling word is seldom used on the Disc except by highly-paid stunt linguists and, of course, the tiny tribe of the K\u0027turni, who invented it. It has no direct synonym, although the Cumhoolie word “squemt” (\u0027the feeling upon finding that the previous occupant of the privy has used all the paper\u0027) begins to approach it in general depth of feeling. The closest translation is as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nasty little sound of a sword being unsheathed right behind one at just the point when one thought one had disposed of one\u0027s enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough K\u0027tumi speakers say that this does not convey the cold sweating, heart-stopping, gut-freezing sense of the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was that kind of laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk turned around slowly. Simon drifted towards her across the sand, with his hands cupped in front of him. His eyes were tight shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you really think it would be as easy as that? ” he said. Or something said; it didn\u0027t sound like Simon\u0027s voice, but like dozens of voices speaking\u0027at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simon?” she said, uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is of no further use to us,” said the Thing with Simon\u0027s shape. “He has shown us the way, child. Now give us our property.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsk backed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t think it belongs to you,” she said, “whoever you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face in front of her opened its eyes. There was nothing there but blackness - not a colour, just holes into some other space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could say that if you gave it to us we would be merciful. We could say we would let you go from here in your own shape. But there wouldn\u0027t really be much point in us saying that, would there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn\u0027t believe you,” said Esk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Simon-thing grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re only putting off the inevitable,” it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suits me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could take it anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take it, then. But I don\u0027t think you can. You can\u0027t take anything unless it\u0027s given to you, can you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey circled round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ll give it to us,” said the Simon-thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the other Things were approaching now, striding back across the desert with horrible jerky motions. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/equal-rites-discworld-3/page-28.html","bookId":1622,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:15 PM"}
