With a single sweep, 3 or 4 blood demons would be demolished by the vibrating force.

Suddenly, his surroundings began to change. The bloody lakes and red sky began to turn into a completely dark and gloomy world. Looking up, he could see that the sky was a pale yellow like muddied waters, and there were countless black crows flying everywhere.

I thought that these names were only because of the religion and superstitions of the Southern Wilderness’ people. I didn’t actually expect it to be true!

She wanted to reach the fifth floor of the Sorcerer Pagoda, or even the sixth floor, and gain the Sorcerer’s recognition to restore her Na Tribe!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSince the founding of the Na Tribe, it was already very good if a witch was able to reach the third or fourth level of the Sorcerer Pagoda.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf they passed through the fourth to the fifth, then they were a genius among talents.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf they passed through the fifth to the sixth, then they were a legend.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the thousand or so years of the Na Tribe’s existence, there had only ever been one person to enter the sixth level!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd that legendary figure was the first Witch Queen of the Na Tribe who had brought her people to travel the land, expanded their territory, and eventually founded the Na Tribe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Big Sister, what level do you think that Big Brother Mo is at now?” Na Shui innocently asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He…” Na Yi’s eyebrows knitted together. She looked towards the Sorcerer Pagoda with an anxiously puzzled expression. Before, she had seen Lin Ming rush up the first three levels with incredible speed that was enough to make her gasp in surprise. However, it wasn’t to unexpected. After all, Lin Ming’s strength was at the limit of a Bone Forging powerhouse. With his strength, he should have been able to roll over the first three levels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut what was strange was that after she had seen Lin Ming pass through the first three levels from outside the pagoda, he had seemingly disappeared. She had been staring at the fourth level of the Sorcerer Pagoda and found that the formation array hadn’t even begun to revolve. This proved that Lin Ming hadn’t entered the fourth level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Just what could have happened? With Mo Lin’s strength, it’s impossible that he couldn’t reach the fourth floor. He should easily pass through the fifth and into the sixth. His progress should at least be no less than the first Witch Queen of the Na Tribe.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Could Mo Lin have experienced some sort of accident within the Sorcerer Pagoda?” Thinking this, Na Yi felt her heart tighten in distress.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“But… the Sorcerer Pagoda is only an illusory magic array, there shouldn’t be any accidents. Even if it is too difficult…” Na Yi suddenly gasped as she remembered something. In the ancient texts of the witches, there was once a legend that existed…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that legend, there was once a time long, long ago, when the Sorcerer had founded a Divine Kingdom. The Sorcerer Pagoda was the entrance leading to the Divine Kingdom. If one was selected by the Sorcerer, they would be able to open the door to the Divine Kingdom. Once they returned from that holy land, they would be the king of the Southern Wilderness!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKing of the Southern Wilderness…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNa Yi took a deep breath, her heart surging with emotions as goose bumps began to rise on her arms.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Bones as thin as firewood, sunken eyes, pupils the color of blood, so these are the hungry ghosts of the Hungry Ghost World.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming watched as the hideous ghosts stumbled towards him. Their bodies were lean to the point of being naught by a pile of bones. Their limbs were short and their heads were grotesquely huge. Their mouths were twisted open, and he could see dense rows of sharp teeth with a long, red tongue hanging out as it unendingly dripped saliva.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Whether it is hungry ghosts or blood demons, I’ll kill you all the same!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming rushed towards the hungry ghost at the front, striking out with his spear!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCha!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this point, the absurd occurred. Lin Ming’s spear hadn’t been blocked and struck the hungry ghost without resistance, but the hungry ghost wasn’t injured even a bit. Unharmed, it rushed towards Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA claw swiped downwards.

It was just recently that he had accidently created the Thunderfire Annihilation skill.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, using the Thunderfire Annihilation would sap 40% of Lin Ming’s total true essence reserves; it wasn’t something that he could casually use.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut this didn’t matter. Lin Ming still had his true essence manifestation ability, and he could also use the powers of thunder and flame.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming shook his spear, and a purple electric snake began to circle down the Heavy Profound Soft Spear’s shaft, making a sizzling sound as it passed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThunder had always been a power that was able to exorcise spirits and demons. Ghosts feared the sunlight, and were even more fearful of thunder. If a ghost was caught out in a thunderstorm, the thunderclap would scatter their wretched soul until it was beyond redemption.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, in the legends there also existed super ghosts of unimaginable strength that were able to withstand the destructive power of thunder. They would fly into the thunderclouds and use the power of thunder to temper out the impurities of their soul. This was the so-called heavenly tribulation. Once a ghost was able to pass through this trial by thunder, they would be able to produce Pure Yang from within themselves, and eventually construct a Pure Yang body that was no different from a living human.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, these hungry ghosts in front of Lin Ming were nowhere near that level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eChi!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe electric snake spat out a bolt of lightning that struck a hungry ghost.

Before reaching the Xiantian realm, it was extremely difficult for one to cultivate soul force. Lin Ming had only done so by depending on the ‘Overbearing Soul Tactic’ and drawing inscriptions in order to augment his own soul force. However, that progress had been slow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough Lin Ming’s current soul force was much stronger than a martial artist at the same cultivation as him, it was still difficult to use that minimal soul force to draw up the body inscription symbol. That was why Lin Ming had barely managed to do so, and why each time after drawing the body inscription symbol, he had fallen into a deep slumber from overtaxing his soul force.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I didn’t imagine that the power of the hungry ghosts could strengthen one’s soul force.

Moreover, once one reached the Xiantian realm, they would also have to cultivate the soul.
