My hands were shaking, so I kept missing the latch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of question was that? How am I—hey, it’s just a seatbelt. Not that hard.” He leaned over, taking control. His hands brushed over mine, and I jerked back against the seat. He paused and looked at me, those lips usually tilted up, started to tip down at the corners. Something flared in his eyes. I don’t know what it was, but it was gone as he snapped the seatbelt in place. He didn’t move back, though. “Why shouldn’t we go out on a date?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI strained back against the seat, my hands curling into fists in my lap. It wasn’t that I was that uncomfortable with him being so close. It was that I was uncomfortable with the way I noticed every slight touch of skin or look. “Because… because we don’t know each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips tipped up again. I decided I liked them like that over the frownie face. “That’s what a date is all about. Getting to know each other.” Cam’s eyes dropped to my mouth. “Go out on a date with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s nothing to know about me.” The words came out in a heady whisper as my chest rose sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tilted to his head to the side. “I’m sure there is tons to know about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we can spend the time with me talking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds like fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, it will be more thrilling than watching Raphael cross a road.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “Thought you’d like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the side pocket of my bag vibrate against my leg once. A text message? Probably from Jacob. I wanted to reach for it, but I would end up smacking my head off Cam’s. Not something I wanted to repeat. “Can we go yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we go on a date?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good God, you don’t give up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, couldn’t help it, and his smile spread in response to the sound. “I’m sure there are plenty of girls who want to go out on a date with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow. Modest aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why should I be?” he shot back. “And I want to go out on a date with you. Not them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t understand why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark brows rose. “I can think of a few reasons. You’re not like most girls. That interests me. You’re awkward in this really… adorable way. You’re smart. Want me to list more?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Not at all,” I told him quickly. I needed to nip this in the bud. Reputation aside, he was a hell of a lot more than I could ever hope to handle. He would expect things I couldn’t give him. Holding a conversation with him was difficult enough sometimes. “I don’t want to go out on a date with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam didn’t look surprised by my response or undaunted. “I figured you’d say that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why did you ask?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally—thank God—backed away and gripped the side of the door. “Because I wanted to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Well. Okay. Glad you got it out of your system.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows knitted. “I haven’t gotten it out of my system.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no. “You haven’t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.” He flashed a charming grin. “There’s always tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll ask you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. “The answer will be the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe. Maybe not.” He reached out and tapped the tip of my nose. “And maybe you’ll say yes. I’m a patient guy, and hey, like you said, I don’t give up easily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great,” I muttered, but…oh, oh man, there was an unfamiliar stirring in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Knew you’d see it that way.” Cam tweaked the tip of my nose, and I swatted his hand away. “Don’t worry. I know the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The truth about what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam stepped back. “You want to say yes, but you’re just not ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay.” His grin turned cocky. “I’m a lot to handle, but I can assure you, you’ll have fun handling me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen before I could muster up a response worthy of that statement, he tapped my nose once more and then shut the door in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in my apartment, I dropped my bag on the couch and collapsed next to it. Go out on a date with Cameron? Was he insane? He had to be joking or just flirting. On the ride home, he hadn’t mentioned it again, instead he spent the time drilling me about my schedule. Question by question, he dragged out every detail about the classes I was taking. By the time we’d got back to the building, I was exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning my head back against the cushion, I closed my eyes. My heart was beating pretty fast for just sitting down. Was he being serious about not hooking up with Stephanie on Wednesday? Seemed odd to me that he hadn’t if she really had been all over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, it didn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t do a relationship of any sorts. Maybe one day. Hopefully one day, because I didn’t want to be like this for the rest of my life. Eventually I wanted to be the girl who got excited about being asked out on a date instead of the girl who came home and did this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening my eyes, I groaned. “I’m Señor Fucktard. Or Señorita Fucktard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed to my feet and started halfway to the bedroom before I remembered my vibrating bag. “Shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurrying back to the couch, I reached into the side pocket and pulled out my cell. I tapped the screen, fully expecting to see a text from Jacob or Brittany pop up. Instead I saw a missed call and voicemail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my fingers along the side and figured out I’d knocked the damn thing to silent. Sliding my figure along the screen, I unlocked it and saw that the call was from an UNKNOWN CALLER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart skipped a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo big deal. Probably a wrong call or a telemarketer. I went to the voicemail page and my finger hovered over the delete button. The past raised its ugly, bitter head. How many times did I get a prank call from people blocking their number? Too many to count, but that couldn’t be it. My number was new, like my email….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cursed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, I hit the message and raised it to my ear. There was a pause and then a gravelly, indistinguishable voice crackled through the phone. “You know what happens to liars and skanks? They get a big, fat—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrying out, I hit the delete button before I could hear anything more. I dropped the phone on the couch instead of tossing it against the wall and backed up like it was some kind of venomous creatures perched on the cushions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny method of communication could become poisonous. Didn’t I already know that firsthand? A strangled laugh escaped me. Really, did they have nothing better to do? It had been five years. Five years! They couldn’t let go of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like deep down, neither could I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked straight up in bed, confused and disorientated. It was damn near close to four am when I’d finally fallen asleep and I had no idea what woke me. I twisted in bed, groaning when I saw that it was only eight in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlopping onto my back, I stared up at the ceiling. Once I was awake, there was no hope of ever—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump. Thump. Thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up again, frowning. Someone was banging on a door—my door. What the hell? Throwing off the covers, I swung my legs off the bed. My toe caught on the sheet and I nearly ate the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy crap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCursing, I raced through the apartment before the entire building was woken up. I stretched up, peering through the peep hole. All I could see was a mass of wavy dark hair. Cam?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething had to be wrong. Maybe the building was on fire, because I couldn’t think of any other reason to why he’d be banging on my door Sunday morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is everything okay?” I winced at the sound of my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam spun around. A crooked smile appeared, taking his already extraordinary face and making it boyishly sexy. “No, but it will be in about fifteen minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“W-w-what?” I stepped aside or was forced aside as he entered my apartment, carrying something wrapped in tinfoil, a carton of eggs—huh?—and a tiny frying pan. “Cam, what are you doing? It’s eight in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks for the update on the time.” He headed straight for my kitchen. “It’s one thing I’ve never been able to master: the telling of time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned as padded after him. “Why are you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Making breakfast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t do that in your own kitchen?” I ask, scrubbing at my eyes. After the astronomy assignment and the phone call, he was the last person I wanted to see at a buttcrack time in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My kitchen isn’t as exciting as yours.” He put his stuff on the counter and faced me. His hair was damp and curlier than normal. How was it possible for him to look so good when it was obvious he’d just rolled out of bed and showered? There wasn’t even a dusting of morning scruff on his smooth cheeks. And he made sweats and a plain old tee shirt look damn good. “And Ollie is passed out on the living room floor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the floor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. Face down, snoring and drooling a little. It’s not an appetizing atmosphere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, neither is my apartment.” He needed to go. He had no business being here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam leaned against my counter, folding his arms. “Oh, I don’t know about that…” His gaze moved from the top of my disheveled head and all the way down to the tips of my curled toes. It was like a physical touch, causing my breath to catch. “Your kitchen, right this second, is very appetizing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flush crawled across my cheeks. “I’m not going out with you, Cam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t ask you at this moment, now did I?” One side of his lips curved up. “But you will eventually.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed. “You’re delusional.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m determined.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More like annoying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most would say amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “Only in your head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In many heads is what you meant,” he replied, turning back to my stove. “I also brought banana nut bread baked in my very own oven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking my head, I glared at his back. “I’m allergic to bananas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam spun around, brows raised in disbelief. “Are you shitting me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I’m not. I’m allergic to bananas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Man, that’s a damn shame. You have no idea what you’re missing out on. Bananas make the world a better place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocked his head to the side. “Anything else you’re allergic to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides penicillin and guys who bust up into my apartment? No.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wait-for-you-wait-for-you-1/page-10.html","bookId":2001,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM"}
