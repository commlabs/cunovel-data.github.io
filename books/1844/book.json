The dear Scottish friend of her childhood was about to give birth, and Judith had promised to be at her side. But there was another, private reason for the journey from her bleak English home to the Highlands to meet the father she had never known, the Laird Maclean. Nothing prepared her for the sight of the Scottish barbarian who was to escort her into his land...Iain Maitland, Laird of his clan, a man more powerfully compelling than any she had ever encountered. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIn a spirited clash of wills and customs, Judith revelled in the melting bliss of Iain\u0027s searching kisses, his passionate caresses.
