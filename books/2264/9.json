I slipped up the stairs and flopped on my bed. His scent wafted up into the air from his pillow. I grabbed it and threw it across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy tiger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped seeing Coop standing where I threw the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" I asked looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a finger to his lips. Jules came running into the room and jumped on the bed. She curled into me and cried. Mitch wasn’t far behind her. He wrapped himself around us and joined in on the crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt broke everything inside of me. Their suffering wasn’t a random accident. It was the recklessness of a philandering father. A man I would let die, even if it meant I was in danger. No matter what, they would always believe the lies. I was selling my soul to the devil to ensure it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my children to me and forgot we had an audience, until my mom came in. She stood in the doorway and smiled, \"Fresh cookies on the rack downstairs cooling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed Mitch on the cheek and smiled, \"Go on.\" He wiped his face and shoved his ball cap down, then he stalked past his grandma like a tough guy. Jules was asleep. I nudged her, \"Cookies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t stir. I lifted her off the bed and carried her to her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came back in, I climbed on the bed and smiled at my mom, \"Thanks for making those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, \"No. No thank-you needed. This is what family does, when one of theirs is hurting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"You always were a good mom. You\u0027re an even better grandma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and sat on the bed. I glanced around, looking for Coop but he wasn’t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s the payment for suffering through having kids. You get grandkids,\" she beamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, \"Me and sis were easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe folded her arms around her and grinned, \"I never said you weren’t. But you were kids. Kids are kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a hand on hers and saw the resemblance. We had the same hands. I had hers. I squeezed, \"I need you to leave town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, \"No, the kids need stability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my lips together and took a deep breath, \"They need to survive something I\u0027m about to tell you, that you may never speak of to anyone. I am telling you, not only so you are prepared to run and raise them on your own, but so you understand what I\u0027m doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed my hand back, \"Evie honey, you\u0027re scaring me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked into her green eyes and nodded, \"You should be scared. James did some bad things. He betrayed the country. He sold secrets. He was a rogue agent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, but I could see the truths making their way into her mind. Her eyes showed the doubts she was having and the uncertainty of her headshake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whispered, \"A bad man owns everything of mine. My home, my van, my car, my bank accounts, everything has been transferred into the ownership of this bad man. I have nothing. CI has basically told me, I will help or I will fry for the things James did. I have to help fix James\u0027 mistake. It\u0027s the only way to get the danger out of our lives and get what\u0027s rightfully ours back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face changed and I didn’t know the look she was giving me. She looked around oddly, and whispered so silently, I barely caught her word, \"Evie, we can run. We can take the kids. I have a little nest egg your father put aside, for just a moment like this one. I know a place.\" She looked frightened, as silent tears slipped down her pale cheeks,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and cut her off, \"No. They\u0027ll find me. They\u0027ll hurt the kids or you. They know all about all of us. There is no way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeas flew through her mind; I could see them rolling by like clouds in the sky. She twitched and shook her head, \"We can go to the FBI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"James hasn’t broken a law they govern. As far as they’re concerned, he’s dead. CI is going to take the three of you and go pick up Sissy, and take you somewhere. Somewhere safe. I won\u0027t help them if they don’t do this. I want you safe until this is over.\" My voice cracked, \"You keep my babies safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled her hand away, \"God damned him. What was he thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"He was leaving me for Mel. It never was me he wanted. He got me pregnant. I just never knew. Dad told him to do the right thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands flew to her eyes, “You know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a look, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sniffled and shook her head, “You know that for certain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sobbed and shook her dark head. I crawled to her and wrapped my arms around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t do this to them. You can\u0027t abandon them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled her back and smiled, \"I\u0027m not. I\u0027m giving them the only person I trust in the whole world to keep them safe.\" I looked to the side of the room and spoke softly, \"You can come out, Coop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped from the walk-in closet with a savage look on his face, until my mom lifted hers. Instantly, the clouds from his face were gone and he smiled at her. It wasn’t his cocky smile either. It was sweet. I could see just how handsome he was with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" she asked him. She sounded terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darted at me, \"Everything she said was true. James was a bad man and has put the country in danger. My name is William Cooper. I\u0027m in the section of the government where Evie and your late husband used to work. We need her to come back to work and help us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom looked at me and shook her head, \"Will she be in danger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip and looked down. I didn’t want her to see the face I was making, she could read my face too easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop smiled and shook his head, \"No. I\u0027m very good at my job, ma\u0027am. I will keep your daughter completely safe.\" He offered her his hand, \"You have my word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. He was nine years old for God\u0027s sake; what word did he have to give? Mom ate it up though. She smiled and eventually got up off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Coop and nodded but spoke to my mother, \"Can you go tell the kids they get to go on a fun trip and I\u0027ll make arrangements here with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at us both and then walked from the room. She wasn\u0027t happy and I didn’t blame her. I would kill Jules myself, if she ever said something like that to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the door and instantly Coop lashed at me. He grabbed my arms, \"What are you doing?\" He shook me. I jerked free and shoved him back, \"You aren’t keeping them here as fucking bait. So you can play ball with me or I walk. I will go to jail for whatever the hell James did, just to see them safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paced across the carpet for a minute and then picked up his phone. He dialed and held it to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot me a dirty look as he spoke “I need an evac and I need it now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hated whatever they said to him next; the look he gave me was absolute fury, \"You tell anyone I’ve called you and that weekend I may or may not have footage, goes live.\" He ran his hands over his short, dark-blond hair and then looked back at me, pointing as they talked in his ear. He mouthed the words, \"You are a pain in my ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and crossed my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued, \"No, she wants the family evac\u0027d. She wants them out now… tonight. No. She wants them in a safe house… out of country. I’m thinking Canada, or even Alaska. Find a fishing lodge, or something the kids can have fun at, and they can blend. Something where we can post people and make them look like part of the resort. I want this to be handled by Martin\u0027s team.\" He paced, still holding his hand on the top of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy frantic eyes searched him for signs of body language. In the tiny space between his t-shirt and jeans I could see his stomach. I wasn’t certain if the tattoo on his side, which dipped into his pants, suited him or not. It was sexy and fun looking, whereas he seemed like an asshole most of the time. His face was a storm of repressed fury. He reminded me of my dad a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snapped a finger in front of my face when he caught me looking him over, and continued to speak into the phone quietly, \"I want the jet ready and directions to be disclosed in the air like with the MacLean case. The pilots will be at the resort with them the entire time. No leaks this time. Make sure it’s some place we own, sheriffs and whatnot as employees. Don’t even mess with me, Mickey. I got your wife on speed dial. Yeah, fuck you too. See ya, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned and mouthed, \"This time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head at me and snarled. I glared back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Done.\" He tapped the off and pointed at me, \"Don\u0027t fuck with me. I run this show; I tell you how it goes. No more stunts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed and looked away, seeing the anger on his face I decided then that he didn’t suit the tattoo. Cute and flirty Coop was not consistent enough to suit the sexy tat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned into my face and shouted, \"I mean it, Evie!\" His nostrils flared when he was angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched at his rage. He softened when he saw my face, \"What time did the card say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a strong desire to kick him in the face. I hadn\u0027t been yelled at like that, since I was in basic training. I looked down at the floor and took a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped to his knees in front of me, \"I shouldn’t have yelled,\" he brushed it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled at him, \"You\u0027re single aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, but it wasn\u0027t friendly, it was sort of bitter. \"You\u0027re not really my type. I get the whole cougar thing is huge, but I\u0027m not into it. I like it when I\u0027m on top and all you forty-types always want to steer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand flew at him, he caught it and gave me an outraged look, \"What was that for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yanked my hand from him, \"I\u0027m not a cougar! I\u0027m not forty! I wasn’t hitting on you, you moron, I was mocking you!\" I got off the bed and walked out of the room looking back at him with daggers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Little bastard,\" I muttered and stomped down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five - From Ma\u0027am to Madam\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKissing my kids goodbye wasn\u0027t painful, it was too much pain to only measure with human emotions and words. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-9.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
