But when Jade, an enchanting vision of rippling red hair and eyes of jewel-green, appears at his door to beg desperately for his protection, the Marquess agrees to keep her safe from the villains who want her dead. Jade is infuriating, exasperating, and gorgeous; Caine is noble, strong-willed, and powerful. No woman has ever befuddled him so, nor so deeply aroused his desire. But as Jade answers his knowing caresses with an innocent, wild abandon, they are drawn into a web of treachery that will test the very heart of their love!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2.jpg","author":"Julie Garwood","type":"Historical","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:55 PM"}
