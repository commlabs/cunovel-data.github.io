Do you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought everyone in the village was hearing him. Her ear rang from his roar. It took all her strength\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto stand up to him. She slowly shook her head. \"You called me a whore,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anguish in her voice got through to him. Some of his anger eased away. \"No, I did not call you a whore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought it,\" she countered. \"You were about to shout it to the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t,\" he returned. \"Jade, we have more important issues to discuss now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a gasp. \"More important than calling me a whore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved away from the door and started toward her. She immediately backed up a space. \"Don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecome near me. I never want you to touch me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027re going to be damned miserable for the rest of your days, Jade.

You don\u0027t know the real me. No, you don\u0027t,\" she continued when he shook his head at her. \"I\u0027m really very strong, determined, too. I just pretended to need you, you daft man, so that you would feel honor bound to stay by my side. I used all the ploys a weak woman would use, too. Yes, I did! I complained at every opportunity, and I wept whenever I needed to get my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed hold of her and jerked her up against him. \"I\u0027m leaving,\" she cried out. \"Can\u0027t you get that through your thick . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re staying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate you,\" she whispered before she burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rested his chin on the top of her head. \"No, you don\u0027t hate me,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate everything about you,\" she wailed between racking sobs. \"But most of all I hate the way you contradict me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are your tears a pretense now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t quit crying long enough to give him a clear answer. \"They most certainly are,\" she stammered out. \"I never, ever cry,\" she added a moment later. \"Only weak women cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re not weak, are you, love?\" he asked. His smile was gentle, his voice as well, but his grip continued to be as strong as iron, even after she quit her struggle to get away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to hold her in his arms for the rest of his days. \"Jade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t respond to his vow, but started trembling. He knew he was terrifying her. \"You\u0027re the most confusing woman,\" he whispered on a sigh. \"God help me, I do love you, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t love you,\" she stammered out. \"I don\u0027t even like you. I won\u0027t trust you either.\" She ended her list of what she wouldn\u0027t do with a loud hiccup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine wasn\u0027t the least upset by her denials. \"I love you,\" he said again. \"Now and forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was content to hold her while she wept. Lord, she did have a store of tears locked inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey must have stood there a full ten minutes before she was able to regain her composure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped her cheeks on the lapels of his jacket, then pulled away from him. \"You\u0027d better go back downstairs,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not without you,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she replied. \"Nathan and Harry would know I\u0027d been crying. I\u0027m staying here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, you can\u0027t put off. . .\" He stopped in midsentence, then asked, \"Why does it matter if they know you\u0027ve been crying or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be what they expect me to be if I cried,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to explain what you meant by that remark?\" he asked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a disgruntled look. \"Appearances have to be kept up, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked over to the bed and sat down. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about this.\" She let out a sigh, then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadded, \"Oh, very well. I\u0027ll meet you downstairs . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was shaking his head at her. \"I\u0027ll wait for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t trust me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for her temper to explode. She surprised him, however, when she merely shrugged. \"Good,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t trust me, Caine. I\u0027m going to leave at the first opportunity. I won\u0027t stay here and wait\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor you to leave me. I\u0027m not a fool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally understood. She couldn\u0027t hide her fear or her vulnerability from him now. \"And you\u0027re absolutely certain I would leave you, aren\u0027t you, Jade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe replied with such candor that he wasn\u0027t certain how to proceed. \"Even though I\u0027ve just told you that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you, you still. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan and Harry love me, too,\" she interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine gave up trying to reason with her now, guessing it would do his cause little good. He decided he\u0027d have to wait and find another way around her shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine suddenly wanted to go downstairs and kill both Nathan and Harry. He sighed instead. He couldn\u0027t undo the past for her. No, he could only give her a secure, safe future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would never abandon . . .\" he stopped himself, then said, \"Very well, Jade. You may leave me whenever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened over that announcement. She looked like she was going to start weeping again, too. Caine felt like an ogre. \"Any time you want to leave, do so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her gaze to her lap. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome,\" he drawled out. He walked over to her, pulled her to her feet, then tilted her head up. \"Just one other little detail,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every time you leave, I\u0027m going to come after you. There isn\u0027t any place you can hide, Jade. I\u0027ll find you and drag you back here. This is where you belong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to push his hand away from her chin. \"You\u0027d never find me,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear the panic in her voice. Caine leaned down and kissed her. He missed her mouth completely when she jerked away from him, then captured her soft lips by cupping the sides of her face and holding her still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue took possession then. He growled low in his throat when she pinched him, then deepened the kiss. Her tongue finally rubbed against his own, her resistance spent. She wrapped her arms around his waist and melted against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you,\" he told her again after he\u0027d lifted his head away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe promptly burst into tears again. \"Are you going to do that every damned time I tell you I love you?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was more amused than exasperated with her. She shook her head. \"You don\u0027t understand yet,\" she whispered. \"It hasn\u0027t settled in, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What don\u0027t I understand?\" he asked, his voice filled with tenderness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand what I am,\" she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine let out another sigh. He took hold of her hand and dragged her out of the room. They were halfway down the stairs to the foyer when he finally answered her. \"I understand, all right. You\u0027re mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate your possessiveness, too,\" she told his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine paused at the door to the drawing room, then let go of her hand. \"If you try to move away from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme while we\u0027re in there, I swear to God I\u0027ll embarrass the hell out of you. Got that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. When he started to open the door, he noticed the change that came over her. Gone was the vulnerable woman he\u0027d just held in his arms. Jade looked quite serene. Caine was so astonished by the change in her, he had to shake his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ready now,\" she announced. \"But if you tell Harry we slept together . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" he interjected before she could get herself all worked up again. \"Unless you leave my side, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a quick glare, then forced a smile on her face and strolled into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe talk stopped as soon as she and Caine entered. Jade sat on the arm of the chair adjacent to the hearth and motioned for him to take the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is my supper near to ready?\" Harry asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In just another minute or two,\" Jade answered. \"I insisted on the best for you, Uncle. It takes a little longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry beamed at her. \"I\u0027m the lucky one, having you to take care of me, Pagan,\" he crooned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call her Pagan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat command came out in a harsh whisper. Jade shivered over the anger in Caine\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan grinned while Harry squinted at Caine. \"Why the hell not? That\u0027s her name,\" he argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, her name is Jade,\" Caine snapped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Pagan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice had turned as hard as ice. \"I\u0027m sorry you don\u0027t like it, Caine, but that\u0027s . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quit her explanation when he took hold of her hand and started squeezing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He still doesn\u0027t believe it,\" Harry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade didn\u0027t answer her uncle, but she secretly believed he was right. Caine certainly wouldn\u0027t be holding her hand if it had all settled in. \"He believes all women are weak, Uncle,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry snorted. He was about to launch into several of his favorite stories about his Pagan\u0027s special\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabilities when the men he\u0027d sent to the village returned from their errand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men lumbered over to Harry\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well? What have you got for me, men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eleven pair,\" the shorter of the two seamen announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Caine watched in growing astonishment, spectacles of every size and shape were dropped into Harry\u0027s lap. The old man tried on the first pair, squinted at Caine, then took the spectacles off and tossed them over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t do,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ritual was repeated again and again, until he tried on the eighth pair. Then he let out a happy sigh. \"These do,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle, try the others on,\" Jade suggested. \"There might be another pair that will do just as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry did as she suggested, then tucked another pair in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did your task well, men. I\u0027m proud of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine\u0027s head dropped forward. The picture of how Harry\u0027s men had come by the spectacles forced a reluctant smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half of England will be squinting before Harry goes home,\" Colin predicted with a deep chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You being insulting, boy?\" Harry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, just honest,\" Colin answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSterns opened the doors then and announced that dinner was now ready to be served.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry bounded out of his chair. Nathan and Colin moved out of his way just as he kicked the footstool out of his path. \"Are you coming with me, girl?\" Harry asked as he charged past Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine increased his grip on her hand. \"No, Uncle, I\u0027m staying here,\" Jade called out. \"I have a little explaining to do. Enjoy your meal with your men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Harry left the room, Jade motioned for the men to follow. Jimbo looked like he wanted to argue with that command. His expression bordered on hostility. His target was Caine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade simply stared at Jimbo. The silent message got through and the big man hurried out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut the doors behind you,\" she called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might not be able to hear you if you call out,\" Jimbo argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll hear me,\" Jade promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll hear me too,\" Nathan drawled out. \"I can take care of my sister, Jimbo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s still to be proven,\" Jimbo muttered loud enough for everyone to hear. He gave Caine one last glare, then shut the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you rested enough to explain this problem to Caine? I really would like to get this over with, Colin, so I can leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine gave her hand another good squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m rested enough,\" Colin said. He turned to Nathan, received his nod, then turned his attention back to Caine. \"When I was in my last year at Oxford, a man by the name of Willburn approached me. He was from the War Office and he was recruiting men to do some undercover work for England. Our country wasn\u0027t officially at war with France yet, but everyone knew it was coming. Anyway, Willburn knew you worked for Richards. I was still sworn to secrecy. I should have wondered at the time why I couldn\u0027t discuss my duties with you, Caine, but I didn\u0027t. You never talked about your work, and I figured that was the way it was supposed to be. In all honesty, I think I was enamored with this spy business.\" His expression became sheepish when he added, \"I saw myself as England\u0027s savior for a while, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you meet Nathan?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost a year after I\u0027d started working for Willburn. We were paired together then. He was recruited in much the same way I was. Eventually Nathan and I became good friends.\" He paused to smile at his friend. \"Nathan\u0027s a hard man to like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve noticed,\" Caine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get on with it, Colin,\" Nathan ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It took a long time to win Nathan\u0027s trust, almost another full year working together as a matter of fact. He didn\u0027t confide in me in all that time. Then, on a trip back from France, he told me about the letters Pagan had found.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin shifted positions, grimacing in pain. Nathan caught the expression before anyone else did and immediately righted the stool for his friend. With a gentleness surprising in such a large man, he lifted Colin\u0027s injured leg, slipped a cushion under the heel, then asked, \"It\u0027s better now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank you,\" Colin answered. \"Now where was I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was watching Nathan. He could still see the concern in Nathan\u0027s eyes. He suddenly realized he couldn\u0027t hate the man after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat revelation was one hell of a disappointment. Caine wanted to hate him. The bastard had deserted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis own sister, left her on her own to fend for herself. He was the reason Jade had so many shields guarding her heart, the reason she had had so much pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Colin was alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine?\" Colin asked, drawing his brother back to the discussion. \"Do you believe it\u0027s possible for a government to operate within a government?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything is possible,\" Caine answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever heard of the Tribunal?\" Colin asked. His voice had dropped to a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Colin and Nathan exchanged a nod. They were prepared to hear Caine\u0027s denial. Then they were going to knock the breath out of him with the facts they\u0027d uncovered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-26.html","bookId":1791,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM"}
