Stop trying to call everything dog poop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to find her leaning against the doorframe leading into the kitchen given Carter the evil eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t take offense,” she said, turning her gaze to me. “Last week, every time you asked him a question he replied “stupid fat cows are stupid” no matter what the question was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, grateful that the whole dog poop thing wasn’t just because he already decided he hated me. Claire made her way across the room to where I was and glanced down at the picture still in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God, please don\u0027t look at that picture. I look like I have a giant tumor growing out of me. A tumor that kicked the shit out of my vagina and made me pee myself when I sneezed,\" she said with a groan. \"I just told you I peed my pants didn\u0027t I?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you kind of did. It\u0027s okay, I’ll only send a text to four of my contacts about it instead of my whole phone book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly realized we were toe-to-toe and I was close enough to kiss her. I leaned forward to do just that, completely forgetting that we weren’t alone in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mo-om, can I open my pwesent now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped inches from each other\u0027s mouths and looked down next to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire sighed and leaned back away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you can open your present now,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plopped down on the floor right where he was and started tearing into the paper, pieces of it flying in every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t have to get him anything,\" she said softly to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"It\u0027s no big deal, just something little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mommy, look! It\u0027s crayons and markers and paint and wow I can color stuffs and make pictures!\" Gavin said excitedly, holding everything up for Claire to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s awesome, baby. Can you go put them in Mommy\u0027s room on my bed and we\u0027ll play with them later?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I wanna paint now,\" Gavin complained, dropping the box of crayons on his foot. \"Shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavin Allen!\" Claire yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I shouldn\u0027t laugh, so I looked away and thought of dead puppies and that scene from \"Field of Dreams\" where Kevin Costner\u0027s character got to play catch with his dad. God dammed scene got me every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The next bad word that comes out of your mouth is going to get you a spanking, do you understand me? Tell Carter thank you for the present and go in your room until it\u0027s time for dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Carter,\" Gavin mumbled as he trudged down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was out of earshot I started laughing, and Claire smacked me in the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, but he is funny as hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes at me and walked back to the kitchen with me following behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he\u0027s a riot. Come back to me after you\u0027ve been out in public with him. Like, say in church. And when it gets to a really quiet part and all you can hear is the fountain in the back of the church and then Gavin\u0027s voice say really loudly \"Mom! I hear Jesus taking a piss!\" It\u0027s not so funny then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the counter behind her and my jaw dropped. Covered over every available surface were chocolate, cookies and candy – every kind imaginable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I in Willy Wonka\u0027s workshop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and opened up the lid of a huge pot on the stove and stirred the contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I decided to make you guys my guinea pigs tonight. And Jenny is going to take a few pictures of some of the items for my advertisements since I don’t have anything better than my cell phone camera.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared dreamily at everything. I may have a slight weakness to sweets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy hell, what are those things?” I asked pointing to a row of white chocolate clumps the size of my fist with caramel on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, those are something new I’m experimenting with. I melted a bowl of white chocolate, added crushed up pretzels and potato chips to it and then once the dropped spoonfuls solidified, I drizzled caramel on top. I may have gone a little overboard on the size of them. Right now they’re called Globs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet Mary in heaven. I wanted to ask this woman to have my babies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, wait…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded on the front door and Claire asked me to answer it for her while she set the table and finished up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny and Drew were the next to arrive. I held the door open for them and shook my head at Drew while Jenny walked in and made her way into the kitchen to talk to Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, Drew?\" I asked, looking at his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a picture of a little kid on it shooting a gun above his head. The shirt read \"Don\u0027t hit kids. No, seriously. They have guns now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Kids nowadays are the devil. This shirt is a PSA for you, dude. You\u0027ll thank me one day. So, where is the little guy? Does he need his diaper changed or anything? Maybe I can show him my car or give him some candy,\" he said as he looked around me and rubbed his hands together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s four Drew. He doesn\u0027t wear diapers. And you might want to dial down the creepy kidnapper vibe just a notch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. Take me to your demon seed,\" Drew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked past the kitchen and I stuck my head in and asked Claire if it was okay to head back to Gavin\u0027s room. She told me where it was and we went down the hall and found him sitting on the floor in the middle of his room, squirting a tube of toothpaste right onto the carpet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-51.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM"}
