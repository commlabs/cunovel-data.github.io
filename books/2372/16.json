It was still dark. A light drizzle of icy rain was beginning to soak through his thin gray woolen jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, without question, the happiest moment of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got somewhere to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard at the gate smiled. Wormwood Scrubs was a shitty place to work. The screws hated it almost as much as the inmates. But watching men like Gabe McGregor savor their first taste of freedom in eight long years, reformed young men with their lives still ahead of them, that was a joy that never got old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes. I\u0027ve got somewhere to go all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to Marshall Gresham. I owe that man my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his first night in prison, Gabriel McGregor tried to kill himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Wilmott, his lawyer, had told him not to panic. That the sixteen-year term handed down by the crown-court judge would likely be reduced on appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it goes down to twelve, chances are you\u0027ll be out in seven or eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven or eight? Years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe longest Gabe had been without heroin was seven days. The worst seven days of his life. It was his first week on remand, and he had not yet learned how to buy drugs inside. Once you knew the system, heroin was easy enough to come by. The big dealers all had guys working inside on a commissioned-sales basis. Heroin and crack were both priced at a 30 percent markup. As long as you had money and a friend on the outside who could make regular payments to the gangs, you were okay. But those first seven days! Gabe would never forget the misery. Nights spent screaming, convulsed by cramps so violent he felt like he were being hanged, drawn and quartered. The sweats, the vomiting, the hallucinations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure on a white horse was coming to get him. Jamie McGregor! In his hand was an ax. As he rode, he swung it to the left and right, slicing off the limbs of the screaming women who surrounded him. Gabe knew the women. There was Fiona. Angela. There was Caitlin, pleading for her life as the man on the horse laughed maniacally, severing her head with a single stroke. All the girls Gabe had used to feed his habit suffered the same fate. Then he saw his mother\u0027s face, contorted with terror. She was crying out to him: \"Gabriel! Save me! It\u0027s Jamie McGregor! He\u0027s killing me, he\u0027s killing us all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe woke up. His sheets were drenched in sweat. He wanted to scream, but his throat was so dry and sore he felt like he\u0027d swallowed a pack of razor blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day one of his fellow prisoners had given him a hit. On the outside, however desperate he got, Gabe never shared needles. Here, he practically wrenched the syringe from the guy\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night before he went back to court for sentencing, he heard two of the remand prisoners talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they send me to the Scrubs, I\u0027m finished. Mike says it\u0027s like a bloody desert in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard the same thing. The new warden used to work for the drug czar. That place is cleaner that a nun\u0027s arsehole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe thought: That\u0027s it. If they send me somewhere where I can\u0027t get drugs, I\u0027ll kill myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike all British prisons, Wormwood Scrubs was overcrowded. The twelve-by-eight-foot cells had been built by the Victorians to house a single inmate. Now the same cramped space was home to three or even four men, each sharing a single lidless toilet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe\u0027s two cell mates did not look up when he entered. Both were black, in their midtwenties and of the same heavyset build as Gabe himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least they don\u0027t look gay, Gabe thought. Then he remembered that it didn\u0027t matter anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time tomorrow he\u0027d be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing silently onto his bunk, he lay back and stared at the ceiling. His original plan had been to hang himself with torn up sheets, but he realized now that that wasn\u0027t going to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese guys might not be what you\u0027d call sociable, but they aren\u0027t gonna sit by and do nothing while I choke myself to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe scanned the room. It was bare. No pictures, no hooks, no curtains, no lamps, no nothing. He started to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell can I use?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect. It\u0027ll hurt, but at least I can do it quickly, while they\u0027re asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe was scared. He did not want to die. But anything was better than cold turkey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike says it\u0027s like a bloody desert in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll do it tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNelson Bradley, the bigger of Gabe\u0027s two cell mates, awoke to the sound of groans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it down, jock. Some of us is trying to kip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few seconds later, Gabe projectile-vomited onto the floor. He started to shake, then convulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNelson Bradley sat up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duane. Wake up, man. Something\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuane Wright turned on his handheld reading lamp, pointing it first at Gabe, then at the pool of vomit. Except it wasn\u0027t vomit. It was blood. On the floor beside Gabe\u0027s bunk was an empty bottle of bleach. The screws must have gotten lazy and left it by the loo after sluicing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit. He\u0027s only gone and necked the bloody Dettol!\" Duane Wright hammered on the cell door. \"Get someone in here. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Gabe woke up in the prison infirmary, the first thing he thought was: Christ alive, my stomach is on fire. The second thing he thought was: I\u0027m still alive. I failed. Depression washed over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a very lucky man,\" the doctor told him. \"A few more minutes before we pumped your stomach and you wouldn\u0027t have made it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yeah, that\u0027s me. Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe psychologists asked him why he\u0027d done it and Gabe told them the truth. There didn\u0027t seem any point in lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bloody prat.\" The chief psychiatrist wrote Gabe a prescription for methadone. \"You think you\u0027re the first addict to walk through these doors? We can help you. There are programs...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Gabe didn\u0027t want programs, and he didn\u0027t want methadone. He wanted enough H to put him out of his misery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was well enough, he was transferred to another wing of the prison. This time he had only one cell mate, an ex-junkie lifer named Billy McGuire. Billy was Irish, a former jockey whose life had careened spectacularly off the rails after he got mixed up with drugs. What began as a few \"innocent\" thrown races and betting scams ended up as internecine gang warfare on the streets of Belfast. An innocent father was killed and Billy was sent down for a minimum twenty-year sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The IRA aren\u0027t what they used to be,\" Billy told Gabe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m confused. What did they use to be? Weren\u0027t they always a bunch of murdering terrorists?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, well, sure they were. But right or wrong, they had a cause. Now it\u0027s all about the money. Money and drugs.\" Billy shook his head in disgust. \"That\u0027s what heroin does to you, lad. Makes you forget who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe couldn\u0027t argue with that. The only trouble was that he wanted to forget who he was: a loser with no qualifications, no skills, and now, with a serious criminal record, no future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought my dad was pathetic, wasting his life in the docks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was twice the man I am. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mistress-of-the-game/page-16.html","bookId":2372,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:56 AM"}
