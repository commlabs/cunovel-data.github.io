Allow us to introduce ourselves…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull Sengar gently lifted Seren’s arms and stepped back from her embrace. She almost sagged forward, not wanting the moment to end, and something cold formed a fist in her stomach. Wincing, she turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seren-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved a hand, then met his eyes once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My brother. My parents.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I cannot pretend that they are not there. That they mean nothing to me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, not trusting herself to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed the dusty room, kicking through rubbish-the place had been stripped of virtually everything, no matter how worthless. They had lain together on their cloaks, watched by spiders in the corners near the ceiling and bats slung in a row beneath a window sill. He picked up the Imass spear from where it leaned against a wall and faced her, offering a faint smile. ‘I can protect myself. And alone, I can move quickly-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go, then,’ she said, and felt anguish at the sudden hardness in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis half-smile held a moment longer, then he nodded and walked into the corridor that led to the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment Seren Pedac followed. ‘Trull-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused at the doorway. ‘I understand, Seren. It’s all right.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo it’s not all right! ‘Please,’ she said, ‘come back.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will. I can do nothing else. You have all there is of me, all that’s left.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then I have all I need,’ she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out, one hand brushing her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerging from the pathway crossing the yard, Trull Sengar, the butt of the spear ringing like the heel of a staff on the cobbles, walked out into the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd set off in the direction of the Eternal Domicile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the shadows of an alley opposite, the Errant watched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I feel much better.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys Beddict smiled across at his brother. ‘You look it. So, Tehol, your manservant is an Elder God.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’ll take anybody I can find.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why are your eyes two different colours now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m not sure, but I think Bugg may be colour blind. Blue and green, green and blue, and as for brown, forget it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaid manservant who happened to be an Elder God walked into the room. ‘I found her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol was on his feet. ‘Where? Is she alive?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, but we’ve work to do… again.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We need to find that man, that Tanal-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No need for that,’ Bugg replied, eyes settling on the corpse of Karos Invictad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys did the same. A two-headed insect was slowly making its way towards the spilled entrails. ‘What in the Errant’s name is that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Bugg hissed through his teeth. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘he’s next.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, in the compound, in the street beyond, a mass of citizens were gathering. Their sound was like an advancing tide. There had been some thunderous explosions, and the unmistakable roar of sorcery, from the direction of the Eternal Domicile, but that had all been short-lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol faced Bugg, ‘Listen to that mob. We going to be able to leave here alive? I’m really not in the mood for a Drowning. Especially my own.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys grunted. ‘You’ve not been paying attention, brother. You’re a hero. They want to see you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am? Why, I never imagined that they had it in them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They didn’t,’ Bugg replied, with a sour expression. ‘Ormly and Rucket have spent a fortune on criers.’ Brys smiled. ‘Humbled, Tehol?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never. Bugg, take me to Janath. Please.’ At that, Brys Beddict’s brows rose. Ah, it is that way, then. Well. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA surviving officer of the city garrison formally surrendered to the Adjunct just inside the west gate, and now Tavore led her occupying army into Letheras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving Fist Blistig in charge of the main force, she assembled the five hundred or so surviving marines, along with Fist Keneb, and her own troop of mounted cavalry, and set out for the imperial palace. This ill-named ‘Eternal Domicile’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinn, riding behind Lostara Yil, had cried out when the dragon had appeared over the city; then had laughed and clapped her hands when at least two cussers and then wave after wave of ferocious sorcery routed the creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Faradan Sort’s advance squads were still active-that much had been made abundantly clear. And they were at the palace, or at least very close. And they were in a mood. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-460.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
