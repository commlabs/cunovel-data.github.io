But lately, thanks to her foul mood over breaking up with bestselling writer Seth Mortensen, she\u0027s been so wicked that Seattle\u0027s uber-demon Jerome, decides to \"outsource\" Georgina to a rival--and have her spy for him in the process. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBeing exiled to the frozen north--okay, Vancouver--and leaving Seth in the cozy clutches of his new girlfriend is unpleasant enough. Then Jerome is kidnapped, and all immortals under his control mysteriously lose their powers.
