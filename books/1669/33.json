This here lot,” he said with a sweep of his arm, “is watched by Charlie over there.” His sweeping gesture ended in a wave at a tiny old negro with at least half a dozen firearms in his immediately visible possession, probably more. “Charlie keeps an eye on things, and if you come back to your ride and it’s in one piece, you tip him whatever you’ve got handy. That’s our buggy—if you want to pile inside, I’ll go settle up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe buggy in question did not come attached to a horse. It had a front-mounted motor that drew a big wheeled contraption that looked cobbled together from a rolling-crawler, a cabriolet, a street rail car, and perhaps a two-man flier. It was a hodgepodge piece of machinery, but it was big enough to take everyone wherever they felt like going, and the stretched-wool surrey top kept the worst of the sun off their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirby Troost again sat beside the captain, and leaned over to mumble, “I was going to complain that this was a conspicuous sort of ride, but looking around at the lot, I am forced to revise my opinion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true. All the vehicles in Charlie’s lot were similarly patchworked and rigged together. It could not be said that they were all of a single type, except that none of them had started out looking like they did at present. The captain detected the occasional small dirigible chassis, boat motor, carriage frame, and dual V-twin engine protruding from a hood … but most of what he spied was made of unidentifiable bits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain said, “I suppose people out here like to improvise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthie replied, “They do it because they must. Many of these—” She cocked a thumb at the next row of buggies. “—are made with things the machine shops throw away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I believe it,” Troost said. “The whole yard looks like a big science experiment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly, Norman Somers returned and climbed up onto the driver’s seat. He pulled a lever, which produced a large black umbrella, and with a popping sound it opened to shade him from the sun so that he was protected as well as his passengers. “All right!” he declared. “Now we can get on our way. And how was your trip from the city?” he asked over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just fine,” said Cly, who was still a bit surprised by how unstealthy this whole production felt. “And might I ask, where exactly will the rest of our trip see us heading?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The rest of your trip?” He gave a narrow chain a hearty yank, and the engine burbled to life, spewing fumes and soft puffy smoke clouds in every direction. Over the diesel rumble he said, “We’re going to take a stroll around a lake, that’s all we’re goin’ do. Maybe we swing by the bayou’s edge and visit with some of the fellas we find there, huh? This your first time in New Orleans?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCly said, “Mine and Fang’s? No. Huey, yes. Troost?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never been here before,” the engineer informed them. “Been around the Gulf a bit. Visited Galveston once, and Houston. Spent some time in Mobile. Somehow, never managed to land myself right here on the delta. Not till now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then, let me welcome you to my home city, and I hope you enjoy your stay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the way was filled with jovial chitchat of a similar nature, and gradually the tall grasses, half-paved roads, and spotty marshes gave way to more fully untamed wet, thick grasslands and roads that were not paved at all. The rumbling buggy drove them bumpily along the rutted dirt paths and beneath gigantic trees that oozed lacy gray curls of Spanish moss and peeling spirals of bark and vines. Though the day was young, the world became darker as they moved farther from the city’s hub; before long, the paths were so overgrown that the long elbows of cypress trees met above them, and the whole road was cast in shadow. Whereas before, they could hear the guttural hums of other buggies and the clattering buzz of the street rail cars moving back and forth between their stops, now the passengers heard nothing but the rollicking grumble of their own engine. And behind it, in shrieks and whispers, they picked up the calls of birds and the croaks of a million frogs, plus the zipping drone of clear-winged insects the size of bats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to the side of the road, among the trees, the land grew less landlike and more swamplike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where the hell are we?” wondered Kirby Troost aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman Somers somehow overheard him, and he replied, “Over there, to the right, see? That’s the Bayou Piquant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s the lake?” Troost asked, louder than he needed to, given the superior quality of Mr. Somers’s hearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the other side of the bayou. No worries, my friends! I get you to Pontchartrain just fine, okay? We’ll be there soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue to his word, Norman pulled off to the side of the road on the far side of what could reasonably be proclaimed a swamp. He dismounted from his seat and said, “One moment, fellas.” And Ruthie did her best not to look put out at being lumped in with the lads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomers disappeared behind a buttonbush slightly taller than himself. Sounds of rustling, heaving, shoving, scraping, and finally the steady tick-tick noise of a chain cranking clattered out from the spot where he’d vanished. He did not immediately emerge again, but a definite shift occurred—some strange motion that at first made so little sense that Cly and his crew members couldn’t be sure what they were seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as the seconds clicked by and the chain pattered on, seams appeared in the landscape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had seemed at first to be a pair of colossal bald cypress trees were lifted, and as if mounted on a track, they slid to the left, taking a significant chunk of the landscape with them. The buttonbush and two smaller members of the same species went jerkily scooting away as well, and the whole scene slipped as easily and thoroughly as the dropcloth background of a play—revealing a pair of large mirrors that served as the juncture of three unnatural lines. Their angles made the trunks, mosses, twigs, and vines repeat indefinitely, creating the perfect illusion of infinite swamp-space as long as they were touching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang let out a low, impressed whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoujin’s mouth hung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirby Troost adjusted his hat and sniffed as if he encountered this kind of thing every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthie gave a small, smug smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Captain Cly said, “I’ll be damned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthie asked in French, “You’ve never seen anything like it, have you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Non,” replied Cly. “Jamais.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she was surprised to hear him reply in kind, she did not give him the satisfaction of showing it. Instead she said, in English this time, “Anderson Worth designed it. He grinds glass lenses for spectacles, and he says that mirrors are not so different, the way they change the light—and the things we see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoujin found his voice and asked, “Where’s Mr. Worth now?” “Is he still here? I’d like to talk to him. I want to know how he made this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will meet him at the camp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore any more questions could be generated, Norman emerged from behind a water oak with a mile-wide smile on his face and said, “This is something else, bien sûr?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It surely is, Mr. Somers!” Houjin exclaimed. “Can I come down there and look at it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now? No, but maybe later if you want, okay? For now, we got to get out of the road and close this gate back up again.” With that, he climbed back onto the buggy’s driving seat and restarted the engine with a yank of its chain. “We can’t go leaving the way open for anyone to come inside. It keeps out the riffraff, because this is one of only two ways through the swamp to the camp.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the other way?” Cly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthie answered. “You’ll find out later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman drove the machine past a certain line, deeper into the swamp than it felt the wheels could possibly turn, given the terrain … and he dismounted again, landing with a splash in a soupy mess that was not half so deep as it looked. He skipped back to a set of controls, large cranks and a locking lever, and as he moved, he walked on water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another illusion?” Cly asked Ruthie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, “Oui.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when Somers returned, still smiling that toothsome grin, he said, “What we do, you see—is we drop down stones into the bayou, and then we build a road on top of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you use to make it?” Houjin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oak boards, mostly. We paint them black, and just like that—” He snapped his fingers. “—they disappear, and for all anyone can tell, the bayou is as deep as the ocean. ’Cept for the cypress knees. Those don’t lie, but they fib.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother mile through what looked like open swamp—without any roads, without any signs, and without any hint of a path—and the way opened to something like a clearing, though it was not very well cleared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might have been better described as a settlement, for such it was, and a well-considered settlement at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTree houses were lifted up above the soft, easily flooding ground. They were mounted six to eight feet up the trunks, and accessible with ladders; they were roofed with native flora and insulated with thick bundles of dried moss, so that when viewed from above, they would not rouse suspicion. Let the dirigibles scope and soar. Nothing at the bayou camp would give any scout a cause for alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge canopies, woven from palmetto leaves and carefully camouflaged, were strung up on willow poles in order to hide two rolling-crawlers either bought or stolen from the Texians. Another canopy covered boxes of munitions and supplies, which were stashed upon a platform that was raised off the bayou floor much like the houses—and yet a third canopy clearly functioned as a meeting place, and possibly a dining hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere beneath the verdant overhangs both natural and man-made, the swamp was a green-black place of beauty and shadow. It was a place of precision and caution, activity and consultation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3/page-33.html","bookId":1669,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 PM"}
