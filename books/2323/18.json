Most of \u0027em come from Minnesota.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The murder rate used to be around a thousand a year. Three a day in the five boroughs. That always seemed high.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"High enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just about double that now.\" He leaned forward. \"But that\u0027s nothing, Matt. Most homicides are husband-wife things, or two friends drinking together and one of \u0027em shoots the other and doesn\u0027t even remember it the next day. That rate never changes. It\u0027s the same as it always was. What\u0027s changed are stranger murders, where the killer and the victim don\u0027t know each other. That\u0027s the rate that shows you how dangerous it is to live somewhere. If you just take the stranger murders, if you throw out the other cases and put the stranger murders on a graph, the line goes up like a rocket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a guy in Queens yesterday with a bow and arrow,\" I said, \"and the guy next door shot him with a.38.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read about that. Something about a dog shitting on the wrong lawn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that wouldn\u0027t be on the chart. That\u0027s two guys who knew each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s all part of the same thing. People keep killing each other. They don\u0027t even stop and think, they just go ahead and do it. You been off the force what, a couple years now? I\u0027ll tell you this much. It\u0027s a lot worse than you remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it. It\u0027s a jungle out there and all the animals are armed. Everybody\u0027s got a gun. You realize the number of people out there walking around with a piece? Your honest citizen, he\u0027s gotta have a gun now for his own protection, so he gets one and somewhere down the line he shoots himself or his wife or the guy next door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guy with the bow and arrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. But who\u0027s gonna tell him not to have a gun?\" He slapped his abdomen, where his service revolver was tucked under his belt. \"I gotta carry this,\" he said. \"It\u0027s regulations. But I\u0027ll tell you, I wouldn\u0027t walk around out there without it. I\u0027d feel naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to think that. You get used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t carry anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it doesn\u0027t bother you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the bar and got fresh drinks, more vodka for him, more ginger ale for me. When I brought them back to the table Durkin drank the whole thing in one long swallow and sighed like a tire going flat. He cupped his hands and lit a cigarette, inhaled deeply, blew out the smoke as if in a hurry to be rid of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This fucking city,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hopeless, he said, and he went on to tell me just how hopeless it was. He rang changes on the whole criminal justice system, from the cops to the courts to the jails, explaining how none of it worked and all of it was getting worse every day. You couldn\u0027t arrest a guy and then you couldn\u0027t convict him and finally you couldn\u0027t keep the son of a bitch in jail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The prisons are overcrowded,\" he said, \"so the judges don\u0027t want to hand out long sentences and the parole boards release people early. And the D.A.s let the guys cop to a reduced charge, they plea bargain good cases down to nothing, because the court calendars are so jammed up and the courts are so careful to protect the rights of the accused that you just about need a photo of the guy committing the crime in order to get a conviction, and then you might get a reversal because you were violating his civil rights by taking his photograph without prior permission. And in the meantime there\u0027s no cops. The department\u0027s got ten thousand men below what it had twelve years ago. Ten thousand fewer cops on the street!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twice as many crooks and a third less cops and you wonder why it\u0027s not safe to walk down the street. You know what it is? The city\u0027s broke. There\u0027s no money for cops, no money to keep the subways running, no money for anything. The whole country\u0027s leaking money, it\u0027s all winding up in Saudi fucking Arabia. All those assholes are trading in their camels for Cadillacs while this country goes down the fucking tubes.\" He stood up. \"My turn to buy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll get them. I\u0027m on expenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, you got a client.\" He sat down. I came back with another round and he said, \"What are you drinking there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just ginger ale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I thought that\u0027s what it looked like. Whyntcha have a real drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sort of cutting back on it these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah?\" The gray eyes focused on me as he registered this information. He picked up his glass and drank about half of it, set it down on the worn wooden table with a thunk. \"You got the right idea,\" he said, and I thought he meant the ginger ale, but he had shifted gears by then. \"Quitting the job. Getting out. You know what I want? All I want is six more years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you got your twenty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I got my twenty,\" he said, \"and then I got my pension, and then I\u0027m fucking well gone. Out of this job and out of this shithole of a city. Florida, Texas, New Mexico, someplace warm and dry and clean. Forget Florida, I heard things about Florida, all the fucking Cubans, they got crime like you get here. Plus they got all the dope coming in there. Those crazy Colombians. You know about the Colombians?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Royal Waldron. \"A fellow I know says they\u0027re all right,\" I said. \"He said you just don\u0027t want to cheat \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet your ass you don\u0027t want to cheat \u0027em. You read about those two girls over in Long Island City? Must have been six, eight months ago. Sisters, one\u0027s twelve and one\u0027s fourteen, and they found \u0027em in the back room of this out-of-business gas station, hands tied behind their backs, each of \u0027em shot twice in the head with a small-caliber weapon, I think a.22, but who gives a shit?\" He drank the rest of his drink. \"Well, it didn\u0027t figure. No sex angle, nothing. It\u0027s an execution, but who executes a couple of teenage sisters?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it clears itself up, because a week later somebody breaks into the house where they lived and shoots their mother. We found her in the kitchen with dinner still cooking on the stove. See, the family\u0027s Colombian, and the father\u0027s in the cocaine business, which is the chief industry down there outside of smuggling emeralds-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought they grew a lot of coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s probably a front. Where was I? The point is, the father turns up dead a month later in whatever\u0027s the capital of Colombia. He crossed somebody and he ran for it, and they wound up getting him in Colombia, but first they killed his kids and his wife. See, the Colombians, they play by a different set of rules. You fuck with them and they don\u0027t just kill you. They wipe out your whole family. Kids, any age, it don\u0027t matter. You got a dog and a cat and some tropical fish, they\u0027re dead too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Mafia was always considerate about family. They\u0027d even make sure to arrange a hit so your family wouldn\u0027t be there to see it happen. Now we got criminals that kill the whole family. Nice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his palms on the table for leverage, hoisted himself to his feet. \"I\u0027m getting this round,\" he announced. \"I don\u0027t need some pimp payin\u0027 for my drinks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at the table he said, \"He\u0027s your client, right? Chance?\" When I failed to respond he said, \"Well, shit, you met with him last night. He wanted to see you, and now you got a client that you won\u0027t say his name. Two and two\u0027s gotta be four, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you how to add it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say I\u0027m right and he\u0027s your client. For the sake of argument. You won\u0027t be givin\u0027 nothin\u0027 away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward. \"He killed her,\" he said. \"So why would he hire you to investigate it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he didn\u0027t kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure he did.\" He dismissed the possibility of Chance\u0027s innocence with a wave of his hand. \"She says she\u0027s quitting him and he says okay and the next day she\u0027s dead. Come on, Matt. What\u0027s that if it\u0027s not cut and dried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we get back to your question. Why\u0027d he hire me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe to take the heat off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027ll figure we\u0027ll figure he must be innocent or he wouldn\u0027t have hired you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s not what you figured at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think he\u0027d really think that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I know what some coked-up spade pimp is gonna think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You figure he\u0027s a cokehead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got to spend it on something, doesn\u0027t he? It\u0027s not gonna go for country-club dues and a box at the charity ball. Lemme ask you something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think there\u0027s a chance in the world he didn\u0027t kill her? Or set her up and hire it done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think there\u0027s a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For one thing, he hired me. And it wasn\u0027t to take the heat off because what heat are we talking about? You already said there wasn\u0027t going to be any heat. You\u0027re planning to clear the case and work on something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wouldn\u0027t necessarily know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let that pass. \"Take it from another angle,\" I suggested. \"Let\u0027s say I never called you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Called me when?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first call I made. Let\u0027s say you didn\u0027t know she was breaking with her pimp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we didn\u0027t get it from you we\u0027d of gotten it somewhere else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where? Kim was dead and Chance wouldn\u0027t volunteer the information. I\u0027m not sure anybody else in the world knew.\" Except for Elaine, but I wasn\u0027t going to bring her into it. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027d have gotten it. Not right off the bat, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how would you have figured the killing then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer right away. He looked down at his near-empty glass, and a couple of vertical frown lines creased his forehead. He said, \"I see what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you have pegged it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way we did before you called. A psycho. You know we\u0027re not supposed to call \u0027em that anymore? There was a departmental directive went out about a year ago. From now on we don\u0027t call \u0027em psychos. From now on it\u0027s EDPs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s an EDP?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emotionally Disturbed Person. That\u0027s what some asshole on Centre Street\u0027s got nothing better to worry about. The whole city\u0027s up to its ass in more nuts than a fruitcake and our first priority is how we refer to them. We don\u0027t want to hurt their feelings. No, I\u0027d figure a psycho, some new version of Jack the Ripper. Calls up a hooker, invites her over, chops her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if it was a psycho?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what happens then. You hope you get lucky with a piece of physical evidence. In this case fingerprints were hopeless, it\u0027s a transient hotel room, there\u0027s a million latents and no place to start with them. Be nice if there was a big bloody fingerprint and you knew it belonged to the killer, but we didn\u0027t have that kind of luck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if you did-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if we did, a single print wouldn\u0027t lead anywhere. Not until we had a suspect. You can\u0027t get a make from Washington on a single print. They keep saying you\u0027re gonna be able to eventually, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve been saying that for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll never happen. Or it will, but I\u0027ll have my six years by then and I\u0027ll be in Arizona. Barring physical evidence that leads somewhere, I guess we\u0027d be waiting for the nut to do it again. You get another couple of cases with the same MO and sooner or later he fucks up and you got him, and then you match him to some latents in the room at the Galaxy and you wind up with a case.\" He drained his glass. \"Then he plea bargains his way to manslaughter and he\u0027s out in three years tops and he does it again, but I don\u0027t want to get started on that again. I honest to Christ don\u0027t want to get started on that again.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-18.html","bookId":2323,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:25 AM"}
