The church bell of St Michael and All Saints, ringing for ten o\u0027clock matins, reached her as she buttoned up her cardigan. She always thought how loud it must be for the Jawandas, living right opposite, and hoped that it struck them as a loud proclamation of Pagford\u0027s adherence to the old ways and traditions of which they, so conspicuously, were not a part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomatically, because it was what she so often did, Shirley walked along the hall, turned into Patricia\u0027s old bedroom and sat down at the computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatricia ought to be here, sleeping on the sofa-bed that Shirley had made up for her. It was a relief not to have to deal with her this morning. Howard, who had still been humming \u0027The Green, Green Grass of Home\u0027 when they arrived at Ambleside in the early hours, had not realized that Patricia was absent until Shirley had had the key in the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where\u0027s Pat?\u0027 he had wheezed, leaning against the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, she was upset that Melly didn\u0027t want to come,\u0027 sighed Shirley. \u0027They had a row or something ... I expect she\u0027s gone home to try and patch things up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Never a dull moment,\u0027 said Howard, bouncing lightly off alternate walls of the narrow hallway as he navigated his way carefully towards the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirley brought up her favourite medical website. When she typed in the first letter of the condition she wished to investigate, the site offered its explanation of EpiPens again, so Shirley swiftly revised their use and content, because she might yet have an opportunity to save their potboy\u0027s life. Next, she carefully typed in \u0027eczema\u0027, and learned, somewhat to her disappointment, that the condition was not infectious, and could not, therefore, be used as an excuse to sack Sukhvinder Jawanda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom sheer force of habit, she then typed in the address of the Pagford Parish Council website, and clicked onto the message board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had grown to recognize at a glance the shape and length of the user name The_Ghost_of_Barry_Fairbrother, just as a besotted lover knows at once the back of their beloved\u0027s head, or the set of their shoulders, or the tilt of their walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single glimpse at the topmost message sufficed: excitement exploded; he had not forsaken her. She had known that Dr Jawanda\u0027s outburst could not go unpunished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAffair of the First Citizen of Pagford\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe read it, but did not, at first, understand: she had been expecting to see Parminder\u0027s name. She read it again, and gave the suffocated gasp of a woman being hit by icy water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Mollison, First Citizen of Pagford, and long-standing resident Maureen Lowe have been more than business partners for many years. It is common knowledge that Maureen holds regular tastings of Howard\u0027s finest salami. The only person who appears not to be in on the secret is Shirley, Howard\u0027s wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompletely motionless in her chair, Shirley thought: it\u0027s not true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could not be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she had once or twice suspected ... had hinted, sometimes, to Howard ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she would not believe it. She could not believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut other people would. They would believe the Ghost. Everybody believed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands were like empty gloves, fumbling and feeble, as she tried, with many a blunder, to remove the message from the site. Every second that it remained there, somebody else might be reading it, believing it, laughing about it, passing it to the local newspaper ... Howard and Maureen, Howard and Maureen ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe message was gone. Shirley sat and stared at the computer monitor, her thoughts scurrying like mice in a glass bowl, trying to escape, but there was no way out, no firm foothold, no way of climbing back to the happy place she had occupied before she saw that dreadful thing, written in public for the world to see ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had laughed at Maureen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she had laughed at Maureen. Howard had laughed at Kenneth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways together: holidays and workdays and weekend excursions ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... only person who appears not to be in on the secret ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... she and Howard did not need sex: separate beds for years, they had a silent understanding ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... holds regular tastings of Howard\u0027s finest salami ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Shirley\u0027s mother was alive in the room with her: cackling and jeering, a glass slopping wine ... Shirley could not bear dirty laughter. She had never been able to bear ribaldry or ridicule.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped up, tripping over the chair legs, and hurried back to the bedroom. Howard was still asleep, lying on his back, making rumbling, porcine noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Howard,\u0027 she said. \u0027Howard.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a whole minute to rouse him. He was confused and disorientated, but as she stood over him, she saw him still as a knight protector who could save her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Howard, the Ghost of Barry Fairbrother\u0027s put up another message.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgruntled at his rude awakening, Howard made a growling groaning noise into the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027About you,\u0027 said Shirley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did very little plain speaking, she and Howard. She had always liked that. But today she was driven to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027About you,\u0027 she repeated, \u0027and Maureen. It says you\u0027ve been - having an affair.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis big hand slid up over his face and he rubbed his eyes. He rubbed them longer, she was convinced, than he needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027 he said, his face shielded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You and Maureen, having an affair.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Where\u0027s he get that from?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo denial, no outrage, no scathing laughter. Merely a cautious request for a source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver afterwards, Shirley would remember this moment as a death; a life truly ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-44.html","bookId":2230,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:10:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:10:31 PM"}
