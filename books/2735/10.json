But I took stupid Bluie and kind of cuddled with him as I fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still had one arm draped over Bluie, in fact, when I awoke just after four in the morning with an apocalyptic pain fingering out from the unreachable center of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI screamed to wake up my parents, and they burst into the room, but there was nothing they could do to dim the supernovae exploding inside my brain, an endless chain of intracranial firecrackers that made me think that I was once and for all going, and I told myself—as I’ve told myself before—that the body shuts down when the pain gets too bad, that consciousness is temporary, that this will pass. But just like always, I didn’t slip away. I was left on the shore with the waves washing over me, unable to drown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad drove, talking on the phone with the hospital, while I lay in the back with my head in Mom’s lap. There was nothing to do: Screaming made it worse. All stimuli made it worse, actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only solution was to try to unmake the world, to make it black and silent and uninhabited again, to return to the moment before the Big Bang, in the beginning when there was the Word, and to live in that vacuous uncreated space alone with the Word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople talk about the courage of cancer patients, and I do not deny that courage. I had been poked and stabbed and poisoned for years, and still I trod on. But make no mistake: In that moment, I would have been very, very happy to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up in the ICU. I could tell I was in the ICU because I didn’t have my own room, and because there was so much beeping, and because I was alone: They don’t let your family stay with you 24/7 in the ICU at Children’s because it’s an infection risk. There was wailing down the hall. Somebody’s kid had died. I was alone. I hit the red call button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nurse came in seconds later. “Hi,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Hazel. I’m Alison, your nurse,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Alison My Nurse,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhereupon I started to feel pretty tired again. But I woke up a bit when my parents came in, crying and kissing my face repeatedly, and I reached up for them and tried to squeeze, but my everything hurt when I squeezed, and Mom and Dad told me that I did not have a brain tumor, but that my headache was caused by poor oxygenation, which was caused by my lungs swimming in fluid, a liter and a half (!!!!) of which had been successfully drained from my chest, which was why I might feel a slight discomfort in my side, where there was, hey look at that, a tube that went from my chest into a plastic bladder half full of liquid that for all the world resembled my dad’s favorite amber ale. Mom told me I was going to go home, that I really was, that I would just have to get this drained every now and again and get back on the BiPAP, this nighttime machine that forces air in and out of my crap lungs. But I’d had a total body PET scan on the first night in the hospital, they told me, and the news was good: no tumor growth. No new tumors. My shoulder pain had been lack-of-oxygen pain. Heart-working-too-hard pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Maria said this morning that she remains optimistic,” Dad said. I liked Dr. Maria, and she didn’t bullshit you, so that felt good to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is just a thing, Hazel,” my mom said. “It’s a thing we can live with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, and then Alison My Nurse kind of politely made them leave. She asked me if I wanted some ice chips, and I nodded, and then she sat at the bed with me and spooned them into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’ve been gone a couple days,” Alison said. “Hmm, what’d you miss . . . A celebrity did drugs. Politicians disagreed. A different celebrity wore a bikini that revealed a bodily imperfection. A team won a sporting event, but another team lost.” I smiled. “You can’t go disappearing on everybody like this, Hazel. You miss too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More?” I asked, nodding toward the white Styrofoam cup in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shouldn’t,” she said, “but I’m a rebel.” She gave me another plastic spoonful of crushed ice. I mumbled a thank-you. Praise God for good nurses. “Getting tired?” she asked. I nodded. “Sleep for a while,” she said. “I’ll try to run interference and give you a couple hours before somebody comes in to check vitals and the like.” I said Thanks again. You say thanks a lot in a hospital. I tried to settle into the bed. “You’re not gonna ask about your boyfriend?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t have one,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, there’s a kid who has hardly left the waiting room since you got here,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He hasn’t seen me like this, has he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Family only.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and sank into an aqueous sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would take me six days to get home, six undays of staring at acoustic ceiling tile and watching television and sleeping and pain and wishing for time to pass. I did not see Augustus or anyone other than my parents. My hair looked like a bird’s nest; my shuffling gait like a dementia patient’s. I felt a little better each day, though: Each sleep ended to reveal a person who seemed a bit more like me. Sleep fights cancer, Regular Dr. Jim said for the thousandth time as he hovered over me one morning surrounded by a coterie of medical students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I am a cancer-fighting machine,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That you are, Hazel. Keep resting, and hopefully we’ll get you home soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Tuesday, they told me I’d go home on Wednesday. On Wednesday, two minimally supervised medical students removed my chest tube, which felt like getting stabbed in reverse and generally didn’t go very well, so they decided I’d have to stay until Thursday. I was beginning to think that I was the subject of some existentialist experiment in permanently delayed gratification when Dr. Maria showed up on Friday morning, sniffed around me for a minute, and told me I was good to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Mom opened her oversize purse to reveal that she’d had my Go Home Clothes with her all along. A nurse came in and took out my IV. I felt untethered even though I still had the oxygen tank to carry around with me. I went into the bathroom, took my first shower in a week, got dressed, and when I got out, I was so tired I had to lie down and get my breath. Mom asked, “Do you want to see Augustus?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess,” I said after a minute. I stood up and shuffled over to one of the molded plastic chairs against the wall, tucking my tank beneath the chair. It wore me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad came back with Augustus a few minutes later. His hair was messy, sweeping down over his forehead. He lit up with a real Augustus Waters Goofy Smile when he saw me, and I couldn’t help but smile back. He sat down in the blue faux-leather recliner next to my chair. He leaned in toward me, seemingly incapable of stifling the smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom and Dad left us alone, which felt awkward. I worked hard to meet his eyes, even though they were the kind of pretty that’s hard to look at. “I missed you,” Augustus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice was smaller than I wanted it to be. “Thanks for not trying to see me when I looked like hell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To be fair, you still look pretty bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “I missed you, too. I just don’t want you to see . . . all this. I just want, like . . . It doesn’t matter. You don’t always get what you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that so?” he asked. “I’d always thought the world was a wish-granting factory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turns out that is not the case,” I said. He was so beautiful. He reached for my hand but I shook my head. “No,” I said quietly. “If we’re gonna hang out, it has to be, like, not that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said. “Well, I have good news and bad news on the wish-granting front.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The bad news is that we obviously can’t go to Amsterdam until you’re better. The Genies will, however, work their famous magic when you’re well enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the good news?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, the good news is that while you were sleeping, Peter Van Houten shared a bit more of his brilliant brain with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for my hand again, but this time to slip into it a heavily folded sheet of stationery on the letterhead of Peter Van Houten, Novelist Emeritus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t read it until I got home, situated in my own huge and empty bed with no chance of medical interruption. It took me forever to decode Van Houten’s sloped, scratchy script.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Mr. Waters,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am in receipt of your electronic mail dated the 14th of April and duly impressed by the Shakespearean complexity of your tragedy. Everyone in this tale has a rock-solid hamartia: hers, that she is so sick; yours, that you are so well. Were she better or you sicker, then the stars would not be so terribly crossed, but it is the nature of stars to cross, and never was Shakespeare more wrong than when he had Cassius note, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves.” Easy enough to say when you’re a Roman nobleman (or Shakespeare!), but there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we’re on the topic of old Will’s insufficiencies, your writing about young Hazel reminds me of the Bard’s Fifty-fifth sonnet, which of course begins, “Not marble, nor the gilded monuments / Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme; / But you shall shine more bright in these contents / Than unswept stone, besmear’d with sluttish time.” (Off topic, but: What a slut time is. She screws everybody.) It’s a fine poem but a deceitful one: We do indeed remember Shakespeare’s powerful rhyme, but what do we remember about the person it commemorates? Nothing. We’re pretty sure he was male; everything else is guesswork. Shakespeare told us precious little of the man whom he entombed in his linguistic sarcophagus. (Witness also that when we talk about literature, we do so in the present tense. When we speak of the dead, we are not so kind.) You do not immortalize the lost by writing about them. Language buries, but does not resurrect. (Full disclosure: I am not the first to make this observation. cf, the MacLeish poem “Not Marble, Nor the Gilded Monuments,” which contains the heroic line “I shall say you will die and none will remember you.”)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI digress, but here’s the rub: The dead are visible only in the terrible lidless eye of memory. The living, thank heaven, retain the ability to surprise and to disappoint. Your Hazel is alive, Waters, and you mustn’t impose your will upon another’s decision, particularly a decision arrived at thoughtfully. She wishes to spare you pain, and you should let her. You may not find young Hazel’s logic persuasive, but I have trod through this vale of tears longer than you, and from where I’m sitting, she’s not the lunatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours truly,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Van Houten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was really written by him. I licked my finger and dabbed the paper and the ink bled a little, so I knew it was really real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom,” I said. I did not say it loudly, but I didn’t have to. She was always waiting. She peeked her head around the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay, sweetie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we call Dr. Maria and ask if international travel would kill me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had a big Cancer Team Meeting a couple days later. Every so often, a bunch of doctors and social workers and physical therapists and whoever else got together around a big table in a conference room and discussed my situation. (Not the Augustus Waters situation or the Amsterdam situation. The cancer situation.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Maria led the meeting. She hugged me when I got there. She was a hugger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a little better, I guess. Sleeping with the BiPAP all night made my lungs feel almost normal, although, then again, I did not really remember lung normality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone got there and made a big show of turning off their pagers and everything so it would be all about me, and then Dr. Maria said, “So the great news is that Phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth, but obviously we’re still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation. So the question is, how should we proceed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she just looked at me, like she was waiting for an answer. “Um,” I said, “I feel like I am not the most qualified person in the room to answer that question?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “Right, I was waiting for Dr. Simons. Dr. Simons?” He was another cancer doctor of some kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, we know from other patients that most tumors eventually evolve a way to grow in spite of Phalanxifor, but if that were the case, we’d see tumor growth on the scans, which we don’t see. So it’s not that yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Simons tapped at the table with his forefinger. “The thought around here is that it’s possible the Phalanxifor is worsening the edema, but we’d face far more serious problems if we discontinued its use.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Maria added, “We don’t really understand the long-term effects of Phalanxifor. Very few people have been on it as long as you have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we’re gonna do nothing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to stay the course,” Dr. Maria said, “but we’ll need to do more to keep that edema from building up.” I felt kind of sick for some reason, like I was going to throw up. I hated Cancer Team Meetings in general, but I hated this one in particular. “Your cancer is not going away, Hazel. But we’ve seen people live with your level of tumor penetration for a long time.” (I did not ask what constituted a long time. I’d made that mistake before.) “I know that coming out of the ICU, it doesn’t feel this way, but this fluid is, at least for the time being, manageable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t I just get like a lung transplant or something?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Maria’s lips shrank into her mouth. “You would not be considered a strong candidate for a transplant, unfortunately,” she said. I understood: No use wasting good lungs on a hopeless case. I nodded, trying not to look like that comment hurt me. My dad started crying a little. I didn’t look over at him, but no one said anything for a long time, so his hiccuping cry was the only sound in the room. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-fault-in-our-stars/page-10.html","bookId":2735,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:56 PM"}
