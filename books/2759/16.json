People can’t understand when they haven’t lived through something like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax stares at me again, then looks down at his hand. He’s got a jagged scar on his thumb in the shape of an X and I stare at it too, wondering about its significance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d be surprised at what people understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes another swig of his beer, then looks at the door in satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look who just walked in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up to find Jared swaggering into the bar. His clothes are sweaty and dirty and it’s obvious that he’s on his lunch break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe orders, then makes his way to the bathroom, presumably to wash up. Pax jerks his head in that direction as he gets up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll watch the door,” he says quietly. “Unless you need me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle. “No, I’ve got it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow Pax to the bathroom. When we get there, he stands to the side and lets me pass. The bartender meets my gaze for just a moment, but then looks away. He’s not going to interfere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn almost euphoric feeling comes over me as I enter the bathroom and look around. The rush of adrenaline pulsing through me right now is an old welcome friend. I haven’t felt like this since I left the Rangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait patiently behind him while the dumbass uses the urinal and then washes his hands. When he turns around at the sink, I bury my fingers in his neck and slam him hard against the bathroom stall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the fuck?” he manages to say, his face registering surprise. And fear. Good, because he should fear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt his words I clench my hand tighter into his trachea, hard enough that he can no longer speak, hard enough that I can feel the cartilage rings in his windpipe. He struggles to swallow against the pads of my fingers and I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quit talking,” I tell him. “And listen. I thought I told you to leave my sister alone. If you keep harassing her, I will fuck you up. If I see you lurking around her house, parked on our street or anywhere within a mile radius of her, I will rip your spine out and feed it to you, bone by bone. You must be too stupid to understand English, because I already told you once. This is twice. I won’t tell you a third time. I don’t like dumbasses. I especially don’t like dumbasses who fuck with my sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerk my knee up into his gut and he grunts, his eyes shooting daggers at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not fucking around. Leave her alone. Got it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and I release him. He immediately rubs at his neck and glares at me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your sister is a lying whore,” he snarls. “I haven’t seen her since the other night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout missing a beat, I slam his face into the lip of the sink. As I yank him back up by the hair, his mouth gushes stringy red saliva.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a fucking prick,” he rasps, spitting out a bloody tooth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “I know. But I warned you what would happen if you called my sister a whore again. Leave her the fuck alone. This is the last time I tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to leave, and Jared lunges at me from behind. I easily grab his arm and throw him over my head and into the wall. He slides to the ground, heaving as he glares up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t fuck with me again,” I tell him. “And don’t fuck with Jacey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you,” he mutters, but I ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk out and leave him on the bathroom floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax looks at me. “Taken care of?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “For now. If he tries anything else, I’ll fuck him up for real. He might be a slow learner, but he’s gotta learn sometime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax shakes his head. “What a dumbass. Did he come at you? I heard the crash.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. From behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax shakes his head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fucking pussy,” he mutters. “He’s a waste of oxygen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focuses on his phone, then looks at me. “Mila just texted me. Her art shop is just down the street. She locked her keys in her car. Do you mind if we stop there on the way back to your car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not,” I tell him. We toss some bills down to cover our lunches and walk back out into the sunshine. Mila’s shop is literally fifty paces from the Bear’s Den and her face lights up when we walk in and she sees her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s standing on a stepladder wearing a paint smock, hanging a painting on a thin steel cord. Pax immediately grumbles and heads for her, holding her legs to steady her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mila, for fuck’s sake. Get the hell off the ladder. You’re going to break your neck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just smiles and shakes her head as she climbs down, ignoring his extended hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pax. Seriously. I’m pregnant, not sick or crippled. It’s OK.” She turns to me, rolling her eyes good-naturedly. “Well, well. Gabriel. It’s so nice to see you again.” She looks from Pax to me curiously. “This is strange. Why are you two together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax grins. “What? Am I so unlikable that I can’t make friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila laughs. “You’re not unlikable. You’re overprotective. And of course you can make friends. You’re charming. You just don’t realize it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waggles his eyebrows. “Oh, I realize it, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila giggles and turns to me. “Thank you, guys, for coming to unlock my car. I have pregnancy brain. I’m so forgetful. No one told me that it would affect my memory too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s Pax’s turn to roll his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Babe, let’s just face it. Your memory was never good. You can blame heartburn on the baby, gas on the baby, weight gain on the baby… but you really can’t blame your bad memory on the poor thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila blushes and slaps at his arm. “Pax, seriously. I don’t have gas. I’m a delicate flower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls his eyes again. “Whatever you say, sweet. You fart with the best of ’em in your sleep. Just sayin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God.” Mila blushes darker. “I’m going to pretend you didn’t just say that in front of someone.” She turns to me again. “Just keep in mind that I’m pregnant, Gabe. It does horrible things to the body.” She grins charmingly. “What brings you back to Angel Bay? I thought you lived in Chicago. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide that small-town people have no compunction whatsoever about asking nosy questions and that I shouldn’t be annoyed. It would be impossible to be annoyed with Mila Tate anyway. She’s as genuine a person as I’ve ever met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m here to stay for a while. Jacey’s having a problem with an ex-boyfriend and I’m here as her security detail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, babe. Jared Markson is still fucking with them, even after that scene at the Hill the other night. I told Gabriel how you aren’t a fan of the guy either,” Pax says as he wraps an arm around his wife. “And I told him why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila raises an eyebrow. “So you told him that you broke Jared’s hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax grins smugly. “Yep. And how I wish I’d broken them both.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That might have made things easier,” I answer wryly. “But whatever. I’ll take care of it. He’ll wish he hadn’t messed with Jacey, I can promise you that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, just be careful,” Mila cautions me, her face concerned. “He used to be a pretty decent guy, back in high school. But he’s got a problem with alcohol and it makes him mean. He’s not worth you getting hurt or into trouble. Trust me on that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at her. “Don’t worry. I won’t get hurt. And I won’t get caught.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax grins at me. “That’s what I’m talking about. If you need help, let me know. I’m still holding a grudge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Mila asks us to not personally get involved with Jared, to call the police instead, the bells over the shop door jingle and we all turn to find Madison walking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks drop-dead gorgeous in a slim skirt that hugs her swaying hips, and knee-high tan boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s smoking hot. And surprised as hell to find me here. She’s got that deer-caught-in-the-headlights look and I have to chuckle at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Madison,” I can’t help but say. “It’s so nice to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m taunting her and she knows it. I can see her face freeze up, then relax as she consciously makes the effort to hide her surprise. It’s an effort that amuses me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s so nice to see you too,” she tells me as she strolls through the shop toward us. “Are you an art collector? Or an artist? My sister sells art and art supplies, so either way, you’re in the right place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I’m just out for lunch with Pax,” I tell her. “And Mila locked her keys in her car, so Pax came to save the day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison glances at Mila. “Pregnancy brain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePax rolls his eyes at me. “It’s a conspiracy. There’s no such thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle as Mila protests, but she abruptly stops and sniffs at the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something smells good.” She continues to sniff toward Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison shakes her head and hands Mila a bag. “You’ve seriously got the nose of a bloodhound now. It’s soup. Tony said to eat it all or he will come over here and spoon-feed it to you. He said it doesn’t matter if your morning sickness is back or not, you’ve still got to eat. And he’s right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila takes it and glances at me. “Tony is the bartender at the Hill. He’s been with us forever and he’s a little protective of my sister and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could say that,” Pax says under his breath. To me he says, “He threatened to break my kneecaps if I ever mistreated Mila.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile because Tony seems like my kind of guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I tell Mila. “I’ve gotta respect that, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila rolls her eyes. “Men.” But she obediently pulls out the Styrofoam container of soup and sniffs at it. “Eating this will be such a hardship.” She grins and spoons some into her mouth. “Very hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila continues eating while Pax goes outside to unlock her SUV. While he does, I can’t help but stare at Madison discreetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never seen such a beautiful woman in person before. She seems like she stepped right out of the pages of a magazine. I can’t tell if she knows how gorgeous she is. Most women know and use it to their every advantage. But Madison doesn’t seem to play that card. She seems to rely on her prickly personality instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately she notices my covert gaze and the corner of her mouth turns up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See something you like?” she asks quietly. I grin back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just noticing the difference between you and your sister. You don’t look a lot alike. Mila’s small and dark, and you’re tall and pale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Madison’s cheeks flush, I realize that I could’ve used more tact. She might be self-conscious about the fact that she’s bigger than her sister. Women are weird about that shit. But honestly, she’s taller. She’s willowy, like a model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No offense,” I tell her. “It was just an observation.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-leave-beautifully-broken-2/page-16.html","bookId":2759,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM"}
