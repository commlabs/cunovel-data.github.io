You don\u0027t need to go through my things.\" But the annoyance lasts only a millisecond because she\u0027s waving back at Iris Palmer and Honor Fraser, while Bentley bows his head, raising his empty glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iris looks fabulous,\" Jamie murmurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you and Mr. Ward know each other, Jamie?\" Bentley asks, leaning over. \"And I\u0027ll leave him alone-I promise. It\u0027s just that I was flirting with Harry Nuttall all evening and then I had my sights set on Robbie but it\u0027s all just been intolerably arid-\" And then, squinting into the crowd, \"Oh my god, who invited Zandra Rhodes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We went to Camden College together, Bentley,\" Jamie says. \"However, I graduated.\" She turns to me. \"Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s right,\" Bentley says. \"Bobby told me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Bobby, baby?\" I\u0027m asking, trying to get her attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBentley suddenly pretends to be looking around, \"busying himself,\" his eyes widening exaggeratedly, and over his shoulder the Japanese guy keeps staring in such a strange way that it\u0027s starting to cause me major discomfort and maybe Jamie notices this too because she leans in, blocking the view, and kisses me softly on the lips and maybe that\u0027s an answer to the Bobby inquiry. While I\u0027m staring into Jamie\u0027s face-her expression saying basically \"hey, it\u0027s okay\"-Bentley dramatically clears his throat and Jamie pulls back, almost shamefully. Again I\u0027m left staring at the Japanese guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Victor,\" Bentley says, staring at me with all the subtlety of a raven, \"what do you think of London?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust, I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How tongue-in-chic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey Joaquin, hey man,\" I call out, waving Joaquin Phoenix over, and he\u0027s dressed in a brown Prada suit and has his hair swept back and he shakes my hand and, recognizing Jamie, kisses her on the cheek and nods briefly at Bentley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how\u0027s this party, man?\" I\u0027m asking. \"Wild, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very... unstuffy,\" Joaquin says, giving the party behind him a cursory look. \"I kind of like it. Better than last night, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah man,\" I\u0027m saying. \"So what are you doing in town, man?\" Joaquin flinches, pretends he didn\u0027t hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing in town, man?\" I ask, staring up into his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, Victor, man,\" Joaquin says. \"I told you last night I\u0027m shooting that John Hughes movie in Hampstead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I say. \"Yeah, yeah, that\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you two see each other last night?\" Bentley asks, suddenly paying close attention, emphasis on all the wrong places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were at Annabel\u0027s,\" Joaquin sighs, scratching at a sideburns \"It was a party for Jarvis Cocker that Catrina Skepper threw.\" He takes a sip from a bottle of Tsingtao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, I guess I\u0027m just like, um, really... jet-lagged,\" I say, forcing a casual grin. \"Yeah, that was such a fun party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was okay.\" Joaquin shrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t stay long because Iris Palmer and Bella Freud whisk him away and Bentley lights another cigarette for Jamie, who\u0027s just staring on a continuous basis in a very hard, weird way at me, as if she\u0027s trying to figure something out. I play along by cocking my head, looking confused, grinning dumbly, fooling around with my own cigarette that Bentley insists on trying to light, shrugging my shoulders guy-like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Joaquin\u0027s harelip is fabulous,\" Bentley intones dramatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you tell him you were at Annabel\u0027s last night?\" Jamie asks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, baby, I was,\" I say. \"Yeah, Jarvis and I hung out and then Joaquin and I, er, hung out some more and... it was just like clowns to the left of us, jokers to the right, y\u0027know, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie nods, inhales on the cigarette, then says, \"But you weren\u0027t there, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how do you know, baby?\" I\u0027m asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I was there, Victor,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause and then, feigning outrage, I ask, \"And you didn\u0027t say hello?
