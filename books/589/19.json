{"id":30701,"no":19,"title":"THE DANCE FOR WATER OR RABBIT\u0027S TRIUMPH","content":"There was a frightful drought. The rivers after a while dried up and even the springs gave no water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The animals wandered around seeking drink, but to no avail. Nowhere was water to be found.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A great gathering of animals was held: Lion, Tiger, Wolf, Jackal, Elephant, all of them came together. What was to be done? That was the question. One had this plan, and another had that; but no plan seemed of value.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Finally one of them suggested: \"Come, let all of us go to the dry river bed and dance; in that way we can tread out the water.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Good! Everyone was satisfied and ready to begin instantly, excepting Rabbit, who said, \"I will not go and dance. All of you are mad to attempt to get water from the ground by dancing.\"[80]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other animals danced and danced, and ultimately danced the water to the surface. How glad they were. Everyone drank as much as he could, but Rabbit did not dance with them. So it was decided that Rabbit should have no water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He laughed at them: \"I will nevertheless drink some of your water.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That evening he proceeded leisurely to the river bed where the dance had been, and drank as much as he wanted. The following morning the animals saw the footprints of Rabbit in the ground, and Rabbit shouted to them: \"Aha! I did have some of the water, and it was most refreshing and tasted fine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Quickly all the animals were called together. What were they to do? How were they to get Rabbit in their hands? All had some means to propose; the one suggested this, and the other that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Finally old Tortoise moved slowly forward, foot by foot: \"I will catch Rabbit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You? How? What do you think of yourself?\" shouted the others in unison.[81]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rub my shell with pitch,[1] and I will go to the edge of the water and lie down. I will then resemble a stone, so that when Rabbit steps on me his feet will stick fast.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes! Yes! That\u0027s good.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And in a one, two, three, Tortoise\u0027s shell was covered with pitch, and foot by foot he moved away to the river. At the edge, close to the water, he lay down and drew his head into his shell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rabbit during the evening came to get a drink. \"Ha!\" he chuckled sarcastically, \"they are, after all, quite decent. Here they have placed a stone, so now I need not unnecessarily wet my feet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rabbit trod with his left foot on the stone, and there it stuck. Tortoise then put his head out. \"Ha! old Tortoise! And it\u0027s you, is it, that\u0027s holding me. But here I still have another foot. I\u0027ll give you a good clout.\" Rabbit gave Tortoise what he said he would with his right fore foot, hard and straight; and there his foot remained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [82]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have yet a hind foot, and with it I\u0027ll kick you.\" Rabbit drove his hind foot down. This also rested on Tortoise where it struck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But still another foot remains, and now I\u0027ll tread you.\" He stamped his foot down, but it stuck like the others.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He used his head to hammer Tortoise, and his tail as a whip, but both met the same fate as his feet, so there he was tight and fast down to the pitch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tortoise now slowly turned himself round and foot by foot started for the other animals, with Rabbit on his back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ha! ha! ha! Rabbit! How does it look now? Insolence does not pay after all,\" shouted the animals.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now advice was sought. What should they do with Rabbit? He certainly must die. But how? One said, \"Behead him\"; another, \"Some severe penalty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rabbit, how are we to kill you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It does not affect me,\" Rabbit said. \"Only a shameful death please do not pronounce.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what is that?\" they all shouted.[83]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To take me by my tail and dash my head against a stone; that I pray and beseech you don\u0027t do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, but just so you\u0027ll die. That is decided.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was decided Rabbit should die by taking him by his tail and dashing his head to pieces against some stone. But who is to do it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lion, because he is the most powerful one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Good! Lion should do it. He stood up, walked to the front, and poor Rabbit was brought to him. Rabbit pleaded and beseeched that he couldn\u0027t die such a miserable death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lion took Rabbit firmly by the tail and swung him around. The white skin slipped off from Rabbit, and there Lion stood with the white bit of skin and hair in his paw. Rabbit was free.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2348/65518.html","bookId":589,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 2:31:50 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 2:31:50 AM"}
