He had been continuously held back during his time in the Windswept Realm, but now was the time to rise to prominence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone who had harmed his mastiff would now die!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt no apprehensions; now that he was going to go on the offensive, he would cause a scene that could topple Heaven and crush the Earth. He had been restraining himself for far too long!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of you, prepare to DIE!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sped through the air with such explosive speed that he left sonic booms behind him. A moment later, he appeared in front of one of the black-robed men, and unleashed a punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat punch was not the Life-Extermination Fist, it was simply an ordinary punch backed by his fleshly body power while in the Allheaven Immortal Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything shook. This black-robed man was an Ancient Realm expert with eight extinguished Soul Lamps. However, he wasn’t qualified to even dodge or block Meng Hao. Before he could even react, the punch landed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, he collapsed, his body shattered, and he was completely dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a single punch to fell an Ancient Realm expert was something that caused all of the other black-robed men to gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, things weren’t over. After delivering the fist strike, Meng Hao flashed through the air to appear in front of another black-robed cultivator, upon whom he unleashed another punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man\u0027s face flickered with a ferocious expression, and he immediately spit a flying sword out of his mouth. Meng Hao snorted coldly and didn’t even pause. He followed through with his punch, destroying the flying sword, which shattered into countless pieces. His shocked opponent could only watch as Meng Hao’s fist slammed into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOOOOOMMMM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao moved like lightning. He teleported seven times in a row, and each time he unleashed one punch. Each punch was followed by miserable shrieks, and the death of a black-robed man. Seven of them exploded into clouds of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis slaughter unfolded in the exact moment in which Meng Hao ascended to the Allheaven Immortal Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surrounding black-robed men were completely astonished, even disbelieving. Although they had come here to pursue Meng Hao specifically, they didn\u0027t actually know very much about him. As of this moment, they were shocked to discover that the person they had been chasing... was actually an indescribably terrifying individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the black-robed men’s faces fell, one of their number let out an enraged roar. “Attack together!” he cried. “Even if he were stronger than he is now, he couldn\u0027t handle all of us at the same time!! Kill him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, the man’s head was flying through the air. In the moment before he died, a look of shock could be seen on his face. From behind his headless corpse, out walked Meng Hao, a sword in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wooden sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said, all of you are going to die today.” His voice was cold, and a murderous aura raged up from his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other black-robed men began to tremble with fear. They might be pursuers of the true Dao, but that didn\u0027t mean that they were completely without fear of death. To see Meng Hao in such a powerful state filled their minds with shock, and they began to fall back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was at this point that the Emperor, who still stood next to Zong Wuya, looked at the men with a red glow flickering in his eyes. He performed a double-handed incantation gesture, and then waved his finger at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, similar red glows could be seen in the eyes of the retreating black-robed men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the true Dao!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the true Dao!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowls rose up like those from enraged beasts. The men had expressions of fanaticism and insanity as they all charged toward Meng Hao, violet light swirling up from them. From the look of it, they were actually burning their life forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a dozen or so who flew through the air in attack, summoning numerous divine abilities. There was a volley of violet lightning, an illusory wild beast, glowing magical treasures, and even a gigantic magical hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling echoed out as over ten different divine abilities and magical items filled the sky and descended toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered with killing intent. He saw the Emperor off in the distance, and snorted coldly. The sword in his hand disappeared, and he took a step forward, turning into a blur that sped through the violet lightning toward the man who unleashed it. He reached out and pushed his finger into the man’s forehead, and then, without so much as a backward glance, spun and headed toward the second man. The swish of a sleeve collapsed the man’s Divine ability, and then Meng Hao reached out and tapped his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved again, toward the third black-robed man, ignoring his magical item, closing in, and then shoulder-butting him hard in the stomach. Then he spun, lashing out with his right foot, which kicked up a huge wind as it slammed into the heads of three successive black-robed enemies. When he appeared next, he was in front of the seventh black-robed cultivator. He punched out, instantly destroying the wild beast created by the man’s Daoist magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed through the creature, smashing his fist into the seventh man’s chest. Then he jerked to the side, using his back to slam into the eighth black-robed man. At the same time, he extended his left hand, within which appeared the bone-tip spear. He hurled it out, sending it stabbing into the forehead of the ninth black-robed man. Then, rumbling sounds could be heard as he waved his sleeve, sending Divine Flame rolling out to engulf four other enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his last movement, he appeared above the head of the fourteenth black-robed man, after which he punched down viciously with his right fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air shook, and a shockwave spread out in all directions, slamming into three nearby black-robed cultivators, causing them to tremble violently and let out miserable shrieks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo describe all of these actions takes some time, but it actually happened in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint. Meng Hao spent no more effort than it would take to turn over his hand, and the nearly twenty surrounding black-robed men were killed in quick succession, completely destroyed. The lingering sounds of the battle continued to echo out over the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen everything went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remaining black-robed men looked completely shocked. They stared at Meng Hao with disbelief and terror, apparently having awoken from their madness and ardor from moments ago. Now, they edged away from him, trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“W-what cultivation base does he have!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could he be so strong? Is he in the Quasi-Dao Realm?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“S-so fast! In a few breaths of time he actually cut down almost twenty of us!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff in the distance, the Emperor’s face fell. When he looked at Meng Hao, he was filled with intense terror. As for Zong Wuya, the hope in his eyes deepened, and at the same time, he looked like he wished he could fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDao-Heaven had a very unsightly expression on his face as he sped backward. He simply didn\u0027t dare to do anything to provoke the current Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Dao-Heaven retreated, Meng Hao’s eyes flickered with coldness. Looking Dao-Heaven\u0027s way, he said, “Now that I\u0027m done warming up, it’s your turn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as their gazes met, Dao-Heaven’s face fell, and he began to retreat with greater speed. He performed a double-handed incantation gesture, causing several illusory beasts to appear that charged toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao shot through the air like an arrow. He slammed through the beasts without even slowing down; they didn\u0027t even leave a scratch on him, and his passage caused them to explode into bits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit!” Dao-Heaven continued to back up, waving his right hand and performing an incantation gesture at the same time. The air rippled as a gigantic portal appeared. From within the portal emerged a black-colored fist that struck out toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Break,” Meng Hao said, eyes glittering as he unleashed the Life-Extermination Fist. When it slammed into the black-colored fist, Heaven and Earth trembled, and the fist exploded. As for the portal, it instantly began to disintegrate. Meng Hao’s fist passed through it and made contact with Dao-Heaven’s finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom could be heard. Blood sprayed out of Dao-Heaven’s mouth, and his finger exploded, sending him tumbling backward like a kite with its string cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the chanting of a curse could be heard from within the portal he had just smashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As a Devil Immortal, I call upon the power of my name to curse your blood--”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao snorted coldly. Without waiting for the curse to be completed, he loosened his fist, reached into the door, and grabbed hold of what was inside: a pitch-black, three-horned, humanoid beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast gaped in shock, then let out a scream of terror and astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Y-y-you... you can actually reach through the portal!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s hand flexed as Divine Flame appeared. The humanoid beast was engulfed, and let out a bloodcurdling scream. In the blink of an eye, it was burned into nothing but ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dao-Heaven!” roared Meng Hao as he shot through the air in pursuit, sending a massive shockwave outwards. He was upon Dao-Heaven in an instant and let loose another punch, and in response, Dao-Heaven shouted and unleashed all of the power of his cultivation base. The full power that came from reaching the Ancient Realm nine times was sent against Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom could be heard, and Dao-Heaven coughed up a mouthful of blood. Meng Hao continued to advance. One punch. Two punches. Three punches!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDao-Heaven continuously coughed up mouthfuls of blood. He roared as his cultivation base surged, then bit the tip of his tongue, spitting out some blood which transformed into an entire sea. It didn\u0027t surge toward Meng Hao, but rather, detonated. The massive unleashing of power enabled Dao-Heaven to separate himself from Meng Hao. He sped backward, face pale, coughing up mouthfuls of blood. Then he stretched his right hand up into the air; the sky flashed, and a murderous aura exploded out. Countless tendrils of black fog appeared, which formed into the shape of a scroll painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao, I only hit your blood mastiff’s shield two times!” he said through gritted teeth. “It didn’t hurt your dog!! We’re both in the Echelon. It’s the weirdos from the Third Nation who tracked you down and hurt your Blood Mastiff, not me!” He pointed an accusatory finger at the Emperor. He had no choice but to speak up and say these things, but at the same time, he gripped the scroll painting in his other hand. The scroll painting was his trump card, and also a powerful threat. He was now regretting his earlier impulsiveness, and wished he hadn’t come looking to cause trouble for Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that, because of Meng Hao gaining enlightenment of the 2,700 Essences, the First Nation’s National Aura Mountain crumbled. A pillar of light rose up, the ninth. A ninth vortex also appeared in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ninth vortex ensured that the lands of the Windswept Realm were now completely stopped in place in the pitch-black void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling filled the lands, and the Emperor was panting anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zong Wuya,” he said, “you can hold back, but the plan will not fail! You must understand the truth of that.” Ignoring Zong Wuya, he extended his right hand, within which appeared an earthenware pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pot was the color of blood, and shockingly, nearly overflowed with boiling blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Countless years of preparation have created hope for the Windswept Realm. It doesn’t matter if I’m viewed as a saint or a sinner, I will lead the Windswept Realm to escape from under the 33 Heavens. The 33 Heavens will become the 34 Heavens, and all cultivators of the Windswept Realm will receive the enlightenment of the true Dao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Over the countless years, it’s impossible to say how many lives have been sacrificed for this cause, for this hope! I will use your blood to help us... activate the Blood World Formation!” Howling, the Emperor viciously smashed the blood pot onto the ground.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1135\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1137\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1136","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
