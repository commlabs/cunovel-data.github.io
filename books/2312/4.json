Three weeks, say, at the conclusion of which a man would probably be eager to kill anybody, stranger or blood kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas Ol’ Sweat ’n’ Leather getting paid for his thousand miles? Was he in the trade? Keller turned the book over in his hands, read the paragraph on the back cover. It did not sound promising. Something about a drifter in the Arizona territory, a saddle tramp, looking to avenge an old Civil War grievance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgive and forget, Keller advised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller, riding substantially more than a thousand miles, albeit on a plane instead of a horse, was similarly charged with killing a man as yet unmet. And he was drifting into the Old West to do it, first to Denver, then to Casper, Wyoming, and finally to a town called Martingale. That had been reason enough to pick up the book, but was it reason enough to read it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave it a try. He read a few pages before they came down the aisle with the drink cart, read a couple more while he sipped his V-8 and ate the salted nuts. Then he evidently dozed off, because the next thing he knew the stewardess was waking him to apologize for not having the fruit plate he’d ordered. He told her it didn’t matter, he’d have the regular dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or there’s a Hindu meal that’s going begging,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind filled with a vision of an airline tray wrapped in one of those saffron-colored robes, extending itself beseechingly and demanding alms. He had the regular dinner instead and ate most of it, except for the mystery meat. He dozed off afterward and didn’t wake up until they were making their descent into Stapleton Airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, he’d tucked the book into the seat pocket in front of him, and he’d intended to let it ride off into the sunset wedged between the air-sickness bag and the plastic card with the emergency exit diagrams. At the last minute he changed his mind and brought the book along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spent an hour on the ground in Denver, another hour in the air flying to Casper. The cheerful young man at the Avis counter had a car reserved for Dale Whitlock. Keller showed him a Connecticut driver’s license and an American Express card and the young man gave him a set of keys and told him to have a nice day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe keys fit a white Chevy Caprice. Cruising north on the interstate, Keller decided he liked everything about the car but its name. There was nothing capricious about his mission. Riding a thousand miles to kill a man you hadn’t met was not something one undertook on a whim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, he thought, he’d be bouncing along on a rutted two-lane blacktop in a Mustang, say, or maybe a Bronco. Even a Pinto sounded like a better match for a rawboned, leathery desperado like Dale Whitlock than a Caprice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was comfortable, though, and he liked the way it handled. And the color was okay. But forget white. As far as he was concerned, the car was a palomino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took about an hour to drive to Martingale, a town of around ten thousand midway between Casper and Sheridan on I-25. Just looking around, you knew right away that you’d left the East Coast far behind. Mountains in the distance, a great expanse of sky overhead. And, right in front of you, frame buildings that could have been false fronts in a Randolph Scott film. A feed store, a western wear emporium, a rundown hotel where you’d expect to find Wild Bill Hickok holding aces and eights at a table in the saloon, or Doc Holliday coughing his lungs out in a bedroom on the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course there were also a couple of supermarkets and gas stations, a two-screen movie house and a Toyota dealership, a Pizza Hut and a Taco John’s, so it wasn’t too hard to keep track of what century you were in. He saw a man walk out of the Taco John’s looking a lot like the young Randolph Scott, from his boots to his Stetson, but he spoiled the illusion by climbing into a pickup truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotel that inspired Hickok-Holliday fantasies was the Martingale, located right in the center of things on the wide main street. Keller imagined himself walking in, slapping a credit card on the counter. Then the desk clerk-Henry Jones always played him in the movie-would say that they didn’t take plastic. “Or p-p-paper either,” he’d say, eyes darting, looking for a place to duck when the shooting started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Keller would set a silver dollar spinning on the counter. “I’ll be here a few days,” he’d announce. “If I have any change coming, buy yourself a new pair of suspenders.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Henry Jones would glance down at his suspenders, to see what was wrong with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, shook his head, and drove to the Holiday Inn near the interstate exit. They had plenty of rooms, and gave him what he asked for, a nonsmoking room on the third floor in the rear. The desk clerk was a woman, very young, very blond, very perky, with nothing about her to remind you of Henry Jones. She said, “Enjoy your stay with us, Mr. Whitlock.” Not stammering, eyes steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unpacked, showered, and went to the window to look at the sunset. It was the sort of sunset a hero would ride off into, leaving a slender blonde to bite back tears while calling after him, “I hope you enjoyed your stay with us, Mr. Whitlock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop it, he told himself. Stay with reality. You’ve flown a couple of thousand miles to kill a man you never met. Just get it done. The sunset can wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t met the man, but he knew his name. Even if he wasn’t sure how to pronounce it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in White Plains had handed Keller an index card with two lines of block capitals hand-printed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lyman Crowder,” he read, as if it rhymed withlouder. “Or should that be Crowder?” As if it rhymed withloader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shrug in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Martingale, WY,” Keller went on. “Why indeed? And where, besides Wyoming? Is Martingale near anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother shrug, accompanied by a photograph. Or a part of one; it had apparently been cropped from a larger photo, and showed the upper half of a middle-aged man who looked to have spent a lot of time outdoors. A big man, too. Keller wasn’t sure how he knew that. You couldn’t see the man’s legs and there was nothing else in the photo to give you an idea of scale. But somehow he could tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain a shrug, but one that conveyed information to Keller. If the other man didn’t know what Crowder had done, he had evidently done it to somebody else. Which meant the man in White Plains had no personal interest in the matter. It was strictly business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So who’s the client?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shake of the head. Meaning that he didn’t know who was picking up the tab, or that he knew but wasn’t saying? Hard to tell. The man in White Plains was a man of few words and master of none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the time frame?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The time frame,” the man said, evidently enjoying the phrase. “No big hurry. One week, two weeks.” He leaned forward, patted Keller on the knee. “Take your time,” he said. “Enjoy yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way out he’d shown the index card to Dot. He said, “How would you pronounce this? As incrow or as incrowd?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDot shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus,” he said, “you’re as bad as he is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nobody’s as bad as he is,” Dot said. “Keller, what difference does it make how Lyman pronounces his last name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wondered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, stick around for the funeral,” she suggested. “See what the minister says.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a big help,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one Crowder listed in the Martingale phone book. Lyman Crowder, with a telephone number but no address. About a third of the book’s listings were like that. Keller wondered why. Did these people assume everybody knew where they lived in a town this size? Or were they saddle tramps with cellular phones and no fixed abode?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably rural, he decided. Lived out of town on some unnamed road, picked up their mail at the post office, so why list an address in the phone book?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. His quarry lived in the boondocks outside of a town that wasn’t big enough to have boondocks, and Keller didn’t even have an address for him. He had a phone number, but what good was that? What was he supposed to do, call him up and ask directions? “Hi, this here’s Dale Whitlock, we haven’t met, but I just rode a thousand miles and-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove around and ate at a downtown café called the Singletree. It was housed in a weathered frame building just down the street from the Martingale Hotel. The café’s name was spelled out in rope nailed to the vertical clapboards. For Keller the name brought a vision of a solitary pine or oak set out in the middle of vast grasslands, a landmark for herdsmen, a rare bit of shade from the relentless sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the menu, he learned that a singletree was some kind of apparatus used in hitching up a horse, or a team of horses. It was a little unclear to him just what it was or how it functioned, but it certainly didn’t spread its branches in the middle of the prairie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller had the special, a chicken-fried steak and some French fries that came smothered in gravy. He was hungry enough to eat everything in spite of the way it tasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t want to live here, he told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a relief to know this. Driving around Martingale, Keller had found himself reminded of Roseburg, Oregon. Roseburg was larger, with none of the Old West feel of Martingale, but they were both small western towns of a sort Keller rarely got to. In Roseburg Keller had allowed his imagination to get away from him for a little while, and he wouldn’t want to let that happen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, crossing the threshold of the Singletree, he had been unable to avoid remembering the little Mexican place in Roseburg. If the food and service here turned out to be on that level-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForget it. He was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his meal Keller strode out through the bat-wing doors and walked up one side of the street and down the other. It seemed to him that there was something unusual about the way he was walking, that his gait was that of a man who had just climbed down from a horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller had been on a horse once in his life, and he couldn’t remember how he’d walked after he got off of it. So this walk he was doing now wasn’t coming from his own past. It must have been something he’d learned unconsciously from movies and TV, a synthesis of all those riders of the purple sage and the silver screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo need to worry about yearning to settle here, he knew now. Because his fantasy now was not of someone settling in but passing through, the saddle tramp, the shootist, the flint-eyed loner who does his business and moves on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a good fantasy, he decided. You wouldn’t get into any trouble with a fantasy like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in his room, Keller tried the book again but couldn’t keep his mind on what he was reading. He turned on the TV and worked his way through the channels, using the remote control bolted to the nightstand. Westerns, he decided, were like cops and cabs, never around when you wanted them. It seemed to him that he never made a trip around the cable circuit without running into John Wayne or Randolph Scott or Joel McCrea or a rerun ofGunsmoke orRawhide or one of those spaghetti westerns with Eastwood or Lee Van Cleef. Or the great villains-Jack Elam, Strother Martin, the young Lee Marvin inThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-4.html","bookId":2312,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM"}
