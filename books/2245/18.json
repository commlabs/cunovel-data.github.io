The whole ride back, Conner thought about the Joe DiMaggio card, where it might be. It hadn\u0027t been aboard the Jenny, in the binder with the rest of Folger\u0027s collection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few things Conner wanted to see for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove to Folger\u0027s torched strip mall on Davis Highway. The place was a muddy, scorched mess, halfhearted, yellow police tape draped around the scene. It looked a shambles, but not particularly hazardous. He parked on the side in the shadows, stepped over the police tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was still something of a roof left in places, held up by ash-black beams. Conner couldn\u0027t immediately tell which store was which, but he found a half-burned, life-size cardboard stand-up of Spider-Man and figured he\u0027d found the comic-book shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner poked through the rubble, but there wasn\u0027t much left to see. Burned and melted shelves and display cases. He estimated where the cash register might have been and started kicking through the ash. It was dirty work, and Conner felt suddenly like he was wasting his time. But he quickly found the outline of a panel in the floor. It was caked with grime and ash, and he had to work it back and forth to slide the panel back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the vague notion that he\u0027d check the safe tonight, simply see if he could find the thing, and if it was undamaged, he would come back the next day with some heavy equipment and drill it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner felt simultaneously excited and silly. Secret safes were the nonsense of Nancy Drew treasure hunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally worked the panel all the way back. The safe underneath was unscorched, and presumably whatever might be inside was still undamaged. Conner had mulled the possibilities, thought it possible Folger had left the DiMaggio card in the hidden safe with plans to come back and pick it up later. Conner didn\u0027t know much about safes but figured a good one should survive a fire. He examined its surface, a combination lock and a handle. He reached out, turned the handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elation of his good luck quickly segued into discouragement with the realization nothing of value would be within. Otherwise, Folger would have locked it. He might as well have a look. Conner didn\u0027t currently have any better ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached in, came out with a copy of X-Men. A yellow Post-it note stuck to the plastic covering said #172 First Byrne. Conner had no idea if this was significant. He put his hand back in the safe. The sum total contents consisted of four Star Wars action figures (Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, and something called a Jawa) all in the original packaging, a Rubik\u0027s Cube (unsolved), a videotape labeled Space: 1999 Bloopers, and a red lace brassiere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo DiMaggio card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn.\" But he wasn\u0027t really surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been difficult enough to find a thirty-six-foot sailboat. Something as small as a baseball card could be hidden in any of a million places. He reconsidered Jenny Folger. Conner had to admit, without her he\u0027d never have found the sailboat. After all, she\u0027d been married to the guy, knew his habits. If he told her about the card, got her thinking, she might be able to come up with something useful. He toyed with the idea of calling her, but decided the long, quiet drive across the Bay Bridge might help him think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed the Plymouth toward Mobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner arrived at Jenny\u0027s complex. He didn\u0027t immediately go up to her apartment, sat in the car a moment, leaning on the steering wheel. There had been something mildly disappointing and fatigued about their parting. He\u0027d honestly not expected nor wished to see her again and assumed she felt the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner would try to keep it all business. Jenny Folger would understand that, appreciate it. There was a mercenary quality about her, nothing cruel, but something born of necessity and survival. He\u0027d appeal to her righteous sense of greed and revenge, and maybe she\u0027d know something useful about Teddy\u0027s prize baseball card just as she\u0027d known about the sailboat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, went to her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he knocked, the door creaked open, darkness within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny?\" He pushed the door open the rest of the way, took a tentative step inside. \"It\u0027s Conner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happened sometimes. People leave in a hurry, late for work or a date, and they forget to lock the door. Leave it wide open sometimes. Even as Conner thought this, he knew on a gut level that this wasn\u0027t one of those times, that he wouldn\u0027t find anything but bad news in Jenny Folger\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found her in the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay faceup, blond hair down over her face. Her right arm and leg hung over the side of the tub. She wore matching green bra and panties. She was so obviously dead. Conner looked at her from the doorway, unwilling to move closer. He didn\u0027t want to see what had happened, couldn\u0027t stomach a slit throat or a bullet hole or a caved-in skull, whatever had done her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the life gone out of her, she suddenly seemed older, skin rubbery and fake-looking like the other bodies he\u0027d seen recently. Too many bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho\u0027s next? Me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConner recalled their sudden sex in the cheap riverfront motel. She\u0027d been so heated and animated and desperate. It seemed impossible that this was all that was left of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the apartment. Closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToshi stood at the bow of the small, rented speedboat. Itchi piloted. The boat motored slowly along the shore, the night deep and dark, stars fuzzy behind low clouds. Toshi fished around with a handheld spotlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter ten minutes of violent coaxing, the Folger woman had offered precise directions to where Conner Samson had hidden the sailboat. She\u0027d eagerly spilled the information, hoping it would purchase her life. No sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Toshi, one patch of steaming swamp looked much like another, so he and Itchi had been searching for nearly two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glint of white among the cypress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToshi swung the spotlight back like a pistol, aimed down a narrow inlet that at first seemed too small to accommodate a large sailboat. \"Back up. Turn us around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey swung the speedboat into the inlet, and the Electric Jenny\u0027s stern hove into view. Toshi ordered Itchi to cut the engine. They drifted in silence toward the Jenny, bumped the hull gently. They leapt aboard with lethal grace, intending to move through the boat quickly, subduing Samson or whoever else might be aboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToshi ordered the boat searched. When Itchi couldn\u0027t find the DiMaggio card, Toshi flipped open his switchblade, tore into the cushions and the bedding. No sign of the card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToshi had not really expected to find it. His feeling was that Samson had the card. Rather than search further, Toshi would much rather find Samson and make him tell where it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Itchi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hai.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay here,\" ordered Toshi. \"Lie in wait for Samson in case he should return. You know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It shall be done,\" Itchi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not let him throw you off the boat this time,\" Toshi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eItchi reddened but kept silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember to restrain yourself,\" Toshi said. \"Samson will die soon enough, but we must make him talk first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoellen Becker had made half a bottle of Jack Daniel\u0027s disappear a little at a time with a shot glass shaped like a shotgun shell. The evening had started with her chewing through Folger\u0027s insurance file. She read and reread every line, looking for some hint. Anything. Did he have another property, an office someplace? A safety-deposit box? Folger had no friends, no living relatives. And Folger himself wasn\u0027t talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was useless. Hell, maybe the card had burned with the shop. More likely, Joellen admitted to herself, she\u0027d simply come up empty. She had not found the card, nor had she any leads where it might be. She hadn\u0027t found Folger in time to ask him any useful questions. Then she\u0027d called Samson twenty-five times. No answer. He was a bust too. Useless. All useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe twirled her father\u0027s Old West-style six-shooters. She always brought them out when drinking, not often but once in a great while. The general had been a George Patton worshipper. The pistols were so corny, gleaming nickel, ivory handles, but Becker had to admire the craftsmanship. This is what washed-up spooks did, she imagined. Drink into oblivion, play with guns and wonder where everything went wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered that day she resigned from the NSA. It had been a bad day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood at the foot of his bed, watched him while he slept, a cigarette dangling unlit from her lips. She would wait until he awoke. There was no hurry and nowhere to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father, the retired three-star army general, looked sallow and shrunken, dark circles around his hollow eyes, face pinched. The cancer had eaten its way through most of the major organs, spreading suddenly and rapidly and without mercy. In six short months, Joellen had watched him deflate, this man who\u0027d once been like some ferocious god.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe television above her head blared a cable channel Western. She reached up, flipped it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man\u0027s eyes flickered open. \"I was watching that.\" He produced the remote from beneath the bedcovers, turned the film back on. \"It\u0027s John Wayne. The Searchers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least turn it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thumbed the remote again, cut the volume to almost nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifted in bed, only slightly, but it looked like his bones would shatter, like they couldn\u0027t possibly support the weight of his slack skin. He grunted, moved his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoellen did not offer to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally found a comfortable position, sighed, exhausted, and closed his eyes. For a moment, Joellen thought he\u0027d fallen back to sleep. But he opened his eyes again, and said, \"I hear you got fired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just came from the meeting,\" she said, plainly irritated. \"How did you find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still know people in this town,\" he said. \"A few who still respect me enough to keep me in the loop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already know, then.\" She shrugged. \"There it is.\" She took the lighter out of her purse, almost lit her cigarette but remembered she was in a hospital. She put away the lighter, didn\u0027t know what to do with her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will you do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go someplace,\" she said. \"Get my head together. Figure things out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know someone at Langley,\" the general said. \"And there\u0027s always consulting. I have a few names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need any of your names, Father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause, then he said, \"I suppose you don\u0027t. Or, if you did, you wouldn\u0027t say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough.\" His eyes shifted to the small table under the window. \"Your inheritance is over there.\" He closed his eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the table, opened the highly polished wooden box. Two pistols inside, spotless, nickel six-shooters. In their hometown library, there was a picture of her father in Korea wearing the pistols. To the best of Joellen\u0027s knowledge, the revolvers had never been fired in combat. Her father was simply a ridiculous show-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The brilliance of John Wayne in The Searchers,\" her father said, eyes still closed, \"is that he clings to his quest even when it\u0027s obvious his quest is doomed. What else is there for him to do? He has come home in defeat, a Confederate who\u0027s refused to surrender his sword. He has no cause. What else can he do but invent a new one for himself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you telling me, Father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I\u0027m just telling you about a good film. His quest becomes his life.\" He opened his eyes, looked at his daughter. \"Goals are nothing. That you pursue them is everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, Joellen doubted that was what John Ford had in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m leaving the house and the money to Eliot.\" Joellen\u0027s brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s yours,\" Joellen said. \"Do as you wish.\" You rotten old bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin, weak smile spread on his face. \"I know what you\u0027re thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking that you\u0027ve complained for years about Eliot wasting his life as a painter and wasting your money studying in Paris and Rome where he was doing a lot more screwing and drinking than painting. So naturally you want to reward him with a big inheritance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand,\" he said. \"Eliot doesn\u0027t stand a chance. The world would eat him alive. It\u0027s the only way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" She put her hand on the rail of the hospital bed, touched his thin arm with a finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to die now,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t leave, please.\" He put a frail hand over hers. \"I might fall asleep again, but don\u0027t go. I don\u0027t know why, but I hate the thought that I\u0027d die and nobody would be here. The doctor gives me fifty-fifty on lasting the night. I\u0027m full of narcotics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t go anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see your mother soon,\" the general said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like the pistols, Father. I\u0027ll keep them. If I move somewhere with a fireplace, I\u0027ll put them on the mantel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember that dog we had in Virginia? What was it? When you were a teenager. Some kind of terrier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a Jack Russell terrier,\" Joellen told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I remember. That was a damn fine dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd five minutes later he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoellen understood she was drunk, pushed the bottle away, and it tipped over, spilled the remainder of its contents across the table. She left the mess. To hell with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed herself away from the table, stood on rubbery legs. She made it as far as the couch and fell asleep with her clothes on. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze/page-18.html","bookId":2245,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:32 PM"}
