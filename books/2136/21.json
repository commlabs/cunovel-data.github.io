All I\u0027m asking is for you to let me see my kids - our kids - a little more. I only see them, what, every other week for a few hours. Supervised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You also happen to own a sleazy strip club and date even sleazier strippers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" said Allison, looking up from her smart phone. \"I used to be a stripper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered the mouthpiece and lowered my voice. \"Were you sleazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleazy, no. Good, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and uncovered the phone. \"So, you see my point, then,\" I said to Danny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see that you\u0027re a controlling bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As always, nice talking to you, Danny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, wait!\" he screeched as I made a move to hang up. \"Don\u0027t hang up. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t hang up, but I didn\u0027t say anything either. I looked out across the outdoor deck. So beautiful. This could have been a resort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You there, Sam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, I didn\u0027t mean that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I did, but it\u0027s only because you\u0027re being a little unreasonable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny, I\u0027m going to say this with all the sincerity I can. I really don\u0027t give a shit what you think about me, but I do know one thing, and one thing only: until you sell that sleazebag of a strip club you own and quit bringing your skank-whores home, you will never, ever be alone with my kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone from a nearby table looked over at me. Oops. I might have raised my voice a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t tell me when I can or cannot see my kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can and I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m giving up the law firm, Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. \"To run the strip club full time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a lot of money, Sam. Easy money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are choosing easy money over your kids. Strippers over your kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have it wrong, Sam. I don\u0027t date the girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust hearing the word \"girls\" made my skin crawl. \"No,\" I said, \"you just fuck them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t tell me what to do, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho to see and who not to see. How to live my life. How to make money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I can tell you this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will never, ever be alone with my kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I clicked off the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmphatically. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-21.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
