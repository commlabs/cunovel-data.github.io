How many of Bruenor\u0027s people would have died? How many of your own, who now flourish in the Glimmerwood in relative peace? And in the end, my friend, we do not know who would have prevailed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And yet here we stand, a century beyond that ceremony, and can either of us say with absolute truth that Bruenor chose correctly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, Drizzt knew, to his ultimate frustration. He reminded himself of the roads he had walked over the last decades, of the ruins he had seen, of the devastation of the Spellplague. But in the North, instead of that, because of a brave dwarf named Bruenor Battlehammer, who threw off his baser instincts, his hatred and his hunger for revenge, in light of what he believed to be the greater good, the region had known a century and more of relative peace. More peace than ever it had known before. And that while the world around had fallen to shadow and despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHralien started away, but Drizzt called after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both supported Bruenor on that day when he signed the Treaty of Garumn\u0027s Gorge,\" he reminded. Hralien nodded as he turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As we both fought alongside Bruenor on the day he chose to stand beside Obould against Grguch and the old ways of Gruumsh,\" Drizzt added. \"If I recall that day correctly, a younger Hralien was so taken by the moment that he chose to place his trust in a dark elf, though that same drow had marched to war against Hralien\u0027s people only months before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHralien laughed and held up his hands in surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what resulted from that trust?\" Drizzt asked. \"How fares Tos\u0027un Armgo, husband of Sinnafain, father of Teirflin and Doum\u0027wielle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will ask him when I return to the Moonwood,\" the beaten Hralien replied, but he managed to get in the last arrow when he directed Drizzt\u0027s gaze to the prisoners they had taken that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt conceded the point with a polite nod. It wasn\u0027t over. It wasn\u0027t decided. The world rolled on around him, the sand shifted under his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached down to pet Guenhwyvar, needing to feel the comfort of his panther friend, the one constant in his surprising life, the one great hope along his ever-winding road. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-orc-king-transitions-1/page-37.html","bookId":2187,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:14 PM"}
