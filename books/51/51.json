Then she passed the tape measure about her waist. Twenty inches! Shegroaned aloud. That was what having babies did to your figure! Her waist was a large as AuntPitty’s, as large as Mammy’s.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Pull them tighter, Lou. See if you can’t make it eighteen and a half inches or I can’t get into anyof my dresses.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It’ll bust de strings,” said Lou. “Yo’ wais’ jes’ done got bigger, Miss Scarlett, an’ dar ain’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　nuthin’ ter do ‘bout it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“There is something to do about it,” thought Scarlett as she ripped savagely at the seams of herdress to let out the necessary inches. “I just won’t have any more babies.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Of course, Bonnie was pretty and a credit to her and Rhett adored the child, but she would nothave another baby. Just how she would manage this she did not know, for she couldn’t handleRhett as she had Frank. Rhett wasn’t afraid of her. It would probably be difficult with Rhett actingso foolishly about Bonnie and probably wanting a son next year, for all that he said he’d drownany boy she gave him. Well, she wouldn’t give him a boy or girl either. Three children wereenough for any woman to have.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　When Lou had stitched up the ripped seams, pressed them smooth and buttoned Scarlett into thedress, she called the carriage and Scarlett set out for the lumber yard. Her spirits rose as she wentand she forgot about her waist line, for she was going to meet Ashley at the yard to go over thebooks with him. And, if she was lucky, she might see him alone. She hadn’t seen him since longbefore Bonnie was born. She hadn’t wanted to see him at all when she was so obviously pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　And she had missed the daily contact with him, even if there was always someone around. She had missed the importance and activity of her lumber business while she was immured. Of course, shedid not have to work now. She could easily sell the mills and invest the money for Wade and Ella.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But that would mean she would hardly ever see Ashley, except in a formal social way with crowdsof people around. And working by Ashley’s side was her greatest pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　When she drove up to the yard she saw with interest how high the piles of lumber were and howmany customers were standing among them, talking to Hugh Elsing. And there were six muleteams and wagons being loaded by the negro drivers. Six teams, she thought, with pride. And I didall this by myself!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Ashley came to the door of the little office, his eyes joyful with the pleasure of seeing her againand he handed her out of her carriage and into the office as if she were a queen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But some of her pleasure was dimmed when she went over the books of his null and comparedthem with Johnnie Gallegher’s books. Ashley had barely made expenses and Johnnie had aremarkable sum to his credit. She forbore to say anything as she looked at the two sheets butAshley read her face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Scarlett, I’m sorry. All I can say is that I wish you’d let me hire free darkies instead of usingconvicts. I believe I could do better.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Darkies! Why, their pay would break us. Convicts are dirt cheap. If Johnnie can make thismuch with them—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Ashley’s eyes went over her shoulder, looking at something she could not see, and the glad lightwent out of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I can’t work convicts like Johnnie Gallegher. I can’t drive men.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“God’s nightgown! Johnnie’s a wonder at it. Ashley, you are just too soft hearted. You ought toget more work out of them. Johnnie told me that any time a malingerer wanted to get out of workhe told you he was sick and you gave him a day off. Good Lord, Ashley! That’s no way to makemoney. A couple of licks will cure most any sickness short of a broken leg—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Scarlett! Scarlett! Stop! I can’t bear to hear you talk that way,” cried Ashley, his eyes comingback to her with a fierceness that stopped her short. “Don’t you realize that they are men—some ofthem sick, underfed, miserable and— Oh, my dear, I can’t bear to see the way he has brutalizedyou, you who were always so sweet—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Who has whatted me?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’ve got to say it and I haven’t any right. But I’ve got to say it Your—Rhett Butler. Everythinghe touches he poisons. And he has taken you who were so sweet and generous and gentle, for allyour spirited ways, and he has done this to you—hardened you, brutalized you by his contact.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh,” breathed Scarlett, guilt struggling with joy that Ashley should feel so deeply about her,should still think her sweet. Thank God, he thought Rhett to blame for her penny-pinching ways.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Of course, Rhett had nothing to do with it and the guilt was hers but, after all, another black markon Rhett could do him no harm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“If it were any other man in the world, I wouldn’t care so much—but Rhett Butler! I’ve seenwhat he’s done to you. Without your realizing it, he’s twisted your thoughts into the same hard path his own run in. Oh, yes, I know I shouldn’t say this— He saved my life and I am grateful but Iwish to God it had been any other man but him! And I haven’t the right to talk to you like—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh, Ashley, you have the right—no one else has!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I tell you I can’t bear it, seeing your fineness coarsened by him, knowing that your beauty andyour charm are in the keeping of a man who— When I think of him touching you, I—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He’s going to kiss me!” thought Scarlett ecstatically. “And it won’t be my fault!” She swayedtoward him. But he drew back suddenly, as if realizing he had said too much—said things he neverintended to say.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I apologize most humbly, Scarlett I—I’ve been insinuating that your husband is not agentleman and my own words have proved that I’m not one. No one has a right to criticize ahusband to a wife. I haven’t any excuse except—except—” He faltered and his face twisted. Shewaited breathless.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I haven’t any excuse at all.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　All the way home in the carriage Scarlett’s mind raced. No excuse at all except—except that heloved her! And the thought of her lying in Rhett’s arms roused a fury in him that she did not thinkpossible. Well, she could understand that. If it wasn’t for the knowledge that his relations withMelanie were, necessarily, those of brother and sister, her own life would be a torment And Rhett’sembraces coarsened her, brutalized her! Well, if Ashley thought that, she could do very wellwithout those embraces. She thought how sweet and romantic it would be for them both to bephysically true to each other, even though married to other people. The idea possessed herimagination and she took pleasure in it. And then, too, there was the practical side of it. It wouldmean that she would not have to have any more children.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　When she reached home and dismissed the carriage, some of the exaltation which had filled herat Ashley’s words began to fade as she faced the prospect of telling Rhett that she wanted separatebedrooms and all which that implied. It would be difficult. Moreover, how could she tell Ashleythat she had denied herself to Rhett, because of his wishes? What earthly good was a sacrifice if noone knew about it? What a burden modesty and delicacy were! If she could only talk to Ashley asfrankly as she could to Rhett! Well, no matter. She’d insinuate the truth to Ashley somehow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She went up the stairs and, opening the nursery door, found Rhett sitting beside Bonnie’s cribwith Ella upon his lap and Wade displaying the contents of his pocket to him. What a blessingRhett liked children and made much of them! Some stepfathers were so bitter about children offormer marriages.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I want to talk to you,” she said and passed on into their bedroom. Better have this over nowwhile her determination not to have any more children was hot within her and while Ashley’s lovewas giving her strength.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Rhett,” she said abruptly when he had closed the bedroom door behind him, “I’ve decided thatI don’t want any more children.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　If he was startled at her unexpected statement he did not show it. He lounged to a chair andsitting down, tilted it back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“My pet, as I told you before Bonnie was born, it is immaterial to me whether you have onechild or twenty.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　How perverse of him to evade the issue so neatly, as if not caring whether children came hadanything to do with their actual arrival.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I think three are enough. I don’t intend to have one every year.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Three seems an adequate number.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You know very well—” she began, embarrassment making her cheeks red. “You know what Imean?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I do. Do you realize that I can divorce you for refusing me my marital rights?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You are just low enough to think of something like that,” she cried, annoyed that nothing wasgoing as she planned it. “If you had any chivalry you’d—you’d be nice like— Well, look at AshleyWilkes.’ Melanie can’t have any children and he—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Quite the little gentleman, Ashley,” said Rhett and his eyes began to gleam oddly. “Pray go onwith your discourse.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Scarlett choked, for her discourse was at its end and she had nothing more to say. Now she sawhow foolish had been her hope of amicably settling so important a matter, especially with a selfishswine like Rhett.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You’ve been to the lumber office this afternoon, haven’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What has that to do with it?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You like dogs, don’t you, Scarlett? Do you prefer them in kennels or mangers?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The allusion was lost on her as the tide of her anger and disappointment rose.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He got lightly to his feet and coming to her put his hand under her chin and jerked her face up tohis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What a child you are! You have lived with three men and still know nothing of men’s natures.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　You seem to think they are like old ladies past the change of life.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He pinched her chin playfully and his hand dropped away from her. One black eyebrow went upas he bent a cool long look on her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Scarlett, understand this. If you and your bed still held any charms for me, no looks and noentreaties could keep me away. And I would have no sense of shame for anything I did, for I madea bargain with you—a bargain which I have kept and you are now breaking. Keep your chaste bed,my dear.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Do you mean to tell me,” cried Scarlett indignantly, “that you don’t care—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You have tired of me, haven’t you? Well, men tire more easily than women. Keep your sanctity,Scarlett. It will work no hardship on me. It doesn’t matter,” he shrugged and grinned. “Fortunatelythe world is full of beds—and most of the beds are full of women.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You mean you’d actually be so—”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“My dear innocent! But, of course. It’s a wonder I haven’t strayed long ere this. I never heldfidelity to be a virtue.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I shall lock my door every night!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Why bother? If I wanted you, no lock would keep me out.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He turned, as though the subject were closed, and left the room. Scarlett heard him going backto the nursery where he was welcomed by the children. She sat down abruptly. She had had herway. This was what she wanted and Ashley wanted. But it was not making her happy. Her vanitywas sore and she was mortified at the thought that Rhett had taken it all so lightly, that he didn’twant her, that he put her on the level of other women in other beds.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She wished she could think of some delicate way to tell Ashley that she and Rhett were nolonger actually man and wife. But she knew now she could not. It all seemed a terrible mess nowand she half heartedly wished she had said nothing about it. She would miss the long amusingconversations in bed with Rhett when the ember of his cigar glowed in the dark. She would missthe comfort of his arms when she woke terrified from the dreams that she was running throughcold mist.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Suddenly she felt very unhappy and leaning her head on the arm of the chair, she cried.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/872/3957.html","bookId":51,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 3:07:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 3:07:14 AM"}
