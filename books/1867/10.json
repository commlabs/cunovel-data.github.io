The silvery sky held a bright, shining moon. A spidery tree loomed over me, its skinny, naked branches reaching toward me with witch-like fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, my head aching. Then I saw it. A tombstone. Then another. Not one, but hundreds. I saw the baroness\u0027s monument. I was in Dullsville\u0027s cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I rose, I felt light-headed. I caught my balance on a graveyard marker. I used to seek comfort among the tombstones, but because I was unsure of how I got here, I was anxious to leave before I ended up in an unmarked grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger, wearing black cargo pants with red seams and a white T- shirt emblazoned with the words THE PUNISHER, was standing before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get here? Did you follow my bus?\" I asked, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will all be over in just a few minutes.\" \"What--my life? Forget it. I\u0027m getting outta here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so fast.\" Jagger grabbed my hand and began leading me toward the middle of the cemetery. I tried to pull away from him, but his grip was too strong and my strength had been depleted from whatever means he used to get me there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d snuck into Dullsville\u0027s cemetery many times, and invariably Old Jim, the caretaker, and Luke, his Great Dane, would chase me out. They seemed to be nowhere, now when my life depended on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were looking for Alexander,\" I said, but Jagger ignored me and continued pulling me toward the monuments and tombs. We stopped at a closed coffin laid upon a cement bench. I could hear strange music, a mixture of wailing violins and an underlying harpsichord, coming from one of the tombs. On the coffin, a candelabra flickered among the raindrops, wax dripping down its pewter spine. A medieval goblet sat next to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like a scene from a gothic wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this?\" I asked, my mental fog beginning to wear off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A covenant ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where are the guests? I didn\u0027t bring a gift,\" I said, giddy from my daze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bride doesn\u0027t have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bride? But I didn\u0027t even register yet!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger didn\u0027t smile. Instead he relit a candle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few feet away, I spotted a shovel lying next to an empty grave, glistening in the moonlight. I backed up slowly, inching my way to the shovel until the caretaker\u0027s tool lay at my feet. My heart was beating so loudly, I was afraid Jagger would hear it. I took a deep breath. As he centered the candelabra on the coffin, I bent over and reached for the handle. But as soon as I grabbed it, Jagger\u0027s boot pinned it to the earth. He stood over me as I tried in vain to pry it from the ground. In the struggle, the shiny new shovel shook, and a few bits of clinging dirt fell off the metal head. I saw myself in the shovel\u0027s curve, upside down like a spoon\u0027s reflection. However, I didn\u0027t see a reflection for Jagger right behind me. I looked back up at him. He smiled a wicked smile. I hastily wiped the shovel with my sleeve and shifted to one side, peering into the shiny metal surface. All I could see were the stars above him, but his boot remained on the handle behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something missing?\" he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose quickly and stepped back. \"You--\" I began, breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to run, but Jagger lunged forward and grabbed my arm. He flashed his fangs at me and licked his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy reality spun out of control. I was standing face-to-face with a real vampire. One who wasn\u0027t Alexander. Jagger was the kind I\u0027d read about and seen in movies--the kind who meant to snatch me away from my family and friends and take my blood as his own. I faced pledging my life to a stranger for all eternity. The radical dreams I\u0027d wished for as just a curious goth were about to come true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this wasn\u0027t my dream. I\u0027d dreamed of eternal love, belonging, and fitting in. Not danger, deceit, and evil. Dullsville hadn\u0027t been so dull after Alexander had moved into town. After meeting him, I\u0027d realized all I\u0027d ever wanted was to become one of the living--experiencing movies, metal concerts, and love--and not one of the undead. I wanted to sleep in Alexander\u0027s arms, not alone in a coffin. I wanted to turn into a gothic beauty, not a creepy bat. And most important, if I had to make the choice to transform, I would only do it for Alexander. \"My parents are expecting me home. They\u0027ll be sending out the SWAT team any minute now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held my hand with a strength I\u0027d never felt before. I looked around for anything else to help my escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger led me to the front of the coffin. He picked up the goblet and raised it to the moon, spoke a few words in a language I didn\u0027t understand, and then took a long drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you,\" he said with a wicked grin, offering me the goblet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it!\" I said, pushing the goblet away with my free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But isn\u0027t this what you wanted all along? Why else would you follow Alexander?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I love him!\" I said, trying to wriggle free. \"And I will never love you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t have to,\" he said, and forced the goblet to my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrops of thick, sweet liquid spilled against my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spit the liquid from my mouth. \"I will never become like you, whoever or whatever you are!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger\u0027s face grew strange, as if my words had been a silver stake driven through his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I say you will!\" His blue and green eyes gazed into mine as if trying to cast a spell. \"With this kiss, I take thee for all eternity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger flashed his smile, and his white fangs glistened in the moonlight. He leaned into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bite back!\" I yelled defensively, gritting my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly a burst of lightning struck, illuminating the sky and all of the graveyard. I plunged my teeth into Jagger\u0027s arm as hard as I could and dug my nails into his bony hand. He quickly released his death grip. I turned to run but slammed hard into something--or, rather, someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old Jim?\" I cried, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when I looked up and stared into two midnight eyes, I realized it wasn\u0027t the caretaker I\u0027d run into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, standing before me was my Gothic Guy, like a knight of the night. His dark, shoulder-length hair was hanging in his face. His white, moonlit skin was covered by a black T-shirt and jeans. The plastic spider ring I\u0027d given him was resting on his finger. His eyes were deep, lonely, adoringly intelligent, just as they were the first time I\u0027d seen them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander!\" I exclaimed, and fell into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as I thought!\" Jagger proclaimed, as if he\u0027d won a contest. \"I knew she\u0027d bring me to you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander embraced me hard as if he would never release me. Then he pushed me away. \"You must go,\" he commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy? I can\u0027t leave you!\" I held his hand tightly. \"I thought I\u0027d never see you again!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared into my eyes and warned me. \"You have to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have brought her into this!\" Alexander told Jagger, with an anger I\u0027d never seen before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She found me. Besides, I\u0027m surprised to see that you\u0027re letting her go so soon, after she came all the way to the Coffin Club to find you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave Raven out of this!\" Alexander exclaimed. \"I couldn\u0027t have planned my revenge any better than this. I could destroy you and gain an eternal partner with just one bite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t dare--\" Alexander warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew she\u0027d bring you to me, Sterling. You think you\u0027re not like one of us, but the truth is you are,\" Jagger argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is he talking about?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now,\" Alexander answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think Sterling left Romania?\" Jagger asked me. \"Do you think it was an accident he came to a small town in America where there weren\u0027t any vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t really know, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I found you, Sterling,\" Jagger bragged. \"And I found Raven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has nothing to do with this,\" Alexander said, stepping in between Jagger and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have nothing to do with what?\" I asked curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, Raven, he breaks promises all the time. Right, Sterling?\" Jagger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander clenched his fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What promise? Why revenge? What does he mean?\" I asked, confused, wondering what kind of agreement Alexander had made but couldn\u0027t keep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m not going to leave her! I\u0027m going to hold on to her for all of eternity!\" Jagger proclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed his teeth with a wickedly gnarled grin and leaned in to sink his fangs into my neck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissing-coffins-vampire-kisses-2/page-10.html","bookId":1867,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:26 PM"}
