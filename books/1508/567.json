This was the way it was. Every time Lin Ming attacked, he could clearly feel the heaven and earth origin energy pass through this mist and into his clavicles, converging into his meridians and dispersing through his body. It was like an invisible origin energy vortex had appeared near the Gate of Healing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a constant supply of origin energy, Lin Ming’s long-term combat efficiency had greatly increased. This was also the reason that the Heretical God Force could now last for an incense stick of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the point that Lin Ming began to rise, the Heretical God Force had helped him countless times to reverse the flow of battle. However, the Heretical God Force had a fatal flaw, and that was that it couldn’t last for an extended period. After he used it, it would consume a great deal of his energy; this was the reason that Lin Ming didn’t dare to easily open the Heretical God Force in a fight, instead saving it as his final move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lin Ming first entered Skysplit Tower, his Heretical God Force could only last for several dozen breaths of time. Not just that, but once he opened it he couldn’t close it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter entering Skysplit Tower and practicing here for a long time, the Heretical God Force had taken another step further. Lin Ming could now momentarily open and close the Heretical God Force. After touching upon the threshold for the Gate of Healing, the duration of the Heretical God Force had also lengthened to an incense stick of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could be said that the practical usability of the Heretical God Force had been greatly enhanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter putting away the Cosmic Melting Furnace, with his whole body exhausted and aching, Lin Ming fell into a wonderful sleep. It had been a long time since he was able to relax in sleep. During his stay so far in this top-grade practice area, he had even spent his sleep time cultivating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this comfortable feeling, Lin Ming slept well, resting for an entire day and night. After waking up he took a bath and switched into a new set of clothes, and then made a detour to the city square in order to pick up any new Blood Demon Crystals that were traded in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to go to the third floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout knowing, Lin Ming had already stayed on the second floor for over half a year of time. It had been nearly a year since he arrived at the Holy Demon Continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne year. How were Miss Mu and Xingxuan doing? Was Divine Phoenix Island able to defend itself? How were his parents? How was his little sister?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming was filled with worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e………………………\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the opening token for the transmission array to the third floor. Please take it.” Nearby the second floor’s transmission array, a guard responsible for handling challengers said to Lin Ming as he respectfully handed the token to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming received the token and placed it into the transmission array. A white light flashed around him. In the next instant, Lin Ming arrived at the third floor; this was also the final floor for Skysplit Tower’s challengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkysplit Tower was shaped like a cone. The further up it went, the smaller it was. The third floor was barely half the size of the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lin Ming stepped forth from the transmission array, a young Fey girl was already waiting there. “Young Hero Lin? My name is Linlin, I have been waiting here for you for a long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting from the second floor, every new arriving challenger would have a reception with a servant. This person could introduce them to the practice areas or show them to the martial arena location in order to avoid trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s me!” Lin Ming cupped his fists together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young girl named Linlin was surprised and then quickly covered her mouth as she chuckled. Martial artists that came to the third floor were normally around 26 or 27 years of age. Not just that, but they were always extremely prideful and arrogant in their behavior, mostly disdaining to talk to such a low level character like her. It was surprising to meet such a well-mannered and polite young man like Lin Ming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Young Hero Lin, I can serve you for these next few days. Practice place, arena, city square, entertainment area; where would you like to go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Practice place!” Lin Ming replied without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his conversation with Muk Gu, Lin Ming was interested in the practice areas on the third floor. He especially wanted to know what resources were here that would cause so many outstanding young elites to rush to the third floor like a pack of ducks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm. Please follow me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third floor was much lonelier than the second floor. Walking through the roads here, it was rare to see a martial artist. Most of them were in closed-door seclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Skysplit Tower’s third floor, the pressure was great. The martial artists that made it here were not common within their generation. Every single person that practiced here was like a boat going against the current of the ocean. If they couldn’t move forwards then they would fall behind, and once they did, they would inevitably fall into the abyss without any chance of redemption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis great pressure spurred on every martial here. If they couldn’t become an Emperor, then they would become a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…………..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third floor’s practice area and city square bordered each other. When Linlin brought Lin Ming close to the third floor’s city square, he finally began to see more martial artists in his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was similar to the second floor; there were many martial artists that had set up a stall here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming glanced over. Most of the martial artists’ cultivation were at the early Xiantian realm, and there were even some at the Houtian realm. Lin Ming was a bit surprised. “These people are…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, they are employees of the challengers here. They are specifically responsible for setting up stalls and making sales. The challengers of the third floor just don’t have time to idle around for business. The city square and practice area on the third floor prohibit fighting, so vendors here can do business without danger even if their cultivation is low.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming nodded. Truly, the third floor was different from the second floor. Here, every second counted. One had to seize every chance possible. Hiring someone to work for them and handle their affairs was the most reasonable approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming swept over several of the items on sale here and noticed that everything was much more expensive than on the second floor. But, Lin Ming was already used to seeing such rare and valuable treasures, so he wasn’t too interested in them. As he was about to exit the city square, Lin Ming suddenly felt someone’s attention lock onto him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming stopped his footsteps and turned around. Behind him, several dozen feet away, there was an Imp sitting at a square table. He was swinging a folding fan in his hand, slyly smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough his smiling expression appeared very amiable, Lin Ming actually had a feeling that he was being stared at by a viper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This person… is strong!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming took a deep breath, his expression solemn. This person had completely restrained their aura within their body, giving off an unfathomably deep feeling. Skysplit Tower’s third floor was truly a den of crouching tigers and hidden dragons. Masters were simply everywhere here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling potential hostility in this person’s smiling expression, Lin Ming decided that he didn’t want to cause unnecessary complications. Just as he was about to turn and leave, a true essence sound transmission sounded in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop right there!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis order carried an imperious tone to it. Lin Ming frowned. As he turned again, he saw that the Imp had closed his folding fan. The Imp said, “Come, let’s have a chat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Imp nodded at a stool across from him – he wanted Lin Ming to walk over and sit there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming asked. Anybody who was commanded to walk over by someone they didn’t know wouldn’t be feeling too good about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at this moment, as Linlin saw this Imp, her expression changed. She hurriedly bowed and respectfully said, “So it’s the Heavenly Demon Seven Stars’ Sir Kai Yang. This young girl greets Sir Kai Yang.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavenly Demon Seven Stars?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming had already heard this title before. It seemed that the Heavenly Demon Seven Stars were famous on the third floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this Imp was apparently one of the Heavenly Demon Seven Stars. No wonder he had been so arrogant, that was because he had the strength to back it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming was silent for a moment, but at this time, Linlin’s panicked true essence sound transmission reached his ears. “Young Hero Lin, don’t look at Sir Kai Yang’s friendly expression, in truth he is a cruel and bloodthirsty individual. He uses extremely wicked and sadistic means. Young Hero Lin, you should quickly go over. If you anger him, he will keep a grudge in his heart. It will be dangerous to you in the future…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Linlin saw Lin Ming not responding, she became a bit impatient. She feared that he would somehow offend Kai Yang. She had a very good impression of Lin Ming, so she didn’t want him to suffer a loss in the future because of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, as Kai Yang saw Lin Ming’s indifferent look, he glowered. Then, as if he suddenly thought of something, Kai Yang’s amiable smile returned and he took initiative to stand up instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t want to come over, it’s fine that I come over instead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKai Yang slowly walked over to Lin Ming as he swung his fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinlin was afraid. She had heard that Kai Yang was subject to wildly swinging moods. If he smiled, it was likely that he wanted to kill someone. She subconsciously stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, this was the city square. Fighting was prohibited here. No matter how great Kai Yang’s courage was, he would not randomly kill someone here. This thought calmed her down somewhat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn’t be blamed for shrinking back. On the third floor, it was normal for a challenger to kill a servant because they were displeased by something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming’s mind went on alert though he remained calm and collected on the surface. He knew that when he arrived here, it was likely that he would meet someone who was aiming at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kai Yang approached, Lin Ming cupped his fists together and said, “Can I help you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis question that was neither humble nor arrogant caused the Imp to smile. When he smiled, the wrinkly folds on his face bunched up even further, causing him to look even more disgusting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lin Ming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am Lin Ming!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm, I heard that you killed Xing Tian?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming raised his eyebrows. “Yes. Are you thinking of taking revenge for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Revenge? Hehe, I don’t have that much time to waste. But… when you killed Xing Tian, you should have obtained his spatial ring?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming’s mind went cold. This Imp had come here for this? He nodded. It was impossible to hide something like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha…” The Imp chuckled twice. Then, he switched to a true essence sound transmission and said, “In Xing Tian’s spatial ring, if I’m not wrong, there should be a black, glass-like bead, around the size of a pigeon egg. It’s covered in impurities and is cool to the touch, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming remained silent. There really was this sort of bead within Xing Tian’s spatial ring. It had been cleverly hidden within a normal looking pill bottle by a spell. If he hadn’t carefully looked through Xing Tian’s ring, then he would have really missed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Lin Ming didn’t completely understand the function of this bead, he could tell from how Xing Tian had carefully treated it, in addition to a faint intuitive feeling he had, that this bead was something extraordinary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Lin Ming’s silence, the Imp smiled. In truth he didn’t need Lin Ming to reply. He could approximately guess that this bead had fallen into Lin Ming’s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“1000 Blood Demon Crystals! I’ll buy that from you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Imp tossed out a price tag. These 1000 Blood Demon Crystals were naturally high-grade Blood Demon Crystals. It was equal to more than 100,000 medium-grade Blood Demon Crystals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, but it’s not for sale.” Lin Ming flatly refused. He could earn Blood Demon Crystals again, but this bead was most likely something that couldn’t be bought. Naturally Lin Ming wasn’t do something so stupid as selling it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm?” Kai Yang frowned. He didn’t become angry but instead coldly said, “Then how much do you want? Name a price!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Ming said, “I just said that I will not sell this bead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKai Yang glowered. “So you would rather do things the hard way, huh!?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-565\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-567\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-566","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:18 AM"}
