{"id":9871,"no":38,"title":"Chapter 38.","content":"LailaJLaila was glad, when the Taliban went to work, that Babiwasn\u0027t around to witness it. It would have crippled him.\n\u003cbr\u003e Men wielding pickaxes swarmed the dilapidated Kabul Museumand smashed pre-Islamic statues to rubble-that is, those thathadn\u0027t already been looted by the Mujahideen. The universitywas shut down and its students sent home. Paintings wereripped from walls, shredded with blades. Television screens werekicked in. Books, except the Koran, were burned in heaps, thestores that sold them closed down. The poems of Khalili,Pajwak, Ansari, Haji Dehqan, Ashraqi, Beytaab, Hafez, Jami,Nizami, Rumi, Khayyam, Beydel, and more went up in smoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila heard of men being dragged from the streets, accused ofskippingnamaz, and shoved into mosques. She learned thatMarco Polo Restaurant, near Chicken Street, had been turnedinto an interrogation center. Sometimes screaming was heardfrom behind its black-painted windows. Everywhere, the BeardPatrol roamed the streets in Toyota trucks on the lookout forclean-shaven faces to bloody.\n\u003cbr\u003e They shut down the cinemas too. Cinema Park. Ariana. Aryub.\n\u003cbr\u003e Projection rooms were ransacked and reels of films set to fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e Laila remembered all the times she and Tariq had sat in thosetheaters and watched Hindi films, all those melodramatic tales oflovers separated by some tragic turn of fate, one adrift in somefaraway land, the other forced into marriage, the weeping, thesinging in fields of marigolds, the longing for reunions. Sheremembered how Tariq would laugh at her for crying at thosefilms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder what they\u0027ve done to my father\u0027s cinema,\" Mariamsaid to her one day. \"If it\u0027s still there, that is. Or if he stillowns it.\"Kharabat, Kabul\u0027s ancient music ghetto, was silenced. Musicianswere beaten and imprisoned, theirrubab%?iamboura%? andharmoniums trampled upon. The Taliban went to the grave ofTariq\u0027s favorite singer, Ahmad Zahir, and fired bullets into it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s been dead for almost twenty years,\" Laila said toMariam. \"Isn\u0027t dying once enough?\"* * *Rasheed wasnt bothered much by the Taliban. All he had todo was grow a beard, which he did, and visit the mosque,which he also did. Rasheed regarded the Taliban with aforgiving, affectionate kind of bemusement, as one might regardan erratic cousin prone to unpredictable acts of hilarity andscandal.\n\u003cbr\u003e Every Wednesday night, Rasheed listened to the VoiceofShari\u0027a when the Taliban would announce the names of thosescheduled for punishment. Then, on Fridays, he went to GhaziStadium, bought a Pepsi, and watched the spectacle. In bed, hemade Laila listen as he described with a queer sort ofexhilaration the hands he\u0027d seen severed, the lashings, thehangings, the beheadings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I saw a man today slit the throat of his brother\u0027s murderer,\"he said one night, blowing halos of smoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027re savages,\" Laila said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You think?\" he said \"Compared to what? The Soviets killed amillion people. Do you know how many people the Mujahideenkilled in Kabul alone these last four years? Fifty thousandFiftythousand! Is it so insensible, by comparison, to chop the handsoff a few thieves? Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. It\u0027s in theKoran. Besides, tell me this: If someone killed Aziza, wouldn\u0027tyou want the chance to avenge her?\"Laila shot him a disgusted look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m making a point,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re just like them.\"\"It\u0027s an interesting eye color she has, Aziza. Don\u0027t you think?\n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s neither yours nor mine.\"Rasheed rolled over to face her, gently scratched her thighwith the crooked nail of his index finger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me explain,\" he said. \"If the fancy should strike me-andI\u0027m not saying it will, but it could, it could-I would be withinmy rights to give Aziza away. How would you like that? Or Icould go to the Taliban one day, just walk in and say that Ihave my suspicions about you. That\u0027s all it would take. Whoseword do you think they would believe? What do you thinkthey\u0027d do to you?\"Laila pulled her thigh from him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not that I would,\" he said. \"I wouldn\u0027t.Nay. Probably not.\n\u003cbr\u003e You know me.\"\"You\u0027re despicable,\" Laila said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s a big word,\" Rasheed said. \"I\u0027ve always disliked thatabout you. Even when you were little, when you were runningaround with that cripple, you thought you were so clever, withyour books and poems. What good are all your smarts to younow? What\u0027s keeping you off the streets, your smarts or me?\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m despicable? Half the women in this city would kill to havea husband like me. They wouldkill for it.\"He rolled back and blew smoke toward the ceiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You like big words? I\u0027ll give you one: perspective. That\u0027s whatI\u0027m doing here, Laila. Making sure you don\u0027t lose perspective.\"What turned Laila\u0027s stomach the rest of the night was thatevery word Rasheed had uttered, every last one, was true.\n\u003cbr\u003e But, in the morning, and for several mornings after that, thequeasiness in her gut persisted, then worsened, becamesomething dismayingly familiar.\n\u003cbr\u003e * * *One cold, overcast afternoon soon after, Laila lay on her backon the bedroom floor. Mariam was napping with Aziza in herroom.\n\u003cbr\u003e In Laila\u0027s hands was a metal spoke she had snapped with apair of pliers from an abandoned bicycle wheel She\u0027d found itin the same alley where she had kissed Tariq years back. Fora long time, Laila lay on the floor, sucking air through herteeth, legs partedShe\u0027d adored Aziza from the moment when she\u0027d firstsuspected her existence. There had been none of thisself-doubt, this uncertainty. What a terrible thing it was, Lailathought now, for a mother to fear that she could not summonlove for her own child. What an unnatural thing. And yet shehad to wonder, as she lay on the floor, her sweaty handspoised to guide the spoke, if indeed she could ever loveRasheed\u0027s child as she had Tariq\u0027s.\n\u003cbr\u003e In the end, Laila couldn\u0027t do it.\n\u003cbr\u003e It wasn\u0027t the fear of bleeding to death that made her dropthe spoke, or even the idea that the act was damnable- whichshe suspected it was. Laila dropped the spoke because shecould not accept what the Mujahideen readily had: thatsometimes in war innocent life had to be taken. Her war wasagainst Rasheed. The baby was blameless. And there had beenenough killing already. Laila had seen enough killing ofinnocents caught in the cross fire of enemies.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838/53257.html","bookId":1002,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:59 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:38:59 AM"}
