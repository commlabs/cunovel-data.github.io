As the knocking continued, she was getting more worried and less confused. \"Better see if it is a bird, I guess,\"she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan rol ed away from her, somehow got on his jeans, and went reeling to the door. In spite of herself, Elena pitied whoever was on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knocking started again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan reached the door and nearly wrenched it off its hinges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the - \"He stopped, suddenly moderating his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Flowers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\"Mrs. Flowers said, deliberately not seeing Elena, who was wearing a sheet and directly in her line of vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s poor dear Meredith,\"Mrs. Flowers said. \"She\u0027s in such a state, and she says she has to see you now, Stefan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena\u0027s mind switched tracks as suddenly and smoothly as a train. Meredith? In a state? Demanding to see Stefan, even if, as Elena was sure she must have, Mrs. Flowers had delicately indicated just how...busy Stefan was at the moment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind was Stillsolidly linked with Stefan\u0027s. He said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mrs. Flowers. I\u0027l be down in just a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena, who was slipping into her clothes as fast as she could, while crouching on the far side of the bed, added a telepathic suggestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you could make her a nice cup of tea - I mean, a cup of tea,\"Stefan added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, dear, what a good idea,\"Mrs. Flowers said gently. \"And if you should see Elena, perhaps you could say that dear Meredith is asking for her, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wil ,\"Stefan said automatical y. Then he turned around and hastily shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena gave him time to put his shirt and shoes on, and then they both hurried down to the kitchen, where Meredith was not having a nice cup of tea, but pacing around like a caged leopard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan began, \"What\u0027s - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027l tel you what\u0027s wrong, Stefan Salvatore! No - you tel me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were in my mind before, so you must know. You must have been able to see - to tel\u0026nbsp; - about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena was Stillmindlocked with Stefan. She felt his dismay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To tel what about you?\"he asked gently, pul ing out a chair at the kitchen table so Meredith could sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very simple act of sitting down, of pausing to respond to civility, seemed to calm Meredith slightly. But StillElena could feel her fear and pain like the taste of a steel sword on her tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith accepted a hug and became a little calmer yet. A little more herself and less like a caged animal. But the struggle was so visceral and so clear within her that Elena couldn\u0027t bear to leave her, even when Mrs. Flowers deposited four mugs of tea around the table and took another chair Stefan offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Stefan sat down. He knew Elena would stand or sit or share a chair with Meredith, but whatever it was, she would be the one to decide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Flowers was gently stirring honey into her mug of tea and then passing the honey along to Stefan who gave it to Elena who put just the little bit that Meredith liked into Meredith\u0027s mug and stirred it gently, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ordinary, civilized sounds of two spoons quietly clinking seemed to relax Meredith Stillfurther. She took the mug Elena gave her and sipped, then drank thirstily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena could feel Stefan\u0027s mental sigh of relief as Meredith floated down another few levels. He politely sipped his own tea, which was hot but not burning hot and made from natural y sweet berries and herbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good,\"Meredith said. She was almost a human now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mrs. Flowers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena felt lighter. She relaxed enough to pul over her own cup of tea and squeeze lots of honey in and stir it and take a gulp. Good! Calming down tea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s chamomile and cucumber, Stefan told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chamomile and cucumber,\"Elena said, nodding wisely, \"for calming down.\"And then she blushed, for Mrs. Flowers\u0027s bright smile had knowledge in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena hastily drank more tea and watched Meredith have more tea and everything began to feel almost al right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith was completely Meredith now, not some fierce animal. Elena squeezed her friend\u0027s hand tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was just one problem. Humans were less frightening than beasts but they could cry. Now Meredith, who never wept, was shaking and tears were dripping into the tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what morcillo is, right?\"she asked Elena at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena nodded hesitantly. \"We had it sometimes in stew at your house?\"she said. \"And for tapas?\"Elena had grown up with the blood sausage as a meal or a snack at her friend\u0027s house, and she was used to the bite-sized pieces as a delicious food only Mrs. Sulez made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena felt Stefan\u0027s heart sinking. She looked back and forth from him to Meredith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It turns out my mother didn\u0027t always make it,\"Meredith said, looking at Stefan now. \"And my parents had a very good reason for changing my birthday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tel it al ,\"Stefan suggested softly. And then Elena felt something she hadn\u0027t before. A surge, like a wave - a long gentle swell that spoke right into the center of Meredith\u0027s brain. It said: Just tell it and be calm. No anger. No fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t telepathy. Meredith felt the thought in her blood and bones, but didn\u0027t hear it with her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Influence. Before Elena could brain her beloved Stefan with her mug for using Influence on one of her friends, Stefan said, just to her, Meredith\u0027s hurting, feeling scared and angry. She has reason to, but she needs peace. I probably won\u0027t be able to hold her anyway, but I\u0027ll try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith wiped her eyes. \"It turns out that nothing was like what I thought happened - that night when I was three.\"She described what her parents had told her, about everything that Klaus had done. Tel ing the story, even quietly, was undoing al the calming influences that had helped Meredith maintain herself. She was beginning to shake again. Before Elena could grab her, she was up and striding around the room. \"He laughed and said that I\u0027d need blood every week - animal blood - or I\u0027d die. I didn\u0027t need much. Just a tablespoon or two. And my poor mother didn\u0027t want to lose another child. She did what he told her to. But what happens if I have more blood, Stefan? What happens if I drink yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan was thinking, desperately trying to see if in al his years of experience he\u0027d come across anything like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile he answered the easy part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you drank enough of my blood you\u0027d become a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut so would anyone. With you - Well, it might take less. So don\u0027t let any vampire trick you into blood exchange. Once might be enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027m not a vampire? Now? Not any kind? Are there different kinds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan answered seriously. \"I\u0027ve never heard of \u0027different kinds\u0027of vampires in my life, except for Old Ones. I can tel you that you don\u0027t have a vampire\u0027s aura. What about your teeth? Can you make your canines sharp? Usual y it\u0027s best to test over human flesh. Not your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena promptly stuck out her arm, wrist vein-side up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith, eyes closed in concentration, made a great effort, which Elena felt through Stefan. Then Meredith opened her eyes, mouth also open for a dental inspection. Elena stared at her canines. They looked a little bit sharp, but so did anybody\u0027s, didn\u0027t they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareful y Elena reached a fingertip in. She touched one of Meredith\u0027s canines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny pinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, Elena pul ed back. She stared at her finger where a very smal drop of blood was well ing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone watched it, mesmerized. Then Elena\u0027s mouth said without pausing to consult her brain, \"You have kitten teeth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next moment Meredith had brushed Elena aside and was pacing wildly al around the kitchen. \"I won\u0027t be one! I won\u0027t be! I\u0027m a hunter-slayer, not a vampire! I\u0027l kill myself if I\u0027m a vampire!\"She was deadly serious. Elena felt Stefan feeling it, the quick thrust of the stave between her ribs and into the heart. She would go on the Internet to find the right area. Ironwood and white ash piercing her heart, Stilling it forever...sealing off the evil that was Meredith Sulez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe calm! Be calm! Stefan\u0027s Influence flooded into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith was not calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But before that I have to kil my brother.\"She flung down a photograph on Mrs. Flowers\u0027s kitchen table. \"It turns out that Klaus or someone has been sending these since Cristian was four - on my real birthday. For years! And in every picture you could see his vampire teeth. Not \u0027kitten teeth.\u0027And then they stopped coming when I was about ten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had shown him growing up! With pointed teeth! And last year this one came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena leaped for the photo, but it was closer to Stefan and he was faster. He stared in astonishment. \"Growing up?\"he said. She could feel how shaken he was - and how envious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one had given him that option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena looked at the pacing Meredith and around at Stefan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s impossible, isn\u0027t it?\"she said. \"I thought that if you were bitten, that was it, right? You never got any older - or bigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought too. But Klaus was an Old One and who knows what they can do?\"Stefan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon will be furious when he finds out, Elena told Stefan privately, reaching for the picture even though she\u0027d already seen it through Stefan\u0027s eyes. Damon was very bitter about Stefan\u0027s height advantage - about anyone\u0027s height advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena brought the picture to Mrs. Flowers and looked at it with her. It showed an extremely handsome boy, with hair that was just Meredith\u0027s dark color. He looked like Meredith in his facial structure and olive skin. He was wearing a motorcycle jacket and gloves, but no helmet, and he was laughing merrily with a ful set of very white teeth. You could easily see that the canines were long and pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena looked back and forth from Meredith to the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only difference she could see was that this boy\u0027s eyes seemed lighter. Everything else screamed \"twins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First I kil him,\"Meredith repeated tiredly. \"Then I kil myself.\"She stumbled back to the table and sat, almost knocking over her chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena hovered near her, snatching two mugs from the table, to prevent Meredith\u0027s clumsy arm from sweeping them to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith...clumsy! Elena had never seen Meredith ungraceful or clumsy before. It was frightening. Was it somehow due to being - at least partly - a vampire? The kitten teeth? Elena turned apprehensive eyes on Stefan, felt Stefan\u0027s own bewilderment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen both of them, without consultation, turned to look at Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers. She gave them an apologetic little-old-lady smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotta kil ...find him, kil him...first,\"Meredith was whispering as her dark head lowered to the table, to the pil ow of her arms. \"Find him...where? Grandpa...where? Cristian...my brother...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena listened silently until there was only soft breathing to be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You drugged her?\"she whispered to Mrs. Flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was what Ma ma thought best. She\u0027s a strong, healthy girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt won\u0027t harm her to sleep from now through the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I\u0027m sorry to tel you, but we have another problem right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena glanced at Stefan, saw fear dawning on his face, and demanded, \"What?\"Absolutely nothing was coming through their link. He\u0027d shut it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena turned to Mrs. Flowers. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very worried about dear Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt,\"agreed Stefan, looking around the table as if to show that Matt wasn\u0027t there. He was trying to protect Elena from the chil s racing through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first Elena wasn\u0027t alarmed. \"I know where he might be,\"she said brightly. She was remembering stories that Matt had told of being in Fel \u0027s Church while she and the others had been in the Dark Dimension. \"Dr. Alpert\u0027s place. Or out with her, making the rounds of home visits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Flowers shook her head, her expression bleak. \"I\u0027m afraid not, Elena dear. Sophia - Dr. Alpert - cal ed me and told me she was taking Matt\u0027s mother, your own family, and several other people with her and escaping Fel \u0027s Church entirely. And I don\u0027t blame her a bit - but Matt wasn\u0027t one of those going. She said he meant to stay and fight. That was around twelve thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena\u0027s eyes automatical y went to the kitchen clock. Horror shot through her, flipping her stomach and reverberating out to her fingertips. The clock said 4:35 - 4:35 P.M.! But that had to be wrong. She and Stefan had only joined minds a few minutes ago. Meredith\u0027s rage hadn\u0027t lasted that long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was impossible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That clock - it\u0027s not right!\"She appealed to Mrs. Flowers, but heard at the same time Stefan\u0027s telepathic voice, It\u0027s the mind-blending. I didn\u0027t want to rush. But I was lost in it too - it\u0027s not your fault, Elena!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is my fault,\"Elena snapped back aloud. \"I never meant to forget about my friends for the entire afternoon! And Matt -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt would never scare us by keeping us waiting for his cal !\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have cal ed him! I shouldn\u0027t have been - \"She looked at Stefan with unhappy eyes. The only thing burning inside her right now was the shame of failing Matt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did cal his mobile number,\"Mrs. Flowers said very gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ma ma advised me to do so, al the way back at half past twelve. But he didn\u0027t answer. I\u0027ve cal ed every hour since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMa ma won\u0027t say more than that it\u0027s time we looked into things directly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena ran to Mrs. Flowers and wept on the soft cambric lacework at the old woman\u0027s neck. \"You did our job for us,\"she said. \"Thank you. But now we have to go and find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled on Stefan. \"Can you put Meredith in the first-floor bedroom? Just take off her shoes and put her on top of the covers. Mrs. Flowers, if you\u0027re going to be alone here, we\u0027l leave Saber and Talon to take care of you. Then we\u0027l keep in touch by mobile. And we\u0027l search every house in Fel \u0027s Church - but I guess we should go to the thicket first...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, Elena my dear.\"Mrs. Flowers had her eyes shut. Elena waited, shifting impatiently from one foot to the other. Stefan was just returning from putting Meredith in the front room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Mrs. Flowers smiled, eyes Stillshut. \"Ma ma says she wil do her utmost for you two, since you are so devoted to your friend. She says that Matt is not anywhere in Fel \u0027s Church. And she says, take the dog, Saber. The falcon wil watch over Meredith while we are away.\"Mrs. Flowers\u0027s eyes opened. \"Although we might plaster her window and door with Post-it Notes,\"she said, \"just to make sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\"Elena said flatly. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I won\u0027t leave Meredith and you on your own with only a bird for protection. We\u0027l take you both with us, covered in amulets if you like, and then we can take both animals, too. Back in the Dark Dimension, they worked together when Bloddeuwedd was trying to kil us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Al right,\"Stefan said at once, knowing Elena well enough to realize that a half-hour-long argument could ensue and Elena would never be moved an inch from her position. Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers must have known it too, for she rose, also immediately, and went to get ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan carried Meredith out to her car. Elena gave a tiny whistle for Saber, who was instantly underfoot, seeming bigger than ever, and she raced him up the stairs to Matt\u0027s room. It was disappointingly clean - but Elena fished a pair of briefs from between bed and wal . She gave these to Saber to delight in, but found she couldn\u0027t stand Still. Final y, she ran up to Stefan\u0027s room, snatched her diary from under the mattress, and began scribbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Diary,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what to do. Matt has disappeared. Damon has taken Bonnie to the Dark Dimension - but is he taking care of her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no way to know. We don\u0027t have any way to open a Gate ourselves and go after them. I\u0027m afraid Stefan will kill Damon, and if something - anything - has happened to Bonnie, I\u0027ll want to kill him too. Oh, God, what a mess!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Meredith...of all people, Meredith turns out to have more secrets than all of us combined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Stefan and I can do is hold each other and pray. We\u0027ve been fighting Shinichi so long! I feel as if the end is coming soon...and I\u0027m afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena!\"Stefan\u0027s shout came from below. \"We\u0027re al ready!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena quickly stuffed the diary back under the mattress. She found Saber waiting on the stairs, and fol owed him down, running.
