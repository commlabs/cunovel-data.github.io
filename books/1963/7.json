The fact was, he hated to see her in pain. “Besides, we need to talk over how we’re going to handle this situation. I have a feeling that we’ll have to be in top mental form to deal with these kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right.” She closed her eyes and purred like a well-fed kitten when he removed her tennis shoes and kneaded her aching feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Feel better?” he asked after a couple of minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, her eyes still closed. “I think you should stop,” she said, sounding completely unconvincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” He asked the question, but he stopped and bent down to pick up her shoes, which he’d placed on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Meg said. She looked around a little self-consciously as she slipped her shoes back on and tied the laces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling somewhat embarrassed by his uncharacteristic response to her, Steve cleared his throat and picked up his beer. “Do you have any ideas?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him as if she didn’t know what he was talking about, then straightened abruptly. “Oh, you mean for dealing with the kids. No, not really. What about you? Any suggestions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, we’re agreed that we’ve got to stop letting them run our lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly. We can’t allow them to force us into a relationship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. But if that was the case, he wondered, why did he experience the almost overwhelming desire to kiss her? All of a sudden, it bothered him that they were discussing strategies that would ensure the end of any contact between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe imagined leaning toward her, touching his lips to hers ….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s something wrong with this picture, Conlan, he said to himself, but he couldn’t keep from studying her—and picturing their kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been wrong about her face, he decided. She was beautiful, with classic features, large eyes, a full mouth. He’d trailed his finger down the curve of her cheek the first time they’d met, and now he did so a second time, mentally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what he was thinking. Steve swore she did. The pulse in her throat hammered wildly and she looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve did, too. He didn’t know what was happening, didn’t want to know. He reached for his beer and gulped down two deep swallows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat on earth was he doing? Rubbing her feet, thinking about kissing her. He didn’t need a woman messing up his life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially a woman like Meg Remington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you met Steve again,” Laura said. They sat on a bench in Lincoln Park enjoying huge ice-cream cones. A ferry eased toward the dock at Fauntleroy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who told you that?” Meg answered, deciding to play dumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lindsey, who else? You really didn’t think you fooled her, did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Clearly she had no talent for subterfuge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So tell me how your meeting went.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg didn’t answer. She couldn’t. She wasn’t sure what, if anything, she and Steve had accomplished during their meeting at the bar. They’d come up with a plan to dissuade his sister and her daughter, but the more hours that passed, the more ridiculous it seemed. And Meg’s willingness, indeed her eagerness, to see Steve again was disturbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn retrospect she saw that it’d been a mistake for them to get together. All she could think about was how he’d lifted her legs onto his lap and rubbed the tired achiness away. There’d been a sudden explosion of awareness between them. A living, breathing, throbbing awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRarely had Meg wanted a man to kiss her more. Right in the middle of a sports bar, for heaven’s sake! It was the craziest thing to happen to her in years. That of itself was distressing, but what happened afterward baffled her even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelting ice cream dripped onto her hand and Meg hurriedly licked it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meg?” Laura said, studying her. “What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” she said, laughing off her friend’s concern. “What could possibly be wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You haven’t been yourself the last couple of days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure I have,” she said, then deciding it was pointless to go on lying, she blurted out the truth. “I’m afraid I could really fall for this guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura laughed. “What’s so awful about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For one thing, he isn’t interested in me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time Laura eyed her suspiciously. “What makes you think that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Several things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura bit into her waffle cone. “Name one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he wanted to meet so we could figure out a way to keep the kids from manipulating our lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds suspiciously like an excuse to see you again,” Laura murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trust me, it wasn’t. Steve did everything but come right out and say he’s not interested in me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I am! There was ample opportunity for him to suggest we get to know each other better, and he didn’t.” She’d assumed Steve had experienced the same physical attraction she had, but maybe she’d been wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsey and Brenda had insisted she still had it. All Meg could say was that recent experience had proven otherwise. Whatever it was had long since deserted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did it occur to you that he might’ve been waiting for you to suggest something?” Laura asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Meg told her frankly. Steve wasn’t a man who took his cues from a woman. If he wanted something or someone, he’d make it known. If he wanted to continue to see her, he would’ve said so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s got to be more than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is.” Meg took a deep breath. “I was just getting ready to tell you. Steve came up with the idea originally, but I agreed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg stood and found the closest garbage receptacle to dump what remained of her ice cream. “Before I tell you, remember I’d been drinking beer on an empty stomach.” Okay, she’d had the pretzels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This doesn’t sound promising,” Laura said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t.” Drawing in another deep breath, she sat down on the park bench again. “We realized that the louder we protested and the more often we said we weren’t attracted to each other, the less likely either Lindsey or Nancy will believe us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a problem with this scenario,” Laura muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. You are interested in Steve. Very interested.” Laura gave her a look that said Meg hadn’t fooled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg glanced away. “I don’t want to confuse the issue with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, go on,” Laura said with a wave of her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Steve thinks the only possible way we have of convincing Lindsey that he’s not the right person for me is if he starts dating me and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See?” Laura said triumphantly. “He’s interested. Don’t you get it? This idea of his is just an excuse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I doubt it.” Meg could see no reason for him to play games if he truly wanted a relationship with her. “You can come over this evening if you want and see for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Steve’s coming to meet Lindsey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To your house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura grinned widely. “R-e-a-l-l-y,” she said, dragging out the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really. But it isn’t what you think.” Because if Laura did believe Steve wanted to pursue something with Meg, her friend was in for a major disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg got home an hour later. Lindsey had taken Steve’s visit seriously. She’d cleaned the house, baked cookies and wore her best jeans. A dress would’ve been asking too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom,” Lindsey said, frowning at her watch. “Do you have any idea what time it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you think you should shower and change clothes? Steve will be here in an hour and a half.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” She supposed she should reveal more enthusiasm, if only for show, but she couldn’t make herself do it. This had been Steve’s idea and she’d agreed, but she still wasn’t convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thinking you should wear that sundress we bought last year with the pretty red-rose print,” Lindsey suggested. “That and your white sandals.” She studied her mother critically. “I wish you had one of those broad-brimmed sun hats. A pretty white one would be perfect. Very romantic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll just have to make do with the sombrero Grandpa bought you in Mexico,” Meg teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother,” Lindsey cried, appalled. “That would look stupid!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg sighed dramatically, for effect. “I don’t know how I managed to dress myself all these years without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought—or hoped—that her daughter would laugh. Lindsey didn’t. “That might be the reason you’re still single. Have you considered that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis kid was no help when it came to boosting her confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a great mother,” Lindsey said, redeeming herself somewhat, “but promise me you’ll never go clothes-shopping without me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than make rash pledges she had no intention of keeping, Meg hurried up the stairs and got into the shower. The hot water pulsating against her skin refreshed her and renewed her sense of humor. She could hardly wait to see Lindsey’s face when she met Steve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a towel tucked around her, Meg wandered into her bedroom and examined the contents of her closet. In this case, Lindsey was right; the sundress was her best choice. She wore it, Meg told herself, because it looked good on her and not because Lindsey had suggested it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer daughter was waiting for her in the living room. The floral arrangement Steve, or rather Nancy, had sent was displayed in the middle of the coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindsey had polished the silver tea set until it gleamed. The previous time Meg had used it was when Pastor Delany came for a visit shortly after Meg’s father died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell chimed. Lindsey turned to her mother with a grin. “We’re ready,” she said, and gave her a thumbs-up sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg had assumed she knew what to expect, but when she opened the front door her mouth sagged open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Steve?” she whispered to the man dressed in a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans and a white T-shirt. “Is that you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winked at her. “You expecting someone else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“N-no,” she stammered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Invite me in,” he said in a low voice. As she stepped aside, he walked past her and placed his index finger under her chin, closing her mouth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-mother-s-wish/page-7.html","bookId":1963,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:49 AM"}
