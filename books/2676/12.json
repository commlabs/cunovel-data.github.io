They were on a curving course before they could\u0027ve been detected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That second boy put there could\u0027ve gotten a shock-wave echo from the blast,\" said Bonnett. \"He\u0027s just drifting now. He\u0027s already put out his anti-torp volley and it should --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree shock waves washed over them in rapid succession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be our fish being knocked out,\" said Sparrow. \"Any breaking up noises from that EP?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Negative,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then they have our position now from the echo,\" said Sparrow. \"Send out a detection scrambler and get our anti-torp volley off.\" He slapped Garcia on the back, said, \"Evasive action. Force speed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey standing beside Bonnett hit a series of switches with the heel of his hand. A cloud of tiny torp-homing exploders swept out from the Ram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett kicked the control which sent out a dummy torpedo carrying signal equipment to scramble detection systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why couldn\u0027t I have taken a nice safe job in a nitrox factory?\" Garcia moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys who want to live forever make me sick,\" said Bonnett. \"Here you are in a nice perambulating sewer pipe with ple --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up!\" barked Sparrow. \"If we get into close quarters I want a bigger pressure margin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia complied. The deck slanted upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey said, \"What makes you think . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re coming out of that scrambler\u0027s field,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fire another along our forward path,\" said Sparrow. Again he slapped Garcia\u0027s shoulder. \"Right rudder and drift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia pulled the wheel right, straightened it, shut down the drive. Slowly, the Ram lost headway. Again the deck tilted to starboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve gotten sloppy on our trim,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett leaned toward Ramsey, whispered, \"That guy\u0027s a genius. We coast along the edge of the first scrambler\u0027s field. The one we just sent out will leave a track for the other boys to follow and they\u0027ll --\" He broke off, staring at the detection system, eyes widening. \"Skipper!\" he husked, voice hanging on the edge of horror. \"They\u0027re right on top of us -- force speed. Going overhead now. Not more than one hundred feet!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow shouldered Garcia aside, kicked the Ram into force speed, swerved it into the wake of the other sub. To Bonnett, he said, \"Keep us on their tail. Gently, friend . . . gently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia whispered, \"I heard of this happening once with old Plunger, but I never thought I\u0027d see it myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey said, \"Their blind spot. They can\u0027t hear us in the turbulence of their own wake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett\u0027s voice came calm and steady: \"Two degrees port.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow swerved the Ram to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey pointed to the oscilloscope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett followed the direction, said, \"Skipper, off to starboard is a whole wolf pack. They\u0027re converging on that last scrambler we sent out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too close for comfort,\" said Sparrow. With one hand he eased down drive speed; with the other he punched the controls to arm a torpedo. \"Give me minimum range,\" he said. \"This has to be fast. As soon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas the blast reaches us, fire scramblers to the four points of the compass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett acknowledged. \"One hundred yards,\" he said. \"One twenty-five . . . one fifty . . . one seventy . . .\" He glanced to the secondary scope. \"Any second now that pack will be getting two signals from us and one of the signals won\u0027t fit IFF. Two fifty . . . two seventy-five . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow fired the single torpedo, killed the drive, began counting: \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, elev --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concussion shook the Ram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett fired the scramblers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey\u0027s ears were ringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow kicked on drive to force speed, brought the Ram about in a tight circle, coursing upward. With one hand, he pushed Garcia into the control position, stepped back. \"They\u0027ll be expecting us to dive,\" he said. \"Blow the tanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia palmed the switches and the Ram bounced to the lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow said, \"Les, give me a fifty-foot warning on the edge of the scrambler field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" said Bonnett. \"We\u0027ve a way to go yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett caught the puzzled look on Ramsey\u0027s face, said, \"They taught you things in subschool, but they never taught you this, did they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to float up,\" said Bonnett. \"We may be walking on the ceiling before we get there, but we\u0027re going to do it silently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow looked to the static pressure gauge: 1200 pounds -- above the 3000-foot level. He glanced inquiringly at Bonnett, who shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seconds ticked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett said, \"Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia killed the drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow wiped his face with his hands, looked startled when his hand came away bloody. \"Nosebleed,\" he said. \"Pressure change was too rapid. Haldane tablets, everyone.\" He fished a flat green pill from a pocket, popped it into his mouth. As always, his reaction was sudden nausea. He grimaced, held the pill down by will power, shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey choked on his pill, coughed, fought it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett spat into his handkerchief, said, \"Human beings weren\u0027t meant to take this kind of a beating.\" He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ram began to tip gently to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow looked at Ramsey, said, \"Johnny, go over to the left there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey complied, thinking: What a way to get on a first-name basis! I\u0027d sooner stay a dryback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he passed Garcia, the engineering officer spoke the thought aloud: \"Bet you wish you were still Junior Ramsey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey smiled faintly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deck\u0027s tipping slowed, but did not stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow nodded to Bonnett. \"Hand pump. Start shifting some water. Slow and easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnett stepped to the aft bulkhead, swung out a crank handle. Sparrow took over the search-board position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, they steadied on an even keel, but now the nose began to sink. Then the deck began to slant slowly to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow glanced at Ramsey, nodded toward the aft bulkhead on his side. \"Take over fore-and-aft stabilization. Easy does it. No noise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey moved to obey. He looked at the pressure gauge: 840 pounds. They were above the 2000-foot level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can maintain some sort of trim until we hit wave turbulence,\" said Sparrow. \"Then we may have to risk the drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently, the Ram drifted upward, tipping, canting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey found the rhythm of it. They couldn\u0027t hold her in exact trim. But they could rock her to a regular teeter-totter rhythm. He grinned across at Bonnett on lateral stabilization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deck suddenly stopped a leftward countermotion and heeled far right, came back again, nose rising; again she heeled to the right. A hissing sound resonated through the hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen on the forward bulkhead -- tuned to the conning TV eye -- showed milky green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow stood at the controls, one hand on the rail He stared upward at the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen\u0027s he going to give us headway? Ramsey wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the Ram heaved far over to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one frightening moment, Ramsey looked directly down into the pipe and conduit maze against the port pressure hull. We\u0027re going over, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Ram came back sluggishly, righting. The bulkhead screen broke free of foam, cleared to reveal fog and long, whitecapped rollers. The Ram pitched and bobbed in the seas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree with you, Skipper,\" said Bonnett. \"One way of dying is as good as another. They\u0027d have heard us sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia worked his way along the handrail, fighting the uneasy motion of the deck. \"If we could rig a sea anchor,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We already have one,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia blushed. \"The tow!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Lord, for the lovely fog,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ram swung downwind from her tow in a wide, rolling arc, jerking against the lines like a wild horse at a snubbing post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More line on the tow,\" said Sparrow. He nodded to Garcia, who jumped to obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motion of the deck smoothed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow kept his gaze on the detection gear. \"What\u0027s our heading, Joe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Near fifty-eight degrees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wind\u0027s favorable,\" said Sparrow. \"And those boys down under haven\u0027t changed course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re still snooping after our last scrambler,\" said Garcia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time for you to go off watch, Joe,\" said Sparrow. \"I am relieving you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want me to bring up some sandwiches before I sack down?\" asked Garcia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ham and cheese,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks,\" said Sparrow. He studied the sonoscope on the search board. \"We\u0027ll drift with the wind until we no longer get signals from that pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey yawned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow hooked a thumb toward the aft door. \"You, too. That was a good job, Johnny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey said, \"Aye.\" He followed Garcia down the companionway, muscles aching from the unaccustomed exercise at the ballast pumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia turned at the wardroom door, looked at Ramsey. \"Chow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey steadied himself with one hand against the bulkhead. Beneath him, the deck rolled and dipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These tubs weren\u0027t designed for the surface,\" said Garcia. \"What breed of sandwich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of food suddenly made Ramsey\u0027s stomach heave. The long companionway appeared to gyrate in front of him, rolling counter to the motion of the deck. He capped his mouth with a hand, raced for his quarters. He reached the washbasin just in time, stood over it retching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia followed him, pressed a blue pill into his hand, made him swallow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, the surging of Ramsey\u0027s stomach eased. \"Thanks,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the sack, Junior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia helped him grope his way into his bunk, pulled a blanket over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeasick! I\u0027ll never live it down! thought Ramsey. He heard Garcia leave. Presently, he remembered the telemeter. But he was too weak, too drowsy. He drifted off to sleep. The motion of the Ram became a soothing thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRockaby . . . rockaby . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could almost hear a voice. Far away. Down a tunnel. In an echo chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boat is my mother. I shall not want . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he awakened it was the call to watch and he had a scant moment in which to glance at the telemeter tapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow had returned to the pattern of rigid control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though Ramsey\u0027s subconscious had been working on a problem, chewing it, and these were the final data. The answers came spewing up to his conscious level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew what he had to do. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-12.html","bookId":2676,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM"}
