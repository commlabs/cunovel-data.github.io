Maybe. A little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught herself taking deep breaths, soaking up the remaining few hints of his aftershave, and mentally kicked herself. You don\u0027t need this, she told herself. Really. Your life is way too complicated as it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn\u0027t like she didn\u0027t have other things to think about, for God\u0027s sake. A sister she hadn\u0027t talked to in six months after their last fight. A father puttering around on the family farm, still vital but growing old. A brother in the Navy who deserved a few more letters at the very least. She had a life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, Jazz. Having a family doesn\u0027t mean you have a life. Only relatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed the letter again, fingered the check, reread the resume. Folded everything together and stuck it back into the red envelope, then tucked it in her waistband, under the sweatshirt. She worked her knuckles experimentally and found that the bruising was pretty minimal - funny, she didn\u0027t even remember throwing a punch, but that was how fights worked - and the abraded skin would be okay after a day or two. All in all, not the worst bar fight she\u0027d ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKinda fun, actually. She wondered if that made her dangerous, or just masochistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fished her cell phone out of its cradle on her belt, hesitated, and then dialed the number on the resume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo rings on the other end. Three. And then a brisk, contralto voice said, \"Diga-me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucia Garza?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Who\u0027s this?\" The tone was courteous but not welcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I hang up now...hell, she\u0027ll still have my number. Jazz took in a breath and said, as professionally as possible, \"My name is Jazz Callender. I got a letter from - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel, Pike \u0026amp; Laskins?\" Lucia finished. \"Yeah, me, too. It said you\u0027d be calling. Something about a partnership agreement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz went still and felt her eyes half close as she thought it through. \"You must have gotten my resume, then. I got yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\" Nothing in the voice at all, and certainly no approval or offers of friendship. Lucia liked to keep her feelings to herself. \"I apologize, but this is very strange for me. I\u0027m uncomfortable with talking to a stranger on the phone about - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re uncomfortable? Join the club. I just had my evening interrupted by some lawyer with a cock-and-bull story and a nice-looking - \" she edited her usually street-worthy vocabulary with a conscious switch \" - presentation. How do you know these people? You owe them money, or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t mean to lash out, exactly, but Lucia\u0027s careful, measured voice had pissed her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t,\" Lucia replied. The voice was still level and calm, but there was a floor of steel underneath. \"And I don\u0027t know them any more than I know you, Detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Former detective,\" Jazz shot back. \"Which you\u0027d know, if you\u0027d read the damn resume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief, dark silence, and then Lucia\u0027s cool voice. \"A word of advice, Former Detective, there\u0027s no need to take your anger out on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re obviously angry at being manipulated, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. A fucking psychologist, you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t interrupt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently no one\u0027s ever explained that it\u0027s rude,\" Lucia said. \"Like your general attitude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you done? Because I don\u0027t want to interrupt your apology, which I\u0027m sure is coming any second now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t going to work for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t find you a bowl of cherries, either, Lucy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was talking to dead air. Lucia Garza had hung up on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz angrily slapped the cell phone back on her belt, tossed the coffee cups and headed home. It was a six-block walk, and night had well and truly fallen; overhead, stars struggled to outshine the blank glare of streetlights. Kansas City wasn\u0027t much of a walking town in this part of the city; it was a mostly industrial area, and while there were plenty of cars, she was the only one on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all right, she was probably better off on her own just now. She walked faster, burning off adrenaline and anger, feeling the red envelope hot against her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as well, she told herself. This was a total waste of time, anyway. Why the hell would a lawyer from New York fly all the way out to the sticks to hand-deliver something like this? And get the hell beat out of him in the process? What had he really been after? She hadn\u0027t given him anything, except a promise to think it over and call him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nonprofit organization? What the hell was she, some kind of charity case? What did they want?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been told where to find her. How was that even remotely possible? He had to have followed her...but if she\u0027d failed to notice a guy in that outfit following her on a deserted street, she was worse off than she\u0027d thought. The jingle of chains alone should have given him away. He sounded like Santa Claus\u0027s sleigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if he hadn\u0027t followed her, then how had they known where to find her? She\u0027d never been to Sol\u0027s. They - whoever they were - couldn\u0027t have just sent him there, it was impossible. No, he must have followed her, she decided. Either he was a lot better than she thought, or she\u0027d been preoccupied with her own distress and had just plain dropped the ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMystery solved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, not quite. What had all that drama achieved, exactly? Why would they have put on the whole dog-and-pony show in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo get me to call Lucia Garza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped walking, frozen in her tracks as her mind raced. Maybe that was all they\u0027d wanted. If Garza was dirty, she\u0027d just had a minutes-long conversation that was on her cell phone records, and dammit, this could have been a setup, couldn\u0027t it? The cops who\u0027d put away McCarthy were still on her ass, looking for any reason to pull her in for questioning. She\u0027d had the fight in the bar. Borden - if his name was really Borden - would be tough to find, if all this was just an elaborate scheme. Maybe the paper and the check weren\u0027t genuine. Shit, for all she knew, they\u0027d had them printed up under her own name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParanoia, she told herself, and forced herself to start breathing again. You just saw McCarthy today. That makes you paranoid, and you know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen McCarthy had told her to watch her back. She should\u0027ve listened to him. Yeah, listen to the convicted murderer. Good plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished the sarcastic monitor in her head would shut the hell up. McCarthy was no murderer. The case had been a crock of shit, and in time, they\u0027d figure it out, have him exonerated and released from that hellhole. McCarthy had been a good partner and a hell of a cop, and he wasn\u0027t guilty. Couldn\u0027t be guilty, because if he was, that meant she was a poor enough judge of character not to have realized that her own partner, her friend, had calmly pulled the trigger on three people and then walked away, covered it up, and lied for nearly a year. And used her to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop thinking about Ben. That was why she\u0027d gone to Sol\u0027s. It was a kind of punishment she meted out to herself for making the trip to Ellsworth. She always felt safer and stronger there, talking to him; he could always make her believe that the world was wrong and the two of them were right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only after she got out into that wrong world again that she began to doubt, and the darkness started to creep in, and she felt the guilt and shame and horror again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd went in search of something to drown it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if McCarthy was right, that didn\u0027t improve things for her, because if they could get to him, they could get to anyone. She wished she could call him. If his enemies had set this up, then she needed McCarthy\u0027s clarity of mind to tell her what it meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, it was just a heap of fragmented facts looking for context. McCarthy had always been the logical one, the one to meticulously pick through the pile and fit pieces together until the picture started forming....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone rang. She grabbed for it, startled, and checked the number before thumbing it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia Garza was calling her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" she asked cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s Jazz, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Jazz said, and started walking again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got out of line, and I apologize. It is strange, though, don\u0027t you agree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\" She struggled with it for a few seconds, and admitted, \"I was out of line, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother brief silence. \"You think you\u0027re being played?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, me, too.\" The sound of papers rustling. \"I don\u0027t like this phone thing. It\u0027s a paper trail. They can interpret it however they want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They, who?\" Jazz asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not paranoid - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they\u0027re really out to get you,\" Lucia finished. \"Sorry for interrupting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, that\u0027s your freak, not mine. Me, I hate being lied to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, she did hear an emotion in the voice. \"We have something in common after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So.\" Sol\u0027s was ahead. Jazz quickened her pace to get past it faster. \"You want to do this thing? Talk face-to-face?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, silent pause, and then, \"I don\u0027t know. Yes. I think so. Otherwise - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a check,\" Jazz said. \"I have it, it\u0027s made out to us both. For a hundred grand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One...hundred...thousand...dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think you meant cents,\" Lucia said. \"Is it good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll check it tomorrow, but yeah, I\u0027m kind of leaning toward the idea it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t really say, until she tried to put it into words. \"The guy they sent. He was...credible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" Lucia said doubtfully. \"If we\u0027re thinking about any of this, I will insist on seeing the law firm. In New York. And talking to this lawyer you met, face-to-face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething lightened in Jazz\u0027s guts, because those were the exact same steps she would have taken, in Lucia\u0027s position. \"Yeah,\" she agreed. \"Sounds good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But first, we need to meet. In person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, and then Lucia said, with a hint of a laugh in that smooth, professional voice, \"What\u0027re you doing tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait...you\u0027re in Washington, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I travel,\" she said. \"Happens that I\u0027m in transit right now after a case in Dallas. I can reroute through K.C. Can you meet me at the airport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" This was moving a little fast, but hell, Jazz\u0027s schedule for tomorrow had mostly been devoted to sobering up from tonight. \"Call me with the flight number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jazz,\" Lucia said. \"You hate Jasmine, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t you? Fucking Disney movies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia laughed and hung up without saying goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz clipped the cell phone back on her belt and walked the rest of the way to her apartment in silence, thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she wrote her brother a letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call came at seven-thirty the next morning. Jazz was already up, showered and dressed, making her shaggy hair look a little less like a mop and more like an actual style. In honor of Lawyer Borden, she\u0027d used hair gel. She\u0027d chosen a plain brown shirt, blue jeans, and her ubiquitous cop shoes, deliberately unimpressive but clean and neat. ID and the red envelope in her purse, along with paperwork that showed she\u0027d been a decorated Kansas City police detective, until six months ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d included the paperwork about the retirement, too, but she figured that if Garza was anything like she sounded, she\u0027d already have the full story from three credible sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the first chirp of the cell phone, Jazz picked it up and said, \"Garza?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hol��,\" the other woman responded. She didn\u0027t sound awake. \"It\u0027s early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And here I figured you for a morning person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even close. Look, my plane\u0027s landing at ten-thirty. Meet you at baggage claim, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flight number?\" Jazz wrote it down, clicked the on-off switch on the pen nervously, and then said, \"How will I recognize you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be the one standing on one leg, singing \u0027The Star Spangled Banner,\u0027\" Lucia said grumpily. \"We\u0027re cops, right? We\u0027ve got to have a sign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz put out food for Mooch the Cat, petted her on the way out the door, and went to bail the car out of the parking prison where she stored it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive out to Kansas City International was about fifteen miles, but it took longer, of course; traffic on Broadway, then on I-29. Jazz hated driving. Other drivers made her crazy. McCarthy had always gotten behind the wheel when they\u0027d gone on calls, picked her up at her apartment, navigated the streets with casual ease and no sign at all of irritation. When she\u0027d been forced to do it, she\u0027d been a snarling bundle of nerves, arrived at crime scenes angry and wired. It had been a job for McCarthy to calm her down....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flicked the thought of Ben out of her head, hit the turn signal, and exited for MCI. Parking was a nightmare, of course. She hated that, too. And parking garages. She ended up taking a distant spot, because she damn sure wasn\u0027t cruising the lot for anything closer. The walk would help her calm down, anyway; she didn\u0027t want to meet Lucia Garza looking sweaty and wild-eyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe checked her watch. Ten-thirty on the dot. A couple of jets were coming in for landings; unless there had been a miracle and the plane was early, she should be right on time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz followed the signs to baggage claim. She arrived at ten-forty, just as the flight number flashed on the screen and one of the carousels began to clunk out luggage to a growing crowd of travelers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scanned the group without focusing on anyone in particular. Nobody stood out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Someone did. Jazz fixed on a woman who was standing very still, watching luggage bump its way around the segmented track. Her arms were crossed, and she was leaning against a pillar. There was a single black laptop bag over her shoulder and a black ripstop nylon backpack between her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz\u0027s cop brain relentlessly photographed her, chronicling long dark hair, glossy and straight; a model\u0027s golden, flawless skin. She was tall, long-legged, and dressed in what looked like a designer black pantsuit with a close-fitting white shirt under the coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jazz watched her, the woman\u0027s head turned, and her dark eyes fastened on Jazz. The same merciless evaluation, fast and accurate. Jazz wondered what the final catalog entry had been, but then Lucia pushed off and walked confidently through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both stopped, regarded each other for a few seconds, and then Lucia extended her hand. No rings on her fingers. Short, well-maintained French-manicured fingernails with plain gloss polish. Jazz felt like a clumsy lump of dough next to her, but she held eye contact as she shook, feeling strength in the grip but no challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Lucia said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she replied. They both stepped back and considered each other for a moment, and then Lucia smiled. It was a cop\u0027s smile - cynical, secretly amused, as familiar to Jazz as breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to meet you,\" Lucia said. \"Let\u0027s find a place to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey settled in some bright orange battered preformed chairs at the rear of baggage claim, out of the way of the loitering travelers. Lucia crossed her legs, rested an arm on the back of an empty seat and kept scanning the crowd. She looked casual and elegant, and very alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good flight?\" Jazz asked. Lucia made a so-so gesture. \"Nice weather?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair skies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Now that we\u0027ve got the small talk out of the way...\" Jazz pulled the envelope from her pocket, handed over the letter and the check, and watched Lucia read them. Lucia, immediately absorbed, dug a similar red envelope from her bag and handed it absently on, as well. Jazz scanned it. Apart from the fact that this one had been mailed from New York, had a different home address, and didn\u0027t include a check, it was pretty much the same song and dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia\u0027s carefully manicured fingernail flicked the check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s genuine,\" Jazz said. \"I called the bank this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia shuffled the pages to her resume. Her dark eyes widened, and she shot Jazz a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Jazz asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up the paper. \"This isn\u0027t the public resume. This one\u0027s what I give to enforcement agencies. It\u0027s got confidential information on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how did these guys get hold of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia shook her head. \"Last place I sent this resume to was the FBI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz raised her eyebrows. \"They turned you down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\" She shrugged. \"But I\u0027m not so sure I want to go back into government service right now. I\u0027d like to do something with a few less rules. So, you said this guy seemed credible to you? How so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz thought about Borden, his geeky leathers, his soft, sharply intelligent eyes. Maybe the getup hadn\u0027t been clueless, after all. Maybe he\u0027d been deliberately concealing just how smart he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a feeling,\" she said. \"But then, I\u0027m not always the best judge of character.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flung it out there to see if Lucia would react, and she did, looking up and locking eyes with her for a few deep seconds before turning her attention back to the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume you\u0027re referring to your partner,\" Lucia said quietly. \"Yes. I know he was convicted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting in that airless courtroom, watching the jury shuffle and fidget in their chairs, watching them avoiding McCarthy\u0027s eyes, Jazz had known before the forewoman read out the verdict. She\u0027d known, and Ben had known, too. Twenty-five years in prison. He\u0027d be an old man when he got out. If he ever did. Cops were hunted in there, and Ben had always needed somebody to guard his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not guilty,\" Jazz said, mostly just to hear herself say it, to hear how it sounded out loud after all these months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia didn\u0027t look up. \"You\u0027re sure of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The evidence looked pretty damning on paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of guys on death row with paper evidence,\" Jazz shot back, feeling something tighten in her guts. \"McCarthy didn\u0027t kill anybody. I\u0027d have - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnown. That was the mantra that rocked her to sleep at night. I\u0027d have known. All those nights, sitting together, talking, pouring out our lives to each other, I\u0027d have known if he was capable of cold-blooded murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia didn\u0027t comment again. She finally looked up and said, \"What do you think about all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz shrugged. \"I think it\u0027s worth a conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because?\" Those elegantly shaped dark eyebrows rose just a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because even though you shop at Ann Taylor for your suits, I can\u0027t afford to. I need the money. And I need to set up shop with decent resources so I can find out what happened to McCarthy, and maybe keep it from happening to me.\" Jazz glared at her, daring her to find fault. \"I need the money. That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia\u0027s lips curved into a smile. \"That\u0027s it? You\u0027re not curious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How someone came to learn so much about us. About how they had my home address, which is not something just anyone can learn, believe me. I guard my privacy closely. About how they knew you needed the money, and I needed the challenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnwillingly, Jazz thought about the tinkle of the bell at Sol\u0027s, and James Borden arriving in his un-apropos leather with a message addressed to her. \"And how they knew where I\u0027d be,\" she said. \"They know a hell of a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than I think either of us is comfortable with,\" Lucia finished. \"At least until we know just how they got their information, and why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like talking to a mirror, Jazz thought. A mirror in which she was better-looking, taller, had better clothes, and knew how to apply lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia was smiling at her, eyes shining with something that might have been similar feeling, but then her eyes wandered past Jazz, focused on something behind her. Jazz resisted the urge to turn as the woman\u0027s smile shut down and left her face blank and watchful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you bring backup?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Hell, no. Who would I bring?\" She wasn\u0027t exactly rolling in allies at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two men have been watching us since we met,\" Lucia said. \"Were you followed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this, I Spy? I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t usually look for tails when I go on perfectly innocent meetings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it was perfectly innocent,\" Lucia said patiently, \"your lawyer friend wouldn\u0027t have gone through this cloak-and-dagger routine to put us together, now, would he? Disgraced former detective and a national security risk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" Her hackles came up at the disgraced part. She thought about the second part of Lucia\u0027s question a second later, with a blink of surprise. \"National security what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say that there are things I know that the government would rather I didn\u0027t. Being watched is nothing new for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then maybe these guys are your problem, not mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except they followed you into baggage claim.\" Lucia\u0027s body language hadn\u0027t altered at all - still languid and relaxed. \"Let\u0027s try something. You get up and walk away. Go to the bathroom. Don\u0027t look back. I\u0027m going to head outside to the taxi stand. Let\u0027s see who they tag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz frowned. \"I thought we were going to talk about this deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we will. Later.\" Lucia uncoiled herself from the chair and held out her hand. Jazz, rising, automatically took it. \"Watch your back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late. The woman was walking away, parting the crowd with the sheer force of her personality. Jazz shoved her hands in her pockets, rocked back and forth on her heels for a second, and then took off at right angles, heading for the bathroom. Her peripheral vision found the two men - identical buzz cuts, one blond, one brown. Both had the fit look of guys who could run down a suspect without any trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked right past them, but they didn\u0027t follow. In fact, they didn\u0027t follow Lucia, either. They stayed where they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe risked a glance back as she pushed open the restroom door. One of them was talking into his sleeve. Hidden microphone, very government-issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fished her cell phone out of the cradle, hit Recall and found the number, then dialed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" Lucia\u0027s cool voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve got radios. There are probably spotters on you out there. Watch yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they follow you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not into the ladies\u0027 room. Hang on.\" Jazz uncoiled the earpiece and plugged it in, hooked the cell back in its cradle. \"I want my hands free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea.\" Lucia sounded amused. \"I\u0027m staying in plain sight. At least it\u0027s difficult to start trouble in an airport these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, let\u0027s hope. So. What\u0027s the plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that I have one, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t hang out here all day. When you think it\u0027s safe, hail a cab and take it to my apartment.\" She gave her the address. As she was telling her cross streets, the door to the restroom banged open; Jazz stopped talking and began washing her hands, staring into the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jazz?\" Lucia\u0027s voice buzzed in her ear. \"Someone with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman who walked around the corner looked sleek and businesslike, wearing a tailored black jacket and black jeans, but there was something in her eyes, something...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong?\" Lucia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz reached for a towel. As she bent over, the woman angled toward her, moving fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Might be,\" Jazz said, and ducked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punch - intended for the back of her neck - sailed past to crash into glass. Jazz spun, still crouching, and drove the heel of her hand into the woman\u0027s solar plexus, sending her flying and gasping for air. She moved for the door -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it opened to admit the two crew cuts from baggage claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Jazz said loudly. \"This is the ladies\u0027 room, guys - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them grabbed for her arm. She danced backward, almost tripped over the woman, who was coming to her feet with a brutal look on her face, and retreated to the empty narrow area between the stalls and the wall. Not a lot to work with, but at least it was defensible, they could only come at her one at a time, and, Jesus, how had she gotten into this mess, anyway? She\u0027d been minding her own business, dammit, drinking her whiskey and drowning her sorrows, and now she was about to get the crap beaten out of her in a bathroom for a woman she\u0027d barely met and a check she hadn\u0027t even cashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia Garza said in her ear, \"I\u0027m coming. Don\u0027t do anything brave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Jazz said out loud, and ducked a punch. \"Brave is definitely not my style.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom was just too narrow for a decent fight, but at least it meant they couldn\u0027t use their numbers effectively, either. She backed up into the narrow aisle in front of the stalls until her back was against cold tile and snap-kicked toward the face of the man coming at her. It was a feint. When he flinched, she hooked her foot behind the bend of his left knee and pulled. His head hit the wall with a thick sound, and he went to one knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put him down with a fist to the temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up to see a blur coming at her and instinctively put up a parrying arm. The kick caught her on the forearm, and damn, it hurt; she gritted her teeth against the urge to yelp, wrapped her arm around the foot that had just come at her and yanked. Hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGirlfriend in the pantsuit slipped and nearly went down, caught herself and shifted her weight forward, slamming Jazz back against the wall, then breaking free with a twist of her hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody had a gun, knife, or even a taser. That was good, Jazz thought. Any kind of weapon would have ended this quick and ugly. At least this way, she\u0027d have a much slower defeat. Time for lots of things to happen, including miracles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second man shoved the woman out of the way and lunged to fasten his hands around Jazz\u0027s throat. He ran into her fist with his Adam\u0027s apple instead and fell back, gagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if they\u0027d gotten some secret signal, all three of her attackers suddenly stopped, backed off - even the one still shaking off her whack to his temple - and just looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it was creepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" the woman said, and moved to the door. The two men followed her. Single file, straight out into the airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty seconds later, the door banged open, and Lucia Garza entered, looking ready for anything - hands up, weight balanced on the balls of her feet, which in those shoes was something of an accomplishment. She looked around in a lightning-fast analysis, then focused on Jazz and raised her eyebrows in an eloquent what the hell? motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Party\u0027s over,\" Jazz said breathlessly. She was shaking, buzzing all over. Strangely ecstatic. She swiped the back of her hand across her mouth, looking for blood, and remembered that they hadn\u0027t actually laid a hand on her. Well, girlfriend in the pantsuit had kicked like a mule...Jazz skinned up her shirtsleeve and looked at the impact mark. Yep, that was going to bruise like a son of a bitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell happened?\" Lucia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tell me, you\u0027re the superspy. When people attack me, it\u0027s usually during the commission of a felony, not just because I took the wrong sink in the ladies\u0027 room.\" Jazz pushed away from the support of the tile wall and walked to the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was vivid and flushed, her eyes fever-bright. Even her hair looked better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, she enjoyed this stuff. That was probably sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" Lucia said, as if she\u0027d read her mind, \"need a hobby. Something nonviolent. Maybe macrame.\" She sounded amused, though. \"Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Jazz agreed. \"Probably a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking with Lucia wasn\u0027t like walking alone. For one thing, Jazz was used to blending in, slumping, avoiding people\u0027s eyes. McCarthy had always laughed about it, called her a chameleon; he\u0027d had the traditional cop presence and radiated an implicit threat even when sitting and reading the newspaper. But then, McCarthy hadn\u0027t worked undercover. She had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia Garza\u0027s aura was more like a runway model\u0027s. She drew stares as she stalked through the baggage-claim area, lean and elegant in her designer clothes. Jazz still felt invisible, but not in a good way. Next to Lucia Garza, most women would fade into wallpaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which way?\" Lucia asked, sliding on sunglasses as they exited the building. Jazz nodded toward the distant parking lot. She wished she\u0027d thought to pack some shades, but then, hers would have been clunky blue-blockers from a flea market. Lucia\u0027s had the sleek, finished look of sculpture and probably cost more than a car. Not that she was comparing or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia\u0027s bag went into the trunk, and Jazz scanned the area for signs of her restroom visitors. Nobody in sight. She had a prickling on the back of her neck, though, and wasn\u0027t surprised when Lucia, opening the passenger side, said, \"They\u0027re watching us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" Jazz ducked inside. They slammed doors at the same moment. Lucia jerked her chin a bare quarter inch in the direction of a white panel van sitting on the garage roof about five hundred yards away. As Jazz looked at it, it silently backed out of sight. \"Son of a bitch. Okay, I give up. What the hell is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you know more than I do!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia brushed long, dark hair back with a distracted air, and frowned. \"I picked up a tail at the hotel in Dallas,\" she said. \"Nothing obvious, but it was there. Professionals, like the guys in the airport just now. I don\u0027t know who they\u0027re working for. Although I have no idea why professionals would try to take you out in such a risky public setting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it isn\u0027t about me at all. Maybe it was related to your case. Whatever it is you\u0027re working.\" She didn\u0027t ask, but she left the door open in case Lucia wanted to share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should have known better. \"No. It\u0027s not germane,\" Lucia said. \"That was all done when these people showed up. And they arrived within an hour of the letter arriving at my hotel. Those things have to be connected, especially if they\u0027re here, following you, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz started the car and backed out of the parking space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" Lucia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know about you,\" Jazz replied, \"but I\u0027m already tired of being the one who doesn\u0027t know anything. I intend to change that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove downtown, to the business district, then off into a less Fortune 500, more industrial neighborhood. Office buildings went from sky-piercing steel and glass to squat, square, converted warehouses. She pulled in at the grimy curb next to one and picked up her cell phone. As Lucia watched silently, she paged through numbers until she found the one she wanted and connected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" A cautious voice on the other end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Manny, open up,\" she said. \"It\u0027s Jazz. I need an opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drive-through\u0027s closed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t pay me for the last opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that was a freebie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jazz, Jazz...I don\u0027t give freebies and you know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, I\u0027ll pay you this time. Double.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. He hung up. Jazz waited for a few seconds, and smiled as the grimy garage door a few yards down the street began rattling slowly up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as her car passed under it, the door reversed course and began jerking and clattering back down again. Manny didn\u0027t like open doors. \"Who\u0027s Manny?\" Lucia asked. She didn\u0027t sound bothered, for which Jazz had to give her points. If the situation had been reversed, Jazz was pretty sure she\u0027d have been firing off questions every ten seconds and jumping at every noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old friend,\" Jazz said, which didn\u0027t really answer anything, and killed the engine. She kept the headlights running, bathing the big concrete room in white light. The few spotlights were feeble and far between. Manny also wasn\u0027t big on paying electric bills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got out of the car, leaned against the cool metal and waited with her arms folded. The car shifted as Lucia got out on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wait,\" Jazz said. \"Oh, and keep your hands where he can see them. He\u0027s a little twitchy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twitchy?\" Lucia echoed grimly. \"Wonderful. I already like your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me. When someone\u0027s out to get you, the best friend you can have is a paranoid nutcase with skills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amen to that,\" said a dry, raspy voice out of the shadows. \"You know the rules, Jazz. Weapons on the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spread her jacket. \"No weapons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve gotta be kidding me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then who are you and what have you done with Jazz Callender?\" He sounded amused for a second, and then his raspy voice turned serious. \"I mean it. Knives, batons, tasers - everything on the ground, or I turn around and walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Manny, I got nothing. We came from the airport, for God\u0027s sake. You don\u0027t run around armed there, in case you missed the events of the last few years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny edged out of the shadows. He was a big man, not very clean, with a greasy tangle of black hair that he kept cut above too-large ears. Muddy green eyes that with a little polish would have knocked a girl dead, but when combined with his unattractive personal grooming habits, a perpetual slump to his broad shoulders, and a habit of flinching from loud noises...no, Manny wasn\u0027t exactly prime date material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that Jazz was in the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny was watching Lucia. \"What about her?\" he asked, and pointed. Jazz wasn\u0027t exactly a makeover fan, but even she winced from the state of his cuticles. \"She armed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She,\" Lucia said with absolute precision as she took off her sunglasses, \"is always armed. So you can just assume that and move on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny was already shaking his head, violently. \"No, no, no, Jazz, you know I don\u0027t do - I don\u0027t let - no, no, no - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on.\" She shot Lucia a look. Lucia tilted her head and gave her one right back, and this one clearly said I\u0027m not giving it up for your paranoid weirdo friend. Jazz lowered her voice and walked around to talk to her. \"Manny\u0027s a little freaky, but he\u0027s a good guy. Plus, this building has the best security in the city. He built it himself. He\u0027s really good at it. But he\u0027s got quirks, okay? You need to cut him a little slack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do we need him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I say we do,\" Jazz said. Simple. \"You can either trust me about this, or we can get in the car, drive out, and go our separate ways. Your choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia\u0027s dark eyes studied her for several long seconds, and then those elegantly outlined lips curved into a smile. \"All right,\" she said, and reached to her back with one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGun. Damn, Lucia had a gun. It was a small one, a .22 automatic, combat black. \"How the hell did you get that through airport security?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t,\" she replied, and put the weight of it into Jazz\u0027s hand. \"I sent it ahead to a courier and had him bring it. I palmed it on the way out of baggage claim from the man with the briefcase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz hadn\u0027t even noticed a man with a briefcase, except as part of the general wallpaper. There must have been a hundred fitting that description. She blinked, the weight of the gun heavy and warm in her palm, and then nodded as if she\u0027d known that all along. Not that Lucia appeared fooled, considering her smile. \"Uh-huh. Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Search me,\" Lucia invited, and spread her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, this isn\u0027t going to be that kind of relationship, believe me.\" Jazz bent over and put the gun on the ground, then held up both hands in the air and raised her voice for Manny. \"Yo! Gun on the ground! We\u0027re cool now, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny was dithering, half in shadow, half in the whitewash of the car headlights. Clearly spooked. \"I don\u0027t know, Jazz...you know I don\u0027t like it when you bring strangers...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not a stranger,\" she lied. \"Look, Manny, you do this for me and you get a free lunch. Plus the usual fee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her for a long, long moment. \"I don\u0027t do criminal. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a criminal case, Manny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No murders. No rapes. No violent crimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s maybe fraud, and that\u0027s a maybe.\" She was seriously stretching the truth, and saw Lucia watching her with slightly raised eyebrows. \"You won\u0027t need to do anything but give me results. No depositions. No trials.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed, wiped his sweaty face with his grimy sleeve and nodded. \"Yeah, okay,\" he agreed. \"But only because it\u0027s you, all right? Follow me, ladies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia started to pick up the gun. Jazz kicked it under the car with a skitter of metal on concrete, then reached through the window to shut off the headlights. Darkness closed in around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to do that,\" she said. \"Really. You don\u0027t. Manny may look like some squirrelly little pushover. He isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey followed Manny to the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs was a different world. This didn\u0027t come as a shock to Jazz, but she saw it register on Lucia as Manny keyed a code into a lock and opened the door at the top of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause beyond was a state-of-the-art science lab, segmented by movable clear glass partitions. Beyond that was a thick leather couch and widescreen HDTV that doubled as Manny\u0027s living area. Green hospital curtains hung on suspended rods hid the open-forum bathroom - which, Jazz had cause to know, was an interior designer\u0027s wet dream of gleaming marble, Jacuzzi tub and spa shower - and the bedroom, which she\u0027d only glimpsed but looked good enough that if she lived here, she\u0027d never get out of bed. Manny shooed them away from the lab part of the room and toward the living room. He combed fingers through his disordered hair and avoided their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, yeah, sorry, I don\u0027t get a lot of - visitors - sit. Sit down.\" He moved newspapers and piled them on a glass side table, then picked up the remote control and clicked the TV to some high-definition channel doing a travelogue of China. No sound. \"So. Um, tell me what you want. Oh, and hi, by the way. I\u0027m Manny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last went to Lucia, who was standing, staring in bemusement. Jazz patted the couch. Lucia sank down gracefully, hands in her lap. Studying Manny like a new and alien life-form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Lucia,\" Jazz said. \"I\u0027ve got two documents for you, plus envelopes. I want the full ride. Everything you can give me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny couldn\u0027t seem to tear his attention away from Lucia. Apparently, his hormones weren\u0027t dead. \"Takes time,\" Manny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also, the full ride doesn\u0027t come cheap. And hey, I\u0027m only saying that because, you know, I\u0027ve got to pay for upkeep around here, supplies, stuff...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazz winced inside, but smiled and nodded. \"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two documents? Three grand. That includes my time and materials, by the way. Plus, you get to, um, stay here if you want. Wait on the results.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHotel Manny. He did have a nice place - scrupulously clean - but she could see Lucia was starting to wish she\u0027d crawled under the car to retrieve the gun. \"That\u0027s a nice gesture, but how about if we come back later? You call me when you\u0027re ready with the results?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um...sure.\" Manny stared at her with his slightly off-kilter eyes. \"Jazz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this about Mac?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027s not about Mac.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Cause you know I\u0027d do it for free if - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not about Mac. But I\u0027ll tell him.\" Ben McCarthy, she knew, would shake his head and roll his eyes, but he\u0027d appreciate it somewhere deep down. Manny was a twitch, but he was an honest one. In some ways, he was also the bravest guy she\u0027d ever met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the plastic bag out of her jacket and handed over her letter; Lucia did the same. Manny raised the evidence bags, thick eyebrows going up, and stared at Jazz through the plastic. \"You\u0027re sure it isn\u0027t murder or something? \u0027Cause I\u0027m getting a weird vibe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a cop anymore, you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well...still. It looks hinky, Jazz. There\u0027s blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That falls under the heading of bar mayhem, not murder. Two guys tried to start something with me. They\u0027ll live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you want DNA profile on the blood, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want every scrap of information you can pull off of either one of those, right? Everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny nodded. \"Okay. Everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got any idea how long...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-four hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not outsourcing, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything gets done here,\" he said, and gave her an almost charming grin. \"Jeez, grow up. Who would I trust?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a really good point. \"Call me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-bargain-red-letter-days-1/page-2.html","bookId":2310,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:03 PM"}
