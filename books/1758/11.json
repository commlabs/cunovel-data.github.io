Then, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Sirians would certainly want to know how the ship actually worked. If their method of spying is foolproof, as it has been till now, why not continue it on board the ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you\u0027re saying, then, is that one of the fourteen men on board the Jovian Moon is a robot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is exactly what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the men aboard ship have been chosen long since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Sirians would know the reasons for choosing and the method of choice just as they know everything else about the project and they would maneuver their humanoid robot so as to have him chosen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s giving them a lot of credit,\" muttered Panner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I admit it,\" said Lucky. \"There is an alternative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That the humanoid robot is aboard as a stowaway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very unlikely,\" said Panner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But quite possible. It might easily have boarded the ship in the confusion before the commander made his christening speech. I tried to watch the ship then, but it was impossible. Furthermore, nine tenths of the ship seems to be made up of engine compartment, so there must be plenty of room to hide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner thought about it. \"Not as much room as you might think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still we must search the ship. Will you do that, Dr. Panner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. As chief engineer, you would know the contents of the engine compartment better than anyone else. We\u0027ll go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. It\u0027s a fool\u0027s errand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there is no stowaway, Dr. Panner, we have still gained something. We\u0027ll know we can restrict our consideration to the men legally aboard ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just three of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said quietly, \"Whom can we trust to help us, when anyone we might ask might be the robot we\u0027re looking for? Let us not discuss this any further, Dr. Panner. Are you willing to help us search the ship? I am asking your help in my capacity as a member of the Council of Science.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly Panner got to his feet. \"I suppose I must then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey clambered down the hand holds of the narrow shaft leading to the first engine level. The light was subdued and, naturally, indirect, so that the huge structures on either side cast no shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sound, no slightest hum to indicate activity or to show that vast forces were being trapped and dealt with. Bigman, looking about, was appalled to find that nothing seemed familiar; that of the ordinary workings of a space ship, such as that of their own Shooting Starr, nothing seemed left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s closed in,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner nodded and said in a low voice, \"Everything is as automatic as possible. The need for human intervention has been cut to the minimum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about repairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There shouldn\u0027t have to be any,\" the engineer said grimly. \"We have alternate circuits and duplicated equipment at every step, all allowing for automatic cut-in after self-check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner moved ahead, guiding them through the narrow openings but moving always slowly as though at any moment he expected someone, or some thing, to hurl itself murderously upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevel by level, methodically moving out from the central shaft along the side channels, Panner probed each bit of room with the sureness of the expert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually they came to a halt at the very bottom, hard against the large tail jets through which the glowing hyperatomic forces (when the ship was in ordinary flight) pressed backward to push the ship forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom within the ship the test jets showed as four smooth pipes, each twice as thick as a man, burrowing into the ship and ending in the tremendous featureless structures that housed the hyperatomic motors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman, said, \"Hey, the jets! Inside!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Panner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? A robot could hide there fine. It\u0027s open space, but what\u0027s that to a robot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hyperatomic thrusts,\" said Lucky, \"would be plenty to it and there\u0027ve been a number of those till an hour ago. No, the jets are out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" said Panner, \"there\u0027s no one anywhere in the engine compartments. No thing, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. There isn\u0027t a place we haven\u0027t looked, and the route I followed made it impossible for anything to get around and behind us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir voices made small echoes in the lengths of shafts behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said, \"Sands of Mars, that leaves us with the fourteen regulars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said thoughtfully, \"Less than that. Three of the men aboard ship showed emotion: Commander Donahue, Harry Norrich, Red Summers. That leaves eleven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner said, \"Don\u0027t forget me. I disobeyed an order. That leaves ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That raises an interesting point,\" said Lucky. \"Do you know anything about robotics?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I?\" said Panner. \"Never dealt with a robot in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" said Lucky. \"Earthmen invented the positronic robot and developed most of the refinements, yet, except for a few specialists, the Earth technician knows nothing about robotics, simply because we don\u0027t use robots to any extent. It isn\u0027t taught in the schools and it doesn\u0027t come up in practice. I myself know the Three Laws and not too much more. Commander Donahue couldn\u0027t even quote the Three Laws. The Sirians, on the other hand, with a robot-saturated economy, must be past masters at all the subtleties of robotics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I spent a good deal of time yesterday and today with a book-film on advanced robotics, that I found in the project library. It was the only book on the subject, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" said Panner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It became obvious to me that the Three Laws aren\u0027t as simple as one might think... Let us move on, by the way. We can give the engine levels a double check on the way back.\" He was moving across this lowest level as he spoke, looking with keen interest at his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky continued, \"For instance, I might think it would only be necessary to give each man on the ship a ridiculous order and note whether it be obeyed. As a matter of fact, I did think so. But that isn\u0027t necessarily true. It is theoretically possible to adjust the positronic brain of a robot to obey only those orders that belong naturally to the line of its duties. Orders that are contrary to those duties or irrelevant to them may still be obeyed provided that they are preceded by certain words which act as a code or by the person who gives the orders identifying himself in a certain way. In this manner a robot can be handled in all ways by its proper overseers and yet be insensitive to strangers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner, who had placed his hands on the holds that would guide the men up to the next higher level, released them. He turned to face Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"You mean when you told me to take off my shirt and I didn\u0027t obey, that meant nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say it could have meant nothing, Dr. Panner, since taking off your shirt at that moment was no part of your regular duties, and my order might not have been stated in the proper form.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027re accusing me of being a robot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It isn\u0027t likely that you are. The Sirians, in choosing some member of the project to replace by a robot, would scarcely choose the chief engineer. For the robot to do that job properly, it would have to know so much about Agrav that the Sirians couldn\u0027t supply the knowledge. Or, if they could, they would have no need to spy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" said Panner, sourly, turning toward the hand holds again, but now Bigman\u0027s voice rang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold it, Panner!\" The small Martian had his ready needle-gun in his fist. He said, \"Wait a minute, Lucky, how do we know he knows anything about Agrav? We\u0027re just assuming that. He never showed us any knowledge. When the Jovian Moon shifted to Agrav, where was he? Sitting on his squatter in his quarters with us, that\u0027s where he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"I thought of that, too, Bigman, and that\u0027s one reason I brought Panner down here. He\u0027s obviously acquainted with the engines. I\u0027ve watched him inspect everything and he couldn\u0027t have done it with such assurance if he weren\u0027t an expert on the workings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that suit you, Martian?\" Panner demanded with suppressed anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman put his needle-gun away, and without a further word Panner scrambled up the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped off at the next level, working through it a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner said, \"All right, that leaves ten men: two army officers, four engineers, four workmen. What dp you propose to do? X-ray each of them separately? Something like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky shook his head. \"That\u0027s too risky. Apparently the Sirians have been known to use a cute little trick to protect themselves. They\u0027ve been known to use robots to carry messages or to perform tasks which the individual giving the orders wanted to be kept secret. Now obviously a robot can\u0027t keep a secret if a human being asks him, in the proper fashion, to reveal it. What the Sirians do, then, is to install an explosive device in the robot which is triggered by any attempt to force the robot to give away the secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean if you put an X-ray on the robot, it will explode?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a very good chance that it would. Its greatest secret is its identity, and it may be triggered for every attempt to discover that identity that the Sirians could think of.\" Lucky added regretfully, \"They hadn\u0027t counted on a V-frog; there was no trigger against that. They had to order the robot to kill the V-frog directly. Or that might have been preferable anyway, since it managed to keep the robot alive undetected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t the robot be harming humans nearby if it exploded? Wouldn\u0027t it be breaking First Law?\" asked Panner with a trace of sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t. It would have no control over the explosion. The triggering would be the result of the sound of a certain question or the sight of a certain action, not the result of anything the robot itself would do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crawled up to still another level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what do you expect to do, Councilman?\" demanded Panner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Lucky said frankly. \"The robot must be made to give itself away somehow. The Three Laws, however modified and fancified, must apply. It\u0027s only a question of being sufficiently acquainted with robotics to know how to take advantage of those Laws. If I knew how to force the robot into some action that would show it to be non-human without activating any explosive device with which it might be equipped; if I could manipulate the Three Laws so as to force one to conflict with another sufficiently strongly to paralyze the creature completely; if I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner broke in impatiently, \"Well, if you expect help from me, Councilman, it\u0027s no use. I\u0027ve told you already I know nothing of robotics.\" He whirled suddenly. \"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman looked about, too. \"I didn\u0027t hear anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWordlessly Panner squeezed past them, dwarfed by the bending metal tube on either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had gone almost as far as he could, the other two following, when he muttered, \"Someone might have squeezed in among the rectifiers. Let me pass again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky stared, frowning, into what was almost a forest of twisting cables that enclosed them in a complete dead end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"It seems clear to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can test it for sure,\" Panner said tightly. He had opened a panel in the wall nearby and now he reached in cautiously, looking over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t move,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman said testily, \"Nothing\u0027s happened. There\u0027s nothing there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner relaxed. \"I know it. I asked you not to move because I didn\u0027t want to slice an arm off when I established the force field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What force field?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve shorted a force field right across the corridor. You can\u0027t move out of there any more than you could if you were encased in solid steel three feet thick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman yelled, \"Sands of Mars, Lucky, he is the robot!\" His hand lunged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner cried at once, \"Don\u0027t try the needle-gun. Kill me and how do you ever get out?\" He stared at them, dark eyes sparking, his broad shoulders hunched. \"Remember, energy can get through a force field but matter can\u0027t, not even air molecules. You\u0027re airtight in there. Kill me and you\u0027ll suffocate long before anyone happens to come across you down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said he was the robot,\" said Bigman in raging despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanner laughed shortly, \"You\u0027re wrong. I\u0027m not a robot. But if there is one, I know who it is.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-moons-of-jupiter-lucky-starr-5/page-11.html","bookId":1758,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:21 AM"}
