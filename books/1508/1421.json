When he had approached Lin Ming, Lin Ming hadn’t taken even half a step backwards. The reason that Lin Ming had dared to allow a body transformation martial artist to come close was not because of his own body transformation technique but because of his grandmist space. The smaller the area of the grandmist space was, the greater its might would be!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn other words, from the very start Lin Ming hadn’t feared close combat at all. When Imperial Prince Naqi had approached him he already had a plan laid out. Lin Ming had waited for the moment that Naqi attacked to launch his own counterattack and take him by surprise.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, the sure-win strike had failed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was startled. Even though he didn’t underestimate Naqi, he never imagined that Naqi would be able to attain such high comprehension in the Laws as a saint race martial artist.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that instant, Naqi had utilized three different Laws. In particular, the Space and Time Laws. Although he hadn’t been able to achieve the degree of proficiency that Lin Ming had reached, he had still steadily reached the fifth level Concept. If he used it for just defense then he was only slightly worse than Lin Ming, and this slight difference had caused his chest to be stabbed by the Phoenix Blood Spear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaqi’s defensive powerful was horrifying. It was impossible for that light stab to pierce his heart. Even though Lin Ming was able to break apart Naqi’s tough skin that was as hard as divine iron, that was entirely due to the powerful strength brought to him by the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even be able to leave behind a flesh wound!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Naqi is injured!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany people noticed the blood leaking out from between Naqi’s fingers. The saint martial artists were so shocked that they couldn’t even speak.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn their minds, Naqi was an invincible existence amongst his peers. The only one that could challenge Naqi was the Good Fortune Saint Son if he had reversed his age by several dozen years!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd yet this Naqi was actually injured.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone could see that the spear strike had only caused a light wound to his skin and flesh that didn’t even affect Naqi’s combat efficient. Even if that strike were to hit a human’s body, it still wouldn’t affect their combat strength, but those saint martial artists found this hard to believe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was because Naqi was a legendary existence in their minds!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe human martial artists all gripped their fists, not cheering. They only looked at the battlefield, nervousness in their eyes. In that exchange just now they hadn’t been able to understand anything at all, and the result was an unknown to him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaqi looked at his bloodstained hands. He stretched out his tongue and licked his bloodstained fingers, looking like a demonic monster.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I didn’t expect that not only would you have inherited Empyrean Primordius’ legacy but that you would also have practiced the Grandmist Heavenly Dao to such a degree. I’ve underestimated you.” As Naqi spoke, the muscles on his chest began to wriggle about. The wound that Lin Ming left behind was regenerating at a visible speed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat an abnormal restorative power!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sort of regenerative ability was even greater than Lin Ming’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming watched as the wound he left behind vanished. He coldly said, “I also didn’t think that even though you are a saint you would comprehend the Laws, and also to such a high boundary.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hahaha!” Naqi laughed. “In the 33 Layered Heavens Dao, the essence gathering system has 11 layers. The ‘Seek Nine Falls and find the Nine Divine Shifts’ that humanity practices is only a single variation. In this world there is also an essence gathering system that my saint race can cultivate. Did you think that only you could dual cultivate body and energy and that I could not?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes, whether it is humans or saints, both are equal. The saints excel in body transformation and humans excel in essence gathering. This also means that the ‘Seek Nine Falls and find the Nine Divine Shifts’ that humanity practices is the strongest essence gathering system of the 11 Daos! Now, let us see just who among us is more powerful!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhether it was Lin Ming or Naqi, both of them dual cultivated in body and energy. They were both unrivalled geniuses in this aspect, stepping on similar paths as if guided by the hands of fate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, Lin Ming not only dual cultivated body and energy, but triple cultivated essence, energy, and soul.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe believed that even though following this path of cultivation was difficult, it was necessary if he wished to find the road which led to the peak of martial arts, because that was the most universal truth in the world.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming and Imperial Prince Naqi collided once more. Their overwhelming momentum caused the earth to shake.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA terrifying shockwave rushed out like a tide, extending to infinity!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming and Imperial Prince Naqi both launched into a brutal melee. Each strike was devastating, creating massive craters in the ground and filling the skies with dust. As one looked down from the heavens, they could see a giant bowl-shaped pit being slowly dug out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn just a moment, the towering Ash Blood Mountain had been reduced to a desert. Countless rocks were turned into powder, crazily sweeping through the world in giant storms.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Interesting, interesting! You are a match that is worthy for me to be excited about! But what a pity, your grandmist space cannot be filled with grandmist energy at all times, otherwise your true essence cannot endure. I know that stimulating the grandmist energy that is as heavy as stars places a tremendous burden and level of consumption on your body! If this is the limit of your skill then your loss has already been decided!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaqi wildly cackled. Atop his spear, a divine fire lit up.

His arms became sturdier and thicker and meridian channels spread through his fingers, twisting about like worms. His entire being filled with strength and even his shoes split apart as clawed feet appeared, similar to a dragon’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn his head, curved horns grew out just like a devil. Then, with a flapping sound, a pair of giant wings unfolded behind Naqi’s back. As these two wings spread out, their wingspan was actually 30 feet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eImperial Prince Naqi had transformed his body once more.

The giant halberd edge was cold and bright like a scythe. The shaft was as thick as an arm, and not even a grown man would be able to grasp it in one hand.
