They always leave the kids behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts a finger to her lips, \"Shh you hear that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listen. All I hear is my own heartbeat and it dawns on me that as she natters on, she listens to the forest song the way I do. I don’t hear them. No birds, no squirrels. I stop walking. I pull an arrow instantly and hold the bow ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA branch breaks to the side of us. I swing the bow with the arrow trembling in my hands. A huge black bear groans and walks past us on the ridge below us. Leo growls and crouches. He looks at me but I shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t turn our back on it. We walk up the hill backwards until the bear is far enough away. Leo\u0027s dark hackles stay up until he starts sniffing the ground again. He wanders in a circle for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So then I was saying to Momma…hey look I think he has a smell. Not totally useless is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hands up, \"What? He\u0027s no hound but I think he\u0027s got the scent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow him through the thick woods until suddenly he stops walking. We\u0027ve hiked for hours and this is the most animated I\u0027ve seen him. He growls in his low tone and crawls along the forest floor on his belly. We follow him low to the ground. I am scanning the forest but I see nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There.\" Meg points to a man wearing camouflage high up in a tree. He holds a sniper rifle. There is no way we will get around him. I pull my bow out but Meg stops my hand and points to a man in another tree just behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wait for dark.\" She whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her and frown, \"Where is your home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brown eyes look haunted, \"It\u0027s back closer to the town by the big river. Momma was taken when they were looking for some girl. They searched all the houses and found my aunty Lisa and Momma hiding. They didn’t find me. I snuck out the back and over the pointy log wall. The others snatched me outside the gates. The hunters were long gone though, so they were gonna wait for them to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was me.\" The words slip from my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crouches in some larger bush and sits and waits for nightfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI speak after a while. I feel awkward in her silence. She\u0027s never silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can help you find your mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She never got taken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where would she go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing Momma she went to hell. She was a mean and spiteful woman. Full of piss and vinegar is what Aunty Lisa always said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hits me like a club to the face, \"She died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg glances at me, \"I told what she always said. You do whatever it takes to not go there. They woulda put her in the fields anyway. Her insides were injured having me. She couldn’t have more babies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to cry. She had a mother. She had someone. It feels like it\u0027s my fault somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really sorry Meg. Do you have anywhere you can go? Do you have other people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"Nope it was me and Momma and aunty Lisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t ever leave her. No matter what I won\u0027t ever leave her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day fades to night slowly. Spring is further along and the days are longer. The cool air is still fresh and crisp but the sun is getting warmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo sleeps against me and Meg whittles a small piece of wood. She passes me the finished product. I don’t know what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a rook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For chess.\" She says it like I\u0027m an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and smiles, \"I\u0027m making the pieces for a board. I guess I have to start over. Mine were in our village.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look confused, \"You have a village?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"Nope. Had. The others came last month and burned it to the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Life is hard Meg. I\u0027m convinced the god that everyone talked about before, hates us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brown eyes harden and she pulls her dark brown hair back from her filthy little face, \"Don\u0027t ever say that Em. No matter what we have to believe that he\u0027s going to help us. The evil is us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo jumps up but it\u0027s too late. As I hear the branch snap behind me I see the black hood go over Meg\u0027s little face. I jump up but the guns are on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have we got here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man standing before me is grinning. He holds a rifle at my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo is ready to attack but I put my hand out, \"No Leo. No.\" He looks at my face confused. I can see it in his eyes. I shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the man, \"We\u0027ll walk with you but you can\u0027t put that over my head. If he can\u0027t see my eyes he\u0027s going to lose it and kill at least one of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"You walk with the wolf. I will kill him if I have to.\" He removes the black hood from Meg, who looks like Leo. I give her a sharp look too, \"No Meg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know the desperation on her face is trying to over take, I feel the same way. But we can\u0027t win the fight. We can die like her mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other guys with a gun smirks at me. He\u0027s young and bold looking. He speaks to me and I can hear the smile on his face, \"I\u0027d ask if you were spies for the others but you\u0027re girls. What girls would help them out? So that leaves me with only one assumption,\" He grins and nudges me, \"You\u0027re looking for a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown at him. I don’t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg snorts, \"You wish. No we\u0027re looking for our friends. The others had us but we got away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoot her a dirty look. She scowls, \"Don\u0027t give me that look Em. Momma says we need to remember some ways of the world before and manners is one of the things we all seems to forget about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the gun smiles, \"Her momma sounds like the kind of girl we are always looking for. Warm my bed, bake my bread and say please and thank you like a lady should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg shoves him, \"My momma never warmed no man\u0027s bed. She weren’t no lady. She was a survivor. She was a fighter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoves Meg back. I catch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader gets in my face with his gun. I look up into his dark blue eyes angrily, \"Her mom just died creating a diversion for her to escape the hunters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes a face that surprises me, remorseful, \"I\u0027m sorry Meg, is it? Never speak ill of the dead, unless they\u0027re one of the monsters who started all of this.\" He holds his hands out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sniffs and wipes her nose on her arm, \"It aint no thing. She died the way she wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know the pain Meg feels and the strength she hides behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes tell me he does too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo nudges against me. He is nervous. He whines. I look as we enter a huge camp. The fires are lit making the woods smoky and smell of food. My mouth waters as my stomach grumbles. I don’t remember the last time we really ate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New recruits?\" A man asks looking me up and down and nodding his head. Leo lunges at him. I seriously think the wolf can read minds and that man\u0027s mind is not pure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jumps back, \"Holy shit is that a timber wolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. I can\u0027t help myself. Leo is hovering over him snarling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men who\u0027ve escorted us laugh at the fallen man. I call him, \"Leo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snarls once more and runs to my side. He stands tall and proud with his chest out. He snarls at everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have my friends here don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the smile frowns, \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A girl and a guy. They\u0027re brother and sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrow, \"No one has come recently. Except you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don’t lie to me. He\u0027s tall with dark hair and blue eyes. He has an injury on his leg. She is younger and about my size. She has dark hair and blue eyes too. They look alike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"Look we don’t have anyone here. We don’t take prisoners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the guns surrounding us and raise my eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"You were spying on us and have a huge timber wolf as a pet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t laugh. I want Jake and Anna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg gives me a look, \"Why would he bring us here if they\u0027re not here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"The smell of food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy with the gun in my face points to Leo, \"Keep him under control and we can drop the weapons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pat Leo on the head and scratch his ears. He shakes his head once. He still is agitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camp is like nothing I\u0027ve ever seen. It reminds me of the band of merry men Robin Hood joins in the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a noise I\u0027ve never heard before. I turn my head when I see where it comes from. A small boy with white blond hair runs past me. He has his arms stretched out. He latches on to Leo, making me jump to his rescue but Leo looks at me and lowers his body for the child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Andy no. Not the wolf. Oh my god I\u0027m so sorry.\" A dark haired woman walks up to me. She looks older, maybe thirty. She\u0027s dressed in a long gathered skirt and a blouse. She\u0027s pretty in a simple way. She looks at Meg and smiles motherly, \"We need to get you cleaned up and get some food in that belly. You look like you must be starved.\" She looks at the man next to me, \"Watch him for me while I get her taken care of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man nods and kneels next to the boy who is shrieking and hugging my huge wolf. Leo pants contented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name is Leo. Be careful okay Andy.\" The man puts a hand out for Leo to sniff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeg gives me a pleading look as she is dragged off. I want to reach for her but I don\u0027t. The woman with the brown hair has dark doe eyes that instantly make me comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around and notice that there are fires everywhere. Small tents line the forest and lean-tos are staggered amongst them. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it. Clothes hang from lines in the trees. The canopy provides the perfect shelter. I feel like I\u0027ve entered a sacred site. Everyone is bustling about, as if on a mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is like the Shire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve read The Hobbit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy neck almost snaps as I look back at him, \"Yes. Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and pats Leo once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolfie wolfie wolfie.\" The white haired angel cries into Leo\u0027s dark fur. Leo looks done with the hug. He struggles to escape. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-12.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
