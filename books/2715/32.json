My legs were still shaking with relief as I exited the store and crawled into my beat-up old junker of a tin can car. But when I started the engine, I just sat there, realizing I had nowhere to go. As of half an hour ago, I was officially homeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the joy and elation I’d felt in the bathroom began to ebb. Then the fresh memory of catching my boyfriend—oh right, ex-boyfriend—screwing one of his coworkers doggie style on my kitchen table half an hour ago obliterated all my happy thoughts completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shoulders slumped, depression crept in, and my chest went tight as my throat dried up like I was about to—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap! I was going to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I absolutely, unequivocally refused to cry over this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God, I needed reinforcements before I turned into a freaking watering pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had friends. I should call one of them. But when I dug my phone out of my purse, I realized the battery had died...and my phone charger was still at my former residence where I had lived up until half an hour ago with my ex-boyfriend, and I was only returning there after hell froze over. Twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blew out a long breath, forcing my body to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could do this. I could handle whatever happened next. My life had been at worse places than this, and I’d survived then. I could surely survive this little hiccup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat revitalized by my mini-pep-thought, I put the car into gear and drove to the first house that sprang to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was located in a nice, peaceful, modest neighborhood. The branches of the trees lining the street swayed lightly in the autumn breeze, making me miss my childhood woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I hadn’t entered them in six years, and I knew if I ever did, the memories would no doubt slay me. So I tore my attention from the flaming red maples, pushed from my car, and made my way up the front walk until I was on a covered porch and ringing a doorbell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ten-year old who answered immediately yelled, “Zombie attack,” when he saw me. Then he ran off, screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn any other day, I would’ve chased after him, croaking “Brains,” with my arms outstretched and my head canted to the side, but today, I just couldn’t get with the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I stood there, by myself, in the opened front door, pathetic and a little mangled, if not completely broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Colton, who’s at the—” A brunette popped her head into the living room to see me still hanging out in the entrance. “Oh! Felicity. Hi, come on in. What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and stepped into the house. “Hey, Aspen.” I gave her a friendly wave and then a forced smile as I closed the door behind me. “You have any time for some girl talk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For you? Of course. Follow me back to the kitchen. I’m trying to make homemade noodles for chicken noodle soup. The guys always go gaga whenever I make anything homemade, and I get a kick out of their exaggerated reactions, so it’s become kind of an addiction of mine to cook up new surprises for them. Can I get you anything to drink?” she asked as we entered the brightly lit room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God, yes.” Nothing sounded as good as alcohol right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Iced tea?” she asked, making me frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean, Long Island Iced Tea, right?” I corrected—pleaded, really—as I slumped into a chair at the table and rested my face in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced back at me and lifted an eyebrow. “Ah, so this is going to be one those talks, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and closed my weary eyes. “Unfortunately yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of cabinet doors opening and ice in a glass were like music to my ears. When Aspen sat across from me and slid a cup my way, I sat up and took a fortifying breath. After a long, deep drink that made my eyes water, I let out a refreshed sigh and sent Aspen my most sincere look of gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. You’re amazing. I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed and waved away my gushing praise. “Just talk. I’m dying of curiosity over here. What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right.” I cleared my throat and stiffened my back. “So, I walked into my apartment about an hour ago, only to interrupt Cam screwing some other girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAspen gasped and slapped her hands over her mouth. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “Oh, yes.” Gifting her with one of my overly forced smiles, I added, “And when I confronted them, I discovered he was actually ready to dump me and have her move in...without discussing it with me first. In fact, her clothes were already hanging in my closet.” After a bitter laugh, I asked, “What a way to break it to a girl easy, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t...this is just... He seriously cheated on you?” Aspen blinked before asking, “Is he stupid or something?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-32.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
