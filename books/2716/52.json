It pounds onto the beach, sending up white froths of spray, as I slip through the gate of Mrs. Palmer’s house and into the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverywhere the shards of glass slice up out of the sand like shark fins slicing through water. The air here by the ocean is thick and hot to breathe. I raise the nine-iron in my hand; it feels heavy and solid. I bring it down hard against the nearest shard, half expecting the club to bounce off it. But the glass shatters, spiderwebbing out into a million cracks. A white puff of smoke rises from it, like an exhalation of cigarette smoke, and dissipates into the night air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand there breathing hard, holding the club. And then I swing again, and again. The air is full of the lovely, silvery sound of shattering glass. A light goes on suddenly—the porch light of the house—stabbing into my eyes, but I keep swinging, bashing glass after glass after glass, until something seizes the other end of the nine-iron and it’s wrenched viciously out of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Palmer is standing in front of me. She no longer looks perfectly put-together; her hair is damp and tangled, her eyes wide and wild. She’s wearing a long black dress, cap-sleeved, old-fashioned. She really does look like a witch. “What do you think you’re doing?” she half screams. “This is private property, my property—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These don’t belong to you,” I tell her. My voice is steady, but I can’t help backing up a step or two; my flip-flops crunch on the ground. “They’re souls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gapes at me. “Souls?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever you want to call them. The lives you’ve stolen. You put them in the mirrors. That’s where you keep them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice is a snarl. “You’re crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw you do it,” I tell her. “I saw what you did to Evan. I was looking through the window.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth opens, and then I see her eyes go to the key in my left hand. “Damaris,” she says. “That woman is a meddler. She never knows when to stay out of other people’s business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to leave my stepbrother alone,” I tell her. “I want you to let Evan go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her anger her red lips curl into a smile. “Damaris must have told you it’s not that easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you don’t let him go, I’ll come back—I’ll smash the rest of these—I’ll tell everyone where you’re keeping the souls, and then everyone will know—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your stepbrother,” she says. “He used to talk about you. He knew you had a crush on him. He said he found it amusing.” The anger is gone from her voice now; it has a lilt to it, the way she’d talked to Evan when she offered him the bottle of juice. “You were a joke to him, Violet. So why are you putting so much of your energy into saving him now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurts, what she says. I tell myself she’s lying, but it hurts anyway, a sharp sting, like getting lemon juice in a shallow cut. I take a breath. “I love him. Damaris said he could only be helped by someone who loves him—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he doesn’t love you,” she says. “That is how men are. They take the love you give them and they twist it until it becomes a stick to beat you with.” She glances at the club in her hand; her look is vicious. “Tell me I have no right to even the score, Violet. Tell me you wouldn’t do the same in my place. Men are a curse on women’s lives and you know it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my mind I see Phillip and my mother at his feet, picking fruit off the ground with bleeding fingers. “I don’t know what I think about men,” I say. “But Evan is only a boy. He isn’t good or evil or anything else yet. He shouldn’t be punished.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He will grow up to be like the rest of them,” says Mrs. Palmer, who murdered her husband in his own bed. In a distant sort of voice, she continues, “They all do. That is why I will not give him up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of Anne Palmer’s husband, the man with the stick. “Damaris said you wouldn’t give Evan up for nothing,” I say. “But he’s young and weak. What if I could find you something even better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst the darkness, like the sudden, startling gleam of a firefly’s light, I see Anne Palmer’s smile. “Tell me,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake in the morning to bright sunlight and the sound of birds. I lie in my netted bed for a long series of moments. It would be easy to think that last night never happened, any of it, but when I turn my head, I see the plastic bottle sitting on my bedside table next to the alarm clock. The pale liquid inside it shines with a rainbow slipperiness, like an oil slick. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacations-from-hell/page-52.html","bookId":2716,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM"}
