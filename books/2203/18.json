I peeled off my wet coat and sniffed. Only the faintest smell of smoke - both demon and wood - lingered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost smiled, so happy was I to see Noelle. She was such a nice, normal woman in a world that seemed oddly shy of normalcy. \"Yes, his name is Sebastian. I hope you didn\u0027t wake him; he\u0027s been very ill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t go into the room, just peeked in when I was checking for imps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, she was almost normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" I set down my bag, well away from the lake of water that was forming at my feet. \"I take it we\u0027re imp-free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, her fingers tracing the carving on the side of the banister. \"Yes, but there\u0027s a very confused mouse in the pantry. It was sharing its home with an imp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. Well, as I don\u0027t know the name of any good mice therapists, I guess it\u0027ll just have to work things out on its own. Would you mind coming into the study for a couple of minutes? I have a little proposition I\u0027d like to make.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sexual or professional?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped midway up the stairs. \"Do I look like I\u0027m about to make a sexual advance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let her gaze wander from my sodden feet, up to my jeans, with mud and water splashed up to my waist, up farther to my damp sweater that had been pulled out of shape when I stuffed the doll under it, finally coming to my face. I had a feeling the long hours with no sleep, not to mention the battle to save Sebastian, and the wear and tear on my nerves at seeing Christian willingly submit to Asmodeus had left my eyes a bit bloodshot. My eyes are not attractive at their best, but bloodshot and tired...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle shuddered delicately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That bad, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a small smile. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve seen better days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and trudged damply up the stairs, ignoring the pain in my leg just as I always did, suddenly feeling the weight of the world bearing down on me. Life seemed so intolerable without Christian. I knew just how impossible it was going to be for me to live without him. Either we managed a life together, or...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going down without taking a few of them with me,\" I said in a growl as I pushed open the door to Christian\u0027s study. Esme bustled toward me, Honoria leaping up and following quickly behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Allie, I\u0027m so relieved to see you! Poor Honoria was beside herself with worry - well, we both were, naturally, but I see you\u0027ve brought a friend with you. Hello, I\u0027m Esme Cartwright. You must be that nice Guardian who\u0027s taken care of the demon and imps. Allie, why are you so damp?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know we had imps,\" I protested as I collapsed with a wet noise into Christian\u0027s chair. \"Esme, Honoria, this is Noelle. She is indeed the Guardian Christian called. I take it you finished with Sarra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle nodded and took the seat opposite the desk, smiling at Honoria. \"That\u0027s a very pretty doll. Does it have a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria scooted behind Esme until just the tips of her soft brown curls peeked out from behind Esme\u0027s bathrobe. \"Bettina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a nice name as well. Is Allie going to Release you and Bettina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and slumped over the desk until my forehead was resting on my arms. Water rolled off my hair and puddled around my wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She couldn\u0027t do it,\" the little ghost had the nerve to snap. She came around from behind Esme and pointed at me, stomping a petulant booted foot. \"She said she would, but she didn\u0027t, because she\u0027s too stupid to know how to do it properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Honoria, a lady never speaks to an elder that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at Esme over the top of my arms. She hurriedly added, \"Especially one who has tried so hard to help you, as Allie has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care, I think she\u0027s stupid. Stupid, stupid, stupid!\" Her little-girl voice rose up into a screech that seemed to pierce the tender flesh of my brain. I narrowed my eyes at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A return to Guarda and her little games can be arranged, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonoria threw herself against Esme and bawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWearily I pushed my wet hair off my face. \"I suppose you should meet the whole gang. Antonio, Jem, Alis, Mr. Woogums, I Summon you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll four popped into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi coraz¨®n! You \u0027ave Summoned me to your side again! My \u0027eart, it beats only for...\u0027Ello. What so charming red curls you \u0027ave, my lady.\" Antonio made a deep court bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Omh! Ah aghn ahnnh ahah ahah ahah arnuah!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem was wearing a blue-and-red skintight spandex outfit, blue boots with gold flames licking up the sides, and a blue black and-red mask fitting tightly over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced. \"Don\u0027t tell me, you\u0027ve been watching one of those wrestling shows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aaaangh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tongue still missing?\" I asked Antonio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quickly dragged his eyes from Noelle and blew me a kiss. \"Alas, I fear it is so, my little water sprite. We \u0027ave looked \u0027igh and low for it, but the tongue, it is \u0027iding. We cannot find it. And who might this beauteous lady be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you Mr. Woogums?\" Noelle asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked appalled. Quickly I made the necessary introductions. Noelle turned her bright, interested eyes from Antonio\u0027s leer to Esme comforting Honoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to look like you,\" I told her, suddenly feeling a bit tetchy and peevish. \"I used to be professional-looking, and on top of everything and with it and all that. Nothing rattled me. Well, not much. I had a plan, a life plan. I knew where I was going, and how I was going to get there. Now look what I\u0027ve turned into.\" I sat back and the leather protested with a rude, wet sucking noise. \"I fell in love. This is what happens when you fall in love. You end up wet, with a houseful of ghosts, and a man who thinks he\u0027s responsible for everyone\u0027s happiness but his own. Taking it all into consideration, I highly advise you against falling in love with anyone, mortal or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned at me. I sighed. She was too cute; some guy was bound to snatch her up and make her wet and miserable, too. \"Esme, would you show Alis to the ceramic room? Her screaming is making my head pound. Then perhaps you all could watch some TV quietly. I need to talk to Noelle about rescuing Christian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rescue? Why would you wish to rescue that dead one? I for one am enjoying \u0027is absence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI batted Antonio away from where he\u0027d perched on the edge of the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh, a rescue! Mr. Woogums and I dearly love a good rescue. What can we do to help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I said, too tired even to collapse and fall into a stupor. \"There\u0027s nothing you can do. You\u0027re just ghosts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We may be ghosts, but we are extremely \u0027andsome and dashing ghosts,\" Antonio said as he strutted through the middle of the desk, twanging his codpiece suggestively at Noelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, I\u0027m sure we can do something to help dear Christian.\" Esme nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahng wahaaaaaan,\" Jem added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never rescued a Dark One before,\" Noelle said slowly, a little frown appearing between her eyebrows. She even frowned cute. \"I\u0027m not absolutely certain that it\u0027s in my job description.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Ha, ha, ha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I hate to contradict you, but if you\u0027re serious about rescuing this boyfriend of yours, your friends here might be very helpful indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There, you see? Even the nice Guardian says we could be of help!\" Esme crowed. \"I\u0027m sure I\u0027d have no problem overcoming a fiend or two, and Mr. Woogums would be happy to bite someone if only I can teach him how to focus his energy properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall bring my rapier. I am most dashing with my rapier,\" Antonio told Noelle. He demonstrated with a few moves that would have left her without the ability to bear children had the rapier been made up of anything other than air and psychic energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem adopted a crouched wrestling pose and cracked his knuckles. \"Eee oong anh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall all be able to help,\" Esme said with great satisfaction as she drifted toward the door. \"I\u0027ll just fetch Alis back. I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll be delighted to pretend the bad people are made of ceramic and yell at them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pounded my forehead gently on the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, they have a point. You might not think they can be of help, but just their appearance can give you a few seconds of diversion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped pounding long enough to look at Noelle. \"I haven\u0027t told you what I\u0027m up against. It\u0027s not just a few Summoners and the odd triumvirate or two. I have to get Christian away from Asmodeus, the demon lord, the demon master who I am fairly certain turned Christian\u0027s father and thus has some sort of connection to Christian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle frowned. \"Oh. I\u0027d forgotten you\u0027d mentioned Asmodeus. That is a bit of a sticky wicket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How sticky a wicket is it?\" I asked as Esme ushered Alis into the room, shushing her and whispering in her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. I didn\u0027t have time or the energy to cope with much more. \"Let me put it to you this way - do you know if it\u0027s possible to defeat a demon lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"You can defeat anything, if you go about it properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that was hopeful. Kind of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, next question: Do you know how to defeat a demon lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know someone who does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to get a bit desperate. I knew that because I had the overwhelming urge to giggle. I must have been more tired than I thought, because a couple of giggles slipped out as I asked, \"Have you ever heard of anyone defeating a demon lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as my giggling grew stronger. \"No, I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave it up and just sat back in the chair and howled, wiping tears from my already damp face as I laughed the laugh of the mentally and physically exhausted. Esme hovered with a worried look on her face, Honoria snickered, Jem demonstrated his prowess by wrestling a chair to the ground, Alis (restrained by Esme\u0027s warning) honed her ancient-crone glare until it could split stone, and Antonio seated himself on the arm of Noelle\u0027s chair and proceeded to ask very personal questions about her preferences in men. By the time he got to whether or not her sexual partners had to be technically alive, I had managed to gather the few wits remaining to me and arranged them in a formation where I could think again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme had detached herself from Honoria long enough to pat me on my right shoulder. \"Overtired, poor child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy arm went numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you\u0027d better tell me everything from the beginning,\" Noelle said, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees despite the fact that Antonio was not very subtly peering down her blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the strength I\u0027d need to tell her everything, decided on an abbreviated version, and quickly hit the high points of the last few days, intimacies with Christian excluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chewed on a fingernail. \"Hmm. Very sticky. This triumvirate you mentioned is clearly being fed by Asmodeus. That might work to your benefit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my aching forehead and tried to follow her thoughts. \"You mean that feeding them would weaken him? I can see that, but what good is a weakened Asmodeus going to do me when I have the triumvirate breathing down my neck? I barely managed to get Sebastian out without bringing the house down around our ears, and that, I\u0027m positive, is only because Christian was distracting Asmodeus enough that he couldn\u0027t throw his power into the triumvirate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back, apologizing as her arm slid through Antonio\u0027s thigh. \"Asmodeus is by far the more powerful of the two entities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Right. So it makes sense to take him out first. I understand that, but the triumvirate - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is made up of humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped me cold. I looked at it, prodded it, and decided it was good. Then I realized what her meaning really was, and the little bit of common sense that had remained with me tossed up its hands in despair, packed an overnight case, and headed off on a long, long vacation. \"You mean I call up a demon to take care of the triumvirate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my!\" Esme\u0027s eyes were round with worry. She scooped up Mr. Woogums and hugged him and Honoria against her ample breast. \"Are you sure that\u0027s wise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pish.\" Antonio snorted, patting his chest. We all turned to look at him. I had never actually heard anyone say the word pish before. It was a bit frightening. \"I will protect mi coraz¨®n from any demon. I am \u0027er courtier most brave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s perfectly safe as long as you keep the demon under your control,\" Noelle said slowly, considering me with a critical eye that didn\u0027t seem to like what it saw. \"I think, upon reflection, that it would be a good idea if I were to accompany you on this venture. I should hate to think what would happen if a demon you raised were to run amok through London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earthquakes, mass \u0027ysteria,\" Antonio said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rain of locusts, the sky set afire, the oceans turned to blood,\" Esme added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank you, I think we get the picture,\" I said. \"What exactly would the demon - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ehn wahnah ahgha mwaaaah,\" Jem said with a sorrowful shake of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, definitely a plague or two,\" Esme nodded. \"And you\u0027re absolutely right about the rats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at them all, then turned my gaze back to Noelle. \"What exactly would the demon do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to carry me to bed after that. The exhaustion and Noelle\u0027s suggestions were just too much for my poor little brain. Fortunately, between the two of them, she and Antonio were able to get me into Christian\u0027s bedroom and onto the bed beside Sebastian without either of the Turners noticing, or Sebastian waking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dreamed of Christian encased in a block of ice, standing in the corner of the bedroom, just watching me as I lay sleeping. The ice turned to glass, and I knew that if I reached out for him, if I tried to touch him, the glass would shatter and pierce his heart. I rose from the bed and stood before him, my arms empty, my heart torn apart by the need I had for him and the knowledge that in order to free him from the glass I\u0027d have to give up everything I had fought for. I wept tears of blood and watched him until his image faded away into the dull gray of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy and Roxy woke me up three hours later. I was disoriented at finding them in Christian\u0027s room, even more so when I realized the person lying in bed, tucked in under the covers, was Sebastian, not Christian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to wake you, Allie, but Noelle said not to let you sleep any later than noon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You met Noelle?\" I pushed myself into a sitting position and looked down at Sebastian. His face didn\u0027t look nearly as wan and gaunt as it had earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoxy waved toward a metal apparatus standing next to him. \"Noelle arranged this. It\u0027s an IV; isn\u0027t that clever of her? She even got the blood from one of the blood banks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We met her when we stopped by to see how you were after last night. She\u0027s taking a shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I rubbed my eyes, the feel of the dream\u0027s blood tears still heavy upon my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look a bit muzzy yet. Come on; we\u0027ll get you into the shower, then let you have some of the soup Mrs. Turner made. What a very odd woman she is,\" Joy prattled as she bustled me out of bed, out of my clothes, and into the shower even before I gathered together the thought to protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half hour later I was washed, dressed, and fed. Fifteen minutes later Roxy and Joy stood at the door of Christian\u0027s house and waved us off as Noelle and I climbed into a cab. Ten seconds after that I realized I was squishing one of the bobbles and spent the rest of the cab ride frantically resuscitating a flattened yarn bobble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour and seven minutes after waking up, I stood with Noelle outside the Trust\u0027s house and prepared to raise my first - and hopefully only - demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree minutes after that I looked at my demon and burst into laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" the demon asked, turning its head 360 degrees to examine itself. \"What\u0027s so funny? Why is the Summoner laughing and crying at the same time? I don\u0027t see what\u0027s so funny. I\u0027m a demon; where\u0027s my respect? Where\u0027s the fear and cowering before me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erm...\" Noelle examined it from the tips of its shiny patent leather shoes to the top of its big pink bow. \"Demon, what is your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right, like I look like I fell off the stupid truck?\" it asked, its pudgy little hands on its flat hips. \"You can\u0027t ask me that, Guardian. Go read the rule book. Sheesh. Amateurs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wiped my eyes and hiccupped a couple of times, blowing my nose on the tissue I stuffed away in my bobble-free pocket. \"Okay, I think I\u0027m better.\" I looked at the demon and felt my lips twitch. I couldn\u0027t help it; the sight of it was too much for my fragile nerves. \"What is your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tirana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do you serve?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oriens. Now would one of you mind telling me why neither of you is averting your eyes from my dreadful presence, so monstrous that my very being is unbearable to humankind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle snickered, quickly converting it into a cough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, possibly,\" I said, feeling my lips twitch again. \"But maybe first you would tell us why you chose to manifest yourself in the form of Shirley Temple as last seen on the \u0027Good Ship Lollipop\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon twirled around, its big pink sash fluttering as it smoothed down its dress and frilly little petticoat. \"My grotesque form isn\u0027t making you sick with fright?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both shook our heads, Noelle with a hand over her mouth to keep from laughing out loud. \"Shirley Temple at her pinnacle was frightening,\" I finally told it, \"but not in the sense I think you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon\u0027s little golden curls bobbed as it stamped its foot. \"It\u0027s that Morilen! He told me that this form would strike terror in the hearts of humans! Well, he\u0027d just better hide behind the legion of Paymon, because when I get back to hell - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s never pretty when a demon swears, but it\u0027s positively ludicrous when the demon in question is an exact duplicate of America\u0027s little sweetheart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you heard of Tirana?\" I asked Noelle while the little demon was stamping around cursing its companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but Oriens is the weakest of all the demon lords. I would say,\" - she paused a moment to watch the demon jump up and down on a late-blooming flower - \"that you have raised one of the lesser demons. In fact, I\u0027m fairly certain it\u0027s the bottom of the barrel, demonically speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shoulders sagged for a minute. I couldn\u0027t even raise a proper demon; I had to get the runt of the litter. How could I possibly save Christian with a demon that wore lacy ankle socks and a big pink sash? It just wasn\u0027t possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it says a lot about the purity of your spirit that the worst type of demon you can raise is... well... Tirana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a little comfort in that fact until the cold, watchful gaze from the house had me straightening my shoulders, the knowledge that somewhere within the house the man I loved was being held strengthening my resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. I can do this. Tirana, stop trying to squash the flower; you\u0027ll get your nice shoes dirty. We have work to do. I command thee to my will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Command, schommand,\" it groused, obediently following me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle touched my arm gently as I started up the walk to the front door. She pulled an amulet off over her head and slipped the chain over mine, then traced a symbol on my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For luck,\" she said with a half smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fingered the amulet. It was warm and gave me a sense of serenity that was greatly lacking in my present state. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember what I told you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped so. I was busy almost the whole of the cab ride trying to desquish one of the ghosts\u0027 bobbles, but I felt pretty confident that I had remembered her instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could go in with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a little smile that I hoped looked more sincere than it felt. \"I know, and I appreciate all the help you\u0027ve given me. You\u0027ll wait here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and faced the house again. I could feel Asmodeus inside, gathering his power. My hand closed around the bobbles as I cleared my mind and gathered my own power. The amulet seemed to hold the power, magnifying it slightly. I raised my chin, held up my hand, and commanded the door to open, then marched into the dark, gaping maw of the house armed with a borrowed amulet, a demon that looked like it should be dancing with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, five helpful ghosts and one petulant one, and a heck of a lot of determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors to the library had been thrown open. Guarda, Phillippa, and Eduardo stood in the middle of the room in a triangle, not yet a triumvirate, but capable of forming one with just a touch of Eduardo\u0027s fingers to the women\u0027s necks. Asmodeus stood to the left of them, Christian to their right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at them all. \"I hope it\u0027s no bother, but I\u0027ve changed my mind. I\u0027d like Christian back, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door slammed shut behind me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-and-the-single-vampire-dark-ones-2/page-18.html","bookId":2203,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:00 PM"}
