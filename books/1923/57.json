success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said with a fist pump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearning to toss a guy as heavy as Parker was no small feat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding the right balance to gain the leverage I needed had taken me longer than it probably should have because I\u0027d had such a hard time concentrating over the last couple of weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no balance in my life when my relationship with Gideon was skewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, Parker reached out to me for a hand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gripped his forearm and tugged him to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery good,\" he praised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re firing on all cylinders tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanna try it again?\" \"Take a ten-minute break and hydrate,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to talk to Jeremy before he takes off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy was one of Parker\u0027s co- instructors, a giant of a man that the students had to work their way up to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight then, I couldn\u0027t imagine ever being able to fend off an assailant of his size, but I\u0027d seen some really petite women in the class do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed my towel and my water and headed toward the aluminum bleachers lined up against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy steps faltered when I saw one of the detectives who\u0027d come to my apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective Shelley Graves wasn\u0027t dressed for work, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore a sports top and matching pants with athletic shoes, and her dark, curly hair was pulled back in a ponytail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince she was just entering the building and the door happened to be next to the bleachers, I found myself walking toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to look nonchalant when I felt anything but.\"Miss Tramell,\" she greeted me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fancy running into you here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you been working with Parker long?\" \"About a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s good to see you, Detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth twisted wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least you don\u0027t think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe you still won\u0027t when we\u0027re done chatting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, confused by that tangle of words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, one thing was clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t speak to you without my attorney present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spread her arms wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m off- duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut anyway, you don\u0027t have to say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll do all the talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves gestured toward the bleachers, and I reluctantly took a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had damn good reason to be wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about we move a little higher?\" She climbed to the top, and I stood and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we were settled, she set her forearms on her knees and looked at the students below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s different here at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI usually catch the day sessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told myself that on the off chance I happened to run into you off- duty someday, I\u0027d talk to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured the chances of that were nil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd lo and behold, here you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be a sign.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t buying the additional explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t strike me as the type to believe in signs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got me there, but I\u0027ll make an exception in this case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips pursed for a moment, as if she were thinking hard about something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think your boyfriend killed Nathan Barker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened, my breath catching audibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll never be able to prove it,\" she said grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s too smart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo thorough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole thing was precisely premeditated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment Gideon Cross came to the decision to kill Nathan Barker, he had his ducks in a row.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t decide if I should stay or go - what the ramifications would be of either decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that moment of indecisiveness, she kept talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe it started the Monday after your roommate was attacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we searched the hotel room where Barker\u0027s body was discovered, we found photos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of photos of you, but the ones I\u0027m talking about were of your roommate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cary?\" \"If I were to present this to the ADA for an arrest warrant, I would say that Nathan Barker attacked Cary Taylor as a way to intimidate and threaten Gideon Cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy guess is that Cross wasn\u0027t conceding to Barker\u0027s blackmail demands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands twisted in my towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t stand the thought of Cary suffering what he had because of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves looked at me, her gaze sharp and flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCop\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad had them, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At that point, I think Cross perceived you to be in mortal danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you know what? He was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve seen the evidence we collected from Barker\u0027s room - photos, detailed notes of your daily schedule, news clippings .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven some of your garbage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually when we find that sort of thing, it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan was watching me?\" Just the thought sent a violent shiver through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was stalking you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blackmail demands he made on your stepfather and Cross were just an escalation of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think Cross was getting too close to you, and Barker felt threatened by your relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think he hoped Cross would step away if he knew about your past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the towel to my mouth, in case I became as sick as I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So here\u0027s how I think it went down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves tapped her fingertips together, her attention seemingly on the strenuous drills below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cross cut you off, started seeing an old flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat served two purposes - it made Barker relax, and it wiped out Cross\u0027s motive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would he kill a man over a woman he\u0027d dumped? He set that up pretty well - he didn\u0027t tell you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou strengthened the lie with your honest reactions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer foot started tapping along with her fingers, her slim body radiating restless energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cross doesn\u0027t hire out the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t want the money trail or a hit man who could rat him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, this is personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re personal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants the threat gone without a doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sets up a last-minute party at one of his properties for some vodka company of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he\u0027s got a rock-solid alibi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the press is there to snap pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he knows precisely where you are and that your alibi is rock-solid, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers clenched in the towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of bodies hitting the mat, the hum of instructions being given, and the triumphant shouts of students all faded into a steady buzzing in my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a flurry of activity happening right in front of me and my brain couldn\u0027t process it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a sense of retreating down an endless tunnel, my reality shrinking to a tiny black point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening her bottle of water, Graves drank deeply, then wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll admit, the party tripped me up a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you break an alibi like that?
