At first, not many people believed this. However, with the passage of time, all signs began to point to this news most likely being true. In particular, after 10 days, the Giant Leviathan once again appeared over the skies of Divine Phoenix Island. And in Divine Phoenix Island, the original disciples of that land had begun to reconstruct their sect on a massively grand scale!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter seeing Divine Phoenix Island build new grand temples and plazas and all sorts of complexes, the South Sea Demon Region actually didn’t interfere. Instead, they retreated from the South Horizon Region and hid away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd then, just three days later, another matter occurred that caused all the great sects to be completely bewildered.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat was… the South Sea Demon Region branch in the South Horizon Region had been disbanded!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Demon Region disciples all went their separate ways. Some joined small sects, some concealed their identities, some went to mortal kingdoms, and some went off on into the distant lands. Overnight, the last stronghold of the South Sea Demon Region had quietly disintegrated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow, the South Sea Demon Region that had survived in name only had completely crumbled away!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe South Sea Demon Region that had a legacy of over 4000 years had disappeared like this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sects of the South Horizon Region and Five Element Region couldn’t believe this. The South Sea Demon Region had once been a Holy Land level sect. From the time when the Silent Demon Emperor City had been destroyed 3000 years ago until now, that mysterious and powerful South Sea Demon Region that had dominated the South Sea had now vanished. It was like everything they knew had been an illusion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was no different from waking up from a dream.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter several days, masters of the Five Element Region finally reached Divine Phoenix Island.

Although her voice was calm and light, the truth was that her heart was not composed at all. She too was incomparably flabbergasted. Even though she knew that Lin Ming had a heaven-defying talent, she still didn’t dare to believe that it was real.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming… killed Xuan Wuji?

Many people couldn’t believe this to begin with, and now Mu Bingyun had spoken even more outrageous news: Xuan Wuji had actually been killed by Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSince this was confirmed by Mu Bingyun, and in addition to everything that had occurred recently, this was most likely true!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA 21 year old Revolving Core youth had killed a fourth stage Life Destruction master!

Since then, he had been known as the Sky Spill Continent’s number one genius. But even when Emperor Shakya was at Lin Ming’s age, he absolutely couldn’t achieve such a degree of strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e “Xuan Wuji was the top master of the South Sea.

Now, Lin Ming’s status is even higher than theirs! Even if you consider the formidable powers backing them, Lin Ming can still be treated equal to a holy abbot from the Great Zen Temple!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe entire Great Zen Temple had a total of three great abbots. The Great Zen Temple had a very deep and formidable strength, and they had dominated the entire Great Zen Region for thousands of years now. They were a fifth-grade sect truly worthy of that reputation. Whether it was power or their inheritance, they were stronger than the South Sea Demon Region in all aspects.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNo matter which abbot it was from the Great Zen Temple, they were an existence that the Sovereigns of the Five Element Region’s seven sects all had to respectfully bow to. But now, Lin Ming’s status had actually far surpassed the three great abbots’!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, let alone calling Lin Ming a ‘boy’, they didn’t even have the qualifications or gall to address Lin Ming by his full name.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“To be on the same footing with an abbot from the Great Zen Temple… being the top master of the South Sea probably doesn’t mean much to Lin Ming. In the future, he will definitely become the number one powerhouse of the entire Sky Spill Continent!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs several Elders were discussing this, at a corner of the meeting table, Zhan Yunjian opened his mouth several times, wanting to speak, but was unable to force out any words due to the rumbling emotions in his heart. He wasn’t able to calm himself down. Spoken words could no longer describe the gap between him and Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is there anything else?

In truth, everyone wanted to meet Lin Ming and pay their respects, in particular the Sunfire Princess, Zhan Yunjian, Bai Aoxuan, and several other young disciples that had known of Lin Ming from long ago. However, no one dared to open their mouth and ask such a brazen question that could be considered as pestering.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLike this, the envoys from the Five Element Region left the South Horizon Region. As they left, news of Lin Ming killing Xuan Wuji spread like a tide!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe remaining forces of the Dire Space Sect, Supreme Mystery Temple, and all the third-grade and second-grade sects of the South Horizon Region were discussing this shocking news with vivid excitement.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEspecially the disciples of the Seven Profound Valleys; they had been stirred into a frenzy. As long as Lin Ming didn’t perish in the future, he would eventually reach the Divine Sea realm and become a true Emperor level powerhouse! He would be considered a legendary existence within the Sky Spill Continent of which there was only just more than a hundred!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMoreover, Lin Ming would not be some ordinary Emperor level powerhouse. In the future, they could brag to their descendants that their grandfather had once been in the same sect as an Emperor level powerhouse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had suddenly become the idol, goal, and dream of countless young disciples everywhere, and the object of admiration and love of innumerable young girls. Nearly all of them had been converted to Linmaniacs. Lin Ming had become the top master of the South Sea, but these young disciples couldn’t even reach the Xiantian realm. Even though they knew perfectly well that they could never reach the same heights as Lin Ming, all of them struggled their hardest to reduce the gap between them as much as possible, lest they regret it in the future.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e……………..\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTen days later, in the jungles of the Southern Wilderness, within a small tribe just shy of 100,000 people… \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s wonderful, wonderful!

And, in front of this middle-aged man was a young black-clothed sorceress wearing a black veil. She had wide and charming eyes, curved like a crescent moon. Although her face was blocked by black gauze, one could still make out slender eyebrows that tapered out; she was obviously a peerless beauty.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sorceress was clearing up some medical tools. As she faintly glanced at the middle-aged man kowtowing before her, she expressionlessly said, “I will give you some medicine. Mix it with lukewarm water and divide it into seven portions and serve it for seven days.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith that, the sorceress waved her hands. With a sudden cool breeze, the middle-aged man was gently blown out of her tent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Gods, it is the gods!” The middle-aged man cried out in happiness, “The Sorcerer has appeared! He has sent a young witch to save us!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe middle-aged man hugged the baby tightly in his arms, walking back towards his home even as he knelt down every few steps to kowtow towards the sorceress’ tent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut in the tent, the sorceress remained silent, displaying no emotion at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd at this moment, an old voice suddenly sounded from outside the tent. “Do you plan on continuing like this? Is there any meaning in saving the lives of a few mortals?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sorceress calmly lifted her veil, revealing a beautiful face. She was the South Sea Demon Region’s Western Faction Sovereign, Xuan Yuqie.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXuan Yuqie gently shook her head, “There is no meaning.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Then why are you still wasting your time here?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXuan Yuqie shook her head once again, “From the moment I was born, all that I was, everything I did, all of that was for the Xuan Clan and the South Sea Demon Region. Now that the South Sea Demon Region is exterminated, the Xuan Clan has also dissolved. What meaning was there in anything I ever did?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Xuan Yuqie retorted, the old man was dumbfounded.

As for those sects that we destroyed, all of them wish for us to die. Perhaps in less than 10 days, the remnants of the Dire Space Sect and Supreme Mystery Temple will gather their remaining forces to chase down the last of the South Sea Demon Region disciples. That includes you, and that includes me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“In a thousand years of life, spring and fall have all become a dream. In this vast and endless universe, is there any significance to anything we do? Since the world will not accommodate me, then I shall walk alone, seeking only harmony and peace in my heart, creating my own pure lands of bliss.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Xuan Yuqie spoke to here, she stood up and let her veil fall back down. In this South Sea catastrophe, the South Sea Demon Region had been destroyed but she had lived. Now, her entire mentality towards life had changed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You want to find peace in your heart, creating your own pure lands?

Although I know it is impossible for me to reach the Divine Sea, I still hope that I can cross several more stages of Life Destruction. If I die during my attempts then I can only say that my fate has reached its end. When I was young I already resolved in my heart that I would explore the road of martial arts until I reached its end. If I die in the throes of crossing Life Destruction then that is still a worthy death for my final act!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Xuan Yuqie, after we bid our farewells today, our fated paths will likely never cross again.
