{"id":20152,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV. IN MORRO CASTLE.","content":"That certainly was a day of triumph for the vindictive Spaniard. Not only Clif Faraday was made wretched, but there was his friend, too, and each a thousand times more unhappy because of the misfortune of the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif as he went out of that room was almost dazed; he could think of nothing. He scarcely heard the sailors sadly bidding him good-by.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nor did he notice anything else until he heard the clang of a door behind him, he realized then from the darkness and silence about him that he was alone in one of the cells of the prison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was not for himself that the poor cadet feared. He could have marched out without flinching and faced a dozen rifles aimed at his heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it was for Bessie Stuart, fallen into the hands of these brutal men. The fate that was before her was enough to make Clif wish her dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He racked his brains trying to think of how she could have come to Havana; could she have been captured in a battle? And what had Ignacio to do with it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But poor Clif knew nothing, and could think of nothing except that she was here, and he powerless to aid her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His own fate was terrible enough, though he hardly thought of that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was to be sent at night to Morro.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Many indeed were the unfortunates who had gone to take that sea trip in the darkness and never come back—and sometimes not reached their destination either. It was a terrible journey, that short ride across Havana Bay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the cadet did not even stop to realize that. He had but one thought, and that he kept repeating over and over to himself in a state of confusion and despair. He never moved from his one position on the floor; and the hours flew by unheeded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once and once only the heavy door of the cell was opened and that by a man who shoved in a pitcher of water and a dish of food. He must have thought the prisoner asleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And as a fact, Clif was half unconscious; he was too dazed to think of anything. He had no hope and no chance of life, and nothing to think of except that Bessie Stuart was captured and he could not aid her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So the long day wore by; it was as a man waking from a deep sleep that the wretched American looked up when the door of that cell was opened again. He found that the hours had flown by, and that the time for the trip to Morro had come.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If Clif had cared about anything then he would have shivered with horror at that moment, for it was surely gruesome and uncanny enough.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three men there were, dark, silent, shadowy figures who entered the damp cell. The only light they had was from a dark lantern, which they flashed upon the solitary prisoner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They found him still lying on the floor, but he raised up to look at them, his haggard, tortured face shining white in the rays of the lantern.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get up,\" commanded one of the men, in a low, muffled voice. \"Get up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The face of the speaker was shrouded in darkness, but Clif recognized the voice, and a cold chill shot over him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ignacio again!\" he gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes. And Clif thought that this was the last—that Ignacio had gained his purpose. The task of murder was left to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But there was no chance of resistance. Clif felt the cold muzzle of a revolver pressed to his head, and so he put the thought away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of the men snapped a pair of handcuffs about his wrists, as if to make sure of him in case the ropes were not strong enough. And then one of them seized him by each arm and Ignacio stepped behind with the lantern.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And so out of the cell they marched and down the long corridor and out of the building into the open air.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif had chance for but one deep breath of it. A moment later he was shoved into a wagon that was in front of the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There he was seated between one of the men and the chuckling Ignacio. The other man was driving and they rattled off down the street.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where they were going the unfortunate victim had no idea. Perhaps to some lonely spot where Ignacio could torture him to his fiendish heart\u0027s content! But there was no use in making an outcry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Clif realized it and sat perfectly silent. He would give his enemies no more satisfaction than he could help.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif did not think that it could be the trip to Morro that was before him; it was too early for such a deed of darkness. If he were dropped overboard upon the way some one might see it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But as it actually happened, Morro was his destination. And he really reached Morro, too. Perhaps the city jail was not considered strong enough for such a villain as he.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the carriage stopped at a wharf. A small launch was waiting there, and the party boarded her and were swept across to the other side in a very short while.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So in a short while the walls of Havana\u0027s strongest dungeon shut upon Clif Faraday. He was a prisoner in Morro, famous or infamous, for its deeds of horror.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For it was in this place, as Clif knew, that all the torture and cruelty of the Spanish nature had been wreaked upon the unfortunate Cubans or Americans who fell into the hands of Weyler. It was here that Ruiz had been murdered, and hundreds of wretches besides—their name and fate being hidden forever by the walls of that horrible place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Clif was going then under the guidance of Ignacio. It was plain that the fiendish man had secured his purpose, for he was in command of the little party. And it was his to decide what was to be done with Clif.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How the man had secured that privilege from the authorities Clif could not hope to know. That he had gotten it as a reward for some deed of darkness he did not doubt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps it was for capturing Bessie Stuart, was the thought that flashed over the lad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Again when the black, silent walls of Morro loomed up before them and the great gate opened nobody asked any questions of Ignacio. He showed a note, and it passed him from sentry to sentry; and the party passed down a flight of stairs into a cold, damp, stone corridor black as night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Poor Clif could not help but think of his own fate then. Ignacio\u0027s cruelty and hatred were such that no torture would be terrible enough for him. And he seemed to have his prisoner entirely to his own discretion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The great vault through which they were going echoed dimly to the footsteps of the party. They seemed to be down in a sort of a cellar, and they were winding their way through secret passages in almost absolute darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Ignacio knew the way—probably the fellow had been in those gloomy dungeons before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stopped suddenly and flashed the lantern upon a rusty iron door. It was solid and heavy, but Ignacio took a key from his pocket and unlocked it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It swung back, creaking dismally upon its hinges. And Ignacio flashed the light of his lantern in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He staggered back quite white with fright as he did so. For there was a series of thumping, shuffling sounds, and a shrill noise that made his blood run cold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But in a moment he again stepped forward, laughing under his breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Por dios!\" he exclaimed. \"The rats! They must be hungry!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he stepped into the room. His foot splashed into a small puddle of water on the reeking, earthen floor. But he pressed on, flashing his lantern about the granite walls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a tiny black cavern into which he had come.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a stone bench at one side of the horrible place, and in the wall by it a heavy ring and a thick iron chain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was but a minute more before Clif\u0027s ankles were locked firmly in the ring, and then he was utterly helpless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For but a moment Ignacio stood looking at him, flashing the lantern full in his face. And then he turned and motioned to the two men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Without a word they faced about and stole away. They went out of the door, and Ignacio, trembling all over with his fiendish eagerness, shut the great iron barrier and locked it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then with a hoarse cry of rage he faced about.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Clif Faraday was alone with his deadly and merciless foe!\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3248/89011.html","bookId":606,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:32:18 AM"}
