You should not have touched this flyer with your bare hands. NO, don\u0027t put it down. It\u0027s too late. They\u0027re watching you. My name is David Wong. My best friend is John. Those names are fake. You might want to change yours. You may not want to know about the things you\u0027ll read on these pages, about the sauce, about Korrok, about the invasion, and the future. But it\u0027s too late. You touched the book. You\u0027re in the game. You\u0027re under the eye. The only defense is knowledge. You need to read this book, to the end. Even the part with the bratwurst. Why? You just have to trust me. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe important thing is this: The drug is called Soy Sauce and it gives users a window into another dimension. John and I never had the chance to say no. You still do. I\u0027m sorry to have involved you in this, I really am. But as you read about these terrible events and the very dark epoch the world is about to enter as a result, it is crucial you keep one thing in mind: None of this was my fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/john-dies-at-the-end-john-dies-at-the-end-1.jpg","author":"David Wong","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/john-dies-at-the-end-john-dies-at-the-end-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:08 PM"}
