She tossed a Twizzler at Susannah and said, belatedly, \"Catch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah reached for it, but it fell on the floor, and she giggled as she picked it up. \"Clumsy me,\" she said, chewing on one end like it was straw and she was a hick. \"Whatever has gotten into me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, everyone knows you guys were smoking pot upstairs,\" Conrad said, just barely bobbing his head to the music that only he could hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah covered her mouth with her hand. She didn\u0027t say anything, but she looked genuinely upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoops,\" my mother said. \"I guess the cat\u0027s out of the bag, Beck. Boys, your mother\u0027s been taking medicinal marijuana to help with the nausea from her chemo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven didn\u0027t look away from the TV when he said, \"What about you, Mom? Are you toking up because of your chemo too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew he was trying to lighten the mood, and it worked. Steven was good at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah choked out a laugh, and my mother threw a Twizzler at the back of Steven\u0027s head. \"Smart-ass. I\u0027m offering up moral support to my best friend in the world. There are worse things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven picked the Twizzler up and dusted it off before popping it into his mouth. \"So I guess it\u0027s okay with you if I smoke up too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you get breast cancer,\" my mother told him, exchanging a smile with Susannah, her best friend in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or when your best friend does,\" Susannah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout all of this, Jeremiah wasn\u0027t saying anything. He just kept looking at Susannah and then back at the TV, like he was worried she would vanish into thin air while his back was turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur mothers thought we were all at the beach that afternoon. They didn\u0027t know that Jeremiah and I had gotten bored and decided to come back to the house for a snack. As we walked up the porch steps, we heard them talking through the window screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah stopped when he heard Susannah say, \"Laur, I hate myself for even thinking this, but I almost think I\u0027d rather die than lose my breast.\" Jeremiah stopped breathing as he stood there, listening. Then he sat down, and I did too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother said, \"I know you don\u0027t mean that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated it when my mother said that, and I guessed Susannah did too because she said, \"Don\u0027t tell me what I mean,\" and I\u0027d never heard her voice like that before-- harsh, angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Okay. I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah started to cry then. And even though we couldn\u0027t see them, I knew that my mother was rubbing Susannah\u0027s back in wide circles, the same way she did mine when I was upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I could do that for Jeremiah. I knew it would make him feel better, but I couldn\u0027t. Instead, I reached over and grabbed his hand and squeezed it tight. He didn\u0027t look at me, but he didn\u0027t let go either. This was the moment when we became true, real friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen my mother said in her most serious, most deadpan voice, \"Your boobs really are pretty goddamn amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah burst out into laughter that sounded like a seal barking, and then she was laughing and crying at the same time. Everything was going to be okay. If my mother was cussing, if Susannah was laughing, it would all be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let go of Jeremiah\u0027s hand and stood up. He did too. We walked back to the beach, neither of us saying anything. What was there to say? \"Sorry your mom has cancer\"? \"I hope she doesn\u0027t lose a boob\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got back to our stretch of beach, Conrad and Steven had just come out of the water with their boogie boards. We still weren\u0027t saying anything, and Steven noticed. I guessed Conrad did too, but he didn\u0027t say anything. It was Steven who said, \"What\u0027s with you guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I said, pulling my knees to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you guys just have your first kiss or something?\" he said, shaking water off his trunks and onto my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" I told him. I was tempted to pants him just to change the subject. The summer before, the boys had gone through an obsession with pantsing one another in public. I had never participated, but at that moment I really wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aww, I knew it!\" he said, jabbing me in the shoulder. I shrugged him off and told him to shut up again. He started to sing, \"Summer lovin\u0027, had me a blast, summer lovin\u0027, happened so fast . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steven, quit being dumb,\" I said, turning to shake my head and roll my eyes with Jeremiah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Jeremiah stood up, brushed sand off his shorts, and started walking toward the water and away from us, away from the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeremiah, are you on your period or something? I was just kidding, man!\" Steven called to him. Jeremiah didn\u0027t turn around; he just kept walking down the shore. \"Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just leave him alone,\" Conrad said. The two of them never seemed particularly close, but there were times when I saw how well they understood each other, and this was one of them. Seeing Conrad protective of Jeremiah made me feel this huge surge of love for him--it felt like a wave in my chest washing over me. Which then made me feel guilty, because why should I be feeding into a crush when Susannah had cancer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell Steven felt bad, and also confused. It was unlike Jeremiah to walk away. He was always the first to laugh, to joke right back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd because I felt like rubbing salt in the wound, I said, \"You\u0027re such an ass**le, Steven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven gaped at me. \"Geez, what did I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored him and fell back onto the towel and closed my eyes. I wished I had Conrad\u0027s earphones. I kind of wanted to forget this day ever happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when Conrad and Steven decided to go night fishing, Jeremiah declined, even though night fishing was his favorite. He was always trying to get people to go night fishing with him. That night he said he wasn\u0027t in the mood. So they left, and Jeremiah stayed behind, with me. We watched TV and played cards. We spent most of the summer doing that, just us. We cemented things between us that summer. He\u0027d wake me up early some mornings, and we would go collect shells or sand crabs, or ride our bikes to the ice cream place three miles away. When it was just us two, he didn\u0027t joke around as much, but he was still Jeremiah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that summer on I felt closer to Jeremiah than I did to my own brother. Jeremiah was nicer. Maybe because he was somebody\u0027s little sibling too, or maybe just because he was that kind of person. He was nice to everybody. He had a talent for making people feel comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter fifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been raining for three days. By four o\u0027clock the third day, Jeremiah was stir-crazy. He wasn\u0027t the kind of person to stay inside; he was always moving. Always on his way somewhere new. He said he couldn\u0027t take it anymore and asked who wanted to go to the movies. There was only one movie theater in Cousins besides the drive-in, and it was in a mall. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-10.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
