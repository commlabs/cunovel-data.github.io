Equally silent he walked out of the house. I expected he\u0027d walked out of my life forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it about the Ruelles that made me feel things I never had before and never expected to again? What was it about a silent man and a chatty boy that made a foolish, lonely cryptozoologist long for a life she\u0027d never wanted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t me. To ache for a child. To contemplate loving again with the same depth I\u0027d once loved before. To consider a future so far gone from the one I\u0027d planned as to be unfathomable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to be under a spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought gave me pause. Was I behaving so oddly, thinking so strangely, longing so deeply because of... magic? The very idea should make me laugh, but after what I\u0027d seen since coming to the Crescent City, laughing was the furthest thing from my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one person I trusted here, and conve-niently that person knew magic. I grabbed my bag and my keys and drove to town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBourbon Street was hopping. I heard the music, saw the lights, from several blocks away. I was tempted to take a detour and soothe my problems with a zombie. But I figured the way things were going, I\u0027d actually run into a zombie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra opened the door before I even knocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know I was here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted a brow. \"I peeked through the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lock the door. You need a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight again. Sometimes I thought she was more than a little psychic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin minutes I sat across from her at the kitchen table, sipping from a glass of something complete with a tiny umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a big swig. \"Fruity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably had twelve types of alcohol. Just what I needed. I took another glug. \"What do you know about love potions? Maybe a charm or a spell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra took a ladylike sip and set down her glass. \"More than you, I suspect. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure. Adam had insisted he couldn\u0027t love me, didn\u0027t want me to love him. What good would a love spell do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Luc was another matter. The child wanted a mother. If I fell hopelessly in love with him, wouldn\u0027t I take the job?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t bring myself to tell Cassandra about the boy. Adam didn\u0027t want anyone to know. And while I trusted Cassandra with my life - had on several occasions already - it wasn\u0027t right for me to trust her with Luc\u0027s. He wasn\u0027t mine to give.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re talking about Adam,\" she murmured. \"You love him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I something him,\" I muttered. \"I don\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just because you don\u0027t want to love the man doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ve been put under a spell. In truth, if you had been, you\u0027d be thrilled about it That\u0027s part of the magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a huge slurp, and the end of the paper umbrella went up my nose. Sneezing, I tossed it aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better slow down,\" Cassandra said. \"You\u0027re going to be smashed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been right about the twelve kinds of alcohol. Right now, every one of them zipped through my bloodstream, both relaxing and revving me. My cheeks felt on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love my husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t you say loved?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how to stop,\" I whispered. \"He still feels alive to me.\" I touched my chest. \"Right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that\u0027s why you saw him in your dream. In your heart he\u0027s still alive. You need to let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of letting Simon go, of giving up, giving in, going on, was too much for me. Maybe that was why I had come up with the notion that my feelings for Adam had been induced by voodoo. They couldn\u0027t be real, because if they were, I didn\u0027t love Simon anymore. And if my love for him died, then so did he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know, I know, he already had. But when was love ever rational?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another swig of courage before blurting what I\u0027d been wondering since I\u0027d seen Simon at the window. \"Could you raise him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at my fingers, clutched together in my lap. Cassandra took a quick, sharp breath and held it. Afraid she\u0027d pass out if she didn\u0027t breathe, afraid I\u0027d panic if she didn\u0027t speak, or maybe if she did, I glanced up, then right back down again. The sorrow, the pity, in her eyes made me want to crawl under the table and stay there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not that powerful,\" she said softly. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in her voice made me tense - hope and fear at war. \"But you might be soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someday, perhaps. But even if I was, I couldn\u0027t raise Simon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long has he been gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached across the table and took my hand. \"He wouldn\u0027t be the same, Diana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would care. Dead is dead; there\u0027s no going back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is - you said so yourself. There are zombies. They\u0027re real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they aren\u0027t alive. They aren\u0027t the same people. They aren\u0027t even people. You want to rip Simon out of the afterlife, reanimate his disintegrating body, have him look at you with hollow, lifeless eyes? Wonder why he\u0027s here? Ask who you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d know me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I miss him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed my hand, and I met her gaze once more. \"Simon didn\u0027t have to die. I could have saved him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra stared at me for several seconds. \"So that\u0027s what this is about? Guilt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I\u0027d started talking, I couldn\u0027t seem to stop. \"I didn\u0027t believe him when he said he\u0027d found a werewolf. Again. I was so sick of his wild-goose chases. We went here; we went there. He saw something and every single time, when I got there, there was nothing. Everyone thought he was crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and admitted my secret shame: \"I started to think so, too. Then that last night, I lost my temper, shouted at him, and we fought. He stormed out alone. The next thing I knew, he was dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed the part where your going with him could have saved him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot her a glare. \"I\u0027d have saved him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow I wasn\u0027t sure, but I\u0027d have tried. And if I\u0027d failed, I\u0027d be dead, too. Sometimes - hell, most times until I came here - I wished that I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gone now,\" she said, \"and you need to move on. Quit sabotaging your chance at a new life by clinging to the old one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to find the loup-garou. Prove that Simon wasn\u0027t crazy. Clear his name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right Then maybe you can move on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered her words, which were an echo of my own earlier thoughts. Maybe I could. Except -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"How do I know if what I feel is real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra sighed. \"You really believe Ruelle put a hex on you to make you love him? I thought it was all sex, all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all the time,\" I muttered, though she did have a point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There might be a way to discover the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Voodoo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted a brow and didn\u0027t bother to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I have to dor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to the temple. We\u0027ll ask the has if you\u0027re under a love spell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That works?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So far, whatever I\u0027ve asked, they\u0027ve answered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. She was starting to scare me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they say you\u0027re not being influenced by magic, will you quit fighting the feeling and tell the man you care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure. Adam had said he couldn\u0027t love me, that I shouldn\u0027t ask him to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana?\" Cassandra pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just do whatever voodoo that you do, and then we\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise you\u0027ll give him a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What difference does it make to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hands on her hips. \"I\u0027m not going to waste a perfectly good voodoo ceremony on someone who\u0027s too stubborn to reap the benefits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK. Fine. Let\u0027s get it over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take a breath. Slow down. The temple is peaceful. You might enjoy your time there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of heading out the back door, Cassandra returned to the shop and picked up a wooden bowl. She proceeded to add items from her shelves, then turned toward the snake cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa,\" I said, my voice a bit slurred from the alcohol. \"No snake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need him for the ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate snakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Consider him Danballah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I\u0027m going to be sorry I asked, but what\u0027s Danballah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Great Serpent. Father of the loos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recalled her earlier explanation. \"A god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More of a spirit. In vodoun there was an original supreme being known as the Gran Met. When he finished his work and returned to the other worlds, he left the has behind to help the people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been raised Catholic, though I hadn\u0027t practiced since I\u0027d left my parents\u0027 house. Nevertheless, all this talk about gods made me twitchy. \"You don\u0027t really believe this, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sigh was aggrieved. \"You can\u0027t ask me to perform a voodoo ceremony for truth, then wonder if I believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI very nearly pointed out that I hadn\u0027t asked her to do anything, but she was on a roll, so I let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I don\u0027t believe, then what in hell am I doing here? For that matter, what are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. You believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotta believe in something,\" Cassandra muttered, and shoved the bowl into my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t see it coming and bobbled the thing, nearly dropping it. \"Hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot me a glare. \"You wanna hold the snake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\" I waved my hand. \"Carry on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled Lazarus out of the cage, murmuring softly. He took one look at me and hissed. The feeling was mutual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think of the loas like saints.\" Cassandra led the way from the shop, through her living area, and out the back door. \"They\u0027re a kind of bridge to the supreme being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see why the Catholic Church was so snarky about the whole voodoo thing. A snake spirit is a far cry from a saint\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t Saint Patrick charm the snakes out of Ireland?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch it when you talk about Saint Patrick and Ireland,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra spared me a smile. \"When the slaves arrived they were baptized Catholic right off the boat, and their religion was outlawed, so they secretly combined the two and got - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vodoun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bingo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Cassandra\u0027s shop lay a partially enclosed courtyard filled with plants, flowers, and a fountain. The ground was hard-packed earth - no grass, no stones, no pavement. A door had been set in one wall; Cassandra opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No lock?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On a temple?\" She flicked the light. \"Besides, most people are too scared to come in here with me. They certainly wouldn\u0027t come without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrific,\" I said, and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped just inside the door. The room was so full of stuff, I didn\u0027t know what to stare at first. Cassandra placed Lazarus in a cardboard box near a flat stone covered with candles and smaller, more colorful flat stones. She proceeded to light the wicks, and I continued to stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurrounding the stone were flowers, pebbles, tiny flags, and charms. The walls were decorated with brightly colored symbols: a cross, a heart, a snake, a box of some sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong, thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a coffin?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm,\" Cassandra said. \"The drawings are veves. They act as magnets, to draw the loas to the earth. The coffin is the symbol of Baron Samedi. He is Saturday, the day of death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d think you would want to avoid that one instead of magnetically sucking him into your personal space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been over this.\" She gave me a look that I recalled from my third-grade teacher - extreme annoyance from a very patient woman. \"Death is powerful, and it isn\u0027t necessarily a bad thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why does everyone try so hard to escape it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s human nature to fear what we don\u0027t understand. I try to see death as a beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows?\" She finished the candles and joined me. \"A new plane, a different world, an adventure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could be right, but I\u0027d rather wait as long as possible to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cross is for Legba,\" she continued, \"god of the sun and the way of all spiritual communication.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see why that would be handy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The heart is Erzulie.\" Cassandra met my gaze. \"Goddess of the moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warm wind seemed to brush my skin. I\u0027d have thought I was imagining it, except the candles fluttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She likes you,\" Cassandra whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will that help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the snake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the python on the wall, whose bright green eyes seemed to shine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danballah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snake god. Spirit. Saint Whatever. I should have known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ceremony brings the loas to earth; then we ask for guidance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How, exactly, do they come to earth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze slid from mine. \"They inhabit another living being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a second my brain refused to accept the information my ears had heard. But only for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possession? Are you nuts? That\u0027s dangerous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is why I don\u0027t take the ceremony lightly. It\u0027s also why people are scared to come here. Word gets around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think I\u0027m going to let some snake spirit possess me, you are off your rocker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt Danballah would be interested in you. I was thinking more along the lines of - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe traced a finger through the heart, her touch smudging whatever had been used to draw the symbol on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deesse de la lune,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe candles fluttered again in a nonexistent wind.
