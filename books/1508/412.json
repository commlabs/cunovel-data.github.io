The contents of the sound transmitting talisman were very simple. Lin Ming asked about his parents’ situation and whether or not they had received news of his death, and whether anything had happened to them because of a broken heart. Then he left behind a new sound transmission mark and asked Qin Ziya to wait for him on the island.

Then, he took out a long distance sound transmitting talisman from his spatial ring that was used to report on military situations. He gave a simple and brief summary of the current situation and then with a shake of his hand, the talisman ignited.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e……………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e10,000 miles away, a mass of flames appeared in front of Lin Ming but was instantly left behind by Fireshine’s terrifying speed.

The forces that supported him from behind were far too great, and his cultivation had already been at the peak of the early Xiantian realm for dozens of years.

This disciple was sent by Ouyang Boyan to monitor him, and his cultivation was at the middle Houtian realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eQin Ziya looked at the hourglass in the corner, estimating his time. Without caring for the middle Houtian Acacia Faction disciple behind him, he walked into the operations room and picked up the sea map, wrapping it up.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs he picked up the sea map, all the little flags that were on top fell onto the floor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Acacia Faction disciple’s expression was immediately ugly, “Qin Ziya, what is the meaning of this?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“No meaning.

Since you are defying military orders, you are just digging your own grave. Don’t blame me for what I’m going to do. I’ll write down all your crimes and report you to the sect. When that happens, they’ll impeach you! Mm, what’s with that look? What are you thinking of doing? You want to kill any witnesses to your crime?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Acacia Faction disciples derisively smiled. Although his cultivation was only at the middle Houtian realm, he had the support of Ouyang Boyan. Not just that, but he was also part of the Acacia Faction; he didn’t necessarily need to fear the Zither Faction’s Qin Ziya.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eQin Ziya looked at this man with pity. At this moment, a shrill phoenix cry sounded in the skies. The Acacia Faction disciple jumped in shock and then rushed out. He saw flames and wind coming from all directions, as a massive Vermillion Bird landed outside of the command post. The phoenix extended its huge, fiery wings, covering the entire courtyard.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for who the Vermillion Bird was carrying on its back, it was actually a red-robed youth. His hair was disheveled and flew everywhere, and his eyes flashed with thunder. His appearance was outstanding, and his momentum was utterly threatening. Between his forehead was a flame mark that caused those who saw it to feel their heart palpitate with fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This… this…” The Acacia Faction disciple was stunned. Just what was going on?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the Acacia Faction disciple looked more closely at the red-robed youth, his eyes became increasingly dazed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This… doesn’t this person look like…” The Acacia Faction disciple’s eyes met Lin Ming’s, and he suddenly felt as if he had fallen into a massive black vortex. In just a few breaths of time, his mind shook as he turned white, and then spat out a massive amount of blood!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming hadn’t intentionally hurt him. It was just that he had learned of Qin Xingxuan’s situation, and his innermost murderous intent was overflowing everywhere, spilling out and covering the world. After almost an entire year of trials within the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm, he had experienced an endless scene of slaughter and his murderous intent had reached the degree where it could manifest in reality.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow this murderous intent could spill out depending on his mood. His vision was like a flash of thunder that could directly pierce through an ordinary martial artist’s spiritual sea.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis Acacia Faction disciple’s cultivation was at the middle Houtian realm. But with just a single glance from Lin Ming, he had been injured by Lin Ming’s killing intent!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You… you are… Lin… Lin Ming!?” The Acacia Faction disciple’s legs began to shake.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming frowned, and the black vortex in his eyes began to spin once again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Allow me.” As Qin Ziya spoke, he took out a long zither from his spatial ring and then played a few notes. The Acacia Faction disciple’s legs went soft, and he tumbled onto the ground.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eQin Ziya said, “He won’t remember you.

Now wasn’t the time to make public the news that he was still living. Once this news spread, Ouyang Boyan would be able to prepare in advance. Maybe, when that happened, Ouyang Boyan might even run away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let’s go!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eQin Ziya jumped onto Fireshine’s back, and Fireshine spread its great wings, soaring into the sky!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Martial House Master Qin, what is Xingxuan’s sound transmission mark?” As the strong winds blew against Lin Ming’s hair, his eyes were frosty and determined.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eQin Ziya sighed, “After Qin Xingxuan went Blood Demon Island, her sound transmission mark was cancelled. Now, I cannot reach her.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Ouyang Boyan wanted to deal with Qin Xingxuan, then he naturally had to shut off all ways for her to contact Qin Ziya.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s mind sank, and his killing intent thickened by several degrees. “Without the sound transmission mark, then how will I find Xingxuan on the vast Blood Demon Island?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I already expected that she would be pushed into a dead end. So I had her separate a sliver of her soul and sealed it into a jade slip to create a soul jade slip. I had wanted to use this to know whether or not she was still living, but this soul jade slip can also be used to determine her position by sensing it.” Qin Ziya took out Qin Xingxuan’s soul jade slip.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming looked at it and then felt his heart tighten. A soul jade slip’s soul sliver was connected to the main soul. It could be used to determine the current situation of its owner.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming could feel that Qin Xingxuan’s life was like a flickering candle in the wind. This was an extremely bad situation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eQin Ziya sighed. “Blood Demon Island has an incomparably rich blood demon energy. Even without considering how much she has probably been fighting, but even if she didn’t, that blood demon energy would still slowly corrode her, causing her life to continuously weaken. A Houtian martial artist would be relatively fine, but Xingxuan is only at the early Pulse Condensation period.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t speak, he only remained silent. The strong gales howled in his ears, but the air around Lin Ming seemed to completely stop without a single trace of air flow. This was result of the amount of killing intent that he was emitting, which almost formed a domain around him. The thickness of this killing aura was even enough to make Qin Ziya feel suppressed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eQin Ziya gasped. A while ago, he had been in a hurry and hadn’t carefully probed Lin Ming’s situation. But now that he looked, he only felt a simmering fear and cautiousness; this youth was like a raging Demon God!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf God blocked him, then he would kill God. If Buddha blocked him, then he would kill Buddha!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe couldn’t imagine that the one standing beside him was a late Houtian realm martial artist. Just what had Lin Ming experienced in this past year!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe atmosphere was tense for a very long time. Qin Ziya thought of something to say, and then hesitated before saying, “About the Qin Family and Lin Family’s situation, I wrote a letter to Her Highness Mu Qianyu, and even sent two, but there was no response from her…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming frowned. He didn’t doubt Mu Qianyu’s character. If she knew that this was happening, then she wouldn’t idly stand by.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn fact, Mu Qianyu didn’t know of the grudge he had with Ouyang Boyan. Not just that, but currently Divine Phoenix Island was embroiled in a war. After confirming that he had died, she would most likely send some gifts to Green Mulberry City’s Lin Family, but would never have thought that someone would try to deal with his friends and family.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Qin Ziya had written a letter. So where did that letter go?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s voice sank as he said, “Martial House Master Qin, I understand Mu Qianyu’s nature very well. She owes me a favor, so she would never do something like this. Your letter disappearing and coming to nothing would absolutely not be her intention. I will investigate this matter!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s voice was somewhat cold. He knew that ever since he appeared in Divine Phoenix Island, not everyone appreciated his presence. There were many people that were intensely jealous of him. Not just that, but he had taken their resources, and even the vial of Vermillion Bird blood essence; he had no idea how many people were madly resentful of him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis time, because of what had happened, Lin Ming had learnt a crucial lesson. Against all his enemies, he must be ruthless!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, 6000 miles up ahead is a new transmission array that is set up by the Five Element Region’s Thundercrest Sect that can directly send us to Blood Demon Island. If we go from there, we can arrive at Blood Demon Island in just a few hours, and save an entire two days.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe South Sea was incomparably vast. During this great war, every sect had to find ways to easily transport themselves, thus there were many temporary transmission arrays that had been set up. The reason Qin Ziya had taken the sea map a while ago was to determine the positions of every transmission array and plan the quickest route.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I got it.” Lin Ming poured true essence into Fireshine’s body, speeding up Fireshine.
