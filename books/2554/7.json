Tram squinted against the smoke from his unfiltered Pall Mall as he inspected the ruined lining of the sleeve. He was on the far side of sixty and as a younger man had lost the lower half of his right leg to a Viet Cong finger charge. He\u0027d hired Jack a while back to help him with a mob problem he\u0027d been pushed into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poked a finger through the bullet hole and eyed Jack. \"Yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nodded. He\u0027d gone home, found an insulated Windbreaker, then trained down here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t clean,\" Tram said, shaking his head. \"But can fix hole and sew new sleeve liner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay on the liner, but leave the holes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows lifted. \"Eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A reminder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTram\u0027s smile revealed a mouth crowded with canary-yellow teeth. \"Yes. Reminder is good.\" He pointed down to where his right leg was steel and plastic. \"Makes one more careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Tram\u0027s he walked up to Canal Street and caught a cab over to Doc Hargus\u0027s place. He\u0027d called from home and the doc was in. Doc\u0027s office was his apartment, a third-floor walk-up. He\u0027d had a little substance abuse problem back in the day. Okay, a big problem and he\u0027d lost his license before he\u0027d cleaned up. His only vice now was beer, and that in moderation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still practiced on the QT, treating injuries and overdoses and things people didn\u0027t want part of the public record. Too bad, because his portly physique, deep voice, and Wilford Brimley mustache inspired trust and confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re you running on me?\" he said after Jack had stripped to the waist and he\u0027d removed Bill\u0027s dressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdd question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not running anything. What\u0027re you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc pulled on a pair of latex gloves and removed one of the butterflies, peeling both ends at once toward the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t I tell you over the phone I couldn\u0027t stitch up any wound over twenty-four hours old?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you told me this happened just this morning, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack tensed, feeling a niggle of annoyance. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc pointed to the wound. \"I can\u0027t suture this. It\u0027s already started to knit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack craned his neck and looked. The wound still looked bloody and angry to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just the butterflies holding it together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc looked at him over his glasses. \"I think I\u0027ve seen a few more of these than you, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, no argument there, but Doc, I swear: I got grazed at around ten o\u0027clock this morning. Why would I lie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc looked at him, then adjusted his glasses and leaned closer to the wound. He studied it for a few seconds, then straightened, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Good question. Why would you? But Jack ... that\u0027s at least two days old - \" His hand flashed up as Jack opened his mouth to protest. \"I\u0027ll rephrase: It\u0027s got at least two days\u0027 worth of healing there. If, as you say, this happened this morning, well, you tell me what vitamins and herbs you\u0027re taking because you\u0027ve suddenly developed some super healing powers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack went cold as he heard Glaeken\u0027s voice echo in his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWounds heal much more quickly than you\u0027d imagine ... a scratch like that would heal almost immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack\u0027s wound hadn\u0027t healed \"almost immediately,\" but Doc said it was already days into the process, though only hours had passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Doc said. \"You don\u0027t look so hot. Never known you to mind the sight of blood - even your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken seemed to be failing, and here Jack was developing the healing powers the old guy had once possessed. Pretty obvious that Jack, as the Heir to the Defender post, was being prepared to step into Glaeken\u0027s shoes. How long had this healing thing been going on? If Jack hadn\u0027t been hurt, he still wouldn\u0027t know about it. It could only mean Glaeken\u0027s demise was imminent. How long did the old guy have?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll replace the butterflies,\" Doc was saying, \"even though it hardly needs them at this point. Pretty good job of closing that wound. Who did it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want this, Jack thought. I do not want this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one had asked. No one had given him a choice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-7.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
