She was more like a calmly flowing volcano. Right when she was about to erupt, the radiance in the young lady’s eyes finally released a cool-headed decisiveness. She instantly compared her own battle ability with Su’s, and then fiercely thought, “Wasn’t there a way a long time ago? It’ll just be like Persephone! That crafty fella…”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhat made the young lady feel vexed was that when Persephone used forceful methods, Su’s combat ability was completely negligible, not something that could be compared to his current self at all. If it was the current Su, before Persephone obtained him, there might be a great battle first, the victor and loser uncertain.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHer terrifying battle instincts returned, helping the young lady continuously analyze and simulate different battle scenarios with Su.

On his back was the electromagnetic energy rifle, and inside the knapsack that wasn’t that large fuel cells and electromagnetic bullets were stored. Two specialized custom-made 60 centimeter daggers were inserted next to his legs. Apart from these, he didn’t bring anything else.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMadeline didn’t have anything to pack. The young lady lifted her bag, put on her hat, and then followed behind Su while dragging the alloy heavy sword.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eUnder the drooping hat’s cover, the young lady’s azure eyes flickered continuously. Cirvanas who was walking in front of her suddenly sensed danger, his entire body trembling, involuntarily looking all around him. When his eyes swept past Madeline, he immediately felt the young lady’s slowly rising loftiness. The various painful experiences that happened to him these past few days appeared before his eyes once again, making him immediately avert his eyes, not daring to look at her anymore. However, Cirvanas felt that today’s Madeline felt a bit strange, but as for where the strangeness laid, he couldn’t really say, only feeling that she was a bit different from the past. Even though the young man experienced close to a hundred years of life, he spent most of his life in the underground research base. Aside from Ansuna, the only other creatures he associated with were infected researchers. Their intelligence already degenerated to the level of animals, so it could be said that he completely lacked social experience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu was oblivious to the slight changes that were happening behind him, only walking out from the city at a constant speed.

He ran at a constant speed, Cirvanas and Madeline following behind him. Thirty kilometers per hour, for someone like Cirvanas wasn’t too great of a burden either. Under Su and Madeline’s occasional help, he could continuously run for seven to eight hours. After obtaining the nucleus, energy was no longer a problem, what restricted the youth was his body’s strength.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen night withdrew, and then returned, the land Su’s feet treaded upon was already covered in snow.

It sensed that these three prey were extremely hard to deal with.

Energy surged once once again, triggering a resonance. However, this time, the heartbeat sound did not come from the heart in Su’s chest, but was instead completely baseless, as if sounding right next to these three’s ears.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe snow beast whimpered, and then it was suddenly shot into midair, its body continuously distorting, expanding in the void, its body that quickly inflated immediately pushed aside the fur around it, revealing its bloody muscle tissues. Its skin and fur began to split open inch by inch, and there was naturally blood that flew out. However, this blood was similar to the blood from Su’s body, after flying out, automatically gathering into blood beads.

Its forehead was cracked open as well, a yellow bubblelike structure floating, staring deathly at Su! Blood continuously flowed out from his body, but gravity seemed to have lost effectiveness. This blood flowed extremely quickly in reverse, even intertwining, just not dripping onto the ground.
