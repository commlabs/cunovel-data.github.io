I’m just waiting to get the exact figure from Zane once he’s spoken with the accountant again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five. Hundred. Fucking. Thousand. Dollars!” I gasp. “Someone has stolen five hundred thousand dollars from you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I was angry before, I’m bloody raging now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slides me a look. “From the business, but basically, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to go back to LA, Jake. You need to get back and sort this out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, we’re—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say firmly. “This is huge. This is fraud we’re talking about here. Fraud against your company. A huge amount of fucking fraud! When did you find out about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a pissed-off look. “You should have told me yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tru, don’t be ridiculous, you were sick. Look I’m telling you now like you asked.” He brings my hand to his lips and kisses it. “I know you’re worried, which is exactly what I didn’t want, but here we are. No fuckin’ way are we leaving this island for another three days. I’m on vacation with my girl—and no, you’re not keeping me from my business obligations,” he interjects, cutting me off with his finger to my lips when I open my mouth to protest. “Yes, the label is having some problems. Problems that Zane is more than capable of handling for another three days until I get back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring into my eyes, he traces his fingertip over my lower lip, tugging it down ever so slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch his pupils dilate. And I feel the air instantly shift between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy nipples harden. I’m not wearing a bra under my vest, so they put on an obvious show to Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darken further as they move downward, over my breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you want to help me, Tru, then give me this time with you,” he says, his voice rough. “It’s what I need right now. You are what I need right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing exactly what Jake needs, and more than willing to give it to him, I climb onto his lap, straddling him. “Okay,” I say. “We’ll do this your way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving me a sexy smile, he rests his large hands on my behind. “What do you want to do today?” he asks with blatant sex in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach between us and palm him through his shorts. “I want you inside me—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently I don’t need to say anything more. Jake is on his feet in one swift move, taking me with him, and he carries me back to our villa in record time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant we’re inside, he sets me down and tears my vest off. And yes, I mean he’s ripped it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, he’s strong, and it’s so totally hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shorts and panties are next. Thankfully, they avoid a tearing, as he whips them down my legs in one go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve been stripped bare in a matter of seconds. Only Jake could make tearing my clothes off a show of how strong his love is for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love that he can make me feel so wanted and cherished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, I’ve missed this…you.” His eyes devour me for long seconds, then his mouth is on mine. Taking me with him in a few strides, he has me flat on my back on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving down my body, he takes my nipple into his mouth and runs his tongue around it. Heat pools in my core, leaving me wet and wanting, and I moan with need and desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grazes his teeth over my nipple, then moving down and off me, he kneels on the floor by the bed, grabs me by the thighs, and yanks me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy legs are set to rest on his shoulders, and he slides a finger over my sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So wet,” he rasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing what he’s about to do, I close my eyes and let my head fall back into the comfort of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watch me,” he commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInclining, resting up on my elbows, I look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to watch me…make you come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake’s never asked me to watch him before. I don’t really care what’s made him ask—I’m just glad he did, because it’s so fucking sexy. He’s so fucking sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoing as he asks, I stay inclined and keep my eyes fixed on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as he runs his tongue over his upper lip, like he tastes me already. His bright blue eyes darken to inky as he leans forward and puts his mouth close to my sex. Then he very slowly licks his tongue over my sensitive bud, all the while not moving his eyes from mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm, so sweet,” he murmurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m riveted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching him tend to me in this way is mind-blowing. It elevates the sensation of his touch to a level I didn’t even know existed. It’s insanely sensual watching as Jake’s tongue moves over the most intimate part of me, in the most intimate way. What makes me nearly lose control is seeing the pleasure on his face while he’s doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands fist in the sheets when he blows over my already sensitised clit, driving the sensations higher and me wilder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want him inside me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake pushes a finger inside me as he continues to lick me to crazy with his tongue, and I instantly clench around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want it…my cock inside you?” he murmurs, sending vibrations humming over my sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, yes,” I moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes flicker to mine, hitting me with his sex-hot gaze, as he pushes another finger in me and starts to fuck me with them. Then he continues his sweet assault of my senses with his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, yes,” I breathe, clutching my own breast, the tension inside me building to insane. My core tightens in response to his maddening licks. “Yes, Jake…oh, please…right there…holy fuck, I’m coming!” I suddenly cry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a bolt of lightning searing through me, the orgasm tears through my body, arching my back off the bed. Jake pins my hips down with his free hand, continuing to draw the orgasm out, while I move under him as he climaxes me to epic proportions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve gone two days without this, without him, and apparently I was ready. More ready than I had realised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the sensations ebb, I sag into the bed, replete and boneless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my hazy orgasmic vision, I see Jake peeling off his T-shirt and reaching for his shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing myself up, I stand on wobbly legs and stop his hands with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake is always pleasuring me. Now it’s my turn to please him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hook my fingers into the waistband of his shorts. Pulling them down, I follow them on their journey, my knees hitting the floor the moment they do. Jake kicks them aside, while my gaze alights on his thick cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, I take him in my hand and place my lips over his crown, drawing him into my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus,” Jake groans, his body jerking at the feel of me around him. He grabs a fistful of my hair, steadying himself. “The feel of your mouth gets me every time, Tru, it’s so fuckin’ warm…so soft.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silk and steeliness of him makes me moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a shudder move through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flicker my tongue on the underside, pull back slightly, lick the tip, then take him back in my mouth. I feel a burst of pre-cum hit my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreedily swallowing it, I start to fist him farther into my mouth, sucking hard, taking in as much of him as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tru, your mouth…so hot…you suck me so good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePleased that I’m pleasing him, I brace my hand against his hard thigh, relaxing my jaw, taking even more of him in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” he growls. Taking hold of my head with his other hand, knotting his fingers into my hair, he starts to fuck my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God…Tru…ah, we need to stop…I’m, ah, Jesus…I’m gonna come.” He starts to pull back, trying to remove himself from my mouth. But I want him to come in my mouth. I’ve missed the taste of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tighten my hold on his thigh, removing my hand from his cock, gripping his other thigh, trying to keep him in place, letting him know my intention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, baby, you’ve been sick, you don’t need me coming in your mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head gently, running his fingers down my cheek. “Next time. Right now, I just want to come inside that gorgeous body of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him one last remembering suck, then let him guide me to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake’s eyes are blazing. I know how hard it must have been for him to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my tongue over my upper lip. Jake’s eyes follow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you want me?” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inhales sharply. “Bend over and brace your hands against the wall.” There’s no conversation in his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoving the command, legs trembling, I do exactly as he says. I bend over and place my palms flat against the wall by the bed, more than ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel Jake move behind me. He nudges my legs farther apart with his knee, then I feel the head of his cock press against my entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m gonna fuck you, baby. Hard. You ready?” I don’t have to see him to know his teeth are gritted together, that his restraint is almost gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeen, I push my hips back against him. “What are you waiting for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake grabs hold of my hips and slams into me in one swift move, jolting me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” he bites out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI steady myself against the wall as Jake pulls my hips back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eases out of me, then drives into me again with a long, hard thrust. I can’t help the loud moan that escapes me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake’s grip on me tightens to near pain, holding me in place, but I don’t care. I need this. I need him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talk to me in Spanish, sweetheart,” he growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile sweeps my lips. Knowing exactly what this does to him, I comply readily. “No me jodas más, Jake. Harder!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake loves the Puerto Rican in me, and the sound of me speaking Spanish drives him crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny reserve he had left is gone, and he starts fucking me hard and ruthless, talking sex to me. “Jesus, Tru, you’re so fuckin’ sexy with that dirty mouth of yours. You feel so fuckin’ tight and hot. I’m so hard…fucking you deep…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel him growing even bigger inside me, hitting that spot, the one hidden deep within me. It’s only ever been touched by Jake, and I know he’s getting near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves his hand around to my sex and rubs my clit with his finger, urging me on to another orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy muscles start to tighten and spasm as he thrusts his big cock in and out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come, Tru. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body bows to his command, and I climax in a lust-fuelled haze of his dominance, my core tightening around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel him shudder. “Fuck, Tru!” he cries out, and I feel the heat of him spurt into me, his hips jerking, ramming into me, as he fills me with his semen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he’s given everything to me, Jake brushes my hair aside and lays his chest against my back, resting his hands over mine against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?” he asks softly, kissing my shoulder, his teeth gently grazing my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m better than okay.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wethering-the-storm-the-storm-2/page-5.html","bookId":1999,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:55 PM"}
