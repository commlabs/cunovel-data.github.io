When the moment passed, we headed to the Range Rover to start our road trip to Michigan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw our bags in the back as Ellery settled in comfortably. As I started driving, I looked over and noticed that she was staring at me. She didn’t care that I noticed, because every time I glanced over, she was still watching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you staring at me?” I grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was just wondering about Connor Black, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and looked back at the road. She wasn’t going to give up until she found out more about me. I know I need to open up to her, and I will; just not right now. She put her headphones on and stared out the passenger window. I could tell she was irritated with my response. I tapped her on the shoulder; she looked at me and took her earphones off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to ignore me the whole way there?” I asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to tell me a little bit about Connor Black?” she smiled in a cocky way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy god this girl was starting to piss me off, but in a sexy way. I sighed and tried to think about what I should tell her or better yet, where I should start. She turned her head and put in her headphones again. I was not about to be ignored by her, especially for the next 10 hours because she’s too damn stubborn to respect my privacy. I reached over and yanked out one of her headphones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, what the hell, Connor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take those things out you stubborn girl, and I’ll talk,” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she won, and I bet she did it on purpose. There was no getting around not telling her something about me or else she would make me suffer. I started with the story about my twin brother, Collin and how he died when he was seven years old from a virus that attacked his heart. After I was finished explaining the story about Collin, I told her about Cassidy and her son Camden. I explained how Camden is autistic, and that he’s the reason my company and I are involved with the charity for autism. She gave me a sympathetic look as she put her hand on my shoulder and started rubbing it. She cared; I could see it in her face and in her eyes. Ellery is the most caring and helpful person that I’ve ever known. I went on to explain to her about my father and how he started grooming me for Black Enterprises when I was thirteen years old. I told her all about Harvard, how I took over my father’s company when I was twenty-eight years old, and how I’ve doubled the company’s profits over the past two years. It wasn’t hard talking about my personal life to Ellery. I didn’t think I would be able to do it as I’ve never discussed anything about my life with anyone. She was easy to talk to, and I could tell she was happy with the information I gave her. That was until she spoke the unspeakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about past relationships?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my lips together and took in a deep breath, I don’t talk about my past relationships; there’s no point, and why revisit the past? I don’t have a girlfriend, nor do I want one.” The comment just fell out of my mouth, without even thinking about it first. She looked away after I said that and then back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you? Even if you’ve been hurt before, you just have to pick yourself up and move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone’s been hurt at least once in their life, some more than others, but you have to make a choice what to do with that pain,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that simple, Ellery; trust me,” I said as I continuously stared at the road ahead of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you don’t ever want to get married or have children and do the whole perfect family thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her with a serious look, “No, I never want any of that, and to quote you, nothing lasts forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really need to stop quoting that, Connor. I think you took it the wrong way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Regardless of which way I took it, I already told you that I don’t do relationships, and I mean that,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked out the window, “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t tell if she was hurt or put off by my comments. I don’t know why she would be hurt, and it’s not like she wants any of that bullshit. I’ll admit, maybe it isn’t all bullshit, but it scares me. We made small talk for a while, and she kept putting one headphone in my ear then asked me if I liked her music. She seemed to be ok, and she was having fun, making me listen to her songs. We had different taste in music, that’s for sure. But I played along, because every time she put on a different song and asked if I liked it, she smiled. Damn that smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had already been driving about four hours, and I needed to stop for gas. I pulled off the highway and stopped at the first gas station that I saw. Ellery had fallen asleep about 30 minutes before and woke up when I stopped the Range Rover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on? What are we doing?” she asked sleepily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to fill her up and then we’ll stop for something to eat,” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out and walked over to the gas pump. Ellery opened her door and got out, stretching her back and legs. She walked over to where I was standing and kissed my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that for?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just a thank you for telling me about your family,” she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back as she told me she was going inside the store to pick up a couple of things. I finished pumping gas and headed inside to find Ellery. I saw her standing in the candy isle, looking over the vast amount of junk food in front of her. She was so engrossed in the chocolate that sat before her eyes; she didn’t notice me walk up behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to fill your body with this junk?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quickly turned around as she stumbled, but I caught her in my arms. “Ellery, are you alright?” I asked as I held her close to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine; I just got a little light-headed,” she replied as she held her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continued to hold her until she felt better. “I knew we should have waited an extra day to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re not ready to travel yet. You need more time to recover from your fall.” I was pissed off at myself because I played around with the idea of leaving tomorrow instead. She kept her head on my chest and told me to stop being overprotective and that her light-headedness was probably caused from the pain medication she took. I found that odd because I didn’t see her take any pain meds. I started to worry about her; in fact, I’ve been worried about her since she fainted. I told her that I was finding us a hotel, and that we were stopping for the night so she could rest. We were ahead of schedule, and we’d be in Michigan tomorrow with plenty of time. She told me she wanted to drive for a couple of more hours and get something to eat before we stopped for the night. She pointed towards the front door and asked me to get her a basket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You aren’t seriously buying that much, are you?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ok, Mr. Black, if you must know the truth, it’s my PMS time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a step back and put my hands up, “Whoa, enough said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned as she took the basket and filled it with chips, chocolate, and pop. I stood there and watched her with a horrified look on my face. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone eat that much junk food. The women I’m used to practically starve themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you’re the one who wanted to take me on this road trip. I’m just trying to keep the peace because without these foods for a woman at that time of the month,” she waved her hand, “Well, you don’t really want to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked over to the checkout, and she placed the basket on the counter. The cashier overheard our conversation, then she looked at me and said, “Trust her; we girls are two sheets short of psycho when it comes to our special little time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just stood there and looked at both of them, speechless, as she rang up the food. The cashier gave the total, and Ellery looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her in confusion, “Really? You want me to pay for this crap?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cashier leaned over the counter and looked me straight in the eyes, “Remember, two sheets short of psycho.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out my wallet and paid as I mumbled under my breath. I took the bag and headed out. She climbed in the Range Rover, and we headed for the interstate. I looked at her and shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re crazy; I just wanted you to know that,” I said in a serious, but playful tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aw, sweetie, I know, but I promise it’s only for a few days,” she laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried so hard to hold back a smile, but I couldn’t. She was just too damn adorable, and my feelings for her were getting stronger by the minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile driving along the interstate, we saw a sign for multiple restaurants. I got off the highway and asked Ellery where she wanted to eat. She asked me to surprise her as she liked just about anything. I asked her if she was sure, and she nodded her head in response. I had a craving for seafood as I saw the restaurant on the left. I turned into the parking lot, got out of the car, and opened the door for Ellery. I held my arm out for her as she hooked hers around mine, and we walked into the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hostess informed us that there was a 30 minute wait; however, Ellery didn’t seem to want to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her 30 minutes was nothing as I grabbed her hand and led her to the bar to have a drink while we waited for our table to free up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we took our seats at the bar, the bartender set down some napkins and leaned on the bar in front of me. I won’t lie; she was an attractive woman, but not my type. I could see Ellery eyeing her from the corner of my eye. She had a ‘back off’ look on her face as she stared at the attractive bartender. I wanted to test her and see if she would get jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will it be, handsome?” The bartender asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned in closer to her. “I’ll have a sex with the bartender,” I flirtatiously smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One sex with a bartender coming right up, stud,” she winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllery gasped, and by the look on her face, I could tell she was pissed. I waited for her to say something to me, but she didn’t. She looked at the bartender and did the unthinkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, sweetheart, when you get his drink, don’t forget to bring those luscious boobies over here,” she smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened as I slowly turned my head and looked at her. I couldn’t believe what she just said. “Ellery, what the hell are you doing?” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Am I embarrassing you, Mr. ‘I’ll have sex with a bartender’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender walked over and handed me my drink. She looked at Ellery, and asked her what she wanted in an irritated way. Ellery looked at her and pouted, “Don’t you think it’s only fair that you give me the same kind of service that you’re giving him? Why should he be the only one to get to see your boobies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so embarrassed. I couldn’t believe she did that. I threw some money on the bar and stood up, “Come on honey, I think our table is ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed her hand and shook my head. She looked at me and smiled. I leaned over and whispered in her ear, “Point taken, you bad girl.” My plan had obviously backfired on me. This girl was not a force to be reckoned with, that’s for sure. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-you-forever-2/page-15.html","bookId":1820,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:12:14 PM"}
