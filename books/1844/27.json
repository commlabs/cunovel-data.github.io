Brodick, true to his impatient nature, blurted out, \"Judith, you aren\u0027t going back to England. Not now. Not ever. Iain isn\u0027t going to take you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior sounded quite cheerful when he gave her his news. She turned her gaze to him. \"He isn\u0027t? Then who will take me back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one,\" Brodick answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain took hold of both her hands and squeezed to get her attention. Then he took a deep breath. Even with his men watching, he wanted the words to be right, his declaration to be one she would always remember. It was a damned awkward undertaking, trying to think of loving words, and he had absolutely no experience in this area, but he was still determined not to muck it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment needed to be perfect for her. \"Judith,\" he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Iain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m keeping you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t just… keep me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, he can, lass,\" Alex cheerfully explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s laird,\" Graham reminded her. \"He can do anything he\u0027s wanting to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter that he\u0027s laird,\" Brodick interjected. \"Franklen kept Marrian and he isn\u0027t laird. Robert kept Meagan,\" he added with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kept Isabelle,\" Winslow added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s our way, lass,\" Gowrie explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t just keep Isabelle,\" Brodick told his brother, determined to set that misconception straight. \"You asked for her. There\u0027s a difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have taken her if her father had been difficult,\" Winslow argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith couldn\u0027t believe what she was hearing. They had all gone daft. She pulled her hands away from Iain\u0027s grasp and took a step back, away from this madness. She stepped on Graham\u0027s foot. She turned around to give him her apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Graham. I didn\u0027t mean to step on—He can\u0027t just keep me, can he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraham nodded. \"Gowrie was right when he told you it\u0027s our way,\" he explained. \"Of course, you\u0027re going to have to agree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was filled with sympathy. Iain had given the pretty woman quite a startle. She seemed to be a little overwhelmed, but certainly thrilled with this announcement. It was the highest of honors to be chosen as wife of the laird. Aye, she was so pleased, she couldn\u0027t seem to form a coherent word of appreciation, he supposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraham supposed wrong. In the space of a minute or two, Judith recovered. Then she shook her head. She might have been able to control her anger if Iain\u0027s supporters hadn\u0027t all nodded at her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod\u0027s truth, she wanted to kick every one of them. She\u0027d have to quit sputtering first. She took a deep breath in an effort to gain control, then said in a hoarse voice, \"Iain, might I have a word in private with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There really isn\u0027t time for chitchat now, lass,\" Father Laggan called out. \"Merlin won\u0027t keep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merlin?\" she asked in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a Dunbar,\" Graham explained. With a smile he added, \"He\u0027s in need of a priest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith turned to look at Father Laggan. \"Then you must go to him,\" she said. \"Is he dying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest shook his head. \"He\u0027s dead, Judith. His family\u0027s waiting on me to bury him. It\u0027s the heat, you see. Merlin isn\u0027t going to keep much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, he\u0027s got to get him in the ground,\" Brodick explained. \"He\u0027ll marry you first. The Maitlands come before the Dunbars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merlin won\u0027t keep?\" Judith repeated the priest\u0027s explanation and put her hand to her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The heat,\" Brodick reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started trembling. Iain took mercy on her. It had taken him days of hard thought before he\u0027d come to the conclusion that he couldn\u0027t let Judith leave. He realized now he probably should have given her more time to think about his proposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, there wasn\u0027t any time left to consider all the reasons. After talking to Patrick and confirming his own suspicions, he knew he had to marry Judith as soon as possible. He wasn\u0027t about to take the chance that someone else might find out about her father. No, he had to marry her now. It was the only way he could protect her from the bastard Macleans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took hold of her hand and led her over to the corner of the hall. She stumbled and he ended up half dragging her. She stood with her back against the wall. He stood in front of her, effectively blocking her view of the rest of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nudged her chin up so she would look at him. \"I want you to marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iain, will you be reasonable about this? I can\u0027t marry you. Even if I wanted to, it isn\u0027t possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do want to marry me,\" he countered. \"Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staggered by the possibility that she didn\u0027t want him. He had to shake his head. \"You damn well do,\" he told her then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? And why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bluster went out of her anger. Of all the reasons he could have given her, he\u0027d centered on the one she couldn\u0027t argue with. She did trust him, with all her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel safe with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t argue with that truth, either. \"You know I\u0027ll protect you from harm,\" he added with a gentle nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes filled with tears. Dear God, she wished it were possible. \"Do you love me, Iain?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned down and kissed her. \"I have never wanted another woman the way I want you,\" he said. \"You want me, too. Don\u0027t deny it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulders slumped. \"I don\u0027t deny it,\" she whispered. \"But wanting and loving are two different matters. I might not love you,\" she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that was a lie as soon as the words were out of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew it, too. \"Aye, you do love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tear slipped down her cheek. \"You\u0027re putting impossible thoughts in my head,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gently wiped the tear away. His hands cupped the sides of her face. \"Nothing is impossible. Marry me, Judith. Let me protect you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to tell him the truth now. Only then would he change his mind about this rash decision. \"There\u0027s something you don\u0027t know about me,\" she began. \"My father—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth covered hers, effectively stopping her confession. The kiss was long, passionate, and when he pulled back, she barely knew her own thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to tell him again. He stopped her with another kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judith, you will not tell me anything about your family,\" he ordered. \"I don\u0027t care if your father\u0027s the king of England. You will not speak another word on the topic. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Iain—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your past isn\u0027t important,\" he told her. He took hold of her shoulders and squeezed. His voice was low, fervent. \"Let it go, Judith. You\u0027re going to belong to me. I\u0027m going to be your family. I\u0027ll take care of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made it sound so appealing. Judith didn\u0027t know what to do. \"I must think about this,\" she decided. \"In a few days—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good Lord,\" Father Laggan called out. \"We can\u0027t expect Merlin to keep that long, lass. Consider the heat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wait?\" Patrick called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, he\u0027s told you he\u0027s keeping you. Get the wedding done,\" Brodick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until that moment that Judith realized they\u0027d all been listening to her private talk with Iain. She felt like screaming. Then she did. \"I will not be rushed into this,\" she told them. In a softer voice she added, \"There are plenty of reasons why I shouldn\u0027t marry your laird, and I need time to consider…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are these reasons?\" Graham asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain turned to the leader of the council. \"Are you for or against us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not overly pleased, of course, but you know I\u0027ll stand beside you. You have my support. Gelfrid, what about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGelfrid frowned at Judith while he gave his answer. \"I\u0027m in agreement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other council members, like dominoes, followed Gelfrid\u0027s voice of approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith had heard enough. \"How can you give your approval and glare at me at the same time?\" she demanded. She turned back to Iain and poked him in his chest. \"I don\u0027t want to live here. I already made up my mind to live with my aunt Millicent and uncle Herbert. And do you know why?\" She didn\u0027t give him time to answer. \"They don\u0027t consider me inferior, that\u0027s why. Well?\" she demanded in a challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what?\" Iain asked, trying not to smile over the outrage she was giving him. The woman was feisty when she was riled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They like me,\" she stammered out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We like you fine, Judith,\" Alex told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone does,\" Patrick added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t believing that nonsense for a minute. Neither was Brodick. He gave Patrick a look that suggested he\u0027d lost his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t particularly like any of you brutes,\" she announced. \"The thought of living here is simply not acceptable. I won\u0027t raise my children—Oh, God, Iain, I\u0027m not having any, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judith, calm yourself,\" Iain commanded. He pulled her up against him and hugged her tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not wanting children?\" Graham asked. He sounded appalled. \"Iain, you can\u0027t allow that kind of talk. You need an heir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she barren?\" Gelfrid called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She isn\u0027t saying that,\" Vincent muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my fault,\" Winslow interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s your fault the woman\u0027s barren?\" Gelfrid asked, trying to understand. \"How can that be, Winslow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick started laughing. Brodick elbowed him to get him to stop. \"She had to help with Isabelle\u0027s birthing,\" Brodick told Gelfrid. \"It made her afraid. That\u0027s all there is to it. She isn\u0027t barren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe council members grunted with relief. Iain wasn\u0027t paying any attention to anyone but Judith now. He leaned down and whispered, \"You\u0027re right, you need more time to consider this proposal. Take as long as you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something in his voice that made her suspicious. She realized what it was almost immediately. Iain was vastly amused. \"How long do I have to consider this proposal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sleeping in my bed tonight. I thought you might want to be married first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed herself out of his arms and looked up at him. He was smiling. She never stood a chance. She realized that now. Lord, she did love him. And at this very moment she couldn\u0027t think of one good reason why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d all made her daft. \"Why in God\u0027s name do I love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t realized she\u0027d shouted her question until Patrick started laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well now, that settles it. She\u0027s agreed,\" Father Laggan called out. He hurried across the hall. \"Let\u0027s get it done. Patrick, you stand on Iain\u0027s right, and Graham, you put yourself next to Judith. You can give her away. In the name of the Father, and of the Son—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re giving her away, too,\" Gelfrid announced, determined not to be left out of this important ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, we are,\" Duncan muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scuffle of chairs interrupted the priest\u0027s concentration. He waited until the other elders had all squeezed themselves around Judith, and then began again. \"In the name of the Father—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You only want to marry me so you can order me around all the time,\" Judith told Iain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is that benefit,\" Iain drawled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought the Dunbars were your enemies,\" she said then. \"Yet your priest—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you think Merlin died?\" Brodick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, son, you can\u0027t be taking credit for that death,\" Graham advised. \"It was the fall over the cliff that did him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winslow, didn\u0027t you do the pushing when he came at you with the knife?\" Brodick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother shook his head. \"He slipped before I could get to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith was appalled by their talk. Patrick decided to answer her initial question about the priest since no one else seemed inclined. \"There aren\u0027t enough men of the cloth to serve up here,\" he said. \"Father Laggan\u0027s allowed to come and go as he pleases.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He serves a wide area,\" Alex interjected, \"and all the clans we consider our enemies. There are the Dunbars, the Macphersons, and the Macleans, and others, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was astonished by their list of enemies. She made that mention to Graham. She wanted to learn everything she could about the Maitlands, of course, but there was another motive, too. She needed time to collect herself. She felt as though she were in a daze. She was trembling like an infant freshly washed in cold water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex has only given you a partial list,\" Graham told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you people like anyone?\" she asked, incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraham shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we get on with this?\" Father Laggan cried out. \"In the name of the Father…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m inviting my aunt Millicent and uncle Herbert to come for a visit, Iain, and I\u0027m not going through the council to get permission first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"… and of the Son,\" the priest continued in a much louder voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be wanting King John next,\" Duncan predicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t allow that, lass,\" Owen muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please join hands now and concentrate on this ceremony,\" Father Laggan shouted, trying to gain everyone\u0027s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want King John to come here,\" Judith argued. She turned to frown at Owen for making such a shameful suggestion. \"I want my aunt and uncle. I\u0027m getting them, too.\" She turned and had to peek around Graham in order to look up at Iain. \"Yes or no, Iain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see. Graham, I\u0027m marrying Judith, not you. Let go of her hand. Judith, move over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Laggan gave up trying to maintain order. He continued on with the ceremony. Iain was paying some attention. He immediately agreed to take Judith for his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t as cooperative. He felt a little sorry for the sweet woman. She looked thoroughly confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judith, do you take Iain for your husband?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at Iain before giving her answer. \"We\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That won\u0027t do, lass. You\u0027ve got to say I do,\" he advised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-27.html","bookId":1844,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:35:16 PM"}
