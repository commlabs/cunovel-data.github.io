His wife wore a sable hat and a dark sable coat that did wonderful things for her pale complexion and almost concealed her pregnancy. She stood next to her daughter and they both watched proudly as Adam took the oath of office, and the country rejoiced for the three of them. They were the best of America: decent and honest and good, and they belonged in the White House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a small law office in Kelso, Washington, Jennifer Parker sat alone looking at the inauguration on television. She watched until the last of the ceremony was over and Adam and Mary Beth and Samantha had left the podium, surrounded by secret service men. Then Jennifer turned off the television set and watched the images fade into nothingness. And it was like turning off the past: shutting out all that had happened to her, the love and the death and the joy and the pain. Nothing had been able to destroy her. She was a survivor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put on her hat and coat and walked outside, pausing for a moment to look at the sign that said: Jennifer Parker, Attorney at Law. She thought for an instant of the jury that had acquitted her. She was still a lawyer, as her father had been a lawyer. And she would go on, searching for the elusive thing called justice. She turned and headed in the direction of the courthouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer walked slowly down the deserted, windswept street. A light snow had begun to fall, casting a chiffon veil over the world. From an apartment building nearby there came a sudden burst of merriment, and it was such an alien sound that she stopped for a moment to listen. She pulled her coat tighter about her and moved on down the street, peering into the curtain of snow ahead, as though she were trying to see into the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was looking into the past, trying to understand when it was that all the laughter died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMistress of the Game Excerpt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePROLOGUE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLEXI\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2025\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi Templeton\u0027s hands trembled as she read the letter. Sitting on the bed in her wedding dress, in what had once been her Great Grandmother\u0027s bedroom, her quick mind began to race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink. You don\u0027t have much time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would Kate Blackwell have done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt forty one, Lexi Templeton was still a beautiful woman. Her lustrous blonde hair was untouched by gray and her slim, petite figure showed no sign of her recent pregnancy. She\u0027d been determined to get her killer body back before her wedding. She wanted to do justice to her vintage Monique Lhullier gown, a clinging column of finest ivory-white lace. And she had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, the hundred or so wedding guests gathered at Cedar Hill House, the Blackwell family\u0027s legendary Maine estate, gasped when Lexi Templeton appeared on the lawn arm in arm with her father. Talk about beauty and the beast. Peter Templeton, Lexi\u0027s father, once an eminent psychiatrist and one of New York\u0027s most eligible bachelors was now an old man. Frail, bent almost double with age and grief, Peter Templeton lead his beautiful daughter towards the rose covered altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought: I can go now. I can go to join my darling Alexandra. Our little girl is happy at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. Lexi Templeton was happy. She knew she looked radiant. She was marrying the man she loved, surrounded by family and friends. Only one person was missing. That person would never witness another of Lexi\u0027s triumphs. He would never delight in another of her failures. His life and Lexi\u0027s had been intertwined since birth, like the tangled roots of a great tree. But now he was gone, never to return. Despite everything that had happened, Lexi missed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan you see me, Max darling? Are you watching? Are you sorry now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Lexi Templeton felt a pang of loss. Then she laid eyes on her husband-to-be, and all her regrets evaporated. Today was going to be perfect. The cliche. The fairytale. The happiest day of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe President of the United States was unable to make the wedding. There was a small matter of a war in the Middle East. But he sent a congratulatory telegram, which Lexi\u0027s brother Robbie read aloud when the newlyweds cut the cake. And everybody else was there. Captains of Industry, Prime Ministers, Kings, Movie Stars. As Chairwoman of the mighty Kruger Brent Limited, Lexi Templeton was American royalty. She looked like a Queen because she was one. She had it all: great beauty, immense wealth and power that stretched to the four corners of the globe. Now, thanks to her new husband, she had love, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she also had enemies. Powerful enemies. One of whom was determined to destroy her, even from beyond the grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi read the letter again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027ve done. I know everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe net was closing in. Lexi felt the fear churn in her stomach like curdled milk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must be a way out of this. There\u0027s always a way. I will not go to prison. I will not lose Kruger Brent. I will not lose my family. Think!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours ago the Governor of Maine made a speech about Lexi at the reception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...\u0027a remarkable woman, from a remarkable family. Lexi Templeton\u0027s personal courage and integrity are known to all of us. Her spirit, her determination, her business acumen, her honesty...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonesty? If only they knew!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...these make up the public face of Lexi Templeton. But today, we\u0027re here to celebrate something else. A very private joy. A very private love. And a love that those of us who know Lexi know she so richly deserves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi thought: None of you know me. Not even my husband. I don\u0027t \u0027deserve\u0027 his love. But I fought for it, and I won it, and I\u0027m damned if I\u0027m going to let anyone take it away from me. Least of all you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow most of the guests had gone. Lexi\u0027s brother Robbie and his partner were still downstairs. So was Lexi\u0027s baby daughter, Maxine, and the nanny. Any moment now Lexi\u0027s husband would come looking for her. It was time to leave for their honeymoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi Templeton walked over to the window. Beyond the formal lawns of Cedar Hill House she could see the closely huddled white roofs of Dark Harbor, and behind them the dark, brooding sea. This evening the roiling water looked unusually ominous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s waiting. One day it will swallow the island whole. A big wave will come and wipe everything out. As if none of this ever existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men in suits got out of their car and approached the security gate. Even before they pulled out their badges, Lext Templeton knew who they were. It was just like it said in the letter: \u0027The police are on their way. You have no way out Alexandra. Not this time.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears stung the back of Lexi\u0027s eyes. She could hear her Aunt Eve\u0027s voice as clearly as if she were still alive, taunting her, laden with spite. Was she right? Was this really it? The end of the game? After all Lexi\u0027s struggles? She remembered a Dylan Thomas poem she\u0027d learned at school: \"Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn right I\u0027ll rage. I\u0027ll not let that old witch beat me without a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cops were through the gate now. They were almost at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexi Templeton took a deep breath and went downstairs to meet them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the Darkness Excerpt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreed, for lack of a better word, is good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreed is right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreed works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreed, in all of its forms - greed for life, for money, for love, for knowledge - has marked the upward surge of mankind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Gordon Gekko, in Wall Street. 1987) \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-64.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM"}
