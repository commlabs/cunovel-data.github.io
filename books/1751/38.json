{"id":71358,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"\u003cp\u003eOswald Mayer Sheffield (psychologist, thin as a string and as tall as a good length of it, and with a voice that could be used either for singing an operatic selection with surprising virtuosity or for making a point of argument, softly but with stinging accuracy) did not show the anger one would have expected from Vernadsky\u0027s account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was even smiling when he entered the Captain\u0027s cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain broke out mauvely as soon as he entered. \"Look here, Sheffield-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One minute, Captain Follenbee,\" said Sheffield. \"How are you, Mark?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s eyes fell and his words were muffled. \"All right, Dr. Sheffield.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasnt aware you\u0027d gotten out of bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t the shade of reproach in his voice, but Mark grew apologetic. \"I was feeling better, Dr. Sheffield, and I feel bad about not working. I haven\u0027t done anything in all the time I\u0027ve been on the ship. So I put in a call to the Captain to ask to see the logbook and he had me come up here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right I\u0027m sure he won\u0027t mind if you go back to your room now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, won\u0027t I?\" began the Captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield\u0027s mild eyes rose to meet the Captain. \"I\u0027m responsible for him, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd somehow the Captain could think of nothing further to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark turned obediently and Sheffield watched him leave and waited till the door was well closed behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned again to the Captain. \"What\u0027s the bloody idea, Captain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain\u0027s knees bent a little, then straightened and bent again with a sort of threatening rhythm. The invisible slap of his hands, clasped behind his back, could be heard distinctly. \"That\u0027s my question. I\u0027m Captain here, Sheffield.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what it means, eh? This ship, in space, is a legally recognized planet. I\u0027m absolute ruler. In space, what I say goes. Central Committee of the Confederacy can\u0027t say otherwise. I\u0027ve got to maintain discipline, and no spy-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, and now let me tell you something, Captain. You\u0027re chartered by the Bureau of Outer Provinces to carry a government-sponsored research expedition to the Lagrange System, to maintain it there as long as research necessity requires and the safety of the crew and vessel permits, and then to bring us home. You\u0027ve signed that contract and you\u0027ve assumed certain obligations, Captain or not. For instance, you can\u0027t tamper with our instruments and destroy their research usefulness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who in space is doing that?\" The Captain\u0027s voice was a blast of indignation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield repied calmly, \"You are. Hands off Mark Annuncio, Captain. Just as you\u0027ve got to keep your bands off Cimon\u0027s monochrome and Vailleux\u0027s microptics, you\u0027ve got to keep your hands off my Annuncio. And that means each one of your ten, four-striped fingers. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain\u0027s uniformed Chest expanded. \"I take no order on board my own ship. Your language is a breach of discipline, Mister Sheffield. Any more like that and it\u0027s cabin arrest. You and your Annuncio. Don\u0027t like it, then speak to Board of Review back on Earth. Till then, it\u0027s tongue behind teeth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Captain, let me explain something. Mark is in the Mnemonic Service-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, he said so. Nummonic Service. Nummonic Service. It\u0027s plain secret police as far as I\u0027m concerned. Well, not on board my ship, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mnemonic Service,\" said Sheffield patiently. \"Em-en-ee-em-oh-en-eye-see Service. You don\u0027t pronounce the first em. It\u0027s from the Greek word meaning memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"He remembers things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct, Captain. Look, in a way this is my fault. I should have briefed you on this. I would have, too, if the boy hadn\u0027t gotten so sick right after the take-off. It drove most other matters out of my mind. Besides, it didn\u0027t occur to me that he might be interested in the workings of the ship itself. Space knows why not. He should be interested in everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He should, eh?\" The Captain looked at the timepiece on the wall. \"Brief me now, eh? But no fancy words. Not many of any other kind, either. Time limited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t take long, I assure you. Now you\u0027re a space-going man, Captain. How many inhabited worlds would you say there were in the Confederation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eighty thousand,\" said the Captain promptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eighty-three thousand two hundred,\" said Sheffield. \"What do you suppose it takes to run a political organization that size?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the Captain did not hesitate. \"Computers,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. There\u0027s Earth, where half the population works for the government and does nothing but compute and there are computing subcenters on every other world. And even so data gets lost. Every world knows something no other world knows. Almost every man. Look at our little group. Vernadsky doesn\u0027t know any biology and I don\u0027t know enough chemistry to stay alive. There\u0027s not one of us can pilot the simplest space cruiser, except for Fawkes. So we work together, each one supplying the knowledge the others lack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only there\u0027s a catch. Not one of us knows exactly which of our own data is meaningful to the other under a given set of circumstances. We can\u0027t sit and spout every thing we know. So we guess, and sometimes we don\u0027t guess right. Two facts, A and B, can go together beautifully sometimes. So Person A, who knows Fact A, says to Person B, who knows Fact B, \u0027Why didn\u0027t you tell me this ten years ago?\u0027 and Person B answers, \u0027I didn\u0027t think it was important,\u0027 or, \u0027I thought everyone knew that.\u0027\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain said, \"That\u0027s what computers are for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield said, \"Computers are limited, Captain. They have to be asked questions. What\u0027s more, the questions have to be the kind that can be put into a limited number of symbols. What\u0027s more, computers are very literal-minded. They answer exactly what you ask and not what you have in mind. Sometimes it never occurs to anyone to ask just the right question or feed the computer just the right symbols, and when that happens, the computer doesn\u0027t volunteer information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we need, what all mankind needs, is a computer that is nonmechanical; a computer with imagination. There\u0027s one like that, Captain.\" The psychologist tapped his temple. \"In everyone, Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" grunted the Captain, \"but I\u0027ll stick to the usual, eh? Kind you punch a button.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure? Machines don\u0027t have hunches. Did you ever have a hunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this on the point?\" The Captain looked at the timepiece again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield said, \"Somewhere inside the human brain is a record of every datum that has impinged upon it. Very little of it is consciously remembered, but all of it\u0027s there, and a small association can bring an individual datum back without a person\u0027s knowing where it comes from. So you get a \u0027hunch\u0027 or a \u0027feeling.\u0027 Some people are better at it than others. And some can be trained. Some are almost perfect, like Mark Annuncio and a hundred like him. Someday, I hope, there\u0027ll be a billion like him, and we\u0027l really have a Mnemonic Service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All their lives,\" Sheffield went on, \"they do nothing but read, look, and listen. And train to do that better and more efficiently. It doesn\u0027t matter what data they collect. It doesn\u0027t have to have obvious sense or obvious significance. It doesn\u0027t matter if any man in the Service wants to spend a week going over the records of the space-polo teams of the Canopus Sector for the last century. Any datum may be useful someday. That\u0027s the fundamental axiom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every once in a while one of the Service may correlate across a gap no machine could possibly manage. The machine would fail because no one machine is likely to possess those two pieces of thoroughly unconnected information, or else, if the machine does have them, no man would be insane enough to ask the right question. One good correlation out of the Service can pay for all the money appropriated for it in ten years or more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain raised his broad hand. He looked troubled. He said, \"Wait a minute. Annuncio said no ship named Triple G. was under Earth registry. You mean he knows all registered ships by heart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" said Sheffield. \"He may have read through the Merchant-Ship Register. If he did, he knows all the names, tonnages, years of construction, ports of call, numbers of crews, and anything else the register would contain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he was counting stars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? It\u0027s a datum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m damned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps, Captain. But the point is that a man like Mark is different from other men. He\u0027s got a queer, distorted upbringing and a queer, distorted view of life. This is the first time he\u0027s been\" away from Service grounds since he entered them at the age of five. He\u0027s easily upset-and he can be ruined. That mustn\u0027t happen, and I\u0027m in charge to see it doesn\u0027t. He\u0027s my instrument; a more valuable instrument than everything else on this entire ship baled into a neat little ball of plutonium wire. There are only a hundred like him in all the Milky Way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Follenbee assumed an air of wounded dignity. \"All right, then. Logbook. Strictly confidential, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strictly. He talks only to me, and I talk to no one unless a correlation has been made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain did not look as though that fell under his classification of the word \"strictly\" but he said, \"But no crew.\" He paused significantly. \"You know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield stepped to the door. \"Mark knows about that. The crew won\u0027t hear about it from him, believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as he was about to leave, the Captain called out, \"Sheffield!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in space is a noncompos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheffield suppressed a smile. \"Did he call you that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just short for non compos mentis. Everyone in the Service uses it for everyone not in the Service. You\u0027re one. I\u0027m one. It\u0027s Latin for \"not of sound mind.\" And you know, Captain- I think they\u0027re quite right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped out the door quickly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-38.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
