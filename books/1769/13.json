Where\u0027s Nolan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My apartment,\" she gritted out. \"Where\u0027s Aleaha?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A motel. Where\u0027s your apartment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not telling. What motel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not telling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at each other for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that was informative.\" He sighed, making sure the warmth of his breath trickled down the valley of her breasts. Whether she allowed much more intimacy this night, she would not leave this room unscathed. His scent would be imprinted on her every cell, and she would think of him every time she breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoose bumps broke out over her skin. \"Let\u0027s back away from the topic of Nolan and Aleaha for a moment. As planned. Tell me about the vampires you\u0027ve met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her demand, the way to have her, at least somewhat, presented itself. He almost purred with satisfaction. \"And what will you give me in return, hmm? You\u0027ve already proven you won\u0027t give me the answers I seek.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed him warily. \"What do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A kiss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So suspicious.\" He tsked under his tongue. \"I meant my cock, of course.\" A choking sound bubbled from her. \"No way. Hell, no. Never. I\u0027ll die first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Darling, that\u0027s just silly. You can\u0027t possibly know that for sure until you try it. But I can honestly tell you no woman has ever died from giving me a blow job. They\u0027ve come close to dying of pleasure, yes, but in the end they did survive, I assure you.\" He sighed. \"If you\u0027d rather, you can kiss me on the mouth. Though I can\u0027t guarantee you won\u0027t nearly die of pleasure from that, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are the most egotistical man I\u0027ve ever met.\" Even as she spoke, her gaze dropped to his lips, lingering ... savoring? \"It\u0027s beyond frustrating. I don\u0027t know how to deal with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I pretend I\u0027m ugly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You should ... oh, I don\u0027t know.\" Her head fell back, her back arching as she peered up at the ceiling, as if imploring the heavens for support. Her core brushed his penis yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet fire. \"I\u0027d think my honesty easier to deal with than another\u0027s lies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blew out a breath. It trickled over his skin the way his had done to hers, branding him with her scent, orchids and midnight tempests. \"Maybe you\u0027re compensating for something.\" Before he could toss her on the floor and yell at her for even considering such a foolish thing, she added, \"Fine, I\u0027ll give you a kiss on the mouth for every question you answer, but you don\u0027t get to touch me while I\u0027m doing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly he relaxed. \"Very well, I won\u0027t touch you unless you beg.\" Something he was (almost) confident he could make her do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like that\u0027ll happen.\" At least her confidence didn\u0027t seem to match the level of his. \"Just so you know, you only get to collect when I\u0027m satisfied with your answers. And you can\u0027t lie,\" she added in a rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be keeping score inside my head, and I\u0027m very good at math. Example: Devyn plus Bride minus clothes plus a hard, flat surface multiplied by roaming hands equals greatest pleasure ever. When shall we begin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer jaw had dropped during his equation, but she quickly collected herself. \"Let\u0027s start now.\" Those inky locks cascaded down her arms, brushing his stomach as she faced him dead on. \"Where did you meet the vampires?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe plucked a few strands and drew them to his mouth, running the tips along the seam. \"A slave auction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A slave auction?\" Her eyes widened with equal measures of incredulity and disdain, and she jerked the hair from his clasp. \"That\u0027s barbaric!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, at a slave auction. That\u0027s two questions I\u0027ve answered, which means you owe me two kisses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only asked—damn it! I did ask two.\" She pressed her lips together in a mulish line. \"I\u0027ll be more careful with my phrasing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m assuming, despot that you are, that you bought them. And that\u0027s not a question! If you raped them—\" He rolled his eyes. \"As if I need to resort to rape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat deflated her anger. \"Then why buy women? Never mind. Don\u0027t answer that. I don\u0027t want to pay the toll for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToll. As if kissing him was a punishment. Silly girl. She would soon learn. He\u0027d become skilled at many things since he\u0027d given over to the dark side and embraced his decadent nature. \"What\u0027s your full name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth to tell him, then shut it with a snap. \"If I answer that, you have to deduct one of the kisses I owe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But darling, how else am I to tell you everything I know about your people if I don\u0027t know everything about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had started to nod her head in agreement when she caught herself. He\u0027d almost had her. \"Nice try. I\u0027ll answer and you\u0027ll deduct, or I just won\u0027t tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever had he enjoyed a sparring/bargaining match more. \"Fair enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Bride ... McKells.\" She held up her wrist, and he studied the black tattoo. No fancy font, just her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McKells. Warrior class,\" he said, thinking back to the guards who\u0027d escorted him through the underground world of the vampires. First, they\u0027d thought to punish the two vampire females for leading him to the doorway to their world, killing them alongside Devyn. Then, they\u0027d decided to place the decision in their king\u0027s hands. So they\u0027d surrounded Devyn and forced him deeper and deeper into the city, not knowing he could have destroyed them all in seconds. And he would have. Dark, confined spaces didn\u0027t agree with him. Except, he\u0027d never had sex in a cave and had decided to remain for several nights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the king had thanked him for escorting the females back into their fold, for they were of royal blood. The king—Manus, yes, that was his name—had been fierce, jaded, yet fair. While the McKell, the leader of the vampire army and the crudest among them, the most bloodthirsty, had petitioned for Devyn\u0027s execution, citing that they couldn\u0027t have anyone running around on the surface knowing where the vampires were hidden, the king had once again surprised his people and invited Devyn to stay for as long as he desired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn suspected the vampire king was a mind reader. That, or a psychic like Dallas, and had sensed Devyn would do them no harm and could even be relied on as an ally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told Bride none of that, however. She hadn\u0027t asked, and the information would cost her. \"Any more questions for me, pet?\" He hooked a finger under the strap of her bra and glided back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she was trembling, she latched on to his wrist, stopping him. \"Where do the vampires live? Will you take me to them? Can they do the things I can do? How do they drink blood and keep it down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. She had a lot. He tackled them one by one. \"Underground. No. No. I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s three more kisses, plus the one you already owed me. Notice I didn\u0027t charge for the answer I didn\u0027t know. Now. You can\u0027t keep blood down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muscle ticked in her jaw. \"Not a full meal, no. Subtract one of those kisses, please, and then tell me how they live underground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile he\u0027d visited the vampires, he\u0027d come across only one who\u0027d had trouble digesting the blood she\u0027d consumed. He\u0027d been told the poor female\u0027s husband had died, and therefore, she would die. Or maybe she had refused a ... repression of something? He hadn\u0027t been paying the best of attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you married?\" The moment he spoke, he experienced a killing rage. Bride ... married ... out of his reach ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said after a disgusted snort. \"Have you ever been married?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rage vanished as quickly as it had appeared, leaving him shocked and confused. How... odd. He\u0027d never reacted that way before. Clearly the disappointment of potentially losing this challenge was once again the culprit for his riotous behavior. \"I thought you drank a lot before coming to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. But I also threw up most of it. I\u0027m living off a few sips a day. End of subject.\" Actually, it wasn\u0027t. \"Do you want my help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not. Not with the drinking. So tell me about the underground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInfuriating woman. \"The underground ...\" Devyn shook off her hold and ran his hands up her sides, stopping beside the swell of her breasts. She didn\u0027t protest, didn\u0027t pull away. \"It\u0027s a city, much like ours. Dark and murky, water dripping down the rocky walls of their caves. They are self-sufficient, with roads and shops and bars. They only enter our world twice a year, where they capture humans and use them as food for the rest of the year before killing them and getting more. Only a select few are sent here during the hunts, so I\u0027m not sure how you ended up here, raised ... alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Except for Aleaha.\" There was so much hurt in the words, he was momentarily speechless. \"And FYI, you just lost another kiss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t worried. He\u0027d get it back. He just ... He didn\u0027t like that hurt. He much preferred her angry, excited, and triumphant. Clearly she felt abandoned by her people. By Aleaha. \"I wonder how you reached the surface. And no, that wasn\u0027t a question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember,\" she answered anyway. Her fingertip traced a circle over his breastbone, just beside his heart. He doubted she realized what she was doing. \"I don\u0027t remember my mother or my father or if I even had a mother or father. I don\u0027t remember anything about my life before waking up on the streets of New Chicago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you were young. Again, not a question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. And thirsty. So damn thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo why couldn\u0027t she digest the blood anymore? Better question, would she be able to tolerate his blood?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward and brushed a gentle kiss between her breasts. He\u0027d meant to offer comfort, to tempt her, as well as finally planting the tiny tracking bug he had waiting on his tongue. Mostly, he aroused himself. Needing to taste her, desperate for it, he flicked out his now-bare tongue, running it over the edge of her bra and then, when she failed to protest, her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sucked in a breath, tangled her hands in her hair, and held him in place. \"Wh—what are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enjoying you. And now you owe me three kisses.\" See. Got it back. \"Damn it. Diabolical man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn endearment, surely. As he arched toward her, he gripped her ass and pumped her forward, grinding their bodies together. She moaned; he hissed and turned his head, lips locking on one of her nipples. The syn-cotton or whatever material it was that shielded her didn\u0027t deter him. He sucked and laved it like the treasure it was, the little pearl teasing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want to ask me about Nolan?\" she rasped. To distract him? Because she didn\u0027t have the strength to pull away herself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Four kisses now, and you will pay up.\" He spread his fingers over her ass, two closing in on a place she probably didn\u0027t want him, but one day would if he had his way, the others inching toward her clitoris. If she bowed her back, he could thrum her to release. She\u0027d beg and plead, drip in his hand. And oh, wasn\u0027t that a delightful image?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your kisses now, then. Do it!\" She yanked at his hair, tugging several strands from his scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly he lifted his head, meeting her heated gaze. Passion had wrought a rosy glow to her cheeks. Her eyes glittered brightly, dangerously; they were seductive. Tempting him. Her lips were damp and swollen from where she\u0027d chewed them. Breath sawed in and out of her mouth, choppy and shallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want your kisses, pet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want? No. But I never welsh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, she still thought to deny him, did she? His eyelids slitted. If he kissed her now, with her core so close to his cock, he would take her all the way—they both knew it—and if he had her delicious little body now, she would tell herself he\u0027d forced her. She would convince herself it had been for answers, not desire. Afterward, she would avoid him, build a resistance to him. Think of him only in her nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would tolerate none of that. Whenever Bride thought of him, he wanted it to be because of sex, passion, and pleasure. Not shame and regret. Never shame. Never regret. He wanted her to remember this time, his words, his touch with a smile on her beautiful face. He didn\u0027t want her remembering her duty and frowning. More than that, he wanted her to run to him if he so desired in the future, not away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll collect my kisses, don\u0027t worry, but I won\u0027t do it here and I won\u0027t do it now. I\u0027ll let you know when and where. Promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose sharp nails of hers dug into the base of his neck. \"This is the last time I\u0027ll allow myself to be caught alone with you. Take them here or forfeit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he\u0027d suspected, she thought to avoid him. Well, too bad. She\u0027d see him again, and she\u0027d kiss him again and then do a whole lot more. Devyn reclaimed his hold on her mind and forced her to straighten and stand, to walk backward, away from him. He didn\u0027t have the strength to walk away from her himself. Not this time. Already his body mourned the loss of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMourned? Surely not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go, damn it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen closely, pet. I forfeit nothing. You\u0027ll kiss me when I tell you, or you\u0027ll be in breach and I\u0027ll be entitled to simply take what I want. And now that that\u0027s settled... tomorrow night at midnight, you\u0027re going to bring Nolan to the pier. I\u0027ll bring Aleaha, and we\u0027ll trade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately she shook her head, but there was hope in her eyes. \"I don\u0027t trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmart woman. No way in hell would he be at the pier tomorrow. \"Do you want to see Aleaha or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her tongue, probably drawing blood. To keep from biting him? \"You know I do. And if you\u0027ve hurt her, I swear to God I\u0027ll cut off your balls and feed them to you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-the-darkness-alien-huntress-4/page-13.html","bookId":1769,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM"}
