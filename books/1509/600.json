Lan Qing turned back to the camera. “I heard about the business with the parliament. Your suggestion was good, but it isn’t feasible. At least not right now. The Parliament has their own plans as well. Don’t be contrary.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Jue chuckled. “I’m not a child, why would I be contrary? I’m a single person, and the best I can do is try to protect those who are important to me. Relax, I’m not upset. What about you? How have you been lately? Have you had any time to cultivate with all this going on? Don’t let me overtake you.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Qing actually managed a stiff smile. “If you didn’t get in touch with me I would have called you. You should make a trip to An Lun.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Jue’s heart felt tighter in his chest. “What is it? What’s going on?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s nothing,” Lan Qing confessed. “Nothing bad. You’ll understand when you come.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Jue relaxed. His worst fear was the alien planets appearing suddenly near An Lun. That would be a nightmare scenario. The forces stationed there were strong, but were they strong enough to defend against a universe-traversing alien planet that could eat other planets? It was hard to say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Wait a minute, I’ll get father,” Lan Qing said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter a few moments, Jue Di appeared. He had a cigar clipped between two fingers. “It should be night on Skyfire about now. What do you need so late?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe first thing Lan Jue noticed was that his father didn’t look quite himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Dad, are you alright?” Lan Jue asked, concern evident in his voice.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe old Paragon grunted. “Of course I’m alright, what could possibly be bothering me? I’m just surprised you remembered you have a father! You have a mom now, I guess dad don’t count for shit.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSuddenly it became clear to Lan Jue the source of his father’s irritation. It was the fact that he’d accepted Luo Xianni as his mother. Lan Jue choked down a fit of laughter. “Dad, in theory there could be no child without father, nor could there be a mother. So, if I have a father I must thereby have a mother! Look, she’s a good woman. Without her you might not have ever seen me again. At your age what are you trying to hide? You need company in old age!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJue Di narrowed his eyes. “Watch your mouth. I don’t need to be told how to handle by business by some uppity asshole. Now just tell me what the hell you want or leave me the hell alone.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Jue could see his father fuming, barely choking back the urge to wring the life out of him. He smirked. “That’s the dad I remember.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJue Di’s face froze, then suddenly the fury melted away like snow before the sun. His voice came thick with shame. “Was I terrible when you were children?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Jue shook his head. “Not terrible. You used to say, ‘spare the rod spoil the child. Success through hardships.’”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJue Di perked up proudly. “And I was right! Now what is it.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Jue obliged. “Do you remember when I told you I found an adept with a taiyin thunderbolt Discipline…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Jue went on to describe the conundrum, explaining their wish to join their opposed Disciplines with Qianlin involved.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe corner of Jue Di’s eyes crinkled as he thought. “In theory, it shouldn’t be a major issue. Just make sure that you extract and employ the purest form of your thunderbolt Discipline when joining with his. The joining of yin and yang is the way of heaven and earth. \u003ca id\u003d\"footnoteref-1\" href\u003d\"#footnote-1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e It is the beginning of the universe and all the myriad beasts within it. The natural way. Within it you will discover things of great benefit to your protogenia. The advantages would apply to all of you. This should apply especially to you and the girl. The Clairvoyant was clever – the jerk. People thought Queen of Heaven Discipline was extinct, but he found it one in a million. She can’t really use it to attack, but it’s the universal support. Her abilities are compatible with anyone’s. Because of this restriction, Adepts like her have to learn other ways to be useful in a fight. For instance, by learning martial arts like I taught you. It doesn’t matter how much energy is used, she should be fine. In addition, when you’re joined her power enters and empowers yours. When you join your thunderbolt with his, on an energy level her Discipline will be involved too. You don’t need to worry about her, but you do need to worry about getting it right.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“According to what you’ve told me, it sounds like your Discipline is stronger than the other guy’s. You’ll have to guide the cultivation process, use your knowledge of Taiji to manipulate the flow and bring them together. You mustn’t be impatient. Gradually guide the powers, adapt to them, and then apply what I’ve taught you to control the flow of yin and yang within you. From there, it’s all up to your level of control.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLan Jue was hesitant. “But father, for this to work I may need to teach the Driver the ways of Taiji. Otherwise, I’m afraid he won’t be able to work with me.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJue Di frowned. “Fine, teach him. I have no pedigree to protect. But teach him only the methods necessary for moving power.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen he heard this, Lan Jue was very pleasantly surprised. Truth be told, he wasn’t wholly convinced Jue Di would let him teach the secrets of Taiji to the Driver. It was treasured family knowledge! Even in the old days, there was typically only a few families who knew the mysteries of Taiji. \u003ca id\u003d\"footnoteref-2\" href\u003d\"#footnote-2\"\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Alright, so it I,” Jue Di decided. “Oh, A-Jue’s told you I’m sure. Hurry to An Luo, and bring your little girlfriend. Ah, and that guy the Driver.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Alright, thank you father.” Jue Di hadn’t be straightforward, but of course Lan Jue understood his instruction. With his father’s help, the product of their experience was sure to produce great results.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe conversation concluded and the holographic projector was turned off. Lan Jue turned to Qianlin, and pressed his lips to hers. The beautiful young woman became white light and permeated into his chest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn his mind’s eye, Lan Jue saw the aliens as a lofty mountain.

I can’t tell you how happy I am A-Cheng has locked himself away for so long. Why would you go in and disturb him? He has immersed himself in the ghostly realm, the domain of our ancestors. It is a sign of his great chances to become a Paragon. No one can disturb him. He must be allowed to cultivate on his own. When he has achieved what he set out to gain, he will come out on his own. Who knows, it may be possible that he emerges as the new Hades.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That must be unlikely,” Chu Dong said incredulously. “Before locking himself away he was seventh rank.

A moment’s insight can bring more growth than ten years of laborious cultivation. It’s clear that the pendant he was given by His Majesty the Clairvoyant is of great benefit to him. So far it’s been a few months.
