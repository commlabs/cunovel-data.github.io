It was actually kind of cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, once a nerd always a nerd, he thought as he went through a series of lats and flys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce he\u0027d worked up a sweat and an appetite, he checked in with the hospital, downed some cereal. Showered, shaved, dressed, he stepped into his office, up to his workstation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, held up his hands and said, \"Draco braz minto.\" The childhood ritual put everything outside the work, and Ford into it. He sat, picked up his tools and began to draw the first panel for Brid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCILLA HAD her chair angled toward the bed so she could look directly into Steve\u0027s face as she spoke. And she spoke, keeping up a constant one-sided conversation, as if any appreciable stretch of silence could be deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s moving. Clicking along better than I anticipated, even with the changes and additions I made to the original plans. The attic space shows real promise. Later on, I\u0027m going to go pick out the flooring for up there, and the fixtures and tiles for that bath, and the master. We\u0027ll be able to have a beer out on the patio, soon as you\u0027re ready. What I need is pots. A couple of big-ass pots. Monsters. Oh, and I\u0027m going to plant tomatoes. I think it\u0027s about the right time to do that. And, like, peppers, maybe carrots and beans. I should wait until next year when the house is done, but I think I could scratch out a square for a little garden now. Then-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss McGowan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla took a breath. When it hurt her chest to draw it in, it told her she\u0027d been pushing too hard. \"Yes.\" What was the nurse\u0027s name, the nurse with the curly blond hair and warm brown eyes? \"Dee. It\u0027s Cilla.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cilla. The police are out there. A couple of detectives. They asked to speak to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Sure. Just a sec. I\u0027ve got to do this thing,\" she told Steve. \"I\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpotting the cops was the easiest thing she\u0027d done all day, Cilla thought. She stepped up to them. \"I\u0027m Cilla McGowan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective Wilson. My partner, Detective Urick. Is there somewhere we could talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a little waiting room down here. They\u0027ve got something they call coffee. You\u0027re looking into what happened to Steve now,\" she said as she led the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know he didn\u0027t trip over his own feet, bash himself in the head and fall under his own bike.\" She hit the coffeepot, added powdered creamer. \"Do you know what did happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re looking into it,\" Urick said. \"Do you know anyone who\u0027d wish Mr. Chensky harm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He\u0027s only been here a few days. Steve makes friends, not enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No hard feelings?\" Wilson prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None. We were friends before we got married. We\u0027ve stayed friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s living with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s visiting me, and giving me a hand for a couple of weeks on the house. I\u0027m rehabbing the house. He\u0027s in the business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rock the House,\" Urick commented. \"I\u0027ve caught the show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best there is. You want to know if we\u0027re sleeping together. No. We have, but we\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilson pursed his lips, nodded. \"Your neighbor, Mr. Sawyer, states that he saw a prowler on your property a few nights ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, the night Steve got in. Steve heard something outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I sleep like a rock. But Steve woke me up, said he heard something. I brushed it off.\" The guilt wormed its way back. \"Then Ford mentioned the flashlight he\u0027d seen. I was supposed to get a padlock for the barn, and I let it slip by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We noticed you seem to be using the barn to store things. Boxes, furniture...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Junk,\" Cilla finished, and nodded at Urick. \"I brought it down from the attic. I\u0027m having the attic finished off and needed to clear it out. I\u0027ve been sorting, but it\u0027s a big job. I thought I\u0027d separated what struck me as potentially valuable, but it\u0027s hard to tell on a couple of passes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t notice anything missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at this point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of the boxes were crushed, the furniture knocked over.\" Wilson gestured. \"It looked, possibly, as if Mr. Chensky drove his bike into the barn, lost control, went down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what happened. You know he wasn\u0027t drunk or stoned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His alcohol level was well under the legal limit,\" Urick agreed. \"There were no drugs in his system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside her chest, her heart began a tripping beat. \"A sober man, and one who\u0027s straddled a Harley for about a dozen years, doesn\u0027t get off the bike, open the door, get back on the bike and yee-haw drive in over a bunch of boxes and furniture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The X-rays indicate Mr. Chensky was struck at the base of the skull. Probably a crowbar or tire iron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla pressed her hand to her heart as it tightened to a fist. \"Oh, God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The force of the blow pitched him forward, dropped him so that he hit the concrete floor, which caused the second fracture. Our reconstruction indicates the Harley was rolled to where Mr. Chensky lay, then pushed over on top of him, breaking two of his ribs and bruising his kidney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrick waited, watched as Cilla set her coffee down, as her hand trembled. Her color went from pale to ghostly. \"Now, let me ask you again. Do you know anyone who\u0027d wish Mr. Chensky harm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No, I don\u0027t know anyone who\u0027d want to hurt him. Who\u0027d do something like that to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did Sawyer get along with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ford?\" For a moment she went blank. \"Fine. They hit it off. Big-time. Steve\u0027s a fan. He\u0027s even got... Oh, for God\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding, Cilla pressed her fingers to her eyes, then dragged them back through her hair. \"Okay, follow the dots, please. I am not and was not sleeping with Steve. I am not and was not sleeping with Ford, though that is on the table. Ford did not attack Steve in a jealous rage as I don\u0027t think he has a lot of rage in the first place and, more importantly, he knew there was nothing to be jealous about. I was up front with him regarding my relationship with Steve, and in fact was out with Ford the night Steve got hurt. The night both myself and Ford knew Steve had gone out to sniff around Shanna Stiles. There\u0027s no romantic or sexual triangle here. This isn\u0027t about sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss McGowan, it looks as though someone was in your barn, and may have been lying in wait. You and Sawyer knew Mr. Chensky had gone out for the evening, and that he stored his motorcycle in the barn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, that\u0027s absolutely right, Detective Wilson. Just like we both knew he\u0027d gone out to try to score with a very attractive brunette. Neither of us could know if he\u0027d get lucky or bomb out. So you\u0027re suggesting that after spending the evening with me, Ford snuck back, hid out in my barn, just in case Steve came back. It doesn\u0027t make any sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock, anger, guilt, annoyance all drained into sheer misery. \"None of this makes any sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d like you to go through the items you have stored in the barn, see if anything\u0027s been disturbed or taken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your grandmother left a deep mark,\" Wilson continued. \"I\u0027d guess most people figured anything of hers in that house was taken away a long time ago. Word gets out, as word will, there\u0027s still some things around, someone might be interested enough to break into a barn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And fracture a man\u0027s skull. Yeah. The thing is? Most of what\u0027s in the barn is from the McGowans. The ordinary side of the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went back to Steve, but this time sat in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she left, walked to the elevator, she saw her father get off the car. \"Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cilla.\" He strode quickly toward her, took her shoulders. \"How is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same, I guess. He\u0027s critical. He came through the surgery, and that\u0027s a plus, but...A lot of buts and ifs and maybes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry.\" He pulled her tight for a moment. \"I know I only met him a couple of times, but I liked him. What can I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me take you downstairs, get some food in you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, actually, I\u0027m just leaving for a while. I have some errands.\" To get out, to do, to stop thinking for just a couple of hours. \"Maybe... Do you think you could go in and sit with him for a little bit? Talk to him? He liked you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when you leave? Remind him that I\u0027ll be back later. I\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, she pressed for the elevator, hitched her bag on her shoulder. \"I appreciate... I really appreciate you coming. You barely know him. Hell, you barely know me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cilla-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you came.\" She stepped into the elevator, turned, met her father\u0027seyes. \"You came. It means a lot,\" she said as the doors closed between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWORK. WORK GOT HER THROUGH the day.And the next day. She was better at work, she thought, than at sentiment, at expressing emotions- unless they were scripted. She made her schedule, and stuck to it. So many hours on the house, on the landscaping, so many at the hospital, so many in the barn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat left her so many hours to fall on her air mattress and clock out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, she thought, so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept Steve\u0027s mother had jumped down off her broomstick and thrown the schedule into the Dumpster. So, more time for work, Cilla told herself. More time to get things done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up a pole lamp, scowled at the six funnel-shaped shades running down the spotted brass rod. \"What were they smoking when they bought this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn impulse, she took a few running steps and launched it at the open barn doors like a javelin. Then yipped when Ford stepped into view. He jumped back so the lamp whizzed by his face with a few layers of dust to spare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t you yell \u0027fore,\u0027 or something?\" he demanded. \"How the hell would I have explained that one? Yes, Doctor, I\u0027ve been impaled through the brain by perhaps the ugliest pole lamp in the history of pole lamps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it would\u0027ve impaled. More dented. Anyway, it offended my eye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, mine too. Almost literally. What are you doing back here? It\u0027s early for you,\" he added when she frowned at him. \"I saw your car. I thought maybe...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Nothing new. Except Steve\u0027s mother\u0027s there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I ran into her this morning for a minute.\" He dipped his hands into his pockets, hunched a little. \"She\u0027s scary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She hates me. For marrying Steve, for divorcing him. She doesn\u0027t actually like Steve all that much, but me? She hates. So I cleared the field. Deserted, actually. I don\u0027t do well with mothers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do okay with your stepmom. She sent over that nice casserole last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tuna noodle. I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s a sign of affection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is, take my word.\" He stepped through and around some of the mess to get to her, to touch her cheek. \"You\u0027re working too hard, beautiful blond girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\" She pulled away, kicked at one of the boxes. \"The cops want me to go through this stuff, to see if anything\u0027s missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I think I\u0027ve been bumped down the suspect list, which is oddly disappointing. Tall White Guy asked me to sign a copy of The Seeker: Indestructible for his grandson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tall... oh, Urick. I told them it wasn\u0027t about you or Steve or me. But what the hell is here? What\u0027s here somebody would want so damn bad? It\u0027s junk. It\u0027s trash. It should be tossed, all of it. I\u0027m tossing it,\" she decided in an instant. \"Help me toss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her, pulled her back up as she started to drag up a box. \"No. You don\u0027t toss when you\u0027re churned up. And you know that what someone might have wanted isn\u0027t here. Because you already found it and put it somewhere else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The letters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. Did you tell the cops about the letters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, exactly. Partly because all I could really think about at first was Steve. And what would they do with the letters? Thirty-five-year-old letters, unsigned, no return address.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fingerprints, DNA. Don\u0027t you watch CSI?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fact, fantasy. And it\u0027ll leak. It always leaks, that is a fact. Letters from a lover, days before her death. Was it suicide? Was it murder? Was she carrying a love child? All the speculation, the print, the airtime, the reporters, the obsessed fans, it all pumps up. Any chance I had here, at peace, at a life, pretty much goes up in flames.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to live like that, in the crosshairs of the camera lens. I want this to be my home.\" She heard the edge of desperation in her own voice but couldn\u0027t dull it. \"I wanted to bring something back from her, and for her. But I wanted it to be mine at the end of the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to know who wrote those letters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. I do. But I don\u0027t want to ruin his life, Ford, or his children\u0027s lives because he had an affair, because he broke off the affair. Even if he was cruel about it. There has to be a statute of limitations. Thirty years should cover it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing more, just watched her, looked into her eyes until she closed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could anyone prove it?\" she demanded. \"If, if, if she didn\u0027t kill herself. If, if, if some of the conspiracy theories have been close to true and someone-this someone-made her take the pills, or slipped them to her. How could we prove it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but the first step would be asking the right people the right questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know the people or the questions, and I can\u0027t think about this. Not now. I need to get through today, then get through tomorrow. I need-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw herself against him, locking her arms around his neck while her mouth latched on to his. He wasn\u0027t prepared for the eruption, the bursts of desperation and appetite. Who could have been? With quick, catchy gasps, low, sexy moans, she devoured. She hooked one of those long, long legs around him, sank her teeth into his bottom lip, tugged. And he went instantly, helplessly, hard as stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her body against his until he could literally feel the blood draining out of his head and heading south. \"Lock the door.\" Her lips moved to his ear, parted on a breathless whisper. \"Lock the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quivered, felt the shock of need ram into him-head, belly, loins- like fists. \"Wait.\" Even as he said it his mouth collided with hers again for one more greedy gulp. But he managed to order himself to pull back, to get his hands on her shoulders to peel her away, a couple of inches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" he repeated, and momentarily forgot his train of thought as those brilliant blue eyes burned into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cilla. Whoa. Jeez. I can pretty much feel myself growing breasts as I say this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took his hands, pulled them down, pressed. \"Those are mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Soft, firm. \"They are.\"And with considerable regret, and what he considered heroic restraint, he put his hands back on her shoulders. \"Where was I? I meant to say, even at the risk of sounding like a girl, this isn\u0027t right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid her hand over his crotch. \"Then what\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The penis has a mind of its own. And boy, oh boy,\" he managed as he took her wandering hand and yanked it up. \"I should get an award for this. A monument. Let\u0027s just step back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Step back?\" Shock and insult leaped out with the words. \"Why? What the hell is wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The penis is asking those exact questions. But the thing is... wait,\" he ordered, taking a firm hold of her arms when she started to jerk away. \"The thing is, Cilla, you don\u0027t toss stuff out when you\u0027re churned up. Just like when you\u0027re churned up, you don\u0027t... lock the barn door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Maybe. But when it happens? It\u0027s going to be just you and me. Just you.\" He tested his willpower by leaning down and taking her mouth in a slow, soft kiss. \"Just me. No Steve or Steve\u0027s mom, no Janet Hardy, no letters. Just us, Cilla. I want lots of alone with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a sigh, gave one of the boxes a halfhearted kick. \"How am I supposed to feel pissed off and rejected after that?\" Hooking her thumbs in her pockets, she lowered her gaze deliberately to his crotch. \"Looks like that\u0027s still doing a lot of thinking. What are you going to do about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just need to get a picture of Maylene Gunner in my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maylene Gunner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maylene was mean as a snake, big as a battleship and ugly as homemade sin. She beat the living snot out of me when I was eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she couldn\u0027t possibly stay pissed off. \"Why would Maylene do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I had drawn a very unflattering portrait of her. I didn\u0027t possess the talent to draw a flattering one. Da Vinci didn\u0027t possess that much talent. I drew her as a kind of Goodyear Blimp, soaring and farting. Very colorful. Little people on the ground clutching themselves or lying sprawled and unconscious, running for cover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cruel,\" Cilla said as her lips twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was eight. In any case, she got wind-so to speak-and ambushed me and proceeded to pound me to dust. So when I need to, I just picture that Jupiter-sized face, and...\" He glanced down, smiled. \"There we go. Retired from the field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla studied him a moment. \"You\u0027re a very strange man, Ford. Yet oddly appealing. Like your dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get me started again. Even Maylene Gunner has only so much power. Why don\u0027t I give you a hand here, then we\u0027ll go see Steve together. Between the two of us, we can take his mama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she thought, a very strange and appealing man. \"Okay. You can start by taking what\u0027s left of that pole lamp out there to the Dumpster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHE GOT THROUGH THE DAY, got through the night. And Cilla geared herself up for her second visit of the day, and second confrontation with Steve\u0027s mother. Pacing in front of the hospital entrance, she gave herself a pep talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t about her, wasn\u0027t about old business, grudges, one-upmanship.It wasn\u0027t about tossing a bucket of water on the Wicked Witch of the West.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about Steve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bounced her shoulders to loosen them like a boxer before a bout, and stepped toward the doors as someone called her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief at the temporary interruption might have been cowardly, but she\u0027d take what she could get. Turning, she smiled at Cathy and Tom Morrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCathy reached out to rub a hand along Cilla\u0027s arm. \"How\u0027s your friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same. Pretty much the same. I want to thank you again for your help when Steve was in surgery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a lot to me. Are you volunteering today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, we\u0027re here to see our goddaughter. She had a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nice. Well...\" Cilla looked back toward the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to go up with you first?\" Cathy offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, I\u0027m fine. It\u0027s just... Steve\u0027s mother\u0027s probably up there. She harbors extreme dislike for me. It makes it pretty tight in that room with both of us in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can fix that.\" Cathy held up a finger. \"Why don\u0027t I go up, lure her away for fifteen or twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Volunteer mode. I\u0027ll buy her a cup of coffee, lend a shoulder. It\u0027ll give her a break and give you a few minutes alone with your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can do it,\" Tom said with a shake of his head. \"Nobody resists Cathy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be so grateful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing to it. Tom, keep Cilla company for a few minutes. Five should do it.\" With a cheery wave, Cathy strode into the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best there is,\" Tom agreed. \"Let\u0027s sit down over here, give her that head start. I was sorry to hear about your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Three days, she thought. Three days in a coma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do the police have any idea how it happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. I guess we\u0027re all hoping Steve can tell us if... when,\" she corrected, \"he wakes up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught a glimpse of a white van crossing the parking lot and, with a shudder, looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope that\u0027s soon.\" Tom gave her hand an encouraging pat. \"How\u0027s Brian doing on your place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s shaping up. He does good work. You must be proud of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every day. It\u0027s an ambitious project you\u0027ve taken on. The grounds, the house. A lot of time, money and sweat. Word gets around,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be worth it. You should drop by sometime, look at the progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping you\u0027d ask.\" He winked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anytime, Mr. Morrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anytime,\" Cilla repeated, and pushed to her feet. \"I\u0027m going to sneak up, see if Cathy had any success.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can take it to the bank. I\u0027ll say a prayer for your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this, Cilla thought as she crossed the lobby to the elevators, was the reason to make this home. People like the Morrows, and like Dee and Vicki and Mike, the ICU nurses she saw every day. People who cared, who took time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople like Ford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, even people like cranky, dyspeptic Buddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped off the elevator and spotted Mike at the nurses\u0027 station. \"How\u0027s he doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holding steady. Kidney functions are normal. That\u0027s an improvement. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it is. Is anyone with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike wiggled his eyebrows. \"Mrs. Morrow breezed in and took Mrs. Chensky down for coffee. You got a clear road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hallelujah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruises still covered his face, but they were turning yellow at the edges. Thick stubble masked his jawline and pricked her when she leaned over to kiss him. \"I\u0027m back. It\u0027s hot out this afternoon. Strip-it-off weather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tuned out the machines, started to turn to the window to describe the view for him before she relayed construction progress. And she saw the sketch taped to the glass wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have we got here? Con the Immortal?\" She glanced back at Steve. \"Did you see this? Striking resemblance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFord had drawn it. Cilla didn\u0027t need to see the signature looped in the bottom corner to know it. Steve stood, wearing what she supposed was a loincloth, with thick black straps crossing over his chest, and knee boots. His hair flew out as if in a strong wind, and his face was set in a fierce, fuck-you grin. His hands rested on the hilt of a sword, with its point planted between his spread feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big sword, obvious symbolism. You\u0027d love that. And the biceps bulging over the armbands, the tats, the necklace of fangs. Con the Immortal. He\u0027s got you pegged, doesn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears rose hot in her throat, were ruthlessly swallowed down. \"You\u0027ve really got to see this, okay?\" She crossed back to take Steve\u0027s hand. \"You\u0027ve got to wake up and see this. It\u0027s been long enough now, Steve, I mean it. Goddamn it. This bullshit\u0027s gone on long enough, so stop screwing around and... oh God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad his hand moved? Had it moved in hers or had she imagined it? She let her breath out slowly, stared down at the fingers she held in hers. \"Don\u0027t make me yell at you again. You know if I cut loose I can out-bitch your mother. Who\u0027s going to come back here pretty soon, so...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fingers twitched, curled. The lightest of pressure on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay, stay there, don\u0027t go anywhere.\" She reached for the call button, held her finger down on it. \"Steve, come on, Steve, do it again.\" She lifted his hand, pressed her lips to it. Then, narrowing her eyes, bit. And laughed when his fingers twitched and curled again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He squeezed my hand,\" she called out as Mike came in. \"He squeezed it twice. Is he waking up? Is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to him.\" Mike moved to the side of the bed, lifted one of Mike\u0027s eyelids. \"Let him hear your voice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Steve. It\u0027s Cill. Wake up, you lazy bastard. I\u0027ve got better things to do than stand around here and watch you sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the bed, Mike checked pulse, pupils, BP. Then pinched Steve hard on the forearm. The arm jerked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He felt that. He moved. Steve, you\u0027re killing me. Open your eyes.\" Cilla grabbed his face, put her nose nearly to his. \"Open your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fluttered, and she felt another flutter on her chin. More than his breath, she realized. A word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What? Say it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned down, her ear at his lips. She caught his slow, indrawn breath, and heard the hoarse, raw whisper of a single word. He said, \"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCilla let out a sob that choked into a laugh. \"Shit. He said shit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t blame him.\" Quickly, Mike strode to the door to signal another nurse. \"Page Dr. North. His patient\u0027s waking up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you see me?\" Cilla demanded when his eyes opened. \"Steve? Can you see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a weary sigh. \"Hi, doll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHE SPOKE to the doctor, even managed to smile genuinely at Steve\u0027s mother before she locked herself in a bathroom stall for a jag of weeping relief. After she\u0027d washed her face, slapped on makeup and sunglasses to hide the damage, she went back to the nurses\u0027 station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s sleeping,\" Mike told her. \"Natural sleep. He\u0027s weak, and he\u0027s still got a lot of healing to do. You should go home, Cilla. Get a good night\u0027s sleep yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. If he asks for me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll call you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time Cilla stepped into the elevator with an easy heart. As she crossed the lobby, she pulled out her phone and called Ford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, beautiful blond girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He woke up.\" She moved down the sidewalk toward the parking lot with a bounce in every step. \"He woke up, Ford. He talked to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027d he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Shit\u0027 came first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As it should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knew me, his name and all that. His left side\u0027s a little weaker than his right, just now. But the doctor says he\u0027s looking good. They have to do tests, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking good works. Do you want me to come by, bring you some dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m heading home now. He\u0027s sleeping. Just sleeping. I wanted to tell you. I just wanted to say that I saw your sketch, and I was teasing him about it right before... I think it might have done the trick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing stops Con the Immortal for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so- Oh God! Son of a bitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared down at the door of her truck. \"I\u0027ll be home in a few minutes. I\u0027ll come by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clicked off before Ford could respond. And read what someone had written on the driver\u0027s-side door in black marker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHORES BEGET WHORES! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-12.html","bookId":2414,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:33 AM"}
