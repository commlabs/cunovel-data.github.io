The sacrifices He accepts are broken and contrite hearts. It was the breaking down of Jacob\u0027s natural strength at Peniel that got him where God could clothe him with spiritual power. It was breaking the surface of the rock at Horeb, by the stroke of Moses\u0027 rod that let out the cool waters to thirsty people.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was when the 300 elect soldiers under Gideon broke their pitchers, a type of breaking themselves, that the hidden lights shone forth to the consternation of their adversaries. It was when the poor widow broke the seal of the little pot of oil, and poured it forth, that God multiplied it to pay her debts and supply means of support.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was when Esther risked her life and broke through the rigid etiquette of a heathen court, that she obtained favor to rescue her people from death. It was when Jesus took the five loaves and broke them, that the bread was multiplied in the very act of breaking, sufficient to feed five thousand. It was when Mary broke her beautiful alabaster box, rendering it henceforth useless, that the pent-up perfume filled the house. It was when Jesus allowed His precious body to be broken to pieces by thorns and nails and spear, that His inner life was poured out, like a crystal ocean, for thirsty sinners to drink and live.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is when a beautiful grain of corn is broken up in the earth by DEATH, that its inner heart sprouts forth and bears hundreds of other grains. And thus, on and on, through all history, and all biography, and all vegetation, and all spiritual life, God must have BROKEN THINGS.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThose who are broken in wealth, and broken in self-will, and broken in their ambitions, and broken in their beautiful ideals, and broken in worldly reputation, and broken in their affections, and broken ofttimes in health; those who are despised and seem utterly forlorn and helpless, the Holy Ghost is seizing upon, and using for God\u0027s glory. \"The lame take the prey,\" Isaiah tells us.━Selected \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e十月十五日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「心里慌乱，便都昏迷。」 （伯四十一:25）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e神所最重用的人、物，都是先被击打得粉碎的。因为神所悦纳的祭，乃是忧伤痛悔的心。雅各布属天然的大腿窝在毘努伊勒扭了，神纔能给他属超然的能力。摩西用杖击打何烈的盘石，纔有水流出来给口渴的百姓喝。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e基甸和跟随他的三百精兵打破瓶子━打破自己━他们的火把纔能使他们的仇敌惊乱。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e以斯帖在一个异邦宫中冒死违例进去见王，纔得拯救她本族脱离灭亡。主耶稣拿着五个饼、两条鱼，必须把它们擘开，然后纔能叫五千人吃饱。马利亚打破她至贵的玉瓶，纔能教屋里充满香气。主耶稣宝贵的身体，必须被荆棘、钉子、枪矛，刺得粉碎，祂里面的生命纔能像活水一般倾倒出来给口渴的罪人喝。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e一粒麦子必须落在地里面死了，纔能结出无数的粒子来。所以，我们看见：无论在历史上、传记上、植物上、属灵的生命上，神必须擘开打碎一切人、物，然后纔能重用他们。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e啊！财物受了击打、「己生命」受了击打、美丽的理想受了击打、地上的名誉受了击打、爱情受了击打、健康受了击打的信徒阿，你虽然被人轻视、被人弃绝，圣灵却正抓住你，要用你叫神得着荣耀。你愿不愿意呢？以赛亚告诉我们：「瘸腿的把掠物夺去了。」你愿不愿意甘甘心心做一个瘸腿的来夺取掠物呢？━选\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5523.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:49:58 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:49:58 AM"}
