Little glittery shapes—diamonds, squares, stars—floated through the liquid inside the plastic ring, sluggish and sterile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind me Brent Daniels said, \"You\u0027re up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed the cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turned Brent was trying his best not to notice what I\u0027d been doing. He fingered the edge of the shower curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hair had dried, and his face was cleanshaven. Except for the eyes, he didn\u0027t look like a man who\u0027d been drinking as heavily as I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miranda called,\" he told me. \"Said Milo was going to be mixing for the rest of the afternoon and did I want to pick her up early. I could, or—? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drive up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent nodded, like it was bad news he\u0027d been expecting. He gestured behind him with his chin. I followed him out into the apartment, which was just big enough for the two of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent opened a cabinet above the little refrigerator and retrieved a bag of flour tortillas and a can of refried beans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach did a slow roll. I shook my head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent shrugged and cranked up the hot pad. I stared at the picture that was taped inside the pantry door—a black and white of a woman with short brunette hair, a slightly moonish face, an almost uncontainable smile, like she was being tickled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Maria?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent tensed, looked around to see what I was talking about. When he realized I meant the picture he relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. My mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were how old?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew what I meant. \"Almost twenty.\" Then, like it was something he was obliged to add, something he\u0027d been corrected on many times, \"Miranda was only six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent threw a tortilla directly on the hot pad. He watched as it began to puff up and bubble. The tortilla was probably old and flat but after a minute on the grill it would taste almost as good as fresh. The only correct way to heat a tortilla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Willis might not be too happy with you driving to pick Miranda up,\" he speculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flipped the tortilla. One of the air bubbles had cracked open and the edges had blackened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I will take some,\" I decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent made no comment, but got another tortilla out of the bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind,\" he finally agreed. \"Dad ...\" He trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got an unpredictable temper, doesn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent was staring at the picture of his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Billy Senorita,\u0027 \" I said. \"The only song Miranda wrote herself—it was about your parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent stirred up the refried beans. \"The fights weren\u0027t as bad as that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" But scary to a sixyearold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent stared at me. He let a little anger burn through the dead ash. \"You want to think about something— think how Willis feels, hearing that song every night. Put him in his place, all right. Worked like a charm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did what Brent said. I thought about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent added a little pepper and a little butter and salt to the beans. When they were smoking he spread them on the flour tortillas, folded them, and handed one to me. We sat and ate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared out the side window into the tractor shed. An enormous orange cat was sleeping on the seat of the rusty John Deere. A couple of doves were in the rafters above. My gaze shifted over to the ceiling above me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up there?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attic now. Used to be the sewing room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sewing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent looked at me, a little resentful that he had to say anything else. \"Maria.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my attention back to my bean roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to tell you something,\" I decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent waited, not concerned one way or the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was his passivity that made me want to talk. Maybe the midday whiskey hangover. Maybe it was just easier than telling his sister. Whatever it was, I told Brent Daniels pretty much the whole story—about Sheckly\u0027s bootlegging, about Jean Kraus, about how people that were in a position to give information on Sheckly\u0027s business were disappearing, either by choice or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent listened quietly, eating his bean roll. Nothing seemed to shock him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was done he said, \"You don\u0027t want to go telling Miranda all this. It\u0027ll kill her right now. Wait for her to finish her tape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miranda may be in danger. You too, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was Jean Kraus arguing with you about—that night at the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent smirked. \"Jean, he\u0027ll argue about anything. That don\u0027t mean he\u0027s going to kill me and my family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you\u0027re right. I hope Les doesn\u0027t bring you folks the kind of luck he brought Julie Kearnes. Or Alex Blanceagle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent\u0027s eyes started collecting shadows again. \"Miranda doesn\u0027t need this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re not concerned. You don\u0027t worry about Les making problems for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent shook his head slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a hard person to judge. There could\u0027ve been a lie there. Or maybe not. The weathered face and the years of hardness covered up just about everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tough for me to let somebody in here,\" he said finally. He stared off at the rough red walls of the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there for another few seconds before I realized he\u0027d just told me to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e44\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I picked up Miranda at Silo Studios, another promised cold front had edged its way south and stalled, pressing humid air and gray clouds over Austin like a sweaty electric blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe folks seventy miles north in Waco were probably cool and comfortable. Then again, they were in Waco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo Chavez was too busy to speak to me. He and one of the engineers were glued to the sound board, listening in awe to the new vocal tracks Miranda had laid down over the last two mornings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifteen takes,\" Milo mumbled to me. \"Fifteen goddamn takes of \u0027Billy\u0027s Senorita\u0027 and she blew it away in one try this morning. My God, Navarre, losing that first demo tape was the best thing that ever happened to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laid his hand on the little BOSE speaker like he was consecrating it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChavez agreed to let me take Miranda back to S.A. early as long as I got her to her appearance tonight on time. Miranda said she was starving. She suggested lunch on the way back to town. I had a conscience attack and called my brother Garrett to see if he could join us. Unfortunately he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to the Texicali Grille we found Garrett at an outside table. He\u0027d pulled his wheelchair under one of the metal umbrellas and Dickhead the parrot was waddling stiffly back and forth on his shoulder. Danny Young, the owner of the Texicali, was sitting backward in the chair across the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny was a family friend, connected to the Navarres through a network of South Texas kin and nearkin that I never could quite remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany years back Danny had moved his restaurant business from Kingsville to Austin and decided to grant himself an honorary double degree in alternative politics and burgerflipping. He announced that the half of Austin below the Colorado River must secede from the growing yuppiness of the north, so he hoisted a green XXXL Tshirt up the flagpole at the Texicali and started calling himself the Mayor of South Austin. I think Danny\u0027s political platform said something about flip flops and salsa and Mexican beer. I\u0027d told him he could annex San Antonio anytime he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny\u0027s hands took up most of the top of the chair back. His greying brown hair was pulled into a ponytail and when Garrett said something about Samsung Electronics moving to Austin, Danny laughed, flashing the silver in his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, little bro.\" Garrett waved at me. Then he saw Miranda and said, \"Damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was dressed seven hours early for her fifteen minute spot at Robert Earle Keen\u0027s Halloween Night Show. She\u0027d chosen a cotton blouse made of big orange and white squares, a black skirt, tan boots, lots of silver jewellery. Her hair and makeup were airbrush perfect. Most of the time I would\u0027ve called the look too much, too Big Hair Texas for my tastes. This afternoon, on Miranda, it worked for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook hands with Garrett and Danny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to introduce Miranda but Danny said, \"Oh, hell, we\u0027ve jammed together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda laughed and gave Danny a hug and asked him how his washboard playing was coming along. Danny told Miranda she\u0027d sounded just fine on Sixth Street last month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett kept looking at Miranda. He wasn\u0027t having much luck getting his mouth closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parrot eyed me cautiously, like he was forming a vague memory of unhappier times, before Jimmy Buffett and ganja.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noisy bastard,\" he decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny gave Miranda one more hug, then asked us all what we were having. Garrett told him just about everything, especially Shiner Bock. My stomach went into a little gallop, reminding me about the large quantity of whiskey I\u0027d subjected it to for lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make mine iced tea,\" I corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny looked at me funny, like maybe he didn\u0027t know me after all, but he went inside to place the order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The renowned Miss Daniels,\" I introduced. \"My brother Garrett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda said, \"Pleased to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett shook her hand, looking at me while he did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked me some silent questions. I just raised my eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett gave Miranda one of those toothy grins that makes me wonder if he goes to the orthodontist to get his teeth unstraightened and sharpened on purpose. \"Love your tunes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda smiled. \"Much obliged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you only liked them,\" I reminded Garrett. \"I thought she wasn\u0027t Jimmy Buffett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett told me to shut up. So did the parrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, asshole.\" Garrett fished something out of the wheelchair\u0027s side pocket and handed it to me. It was about the size of a computer disk, wrapped in brown paper and sealed with a black and white peace sign sticker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started to protest, he held up his hands in defence. \"Did I say anything? Take the damn disk—it\u0027s nothing. Some security programs I thought you could use. Don\u0027t even consider it a present.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looked back and forth between us, a little confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I promised her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely nothing,\" Garrett agreed. \"Everybody turns thirty. Forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Miranda\u0027s turn to open her mouth. She looked at me indignantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m hoping somebody will gift me a noose,\" I said. \"For my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t—\" Miranda started to say something else, then realized she didn\u0027t know quite what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett was still grinning. \"He\u0027s embarrassed. Getting old. Not having a day job yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe hanging is too quick,\" I speculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dickhead,\" squawked the parrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looked back and forth, at a loss for words. It\u0027s a look I\u0027ve seen a lot from women who find themselves between two Navarre men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"End of subject,\" I announced. \"Tell Miranda how you\u0027re reconfiguring your computer to take over the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout too much more encouragement Garrett started telling us about the bastards running RNI, then about his latest unofficial projects. After a while Miranda stopped staring at me. The conversation swung around to Jimmy Buffett, of course, which segued into Miranda\u0027s pending fameandfortune deal with Century Records. Garrett tried to convince Miranda that she could do a bangup cover of Buffett\u0027s \"Brahma Fear\" on her first album. After the second round of Shiner Bocks, Miranda and Garrett had just about worked out the arrangement. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-40.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
