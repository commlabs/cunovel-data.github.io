I don\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Charlotte were so young, and we only saw you a few times because we lived in Houston and you were in Boston.\" She paused. \"How are you and Charlotte? I can\u0027t tell you how many times I\u0027ve thought of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re fine,\" she answered. \"I\u0027m calling because I found your name and number on a piece of paper that was with an insurance policy belonging to my father. I was wondering if you knew anything about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzanne responded curtly with a hint of bitterness in her voice, \"I know exactly why my name was there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d really appreciate it if you could tell me more. My aunt and uncle never mentioned you . . . or the policy, for that matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not surprised,\" Suzanne said with disgust. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she added quickly. \"It\u0027s been a long time, but I still get upset when I think about your parents and what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did happen?\" Allison asked.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzanne took a long, deep breath before letting it out. \"I met your mom in college, and we became close friends. When we graduated, we both got jobs in Boston and shared an apartment. Actually I was the one who introduced your dad to your mom. He worked in the office next to mine, and a few of us would go out after work. He was a great guy, and I knew he and your mom would hit it off, so I invited her to join us one afternoon. I was right. They were meant for each other.\" She paused, and Allison could hear a smile in her voice when she continued. \"We had a great time back then. Anyway . . . I eventually met Peter, and we were married. When his company transferred him to Houston, it was really hard for me to leave your mom and dad. They were like family. Your mom and I talked on the phone every other day.\" She laughed. \"Our husbands weren\u0027t too happy about the phone bills, but they understood. Whenever possible, we would fly up to Boston or they would come to see us in Houston, but once your mom became pregnant with Charlotte and we had our son, Alex, it became more difficult to get together. Then you were born. Your mother was so happy. Our visits didn\u0027t happen as often. Still, we never lost touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzanne paused again, and this time when she continued she sounded very sad. \"One day your mother called and said she wanted to ask me something very important. She said she and your dad were making out a will and wondered if Peter and I would be your legal guardians, should anything ever happen to them. Of course we said yes, we\u0027d be honored. But you really never expect anything like that to happen.\" Her voice cracked from the emotion she was trying to hold in. \"And only a couple of days later, we got the news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison could hear the tears choking her words when she said, \"I couldn\u0027t go to the funeral. I was nine months pregnant with our second child, and the doctor said I couldn\u0027t travel. I wanted to be there, but I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Charlotte lived at home for a while, and a couple of neighbors stayed with you. Just as soon as we could, we came to Boston, but by then your aunt and uncle had petitioned the court for custody. Unfortunately, we had no legal standing because your mother and father\u0027s will was never finalized. We fought to take you, but there was nothing we could do. Your aunt and uncle were your closest relatives. They put up a really strong fight, and they won . . . despite your parents\u0027 wishes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was stunned. \"My aunt and uncle never told us any of this,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I wouldn\u0027t expect them to. When we told them we wanted to remain in your lives, they were outraged. There was quite a battle between us. They said that we would only make the transition more difficult . . . that it was best for you if we let you settle into your new home without interference. I disagreed at first, but then they said if we called or wrote to you, they\u0027d block us. I certainly didn\u0027t want to cause you more distress. You\u0027d been through so much. I hope we did the right thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was speechless for a moment, and then lied. \"Yes, you did the right thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were still so young, but I guess I hoped Charlotte might remember us at least. Of course we tried to keep you both out of the conflict and she hadn\u0027t really spent much time with us. I understand if she has no recollection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She never mentioned you. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Many times I\u0027ve thought of trying to find you, just to see how you\u0027re doing, but then I worried that I\u0027d be stirring up bad memories.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-37.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
