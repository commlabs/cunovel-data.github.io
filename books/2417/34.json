{"id":76242,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Wallet doctors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. \"The guys in Nashville that smell smalltown money a mile off. They promised A1 all kinds of stuff for me—recordings, promotion, connections. Nothing ever happened except I showed A1 how grateful I was a lot. I thought it was love for a while. Eventually he decided I\u0027d become too expensive. Or maybe his wife found out. I never knew which. I got left in Nashville with about fifty dollars in cash and some really nice negligees. Stupid, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything. Allison drank more beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the bad part? I finally got up the courage to tell somebody in Nashville that story and it was Les SaintPierre. He just laughed. It happens a hundred times every month, he told me, the exact same way. The big trauma of my life was just another statistic. Then Les told me he could make it right and I got suckered again. I was a slow learner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to tell me any of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded like she\u0027d said it so many times she could almost believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened with the agency?\" I asked. \"Why did Les decide to push you out of the business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison shrugged. \"Les didn\u0027t want somebody bringing him back to earth when he went really far out with an idea. He didn\u0027t know when to stop. Most of the time, it turned out well for him that way. Not always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such as?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, noncommittal. \"It doesn\u0027t really matter. Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if he doesn\u0027t come back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get the agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound sure. You think you can keep it afloat without him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I know. Les\u0027 reputation. Sure, it\u0027ll be tough, but that\u0027s assuming I keep the agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name is worth money—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can sell it to all kinds of competitors in Nashville. There are also contracts in place for publishing rights on some hits that are still bringing in money. Les wasn\u0027t stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like you\u0027ve been looking into it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison shrugged. Slight smile. \"Wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must\u0027ve run down his assets, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got a pretty good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know anything about a cabin on Medina Lake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison\u0027s face got almost sober. She stared at me blankly. I told her about the probate settlement from Les\u0027 parents\u0027 property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First I\u0027ve heard about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was something else going on in her head. Like something that had been bothering her slightly for a long time was now coming to the forefront. I looked at her, silently asking her to tell me about it. She wavered, then looked away. \"You have a plan, sweetie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I\u0027d head out there. Check things out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI regretted my answer as soon as I said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison tottered to her feet, held up her beer to check how much was left, then smiled at me. \"You\u0027d better drive. I\u0027ll navigate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she began that job by trying to locate the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was quiet for the first half of the trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d complained bitterly before we left about me making her a thermos of coffee rather than tequila, then making her change clothes into something more utilitarian. I\u0027d found a pair of Carolaine\u0027s drawstring Banana Republics and a crewneck pullover in the back of the closet. They fit Allison well. Once we got going, she curled into the passenger\u0027s seat of my mother\u0027s Audi with her knees on the dash and her face behind the coffee mug and a pair of my mother\u0027s purple sunglasses she\u0027d pulled out of the glove compartment. For a while she made occasional \"uhh\" sounds and I thought she was going to be ill, but once we got out of the city she began to perk up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe even decided to come with me into the tax assessor\u0027s office when we got to Wilming. Wilming was a small county seat consisting of an American Legion Hall and a Dairy Queen and not much else. The assessor\u0027s office was open Saturday because it was also the post office and the grocery store. After successfully scoring the deed and the last five years of tax records on Les\u0027 property I had to grudgingly admit that having the subject\u0027s wife with me, the subject\u0027s pretty blond wife, had helped expedite matters somewhat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got back in the car Allison poured herself more coffee and said, \"Gaah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just strong,\" I said. \"You\u0027re not used to Peet\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered. \"Is this like Starbucks or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peet\u0027s is to Starbucks what Plato is to Socrates. You\u0027ll appreciate it in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison stared at me for about half a mile, then decided to turn her attention back to the tax assessor\u0027s documents and the coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flipped through the paperwork on Les\u0027 cabin. \"Bastard. Two years ago he changed the billing for the tax statements so they wouldn\u0027t come to the house. Exactly when we got married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted a place you didn\u0027t know about. He might\u0027ve already been thinking about getting away someday, leaving himself an exit route.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a small, incredulous laugh. \"What\u0027s this billing address in Austin? A girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a mail drop. A girlfriend would be too risky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bastard. You think you can find this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had the exact address for the cabin but that didn\u0027t mean much at the lake. Most people had their address registered as a mailbox along the main highway, and there would be hundreds of those, all plain silver, many of them with incomplete or weathereddown numbers. Even if we found the right box it wouldn\u0027t necessarily be near the cabin. Most likely that would be a mile or two down some unnamed gravel road, the turnoff marked only by wooden boards displaying the last names of some of the families that lived that way. Often there was no sign at all, no way to find someone out here unless you had wordofmouth instructions. If you could avoid the notice of the locals, Medina Lake wasn\u0027t a bad place for a missing person to hide out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe passed Woman Hollow Creek, wended our way through some more hills, down Highway 16. The ratio of RVs to cars began to climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison examined my mother\u0027s medicine pouch on the rearview mirror, letting the beads and feathers slip through her fingers. \"So how do you know Milo anyway? You two don\u0027t seem—I don\u0027t know, you\u0027re like the Odd Couple or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know that scar on my chest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison hesitated. \"You\u0027re kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milo didn\u0027t do it. He had this idea. He thought I\u0027d make a good private detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road was too twisty for me to look at Allison\u0027s face, but she stayed quiet for another mile or so, the purple sunglasses turned toward me. I missed the noise and the wind and rattling of the VW. In my mother\u0027s Audi, the quiet spaces were way too quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Allison laced her fingers together and stretched her arms. \"Okay. So what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milo was assistant counsel for defence on this homicide case. His first big job with Terrence 8c Goldman in San Francisco. He wanted someone who could track down a witness—a drug dealer who\u0027d seen the murder. Milo thought I could do it. He thought he\u0027d really impress his boss that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you found the guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah, I found him. I spent a few days in San Francisco General afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milo\u0027s boss was impressed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With Milo, no. With me, yes. Once I got out of intensive care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison laughed. \"He gave you a job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She. She offered to train me, yes. She fired Milo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s even better. And a woman, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most definitely a woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison opened her mouth, then began to nod. \"Ah ha. Milo wanted to impress—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t just professional.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you and her—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison grinned. She nudged my arm. \"I do believe the P.I. is blushing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, then uncapped the thermos and poured herself another cup of Peet\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This stuff is beginning to taste better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe skirted the lake for over a mile before we actually saw it. The hills and the cedars obscured the view most of the way around. The waterline was so far down that the clay and limestone shore looked like a beige bathtub ring between the water and the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMedina wasn\u0027t a lake you could get your bearings on very easily. The water snaked around, following the course of the original river that was dammed to make the lake, etching out coves and dead ends, each outlet and inlet looking pretty much like all the others. We might\u0027ve been searching for Les\u0027 cabin the rest of the week if an old friend hadn\u0027t helped us out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a mile past the Highway 37 cutoff, a black Ford Festiva was pulled off on the right side of the road, opposite the lake. The driver\u0027s side window was open and a redheaded orangutanlooking guy was behind the wheel, reading a newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove a quarter mile up the road and then Ued around. I waited for a semi to rumble by and then pulled in behind it, following close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we doing?\" Allison asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep looking straight ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my second pass the redhead in the Festiva still didn\u0027t pay me any attention, but it was definitely Elgin. He had his head firmly buried in the sports page. Advanced surveillance methods. He\u0027d probably figure out to poke eyeholes in the paper pretty soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly scanned the area he was staking out. There were no side roads in view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no mailboxes. It was just a curve of highway around a hill. On the lake side the road fell away in a steep, heavily wooded slope, so you couldn\u0027t really see what was down toward the water, but there were some power lines angling in. That meant at least one cabin and only one way to get down there—past Elgin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elgin without Frank,\" I said. \"Not smart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison looked behind us. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her about my encounter the night before with Elgin and Frank on the side of the highway, how they\u0027d introduced my face to the asphalt and offered me a very nice throwdown gun. I told her they were probably sheriff deputies, buddies of Tilden Sheckly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What shits,\" she said. \"And they\u0027re watching Les\u0027 place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of them at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027re going to go back and whack him on the head or something, right? Tie him up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chanced a look sideways to see if she was kidding. I couldn\u0027t tell. \"Whack him on the head?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I\u0027ve got Mace, too. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter her performance with Sheckly the previous evening I thought it prudent not to deride her abilities as a headwhacker. I said, \"Let\u0027s keep that as a backup plan. Get a fifty out of my backpack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kept driving, going back as far as Turk\u0027s Ice House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter five minutes of chitchat with Eustice, the blue haired store clerk in the flashy satin shirt, we came to an agreement that the cove we wanted was Maple End and no, Eustice didn\u0027t recognize Les from his picture and no, Allison hadn\u0027t gone to high school with Eustice\u0027s daughter. Despite the last disappointment, Eustice agreed to introduce us to Bip, who agreed to loan us his outboard fishing boat for fifty dollars. Bip and his boat were both large grayish wedges, dented up and grungy, and both smelled like live bait. Bip kept grinning at Allison and saying \"whuh!\" every time he looked away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to give him warning looks, to let him know he was putting himself in mortal peril, but Bip paid no attention. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-34.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
