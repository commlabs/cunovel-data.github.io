White as the skin of a corpse, shreds hanging loose to reveal gaping red wounds, and as she drew them onto the altar top and tucked them under her, the Errant suddenly understood something. About humanity, about the seething horde in its cruel avalanche through history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe taste of ashes filling his mouth, he looked away, studied the runnels of water streaming down the stone walls of the chamber. ‘It rises,’ he said, looking back at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He was never as lost as he thought he was,’ Feather Witch said, reaching up distractedly to twirl the filthy strands of her once-golden hair. ‘Are you not eager, dear god of mine? This empire is about to kneel at your feet. And,’ she suddenly smiled, revealing brown teeth, ‘at mine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, at yours, Feather Witch. Those rotting, half-dead appendages that you could have used to run. Long ago. The empire kneels, and lips quiver forth. A blossom kiss. So cold, so like paste, and the smell, oh, the smell…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is it not time?’ she asked, with an oddly coy glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You were a consort. You know the ways of love. Teach me now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Teach you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am unbroken. I have never lain with man or woman.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A lie,’ the Errant replied. ‘Gribna, the lame slave in the Hiroth village. You were very young. He used you. Often and badly. It is what has made you what you now are, Feather Witch.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he saw her eyes shy away, saw the frown upon her brow, and realized the awful truth that she had not remembered. Too young, too wide-eyed. And then, every moment buried in a deep hole at the pit of her soul. She, by the Abyss, did not remember. ‘Feather Witch-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.’Go away,’ she said. ‘I don’t need anything from you right now. I have Udinaas.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have lost Udinaas. You never had him. Listen, please-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’s alive! Yes he is! And all the ones who wanted him are dead-the sisters, all dead! Could you have imagined that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You fool. Silchas Ruin is coming here. To lay this city to waste. To destroy it utterly-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He cannot defeat Rhulad Sengar,’ she retorted. ‘Not even Silchas Ruin can do that!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Errant said nothing to that bold claim. Then he turned away. ‘I saw gangrene at your feet, Feather Witch. My temple, as you like to call it, reeks of rotting flesh.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then heal me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The water rises,’ he said, and this time the statement seemed to burgeon within him, filling his entire being. The water rises. Why? ‘Hannan Mosag seeks the demon god, the one trapped in the ice. That ice, Feather Witch, is melting. Water… everywhere. Water…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the Holds, was it possible? Even this? But no, I trapped the bastard. I trapped him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He took the finger,’ Feather Witch said behind him. ‘He took it and thought that was enough, to just take it. But how could I go where he has gone? I couldn’t. So I needed him, yes. I needed him, and he was never as lost as he thought he was.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what of the other one?’ the Errant asked, still with his back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never found-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Elder God whirled round. ‘Where is the other finger?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw her eyes widen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it possible? Is it-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found himself in the corridor, the water at his hips, though he passed through it effortlessly. We have come to the moment-Icarium walks ~ where? A foreign army and a horrifying mage approaches. Silchas Ruin wings down from the north with eyes of fire. Hannan Mosag ~ the fool-crawls his way to Settle Lake even as the demon god stirs-and she says he was never as lost as he thought he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost dawn, somewhere beyond these sagging, weeping walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn empire on its knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blossom kiss, but moments away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word came to Varat Taun, newly appointed Finadd in the Palace Guard, that Icarium, along with Taralack Veed and Senior Assessor, had escaped. At that statement his knees had weakened, a flood rushing through him, but it was a murky, confused flood. Relief, yes, at what had been averted-at least for the moment, for might Icarium not return?-relief that was quickly engulfed by his growing dread for this invading army encamped barely two leagues away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be a siege, and with virtually no-one left to hold the walls it would be a short one. And then the Eternal Domicile itself would be assailed, and by the time all was done, Emperor Rhulad Sengar would likely be standing alone, surrounded by the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Emperor without an empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive Letherii armies on the Bolkando borderlands far to the east had seemingly vanished. Not a word from a single mage among those forces. They had set out, under a competent if not brilliant commander, to crush the Bolkando and their allies. That should have been well within the woman’s capabilities. The last report had come half a day before the armies clashed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-440.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
