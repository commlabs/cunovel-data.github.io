They sat down on the grass to eat their lunches, but then Maurecia remembered she needed chocolate milk. She went to get some from Miss Mush.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When she returned, she couldn\u0027t find her lunch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What happened to my lunch?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy looked up at her, then shrugged her shoulders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I set my lunch down right here!\" said Maurecia. \"You saw me, didn\u0027t you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy shook her head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 155\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I put it here, then I went to Miss Mush\u0027s room to get some chocolate milk.

She crawled in the dirt as she searched through the bushes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Any luck?\" asked Joy as she finished Maurecia\u0027s chocolate milk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I found it!\" Maurecia exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy coughed on the chocolate milk. \"You did?\" she asked, then coughed again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maurecia crawled out of the bushes holding a paper sack. She sat back down next to Joy and opened it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is it your lunch?\" asked Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Too bad,\" said Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s money!\" exclaimed Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy\u0027s eyes nearly popped out of her head as she looked at the paper bag. It was stuffed with dollar\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 156\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e bills. And they weren\u0027t just one-dollar bills. There were a few five-dollar bills, some ten-dollar bills, but mostly twenty-dollar bills.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We found a million dollars!\" Joy whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We?\" asked Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They counted the money. It wasn\u0027t a million dollars. It was twenty thousand six hundred and fifty-five dollars.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let\u0027s split it,\" said Joy. \"You take half and 111 take half.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe I should show it to Louis,\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louis!\" exclaimed Joy. \"Are you crazy? Let\u0027s spend it. We can buy a skateboard, or a bicycle, or a horse, or a fancy car, or an airplane!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I like taking the bus,\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You could buy ice cream!\" said Joy. \"All the ice cream you ever want for the rest of your life.\" She knew Maurecia loved ice cream more than anything else in the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maurecia smiled as she thought about it. \"No, I better show it to Louis. Hell know what to do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ll just get in trouble,\" warned Joy. \"Louis will think you robbed a bank. You\u0027ll go to jail for the rest of your life.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louis knows I\u0027m not a bank robber,\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But what if the real bank robbers find out you have their money?\" asked Joy. \"They\u0027ll come after you and murder you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 157\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, I didn\u0027t think of that,\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You better give it to me,\" said Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louis will protect me,\" said Maurecia. She walked across the playground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis was talking to Terrence. He said, \"If you ever tie Leslie\u0027s pigtails to the tetherball pole again, 111-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louis, look!\" said Maurecia. She held the paper sack up to his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No thank you, Maurecia, I\u0027m not hungry,\" said Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s not my lunch,\" said Maurecia. \"Look inside!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis took the bag from her and looked inside. \"Very nice,\" he said, then gave it back to her. \"Now I want you to go untie Leslie and tell her-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He suddenly stopped talking and blinked his eyes. He looked at Terrence, then at Maurecia, then at Terrence, then at Maurecia, and then at the paper sack. \"Let me see that again,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maurecia gave him the bag.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, what about me?\" asked Terrence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get lost, Jack Frost,\" said Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Terrence ran away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you rob a bank?\" asked Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I found it in the bushes,\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I believe you,\" said Louis. \"Well have to put it in the lost and found.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know,\" said Maurecia. \"Whoever lost it is probably very sad.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 158\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But if no one claims it in two weeks, you can have it,\" said Louis. He took the bag of money and headed to the office.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy was waiting for Louis at the door. \"Hey, Louis,\" she said. \"I lost a bag full of money. Have you seen it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Help!\" Leslie screamed from the tetherball court.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A week later, Maurecia was eating lunch alone. She was eating a piece of sweet potato pie. Joy was crawling around in the dirt looking for more bags of money.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maurecia,\" said Louis, \"I\u0027d like you to meet someone. This is Mr. Finch.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Finch was an old man with white hair and a long white beard. He shook Maurecia\u0027s hand with both of his hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s your money, isn\u0027t it?\" asked Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Finch nodded. \"It was my life\u0027s savings,\" he said. \"For fifty years I made pencils. I got a penny for every pencil I made. I hate pencils! But finally I saved enough money to quit my job and do what I always wanted to do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m going to open my own ice cream parlor,\" he said, then started to cry. \"When I lost that money, I thought I\u0027d have to start making pencils again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maurecia cried too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 159\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here, I want you to have this,\" blubbered Mr. Finch. He gave her an envelope containing five hundred dollars.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was the second largest amount of money Maurecia had ever had.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I will give you free ice cream for the rest of your life at my ice cream parlor,\" he promised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you!\" said Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, thank you,\" said Mr. Finch. \"I\u0027m so glad someone as kind and as honest as you found it. There are so many dishonest people in the world. It\u0027s good to know there are still good people too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They hugged each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy crawled out of the bushes. \"Hey.
