That’s it? Everything? The grand total?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInigo tried to explain. “We’ve been operating under a terrible time pressure from the very beginning. Just yesterday morning, for example, I was a hopeless drunk and Fezzik toiled for the Brute Squad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s impossible,” Westley cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am Inigo Montoya and I do not accept defeat—you will think of something; I have complete confidence in you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s going to marry Humperdinck and I’m helpless,” Westley said in blind despair. “Lay me down again. Leave me alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re giving in too easily, we fought monsters to reach you, we risked everything because you have the brains to conquer problems. I have complete and absolute total confidence that you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to die,” Westley whispered, and he closed his eyes. “If I had a month to plan, maybe I might come up with something, but this…” His head rocked from side to side. “I’m sorry. Leave me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just moved your own head,” Fezzik said, doing his best to be cheery. “Doesn’t that up your spirits?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My brains, your strength and his steel against a hundred troops? And you think a little head-jiggle is supposed to make me happy? Why didn’t you leave me to death? This is worse. Lying here helpless while my true love marries my murderer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just know once you’re over your emotional outbursts, you’ll come up with—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean if we even had a wheelbarrow, that would be something,” Westley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?” Inigo asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Over by the albino, I think,” Fezzik replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we can get a wheelbarrow,” Inigo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well why didn’t you list that among our assets in the first place?” Westley said, sitting up, staring out at the massed troops in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just sat up,” Fezzik said, still trying to be cheery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestley continued to stare at the troops and the incline leading down toward them. He shook his head. “What I’d give for a holocaust cloak,” he said then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There we can’t help you,” Inigo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will this do?” Fezzik wondered, pulling out his holocaust cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where…?” Inigo began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“While you were after frog dust—” Fezzik answered. “It fit so nicely I just tucked it away and kept it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWestley got to his feet then. “All right. I’ll need a sword eventually.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Inigo asked. “You can barely lift one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“True,” Westley agreed. “But that is hardly common knowledge. Hear me now; there may be problems once we’re inside—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll say there may be problems,” Inigo cut in. “How do we stop the wedding? Once we do, how do I find the Count? Once I do, where will I find you again? Once we’re together, how do we escape? Once we escape—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t pester him with so many questions,” Fezzik said. “Take it easy; he’s been dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, right, sorry,” Inigo said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-122.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
