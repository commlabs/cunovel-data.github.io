This was the right thing to do, the most inconspicuous way to behave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the day, almost all the other students had returned to class, too. Just Tyler and Bella and a few others - who were probably using the accident as a chance to ditch - remained absent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt shouldn\u0027t be so hard for me to do the right thing. But, all afternoon, I was gritting my teeth against the urge that had me yearning ditch, too - in order to go find the girl again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a stalker. An obsessessed stalker. An obsessessed, vampire stalker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchool today was - somehow, impossibly - even more boring than it had seemed just a week ago. Coma-like. It was as if the color had drained from the bricks, the trees, the sky, the faces around me... I stared at the cracks in the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another right thing I should be doing...that I was not. Of course, it was also a wrong thing. It all depended on the perspective from which you viewed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the perspective of a Cullen - not just a vampire, but a Cullen, someone who belonged to a family, such a rare state in our world - the right thing to do would have gone something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised to see you in class, Edward. I heard you were involved in that awful accident this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I was, Mr. Banner, but I was the lucky one.\" A friendly smile. \"I didn\u0027t get hurt at all... I wish I could say the same for Tyler and Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think Tyler is fine...just some superficial scrapes from the windshield glass. I\u0027m not sure about Bella, though.\" A worried frown. \"She might have a concussion. I heard she was pretty incoherent for a while - seeing things even. I know the doctors were worried...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s how it should have gone. That\u0027s what I owed my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised to see you in class, Edward. I heard you were involved in that awful accident this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t hurt.\" No smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Banner shifted his weight from foot to foot, uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea how Tyler Crowley and Bella Swan are? I heard there were some injuries...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"I wouldn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Banner cleared his throat. \"Er, right...\" he said, my cold stare making his voice sound a bit strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked quickly back to the front of classroom and began his lecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the wrong thing to do. Unless you looked at it from a more obscure point of view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just seemed so...so unchivalrous to slander the girl behind her back, especially when she was proving more trustworthy than I could have dreamed. She hadn\u0027t said anything to betray me, despite having good reason to do so. Would I betray her when she had done nothing but keep my secret?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a nearly identical conversation with Mrs. Goff - just in Spanish rather than in English - and Emmett gave me a long look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope you have a good explanation for what happened today. Rose is on the warpath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes without looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually had come up with a perfectly sound explanation. Just suppose I hadn\u0027t done anything to stop the van from crushing the girl... I recoiled from that thought. But if she had been hit, if she\u0027d been mangled and bleeding, the red fluid spilling, wasting on the blacktop, the scent of the fresh blood pulsing through the air ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered again, but not just in horror. Part of me shivered in desire. No, I would not have been able to watch her bleed without exposing us all in a much more flagrant and shocking way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a perfectly sound excuse...but I wouldn\u0027t use it. It was too shameful. And I hadn\u0027t thought of it until long after the fact, regardless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook out for Jasper, Emmett went on, oblivious to my reverie. He\u0027s not as angry...but he\u0027s more resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw what he meant, and for a moment the room swam around me. My rage was so all-consuming that a red haze clouded my vision. I thought I would choke on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHEESH, EDWARD! GET A GRIP! Emmett shouted at me in his head. His hand came down on my shoulder, holding me in my seat before I could jump to my feet. He rarely used his full strength - there was rarely a need, for he was so much stronger than any vampire any of us had ever encountered - but he used it now. He gripped my arm, rather than pushing me down. If he\u0027d been pushing, the chair under me would have collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEASY! He ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to calm myself, but it was hard. The rage burned in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper\u0027s not going to do anything until we all talk. I just thought you should know the direction he\u0027s headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI concentrated on relaxing, and I felt Emmett\u0027s hand loosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTry not to make more of a spectacle of yourself. You\u0027re in enough trouble as it is. I took a deep breath and Emmett released me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched around the room routinely, but our confrontation had been so short and silent that only a few people sitting behind Emmett had even noticed. None of them knew what to make of it, and they shrugged it off. The Cullens were freaks - everyone knew that already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, kid, you\u0027re a mess, Emmett added, sympathy in his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bite me,\" I muttered under my breath, and I heard his low chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett didn\u0027t hold grudges, and I probably ought to be more grateful for his easy going nature. But I could see that Jasper\u0027s intentions made sense to Emmett, that he was considering how it might be the best course of action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rage simmered, barely under control. Yes, Emmett was stronger than I was, but he\u0027d yet to beat me in a wrestling match. He claimed that this was because I cheated, but hearing thoughts was just as much a part of who I was as his immense strength was a part of him. We were evenly matched in a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fight? Was that where this was headed? Was I going to fight with my family over a human I barely knew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that for a moment, thought about the fragile feel of the girl\u0027s body in my arms in juxtaposition with Jasper, Rose, and Emmett - supernaturally strong and fast, killing machines by nature...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I would fight for her. Against my family. I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t fair to leave her undefended when I was the one who\u0027d put her in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t win alone, though, not against the three of them, and I wondered who my allies would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle, certainly. He would not fight anyone, but he would be wholly against Rose\u0027s and Jasper\u0027s designs. That might be all I needed. I would see...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme, doubtful. She would not side against me either, and she would hate to disagree with Carlisle, but she would be for any plan that kept her family intact. Her first priority would not be rightness, but me. If Carlisle was the soul of our family, then Esme was the heart. He gave us a leader who deserved following; she made that following into an act of love. We all loved each other - even under the fury I felt toward Jasper and Rose right now, even planning to fight them to save the girl, I knew that I loved them. Alice...I had no idea. It would probably depend on what she saw coming. She would side with the winner, I imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I would have to do this without help. I wasn\u0027t a match for them alone, but I wasn\u0027t going to let the girl be hurt because of me. That might mean evasive action... My rage dulled a bit with the sudden, black humor. I could imagine how the girl would react to my kidnapping her. Of course, I rarely guessed her reactions right - but what other reaction could she have besides terror?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure how to manage that, though - kidnapping her. I wouldn\u0027t be able to stand being close to her for very long. Perhaps I would just deliver her back to her mother. Even that much would be fraught with danger. For her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd also for me, I realized suddenly. If I were to kill her by accident... I wasn\u0027t certain exactly how much pain that would cause me, but I knew it would be multifaceted and intense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time passed quickly while I mulled over all the complications ahead of me: the argument waiting for me at home, the conflict with my family, the lengths I might be forced to go to afterward...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I couldn\u0027t complain that life outside this school was monotonous any more. The girl had changed that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett and I walked silently to the car when the bell rang. He was worrying about me, and worrying about Rosalie. He knew whose side he would have to choose in a quarrel, and it bothered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were waiting for us in the car, also silent. We were a very quiet group. Only I could hear the shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdiot! Lunatic! Moron! Jackass! Selfish, irresponsible fool! Rosalie kept up a constant stream of insults at the top of her mental lungs. It made it hard to hear the others, but I ignored her as best I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett was right about Jasper. He was sure of his course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice was troubled, worrying about Jasper, flipping through images of the future. No matter which direction Jasper came at the girl, Alice always saw me there, blocking him. Interesting...neither Rosalie nor Emmett was with him in these visions. So Jasper planned to work alone. That would even things up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper was the best, certainly the most experienced fighter among us. My one advantage lay in that I could hear his moves before he made them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had never fought more than playfully with Emmett or Jasper - just horsing around. I felt sick at the thought of really trying to hurt Jasper...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not that. Just to block him. That was all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI concentrated on Alice, memorizing Jasper\u0027s different avenues of attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I did that, her visions shifted, moving further and further away from the Swan\u0027s house. I was cutting him off earlier...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop that, Edward! It can\u0027t happen this way. I won\u0027t let it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer her, I just kept watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began searching farther ahead, into the misty, unsure realm of distant possibilities. Everything was shadowy and vague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire way home, the charged silence did not lift. I parked in the big garage off the house; Carlisle\u0027s Mercedes was there, next to Emmett\u0027s big jeep, Rose\u0027s M3 and my Vanquish. I was glad Carlisle was already home - this silence would end explosively, and I wanted him there when that happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went straight to the dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was, of course, never used for its intended purpose. But it was furnished with a long oval mahogany table surrounded by chairs - we were scrupulous about having all the correct props in place. Carlisle liked to use it as a conference room. In a group with such strong and disparate personalities, sometimes it was necessary to discuss things in a calm, seated manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a feeling that the setting was not going to help much today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle sat in his usual seat at the eastern head of the room. Esme was beside him - they held hands on top of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme\u0027s eyes were on me, their golden depths full of concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay. It was her only thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I could smile at the woman who was truly a mother to me, but I had no reassurances for her now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on Carlisle\u0027s other side. Esme reached around him to put her free hand on my shoulder. She had no idea of what was about to start; she was just worrying about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle had a better sense of what was coming. His lips were pressed tightly together and his forehead was creased. The expression looked too old for his young face. As everyone else sat, I could see the lines being drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie sat directly across from Carlisle, on the other end of the long table. She glared at me, never looking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett sat beside her, his face and thoughts both wry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper hesitated, and then went to stand against the wall behind Rosalie. He was decided, regardless of the outcome of this discussion. My teeth locked together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice was the last to come in, and her eyes were focused on something far away - the future, still too indistinct for her to make use of it. Without seeming to think about it, she sat next to Esme. She rubbed her forehead as if she had a headache. Jasper twitched uneasily and considered joining her, but he kept his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. I had started this - I should speak first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, looking first at Rose, then Jasper and then Emmett. \"I didn\u0027t mean to put any of you at risk. It was thoughtless, and I take full responsibility for my hasty action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie glared at me balefully. \"What do you mean, ��take full responsibility\u0027? Are you going to fix it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the way you mean,\" I said, working to keep my voice even and quiet. \"I\u0027m willing to leave now, if that makes things better.\" If I believe that the girl will be safe, if I believe that none of you will touch her, I amended in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Esme murmured. \"No, Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI patted her hand. \"It\u0027s just a few years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Esme\u0027s right, though,\" Emmett said. \"You can\u0027t go anywhere now. That would be the opposite of helpful. We have to know what people are thinking, now more than ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice will catch anything major,\" I disagreed. Carlisle shook his head. \"I think Emmett is right, Edward. The girl will be more likely to talk if you disappear. It\u0027s all of us leave, or none of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t say anything,\" I insisted quickly. Rose was building up to the explosion, and I wanted this fact out there first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know her mind,\" Carlisle reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know this much. Alice, back me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice stared up at me wearily. \"I can\u0027t see what will happen if we just ignore this.\" She glanced at Rose and Jasper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she couldn\u0027t see that future - not when Rosalie and Jasper were so decided against ignoring the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie\u0027s palm smacked down on the table with a loud bang. \"We can\u0027t allow the human a chance to say anything. Carlisle, you must see that. Even if we decided to all disappear, it\u0027s not safe to leave stories behind us. We live so differently from the rest of our kind - you know there are those who would love an excuse to point fingers. We have to be more careful than anyone else!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve left rumors behind us before,\" I reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just rumors and suspicions, Edward. Not eyewitnesses and evidence!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evidence!\" I scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jasper was nodding, his eyes hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose - \" Carlisle began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me finish, Carlisle. It doesn\u0027t have to be any big production. The girl hit her head today. So maybe that injury turns out to be more serious that it looked.\" Rosalie shrugged. \"Every mortal goes to sleep with the chance of never waking up. The others would expect us to clean up after ourselves. Technically, that would make it Edward\u0027s job, but this is obviously beyond him. You know I\u0027m capable of control. I would leave no evidence behind me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Rosalie, we all know how proficient an assassin you are,\" I snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hissed at me, furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, please,\" Carlisle said. Then he turned to Rosalie. \"Rosalie, I looked the other way in Rochester because I felt that you were owed your justice. The men you killed had wronged you monstrously. This is not the same situation. The Swan girl is an innocent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not personal, Carlisle,\" Rosalie said through her teeth. \"It\u0027s to protect us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief moment of silence while Carlisle thought through his answer. When he nodded, Rosalie\u0027s eyes lit up. She should have known better. Even if I hadn\u0027t been able to read his thoughts, I could have anticipated his next words. Carlisle never compromised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you mean well, Rosalie, but...I\u0027d like very much for our family to be worth protecting. The occasional...accident or lapse in control is a regrettable part of who we are.\" It was very like him to include himself in the plural, though he had never had such a lapse himself. \"To murder a blameless child in cold blood is another thing entirely. I believe the risk she presents, whether she speaks her suspicions or not, is nothing to the greater risk. If we make exceptions to protect ourselves, we risk something much more important. We risk losing the essence of who we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI controlled my expression very carefully. It wouldn\u0027t do at all to grin. Or to applaud, as I wished I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie scowled. \"It\u0027s just being responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s being callous,\" Carlisle corrected gently. \"Every life is precious.\" Rosalie sighed heavily and her lower lip pouted out. Emmett patted her shoulder. \"It\u0027ll be fine, Rose,\" he encouraged in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The question,\" Carlisle continued, \"is whether we should move on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Rosalie moaned. \"We just got settled. I don\u0027t want to start on my sophomore year in high school again!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could keep your present age, of course,\" Carlisle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And have to move again that much sooner?\" she countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it here! There\u0027s so little sun, we get to be almost normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we certainly don\u0027t have to decide now. We can wait and see if it becomes necessary. Edward seems certain of the Swan girl\u0027s silence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was no longer worried about Rose. I could see that she would go along with Carlisle\u0027s decision, not matter how infuriated she was with me. Their conversation had moved on to unimportant details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper remained unmoved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood why. Before he and Alice had met, he\u0027d lived in a combat zone, a relentless theater of war. He knew the consequences of flouting the rules - he\u0027d seen the grisly aftermath with his own eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt said much that he had not tried to calm Rosalie down with his extra faculties, nor did he now try to rile her up. He was holding himself aloof from this discussion - above it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jasper,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe met my gaze, his face expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t pay for my mistake. I won\u0027t allow that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She benefits from it, then? She should have died today, Edward. I would only set that right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI repeated myself, emphasizing each word. \"I will not allow it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows shot up. He wasn\u0027t expecting this - he hadn\u0027t imagined that I would act to stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head once. \"I won\u0027t let Alice live in danger, even a slight danger. You don\u0027t feel about anyone the way I feel about her, Edward, and you haven\u0027t lived through what I\u0027ve lived through, whether you\u0027ve seen my memories or not. You don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not disputing that, Jasper. But I\u0027m telling you now, I won\u0027t allow you to hurt Isabella Swan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other - not glaring, but measuring the opposition. I felt him sample the mood around me, testing my determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jazz,\" Alice said, interrupting us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held my gaze for a moment more, and then looked at her. \"Don\u0027t bother telling me you can protect yourself, Alice. I already know that. I\u0027ve still got to - \" \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m going say,\" Alice interrupted. \"I was going to ask you for a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw what was on her mind, and my mouth fell open with an audible gasp. I stared at her, shocked, only vaguely aware that everyone besides Alice and Jasper was now eyeing me warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you love me. Thanks. But I would really appreciate it if you didn\u0027t try to kill Bella. First of all, Edward\u0027s serious and I don\u0027t want you two fighting. Secondly, she\u0027s my friend. At least, she\u0027s going to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear as glass in her head: Alice, smiling, with her icy white arm around the girl\u0027s warm, fragile shoulders. And Bella was smiling, too, her arm around Alice\u0027s waist. The vision was rock solid; only the timing of it was unsure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...Alice...\" Jasper gasped. I couldn\u0027t manage to turn my head to see his expression. I couldn\u0027t tear myself away from the image in Alice\u0027s head in order to hear his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to love her someday, Jazz. I\u0027ll be very put out with you if you don\u0027t let her be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still locked into Alice\u0027s thoughts. I saw the future shimmer as Jasper\u0027s resolve floundered in the face of her unexpected request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" she sighed - his indecision had cleared a new future. \"See? Bella\u0027s not going to say anything. There\u0027s nothing to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way she said the girl\u0027s name...like they were already close confidants... \"Alice,\" I choked. \"What...does this...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you there was a change coming. I don\u0027t know, Edward.\" But she locked her jaw, and I could see that there was more. She was trying not to think about it; she was focusing very hard on Jasper suddenly, though he was too stunned to have progressed much in his decision making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did this sometimes when she was trying to keep something from me. \"What, Alice? What are you hiding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Emmett grumble. He always got frustrated when Alice and I had these kinds of conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, trying to not let me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it about the girl?\" I demanded. \"Is it about Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had her teeth gritted in concentration, but when I spoke Bella\u0027s name, she slipped. Her slip only lasted the tiniest portion of a second, but that was long enough. \"NO!\" I shouted. I heard my chair hit the floor, and only then realized I was on my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward!\" Carlisle was on his feet, too, his arm on my shoulder. I was barely aware of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s solidifying,\" Alice whispered. \"Every minute you\u0027re more decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027re really only two ways left for her. It\u0027s one or the other, Edward.\" I could see what she saw...but I could not accept it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said again; there was no volume to my denial. My legs felt hollow, and I had to brace myself against the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will somebody please let the rest of us in on the mystery?\" Emmett complained. \"I have to leave,\" I whispered to Alice, ignoring him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward, we\u0027ve already been over that,\" Emmett said loudly. \"That\u0027s the best way to start the girl talking. Besides, if you take off, we won\u0027t know for sure if she\u0027s talking or not. You have to stay and deal with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see you going anywhere, Edward,\" Alice told me. \"I don\u0027t know if you can leave anymore.\" Think about it, she added silently. Think about leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw what she meant. Yes, the idea of never seeing the girl again was...painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was also necessary. I couldn\u0027t sanction either future I\u0027d apparently condemned her to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not entirely sure of Jasper, Edward, Alice went on. If you leave, if he thinks she\u0027s a danger to us...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t hear that,\" I contradicted her, still only halfway aware of our audience. Jasper was wavering. He would not do something that would hurt Alice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot right this moment. Will you risk her life, leave her undefended? \"Why are you doing this to me?\" I groaned. My head fell into my hands. I was not Bella\u0027s protector. I could not be that. Wasn\u0027t Alice\u0027s divided future enough proof of that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love her, too. Or I will. It\u0027s not the same, but I want her around for that. \"Love her, too?\" I whispered, incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. You are so blind, Edward. Can\u0027t you see where you\u0027re headed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan\u0027t you see where you already are? It\u0027s more inevitable than the sun rising in the east. See what I see...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, horrified. \"No.\" I tried to shut out the visions she revealed to me. \"I don\u0027t have to follow that course. I\u0027ll leave. I will change the future.\" \"You can try,\" she said, her voice skeptical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on!\" Emmett bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pay attention,\" Rose hissed at him. \"Alice sees him falling for a human! How classically Edward!\" She made a gagging sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scarcely heard her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Emmett said, startled. Then his booming laugh echoed through the room. \"Is that what\u0027s been going on?\" He laughed again. \"Tough break, Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt his hand on my shoulder, and I shook it off absently. I couldn\u0027t pay attention to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fall for a human?\" Esme repeated in a stunned voice. \"For the girl he saved today? Fall in love with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you see, Alice? Exactly,\" Jasper demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned toward him; I continued to stare numbly at the side of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It all depends on whether he is strong enough or not. Either he\u0027ll kill her himself\" - she turned to meet my gaze again, glaring - \"which would really irritate me, Edward, not to mention what it would do to you - \" she faced Jasper again, \"or she\u0027ll be one of us someday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone gasped; I didn\u0027t look to see who.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not going to happen!\" I was shouting again. \"Either one!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice didn\u0027t seem to hear me. \"It all depends,\" she repeated. \"He may be just strong enough not to kill her - but it will be close. It will take an amazing amount of control,\" she mused. \"More even than Carlisle has. He may be just strong enough...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he\u0027s not strong enough to do is stay away from her. That\u0027s a lost cause.\" I couldn\u0027t find my voice. No one else seemed to be able to either. The room was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Alice, and everyone else stared at me. I could see my own horrified expression from five different viewpoints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment, Carlisle sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this...complicates things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll say,\" Emmett agreed. His voice was still close to laughter. Trust Emmett to find the joke in the destruction of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose the plans remain the same, though,\" Carlisle said thoughtfully. \"We\u0027ll stay, and watch. Obviously, no one will...hurt the girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jasper said quietly. \"I can agree to that. If Alice sees only two ways - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" My voice was not a shout or a growl or a cry of despair, but some combination of the three. \"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to leave, to be away from the noise of their thoughts - Rosalie\u0027s selfrighteous disgust, Emmett\u0027s humor, Carlisle\u0027s never ending patience...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorse: Alice\u0027s confidence. Jasper\u0027s confidence in that confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorst of all: Esme\u0027s...joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stalked out of the room. Esme touched my arm as I passed, but I didn\u0027t acknowledge the gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was running before I was out of the house. I cleared the river in one bound, and raced into the forest. The rain was back again, falling so heavily that I was drenched in a few moments. I liked the thick sheet of water - it made a wall between me and the rest of the world. It closed me in, let me be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran due east, over and through the mountains without breaking my straight course, until I could see the lights of Seattle on the other side of the sound. I stopped before I touched the borders of human civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut in by the rain, all alone, I finally made myself look at what I had done - at the way I had mutilated the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, the vision of Alice and the girl with their arms around each other - the trust and friendship was so obvious it shouted from the image. Bella\u0027s wide chocolate eyes were not bewildered in this vision, but still full of secrets - in this moment, they seemed to be happy secrets. She did not flinch away from Alice\u0027s cold arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did it mean? How much did she know? In that still-life moment from the future, what did she think of me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the other image, so much the same, yet now colored by horror. Alice and Bella, their arms still wrapped around each other in trusting friendship. But now there was no difference between those arms - both were white, smooth as marble, hard as steel. Bella\u0027s wide eyes were no longer chocolate. The irises were a shocking, vivid crimson. The secrets in them were unfathomable - acceptance or desolation? It was impossible to tell. Her face was cold and immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. I could not suppress the questions, similar, but different: What did it mean - how had this come about? And what did she think of me now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could answer that last one. If I forced her into this empty half-life through my weakness and selfishness, surely she would hate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was one more horrifying image - worse than any image I\u0027d ever held inside my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own eyes, deep crimson with human blood, the eyes of the monster. Bella\u0027s broken body in my arms, ashy white, drained, lifeless. It was so concrete, so clear. I couldn\u0027t stand to see this. Could not bear it. I tried to banish it from my mind, tried to see something else, anything else. Tried to see again the expression on her living face that had obstructed my view for the last chapter of my existence. All to no avail. Alice\u0027s bleak vision filled my head, and I writhed internally with the agony it caused. Meanwhile, the monster in me was overflowing with glee, jubilant at the likelihood of his success. It sickened me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could not be allowed. There had to be a way to circumvent the future. I would not let Alice\u0027s visions direct me. I could choose a different path. There was always a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had to be. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-5-midnight-sun-twilight-2/page-4.html","bookId":2027,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:00 PM"}
