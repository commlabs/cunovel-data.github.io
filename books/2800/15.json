Whether it’s supervised or unsupervised. And that makes me happy. Although I’m not a big fan of the sun (Irish, remember? I get sunburnt from fireworks), I like knowing I can see it when I want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo and I have been coming outside for our daily vitamin D for weeks now. She said it helps with training because vitamin D helps you absorb calcium, which the body needs for a number of reasons. She also informed me that ten percent of people in the US are vitamin D deficient, and that a huge portion of those are women, which means that a lot of those women are also calcium deficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo here I am, getting my ass some vitamin D.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hot afternoon sun blisters down to a mellow warmth as sunset approaches and I ask, “Have you ever been drunk before, Boo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking a choked sound through her nose, she utters, “Uh, yeah. A few times, actually. More than enough for my adolescence. My ma had a hard time controlling me when I was a teen.” She pauses a moment before she asks, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, I explain, “I was just curious. I never got to do any of that stuff and now I feel like I never had a complete childhood. I’m twenty three and I have a long list of ‘never have I ever’s. ” Scoffing at myself, I say, “That’s messed up. I’m upset about never having been drunk before. Who does that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo defends me immediately. “You do. Because you’re Delilah fucking Flynn, bad mamma-jamma and woman with a soul too old for her age. And if Delilah Flynn wants to get drunk, Delilah Flynn is gonna get drunk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy God! That was the best damn pep talk I’ve ever had!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat settles it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, I’m getting drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I step into the kitchen, the smell of frying bacon assaults my nostrils. Normally, the smell of such deliciousness would cause me to do a little jig where I stand, but today…it makes me want to barf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox stands at the stove wearing a black pair of cargo pants and a navy skin-tight tee with bare feet, his hair is still wet from this morning’s shower. When he turns to look at me, he bursts into laughter at the poor sight of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs so hard that my ears ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want him to tell me I told you so, so I walk over to the counter and sit as normally as possible, making out that nothing ails me. He smirks and speaks in loud tones. “I’d bet you’re hungry, princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight the urge to swallow hard and hold my breath from the smell of the bacon and eggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought bacon was meant to make everything better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox grins, “Mmmm. Bacon. I love bacon. Fried, greasy bacon. The fat melts to nothing. So crisp you can crunch it. Oh, and eggs. Let’s not forget how great eggs are. Packed full of protein. Fried in bacon grease. I just love to scoop out the gooey, slimy yolk.” He shudders at the word slimy. “I know some people don’t like it, but as far as I’m concerned, the slimier the better. Hell, I eat eggs raw.” He acts out cracking an egg on the counter. “Just crack and…” He lifts his imaginary egg above his open mouth. “…just drop that fucker in. Oozing, raw goodness. Feels a bit like eating a whole handful of boogers. I mean,” A cruel smile appears on his face. He leans forward and into my face, “imagine eating a whole handful of phlegm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, shit. I’m gonna ralph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolting out of the kitchen on shaking legs, I just make it to the bathroom before I gag and retch. I puke up next to nothing, just green, foul-smelling bile. My stomach is empty but I still gag. A cold sweat has broken out over my entire body and I shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit. This sucks so bad. Why the hell do people drink that shit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearing his throat at the door, I feel something cool on the back of my neck. It’s like immediate relief. My stomach calms. “Oh, thank you. I’m never drinking again. As in ever.” I say hoarsely. I rest my cheek on the toilet seat, unable to give a damn that someone probably took a shit on it this morning. Nothing matters more right now than giving my tired body a little breather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox squeezes the back of my neck and shakes it lightly. He says quietly, “Take some aspirin, and when you think you can eat, I’ll make you a nice bowl of oatmeal. It’ll settle you stomach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear him make his way back into the kitchen and I’m surprised. He didn’t gloat. He didn’t say I told you so. He was actually nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a dick!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did that on purpose. Now I can’t be mean to him or I’ll look like a jerk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter resting my head on my toilet bowl for a few more minutes, I stand on shaky legs and walk back up to our room. Lifting my arm, I take a whiff of myself and almost pass out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBody odor mixed with deodorant must make chloroform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStripping off last night’s clothes, I make my way over to the shower. For some reason, the hot water sluicing over my belly makes me want to vomit again. Quickly, I turn it off and let the icy cold water wash away the embarrassment and stupidity I feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m clean but still mortified. I can’t avoid facing him today, so dressing in black sweats and his loose grey tee that has ARMY written on it, I make my way back into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of bacon is no longer there. Nox sits at the table eating a bowl of oatmeal and fruit while reading the newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. He didn’t even eat the bacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is an ass. It was all for my benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou deserved it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I did. I’ll let him have that one. I slide into the seat across from him and he lowers the paper. Smiling a devilish grin, he asks a hushed, “Feeling better, princess?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot trusting myself to speak without throwing up, I cringe and nod. For a moment, he looks concerned. He frowns. “Not speaking to me or still feeling ill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI motion with my finger that it’s the last one and he relaxes. Walking past me over to the microwave, he says, “Nothing a little aspirin and oatmeal won’t fix.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprised at the nice gesture, I watch as he makes my breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick at it for a while. Halfway through it, my appetite returns with a vengeance and I wolf down the rest of it. I take the two aspirin he’s brought me and ask, “Where is everyone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox grins, “Working. Well, Rock is looking after Boo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately concerned, I demand a little too loudly, “What happened to Boo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles, “Shit. You don’t even remember.” Then he explains, “Well, you drank about five or six shots of tequila all on your own.” I cringe at the word tequila and cover my mouth. “Then you said it was no fun drinking alone and begged Boo to drink with you. She decided she would because she has the morning off. So you and Boo had yourselves a private party. Drinking, dancing on tables, and coming onto every single one of my men that was in the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp loudly, “No. No way! You’re lying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raises his eyebrows, pushes his phone towards me and dares me to take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrink into myself. “You recorded me, didn’t you?” He nods. “I made an ass of myself, didn’t I?” He nods again, his expression strangely soft. “Okay, I believe you. Delete the video…please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking his phone, he plays around with it for a while. “Sure you don’t wanna see the part where you told me I was cooler than the Hoff?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp again, disgusted at myself. “What? That’s ridiculous! I’m sorry, Nox, that was just mean.” Nox’s smile spreads wide. “No one’s cooler than David Hasselhoff! I mean, c’mon, it’s the Hoff!” Shaking my head, I widen my eyes to show him just how crazy that thought was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox blinks. Once, twice, then leans his head back and roars with laughter. And even though it hurts my ears and rattles my brain, I smile. That laugh…I think it could be described as fallen angel song. As well as panty wetting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRough, raw laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaying with my spoon in my empty bowl, I don’t dare look at him when I ask, “So I came onto all your guys?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox is suddenly quiet. I look up to find him glaring holes into my skull. He nods. “Yep. Don’t need that distraction with my men, Lily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeriously apologetic, I cringe once more. I think that makes forty-seven just this morning. “I’m sorry, Nox. Seems I get a bit friendly when I’m hammered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorts, “Friendly? You stuck your tongue into Matthew’s ear like you were licking a sucker!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face flushes crimson and I squeak, “You’re shitting me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head forlornly. “Nope. ’Fraid not, little one. Friendly? No. Frisky. Yeah. A whole lotta frisky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck my life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing my arms onto the table, I lower my head onto them and say a muffled, “What else did I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox chuckles. Something about that chuckle I don’t like. I know I’m not going to like what I hear. “Well, you- uh- you sort of kissed me. Twice.” He says quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my fu-. This just gets better and better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face flushes brighter than red and I lift my face. Nox wiggles his brows at me looking all too pleased with himself, and I can’t help but laugh at my own stupidity. “Well, that sucks. My first kiss and I can’t even remember it. Figures. Was I bad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox’s smile falls right off his face. He looks stunned. Leaning forward over the table, he stares at me wide-eyed. “Never been kissed? What do you mean never been kissed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh man. Me and my big mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to shake it off, I shrug. “No big deal. I didn’t exactly have a lot of opportunities to meet people, namely guys living under the lock and key of my father now, did I? Just one of those things. So I guess I sucked at it, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox frowns, leans back and away from me. He looks up as if in thought. “No. Not bad. A little sloppy. But I couldn’t really judge because I stopped you both times after a few seconds. And I was tempted to take a photo of you molesting me as blackmail material, but I didn’t…because I’m a gentleman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the gentleman part of his mini rant, I burst into laughter and it hurts my entire dehydrated and hungover body. “You are so not a gentleman, Nox! Whatever made you think that? You’re like anti-gentleman. You’re rough and scary and downright mean sometimes. You’re jaggedman not gentleman!” I guffaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowls at me but doesn’t say a thing. Immediately, I feel like an ass and try to soften the blow that I didn’t expect would strike him. “Look, it’s probably just because of the job you do. I’m sure you can be a gentleman if you tried, Nox. Really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone stumbles into the kitchen. We both look over at Boo who looks worse than I did this morning. Nox opens his mouth to say something, but she cuts him off with a swipe of her hand. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo glares at me. “God, you suck. Remind me never to drink with you again. You’re like a freakin’ bottomless pit. You just kept guzzling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. “I’m Irish.” I say that as if that should explain my drinking ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo cringes and hisses, “Ssshhhhhh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle quietly. I hadn’t even spoken loudly. Nox grins at her. “You better get your shit together today, Boo. I won’t let you sleep in tomorrow. You’re lucky I let Rock look after you today. He should be on ground patrol.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo snorts. “Look after me? The ass is asleep, Nox. Didn’t lift a finger when I rushed myself to the bathroom to throw up, just snored and turned over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox scowls, “That fucker. He’s pulling a double this afternoon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo grins in victory. I love the relationship she and Rock have. It’s unlike any relationship I’ve seen or read about. It’s almost like they’re in constant competition with each other but never drastically, only playfully. It’s a sweet rivalry. I smile wistfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey must have a lot of fun together. Lucky them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll be lucky if I ever get a boyfriend. Knowing my luck, it’ll never happen. I’ll be the old, plump, spinster that knits covers for everything I own. Throw in a few cats for companionship and that will be my life. I mean, I can’t even remember my first kiss and it only happened last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox and Boo chat while she pours herself a cup of Joe. Unintentionally, I find myself looking over at Nox’s full lips and my brain wanders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would they have felt like? Rough or soft? Maybe he uses chap-stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fight the urge to scoff out loud. Nox does not use freakin’ chap-stick, brain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, scratch the chap-stick. Did he kiss me back? Would his kisses have been sweet and gentle, or demanding and possessive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly shit, I’m making myself antsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he did say he stopped you after a few seconds. Why didn’t he stop you immediately?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell…because…that…that is actually a good point. Why didn’t he stop me immediately?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he wanted you to lay one on him, of course!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way, brain. You’re crazy. Which means I’m crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I am having a conversation with my brain. I’ve officially lost it. Bravo, Nox. You win. I need to stop reading erotic romance. It obviously fills my head with sexual thoughts…all the freakin’ time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lily?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and look up to see Nox and Boo both staring at me and looking concerned. “How long was I out of it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoo grins. “A while. Been callin’ you for a solid minute, hon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNox’s lip twitches and I glare at him as if this is all his fault. I tell him pointedly. “I am never drinking again,” then throw my head down on the table with a bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour knife. My back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been weeks since I slept in my own bed, but every day I stop in at my old room to get a change of clothes. And today is no exception. Walking into my room, I stop dead in my tracks when I see a small white box on my bed. It’s pretty damn small, so I’m ninety-nine percent sure it’s not a bomb. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/willing-captive/page-15.html","bookId":2800,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:06 PM"}
