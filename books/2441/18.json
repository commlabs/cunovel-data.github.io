Kurda led me to the back of one, where we moved aside a couple of large sacks, revealing a small hole in the wall. Kurda began to squeeze through, but I pulled him back and asked if we could rest for a couple of minutes - I was in a lot of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be able to continue?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but only if we stop for regular breaks. I know time is precious, but I\u0027m too exhausted to keep going without resting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I felt ready, I followed Kurda through the hole and found myself in a cramped tunnel that dropped sharply. I suggested we slide to the bottom, but Kurda rejected the idea. \"We\u0027re not going all the way down,\" he said. \"There\u0027s a shelf halfway down this hole that leads to another tunnel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, after several minutes we came to a ledge, left the hole, and were soon back on level ground. \"How did you find this place?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I followed a bat,\" he said, and winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe came to a fork, and Kurda stopped to get out a map. He studied it silently for a few seconds, then took the turn to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you know where you\u0027re going?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not entirely.\" He laughed. \"That\u0027s why I brought my maps. I haven\u0027t been down some of these tunnels in decades.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried keeping track of the route we were taking, in case anything happened to Kurda, and I had to find my way back on my own, but it was impossible. We twisted and turned so many times, only a genius could have memorized the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe passed over a couple of small streams. Kurda told me that they joined up with others farther ahead, to form the wide stream that had been used for burying the dead in the past. \"We could always swim to safety,\" I suggested jokingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not flap our arms and fly away while we\u0027re at it?\" Kurda replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the tunnels were pitch black, but Kurda didn\u0027t light any candles - he said the wax droppings would mark our trail and make it easy for pursuing vampires to track us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe farther we progressed, the harder it became for me to keep up, and we had to stop often so I could catch my breath and work up the energy to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d carry you if there was room,\" Kurda said during one of our rest periods, wiping sweat and blood from my neck and shoulders with his shirt. \"We\u0027ll be entering larger tunnels shortly. I can give you a boost then if you\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d be great,\" I wheezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about when we get out of the tunnels?\" he asked. \"Do you want me to come with you some of the way, to make sure you\u0027re OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"You\u0027d be discovered by the Generals if you did. I\u0027ll be fine once I get outside. The fresh air will perk me up. I\u0027ll find somewhere to sleep, rest for a few hours, then -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped. Loose pebbles had clattered to the floor in one of the tunnels behind us. Kurda heard them too. He ran to the mouth of the tunnel and squatted by the opening, listening intently. After a few seconds, he raced back to my side. \"Someone\u0027s coming!\" he hissed, dragging me to my feet. \"Hurry! We must get out of here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I sighed, sitting down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren!\" he screeched softly. \"You can\u0027t stay. We\u0027ve got to make a break for it before -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" I told him. \"Shuffling was hard enough - there\u0027s no way I can take part in a full-speed chase. If we\u0027ve been found, that\u0027s the end. Go on ahead and hide. I\u0027ll pretend I acted alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I wouldn\u0027t leave you,\" he said, squatting beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe waited in silence as the footsteps came closer. By the sound, there was only one person following us. I hoped it wasn\u0027t Mr. Crepsley - I dreaded the thought of facing him after what I\u0027d done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tracking vampire reached the mouth of the tunnel, studied us from the shadows a moment, then ducked forward and hurried over. It was Gavner Purl! \"You two are in so much trouble,\" he snarled. \"Whose dumb idea was it to run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine!\" Kurda and I said at the exact same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner shook his head, exasperated. \"You\u0027re as bad as each other,\" he snapped. \"Come on - the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was my idea,\" Kurda answered, squeezing my arm to silence my protestations. \"I persuaded Darren to come. The blame is mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an idiot,\" Gavner reprimanded him. \"This will destroy you if word gets out. You won\u0027t just have to forget about becoming a Vampire Prince - chances are you\u0027ll be carted off to the Hall of Death to suffer the same fate as Darren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if you tell on me,\" Kurda said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I won\u0027t?\" Gavner challenged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it was your intention to punish us, you wouldn\u0027t have come alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner stared at the senior vampire, then cursed shortly. \"You\u0027re right,\" he groaned. \"I don\u0027t want to see you killed. If the two of you come back with me, I\u0027ll keep your name out of it. In fact, nobody ever need know it happened. Harkat and I are the only ones who know at the moment. We can get Darren back before judgment is passed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Kurda asked. \"So he can be taken to the Hall of Death and impaled?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s the judgment of the Princes - yes,\" Gavner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda shook his head. \"That\u0027s what we\u0027re escaping from. I won\u0027t let him go back to be killed. It\u0027s wrong to take a boy\u0027s life in such a heartless fashion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong or right,\" Gavner snapped, \"the judgment of the Princes is final!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda narrowed his eyes. \"You agree with me,\" he whispered. \"You think his life should be spared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner nodded reluctantly. \"But that\u0027s my own opinion. I\u0027m not going to ignore the ruling of the Princes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Kurda asked. \"Do we have to obey them even when they\u0027re wrong, even when they rule unjustly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s our way,\" Gavner growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ways can be changed,\" Kurda insisted. \"The Princes are too inflexible. They ignore the fact that the world is moving forward. In a few weeks, I\u0027ll be a Prince. I can change things. Let Darren go, and I\u0027ll get the ruling against him overturned. I\u0027ll clear his name and allow him to return and complete his Trials. Turn a blind eye just this once and I swear you won\u0027t regret it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner was troubled by Kurda\u0027s words. \"It\u0027s wrong to plot against the Princes,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody will know,\" Kurda promised. \"They\u0027ll think Darren got away by himself. We\u0027ll never be investigated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It goes against everything we believe in,\" Gavner sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes we have to abandon old beliefs in favor of new ones,\" Kurda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Gavner agonized over his decision, I spoke up. \"I\u0027ll go back if you want me to. I\u0027m afraid of dying, which is why I let Kurda talk me into fleeing. But if you say I should return, I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to die,\" Gavner cried. \"But running away never solved anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense!\" Kurda snorted. \"Vampires would be a lot better off if more of us had the good sense to run from a fight when the odds are stacked against us. If we take Darren back, we take him back to die. Where\u0027s the sense in that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner thought it over in silence, then nodded morosely. \"I don\u0027t like it, but it\u0027s the lesser of two evils. I won\u0027t turn you in. But,\" he added, \"only if you agree to present the truth to the others once you become a Prince. We\u0027ll come clean, clear Darren\u0027s name if we can, accept our punishment if we can\u0027t. OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine by me,\" Kurda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your word on it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda nodded. \"My word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner let out a long breath and studied me in the gloom of the tunnel. \"How are you anyway?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so bad,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like you\u0027re about to drop,\" he noted skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make it,\" I vowed. Then I asked how he\u0027d found us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went looking for Kurda,\" he explained. \"I was hoping we could put our heads together and figure a way out of this mess. His map cabinet was open. I didn\u0027t think anything of it at the time, but when I dropped by your cell and found Harkat there by himself, I put two and two together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you track us through the tunnels?\" Kurda asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner pointed to a drop of blood on the floor beneath me. \"He\u0027s been dripping the whole way,\" he said. \"He\u0027s left a trail even a fool could follow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda closed his eyes and grimaced. \"Charna\u0027s guts! Espionage never was my strong suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right!\" Gavner snorted. \"If we\u0027re going to pull this off, we\u0027d better move quickly. As soon as Darren\u0027s discovered missing, there\u0027ll be a team of trackers on his trail, and it won\u0027t take them long to find him. Our only chance is to get him outside and hope the sun prevents them from continuing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My thoughts exactly,\" Kurda said, and started ahead. I followed as well as I could, Gavner puffing along behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the tunnel, Kurda turned left. I headed after him, but Gavner grabbed my arm and stopped me, then studied the tunnel to his right. When Kurda realized we weren\u0027t at his heels, he paused and looked back. \"What\u0027s the delay?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been in this part of the mountain before,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner said. \"It was during my Trials of Initiation. I had to find a hidden jewel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can find the way out,\" Gavner said. \"I know the path to the nearest exit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I,\" Kurda said, \"and it\u0027s this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner shook his head. \"We can get out that way,\" he agreed, \"but it\u0027ll be quicker if we take this other tunnel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Kurda snapped. \"This was my idea. I\u0027m in charge. We don\u0027t have time to go wandering around. If you\u0027re wrong, it\u0027ll cost us. My way is certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So\u0027s mine,\" Gavner insisted, and before Kurda could object, he ducked down the tunnel to the right, dragging me along after him. Kurda cursed loudly and called us back, but when Gavner ignored him, he had no choice other than to hurry after us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is stupid,\" Kurda panted when he caught up. He tried to squeeze past me to deal with Gavner face-to-face, but the tunnel was too narrow. \"We should stick to the route on the maps. I know more about these tunnels than you. There\u0027s nothing the way you\u0027re going except dead ends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Gavner contradicted him. \"We can save almost forty minutes this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if -,\" Kurda began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop arguing,\" Gavner interrupted. \"The more we talk, the slower we progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda muttered something, but said no more about it. I could tell he wasn\u0027t happy though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe passed through a small tunnel that cut beneath a roaring mountain stream. The water sounded so close, I was afraid it might break through the walls of the tunnel and flood us. I couldn\u0027t hear anything over the noise of the stream, and it was so dark, I couldn\u0027t see anything either. It felt as if I was all alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was delighted to finally see light at the end, and hurried towards it as fast as I could. Gavner and Kurda also moved quickly, so they must have been anxious to escape the tunnel too. As we brushed the dirt from the tunnel off ourselves, Kurda moved ahead and took the lead. We were in a small cave. There were three tunnels leading out of it. Kurda went to the tunnel on the far left. \"We\u0027re taking this one,\" he said, re-exerting his authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner grinned. \"That\u0027s the one I planned to take anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then hurry up,\" Kurda snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" Gavner asked. \"You\u0027re acting oddly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not!\" Kurda glared, then smiled weakly. \"Sorry. It\u0027s that tunnel under the stream. I knew we\u0027d have to pass through it. That\u0027s why I wanted to go the other way - to avoid it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid the water would break through?\" Gavner laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Kurda answered stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was afraid too,\" I said. \"I wouldn\u0027t like to crawl through a place like that too often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cowards.\" Gavner chuckled. He started towards Kurda, smiling, then stopped and turned his head sideways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I heard something,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounded like someone coughing. It came from the tunnel to the right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A search party?\" I asked worriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavner frowned. \"I doubt it - they\u0027d be coming from behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Kurda asked impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavner thinks he heard something,\" I said as the General crept across to explore the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just the sound of the stream,\" Kurda said. \"We don\u0027t have time to -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was too late. Gavner had already entered the tunnel. Kurda hurried over to where I was standing and peered into the darkness of the tunnel after Gavner. \"We\u0027d be better off on our own,\" he grumbled. \"He\u0027s done nothing but slow us down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if somebody\u0027s in there?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nobody down here besides us,\" Kurda snorted. \"We should head on without that fool and leave him to catch up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, \"I\u0027d rather wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurda rolled his eyes but stood sullenly beside me. Gavner was gone no more than a couple of minutes, but when he returned he looked years older. His legs were shaking, and he sank to his bottom as soon as he emerged from the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head wordlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You found something?\" Kurda asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s...\" Gavner cleared his throat. \"Go look,\" he whispered. \"But be careful. Don\u0027t be seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seen by who?\" I asked, but he didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, I crept along the tunnel, Kurda right behind me. It was short, and as I approached the end, I noticed the flicker of torches in a large cave beyond. I dropped to my stomach, then edged forward so that I had a clear view of the cave. What I saw froze my guts inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty or thirty people were lounging around. Some were sitting, some lying on mats, some playing cards. They had the general appearance of vampires - bulky, rough features, crude haircuts. But I could see their purplish skin and reddish hair and eyes, and I identified them immediately - our blood foes, the vampaneze! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trials-of-death-the-saga-of-darren-shan-5/page-18.html","bookId":2441,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:40 PM"}
