But he failed to see him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Whom are you looking for?\" asked Edward Stripling, the telephone boy, who occupied one corner of the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Wood.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps you are the one he wanted to see. He told me to tell any one inquiring that he would be back in fifteen minutes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then we shan\u0027t have to wait long, Mr. Babcock.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The inventor took up a paper from the table, but he was so nervous that he could not concentrate his attention upon it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ten minutes later Justin Wood entered the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am glad to see you, Scott,\" was his cordial greeting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 194]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, Mr. Wood. I come on business. Let me introduce Mr. Babcock.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Glad to see you, Mr. Babcock,\" said Wood, courteously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Could we go up to your room? We won\u0027t keep you long.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly. Follow me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Wood had a front room on the third floor a pleasant apartment, for which he paid a high rent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Mr. Wood,\" began Scott, \"I am going to ask your attention for ten minutes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will give you fifteen, if necessary,\" said Wood, smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thereupon Scott told the story of the inventor, to which Justin Wood listened attentively.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you a model of your invention?\" he asked, turning to Babcock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here it is, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young man asked various questions, which Babcock answered satisfactorily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think well of your invention,\" said Mr. Wood, in conclusion. \"Now, what do you want me to do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scott answered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Babcock has exhausted all his means and[Pg 195] is penniless,\" he said. \"The invention is perfected, but he is not in a position to put it before the public. He has, to be sure, received offers of assistance from a gentleman whom we both know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To whom do you refer?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ezra Little.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Indeed! Is that liberal gentleman willing to help him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He offers me thirty-five dollars for the invention,\" said Babcock, bitterly. \"I have spent a whole year in perfecting it, and this is to be my compensation.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think you had better not trouble Mr. Little,\" observed Justin, quietly. \"How much money do you need to put it before the public?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If I had one hundred and fifty dollars,\" said the inventor, hesitatingly, \"I think I could manage. I would be willing to sell a one-half interest for that sum.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That would not be enough,\" said Wood, decidedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"With it I\u0027d stand some chance of success.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will tell you what I will do. I will give you five hundred dollars for one-third interest, on condition that you work zealously to make it a success.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 196]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, sir, you are too generous,\" said Babcock, with emotion. \"With that money I see my way clear.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What would be your plan?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can make arrangements with a responsible party to manufacture it, and will myself travel and put it before the public.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will risk it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sure, sir, that you will get your money back several times over.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope so. I am not buying it for myself, but for a friend of mine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scott looked at him inquiringly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The friend is Scott Walton,\" he said, smiling. \"Should it pay, I shall deduct the five hundred dollars from the first money received in the way of profit, and then make over the whole investment to you, Scott. I hope it may make you rich.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How can I thank you, Mr. Wood?\" said Scott, gratefully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wait till you see whether you have anything to be grateful for.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is no doubt about that,\" said the inventor, confidently. \"You will excuse me for saying, Mr. Wood, that I shall work even harder for my young friend Walton than I would for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 197]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is just what I wish. I am already rich, while Scott has his fortune yet to make.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will help him to make it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come around to-morrow, Mr. Babcock, at ten o\u0027clock, and I will have the money ready. We will also have papers regularly drawn up, so that Scott\u0027s share of the investment may be secured to him. And now, I shall have to bid you good-evening, as I have an engagement with a friend at the union League Club.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two went out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The inventor was fairly radiant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Walton,\" he said, \"you don\u0027t know what you have done for me. You have given me a new lease of life. When I came to your room to-night I was in a mood that might have led me to throw myself from the Brooklyn Bridge. Mr. Little\u0027s cold-blooded letter had much to do with bringing on that mood. I felt that there was no hope for me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now I have hope—and confidence. I have a presentiment of success. I shall make myself rich and you also.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope your presentiment will prove prophetic,\" said Scott, smiling. \"I can assure you that[Pg 198] a fortune will be welcome. At present I have only accumulated one hundred dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is not bad for a young man of your age.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say a boy. I am not ashamed of being a boy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Remember I am speaking of my partner. I must speak of him with respect.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did I tell you I was going to leave the city for a time?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. Why is it? You have not lost your place, I hope.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I am going to travel for the firm. If I am lucky I shall soon earn an excellent income.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are sure to do that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How can you tell that I will succeed?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was not referring to your regular position. I was thinking of your interest in my invention.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are confident, then, of success?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am quite confident of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope you are right; mostly, however, on your account, for I think my future is tolerably secure.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see you have no idea of the value of your interest in my enterprise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I shall not think seriously of it, but I will welcome any good that may come to me from it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 199]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My life will be changed,\" said Babcock. \"I shall at once send for my little Molly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that your little daughter?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is she now?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In the country. Now, I shall feel justified in bringing her to the city. She is a sweet little girl.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am sure you will be happier for having her with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, you may well say that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"By the way, have you answered Ezra Little\u0027s letter?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; I shall answer it in person to-morrow, after I have concluded arrangements with your friend.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e About two o\u0027clock the next day, the inventor took his way to Ezra Little\u0027s dry-goods store on Eighth Avenue. He sent in his name and was admitted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was a welcome visitor, for Mr. Little, who was a practical man, had a fair conception of the value of his invention, and meant to make a fortune out of it—for himself. As for the poor inventor, he cared little for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Henry Babcock entered the merchant\u0027s presence, and was bidden to take a seat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 200]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I received a letter from you, Mr. Little,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. I offered you thirty-five dollars for your invention.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That seems to me very small.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Probably it is more than I shall make out of it, but you seemed to be in need, and I am willing to help you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you think, however, you could let me have more? Thirty-five dollars would not support me a month.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It would give you time to look for a place, Mr. Babcock.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But, Mr. Little, think of the time I have spent—and the money!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That does not concern me,\" said the merchant, coldly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I shall have to decline your offer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is foolish. However, I will strain a point, and give you fifty dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Henry Babcock shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Little,\" he said, triumphantly, \"I have sold a one-third interest in my invention for five hundred dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ezra Little looked amazed and disappointed. It was a chance of his life lost.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 201]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What fool gave you that sum?\" he asked, roughly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A Mr. Wood, to whom your cousin, Scott Walton, introduced me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me that at first?\" snarled Ezra Little. \"Wood must have been a fool to be influenced by that boy.
