It was scalding, burning. She could feel her skin turn red, then black, could smell the smoke rising from her frying flesh. This was nothing like the attack at the Repository. She would not survive this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss tore through the miasma of sleep, forced herself to wake up. Wake up! Wake up! It was like being suffocated and torn apart at the same time. But she salvaged what power she had, and gathered all of her effort, all of her strength, and successfully pushed the pain away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a crash and a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked awake and sat up on the couch. She had taken a nap in their suite after coming back from the beach. She was still trying to make sense of what had happened when the door flew open and her parents appeared in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark she saw Jordan lying in a crumpled heap on the floor, holding something bright and glittering in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer parents assessed the situation quickly, almost professionally, as if they had been expecting something like this to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quick, BobiAnne, she\u0027s still stunned. Set the spell,\" Forsyth said as he began to bundle up his younger daughter with the hotel\u0027s comforter and blankets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on? What are you guys doing?\" Bliss asked groggily. Things were happening much too fast for her understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Forsyth said, removing a small blade from Jordan\u0027s hand and tossing it to his wife. \"She picked the vault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss tried to make sense of everything, but logical thinking eluded her in her dizzy and disoriented state. Was she going insane, or did Jordan just try to kill her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flinched as her stepmother put a hand on her brow. \"She\u0027s warm,\" she told her husband. Then she lifted Bliss\u0027s shirt and examined her chest. \"But I think she\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForsyth nodded, kneeling to rip Bliss\u0027s sheets into strips so that he could tie the comforter holding Jordan closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking the pain had come from the emerald stone, Bliss looked down at her chest. It felt as if the stone had burned itself on her skin, branding her. But when she touched it, it was as cool as ever. Her skin underneath was smooth and unharmed. Then she understood. The emerald had saved her from whatever weapon had just tried to pierce her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine,\" BobiAnne announced after checking Bliss\u0027s pupils and pulse. \"Good girl. You gave us quite a scare,\" she said, tapping her pockets for her Marlboro Lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobiAnne lit a cigarette and sucked on it deeply until it formed a long column of ash. Bliss noticed that her stepmother\u0027s face was perfectly made up for a party, and both her parents were dressed in formal dinner clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on? Why did Jordan attack me?\" Bliss asked, finally finding her voice and turning to face her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a few minutes for him to answer. Forsyth Llwellyn\u0027s reputation in the Senate was as of a moderate facilitator, someone who was willing to negotiate with the other side, to bring consensus to warring parties. His smooth Texan charm came in handy during partisan battles in the legislature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss could see he was turning this charm on her now. \"Sweetie, you have to realize that Jordan is different from us,\" Forsyth said, securing the bundle that held his younger daughter. \"She\u0027s not one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of us? What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll understand in time,\" he assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were forced to take her. We had no choice!\" BobiAnne burst out, a bitterness creeping into her voice. \"Cordelia Van Alen made us. That meddlesome old witch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jordan is not of this family,\" Bliss\u0027s father added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" she cried. It was getting to be too much. All these secrets and lies, she was sick of it. She was sick of being kept in the dark about everything. \"I know all about Allegra!\" she declared suddenly, with a look of defiance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobiAnne gave her husband a look that said, \"I told you so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what about Allegra?\" Forsyth inquired, a look of innocence on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found this ...\" Bliss reached into her pocket and showed them the photograph with the inscription, which she kept close by at all times. \"You lied to me. You told me my mother\u0027s name was Charlotte Potter. But there never was a Charlotte Potter, was there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForsyth hesitated. \"No - but it\u0027s not what you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s complicated,\" he sighed. His eyes wandered over to the panoramic view of the beach, not wanting to meet her gaze. \"One day when you\u0027re ready, I will tell you. But not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was maddening. Her father was doing it again: sidestepping her questions, stonewalling her. Shielding her from the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Jordan?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. She won\u0027t hurt you again,\" Forsyth said soothingly. \"We\u0027re going to send her someplace safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sending her to Transitions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that,\" her father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bliss, honey, she\u0027ll be better off,\" BobiAnne said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But ...\" Bliss was completely confused. Her parents were talking about Jordan as if she were a dog being sent off to the country. They talked about her like she didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Bliss had to admit to herself that the strange family dynamics weren\u0027t entirely new. She thought about how BobiAnne never spoke lovingly of Jordan, had always made it clear that she preferred Bliss, who wasn\u0027t even her real child. How her father had always kept an arm\u0027s-length distance from his odd younger daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bliss was younger she\u0027d relished her parents\u0027 indifference to her younger sister. Now she realized it was pathological.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer parents hated Jordan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey always had. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-35.html","bookId":2121,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM"}
