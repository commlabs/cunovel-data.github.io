It’s the way she deserves to be kissed… it’s everything she is. Sweet, with just a hint of wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no ugliness here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne Month Later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother’s excited voice echoes into my ear loudly, and I hold the phone just a little bit away from my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elijah Gabriel Vincent. He’s eight pounds and three ounces and he’s beautiful, Jacey. He’s so fucking beautiful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and congratulate my big brother, so happy to hear him so happy. There was a time when I didn’t think I’d see the day. But here it is. And he so deserves it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brand just happened to be here for a meeting when Maddy’s water broke. You should’ve seen his face,” Gabe crows. “Oh my god. It was priceless. I thought he might pass out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. “I can imagine. Please tell him hello for me. I miss him. I haven’t seen him in a few weeks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe sobers up. “You can tell him yourself. He’s right here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can say anything, Gabe hands the phone to Brand and Brand sighs into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Jacey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart squeezes. I hurt him. I hurt the most amazingly gentle badass on the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Brand,” I say brightly, forcing enthusiasm. “How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’ve now seen amniotic fluid on the floor. I can cross that off my bucket list. And after hearing Maddy scream during labor, I don’t know how you women do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can practically see him shudder and I smile, imagining that he sat right outside of her delivery room, waiting to hear that everything was all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um. I’m sorry, Brand. For everything,” I say tentatively. Sorry is all I can think of to say. It’s what I feel… I just don’t know how to express it to him enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay. Don’t think anything else about it. This is my issue, not yours. I’ll get past it and things will be like they were, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounds tired and sad and I hate it. But I know him and I know he doesn’t want to dwell on it. So I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. I want you to know that I love you. Not like you want me to love you, but I still love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I’ll talk to you later, Jace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hands the phone back to my brother, leaving my heart clenched in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s going to be okay, Jacey,” my brother tells me quietly. “Just so you know. So don’t worry about him. I think he always knew that you and he weren’t meant to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “I know. But it still hurts me that I hurt him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s fine,” Gabe insists. “Maddy’s gonna work on setting him up with some of her friends. Trust me, he’ll be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure he will be,” I agree. “He’s strong. He’s survived far worse things than me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got that right, kiddo. When are you coming to see your nephew? How’s the new job? What are they calling their new restaurant chain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think back to the day a couple of weeks ago when Dom, Duncan, and Sin argued over a name for the new restaurant chain that they’re launching together. They’d bickered for hours until I chimed into the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about The Dirty Dog? Because that’s what you three are. Dirty fucking dogs. Perverted as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d stared at me in shock, then had a toast to the name, because they knew that it fit them like a glove. And then Sin had asked me to come work for them on their business development team, since I have “restaurant experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I’ll have my business degree finished up in a couple of weeks, it made sense, so I accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s The Dirty Dog. We’re going to sell seafood and craft beer. I’ve actually already started part-time, since I quit Saffron, but I’ll be starting full time in a couple of weeks when I officially finish my business degree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so proud of you, Jacey,” Gabriel tells me happily. “You’ve really pulled your shit together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” I answer. “I’m just sorry that I gave you so much trouble along the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all right,” he replies with a chuckle. “Like Brand, I’ve been through far worse than you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. “Okay. I’ve gotta go. I’ll try to get up there in a couple of weeks. Give that baby a kiss for me and send me pics, okay? And tell Maddy that I love her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel agrees and we hang up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ready, babe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to find Dominic lounging in the doorway. Like always, he takes my breath away. He’s just that sexy. He’s wearing dark slacks and a dark shirt today, dressed up to go to the ribbon-cutting of the newly renovated Joe’s Gladiators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. I’m ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leads me through my little house to his car, where he opens the door for me. When he gets in, I glance at my home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to miss this little place, Dom. Are you sure you want to buy a fancy condo for when we’re here in Chicago? We could just stay here. It wouldn’t be a big deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDom glances at it. “Um. There’s no garage for my car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. “Whatever. Fine. We can get a fancy condo. You’re spoiled, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe throws his head back and laughs. “Really? Coming from the woman who just bought four new sets of sheets for absolutely no reason?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t judge. Good sheets are essential.” I stick my nose in the air and he leans over to kiss me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all right, babe,” he adds. “I want to spoil you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pull up to Joe’s a few minutes later, and I barely recognize the place. The building has been completely renovated, inside and out. A state-of-the-art gym with all new equipment and offices, an after-school meal program, and even a running track out back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’ve been waiting on us to arrive, so when we approach they hand Dominic the giant scissors to snip the red velvet ribbon across the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On behalf of the Emma Brandt Foundation, we are pleased to present you with the reopening of Joe’s Gladiator’s!” Dominic announces. Flashbulbs pop, and for once Dom isn’t bothered by his picture being taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes Joe’s hand, and Joe looks pleased as he can be by the big turnout. I know that in large part, the press showed up because of Dominic, but regardless. They’re here, and any attention we can get for the underprivileged kids is worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did your foundation choose this particular project, Dominic?” one of the reporters calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic smiles. Jake waves to the cameras off to the side and everyone laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We chose this project because there was a need. There are good kids here, and all they need is a chance. Sometimes, bad things happen, unfair things… and all we can do is handle it the best we can. Most of the time, with a little help, we come through it just fine. A smart person once told me, ‘Before we fall, we fly.’ We just wanted to help these kids fly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone applauds, and I’m so proud of Dominic I could burst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe head into the reception where we chat with the boys, eat, and drink punch. I’m utterly filled with happiness when we finally walk out to our car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure you don’t mind that we named the foundation after Emma?” Dom asks as we climb inside. I stare at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know me better than that. I think it was the only thing to do. She never had a chance to live her dream. We’ve got to give other kids the chance to live theirs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic fires the engine up, then turns to me. “You know what I love? How you always say we. You never say I. Or you. It’s always we.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. “That’s how I think. In my head, we’re a team. We’re always going to be we, Dom. Get used to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses me, long and thoroughly. When he pulls away, I’m breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a surprise for you,” he announces. “You’re going to love it. I hope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I love surprises,” I tell him, even though he knows that already. “Don’t give me any hints. I want to be really surprised.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to admit, I’m completely stumped as we drive toward the country, out of the city. But then we approach Palos Park, his childhood home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to Castle Kinkaide?” I ask in confusion. He smirks, but doesn’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we pull up to his parents’ house, there’s a red, yellow, and black hot air balloon set up on their lawn. It’s huge and majestic as it billows against the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your chariot, my lady,” Dom bows low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes. “Lord. Is this what I’ve got to look forward to all during filming? I know you like to get into character, but you realize that you’re not really a knight, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDom’s been rehearsing for a sixteenth-century period movie, and it’s made life interesting, to say the least. I fully intend to see him in a suit of armor around the house soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. “Can you just go with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggle. “Fine. Yes, my squire. I’d love a ride in your fine chariot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Squire?” Dom’s the one rolling his eyes now. “Try sir. I’m a knight, Jace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he takes my hand and helps me into the balloon, introducing me to the pilot. Within minutes, we’re floating up and above Palos Park, above Chicago. The city is amazing from up here, with the evening sun reflecting off all of the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s breathtaking.” I breathe, looking down. “Thank you, Dom. But what’s the occasion?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic turns to me, his dark gaze serious. It’s a gaze that causes butterflies to flutter in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jacey, before I met you, I thought all I deserved was the darkness in life. The dark corners, the taboo, the unspeakable. But you’ve given me a new start. A fresh life. A new outlook. I don’t know what I did to deserve you, but I’ll be forever grateful that you saw potential in me. That you saw what no one else did. You looked past the asshole, past the actor, past the name. You saw me. I love you for that. I love you for always grounding me, always reminding me of what’s important. I love you for always being my breath of fresh air, the challenge to my question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pauses and my heart pounds in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he…? Is this…?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Dominic bends down, on one knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOHMYGOD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My lady,” he begins, in an exaggerated English accent, the one he’s been working on for a week. “I have but one question to ask of you. One favor that I wish for you to bestow, if but only you desire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him, laughter in my eyes and the utmost of happiness in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, good knight. Anything you wish to ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDom looks at me, his eyes smoldering, and he drops the accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you marry me? Yes or no?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holds out a ring, a gorgeous princess cut diamond, and I feel like swooning. It’s the most gorgeous thing I’ve ever seen, held by the sexiest man in the world. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/before-we-fall-beautifully-broken-3/page-48.html","bookId":2761,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:30 PM"}
