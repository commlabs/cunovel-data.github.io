I couldn\u0027t expect her to have faith in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, it stung to realize I held no one\u0027s trust. Nobody wanted me here. Except maybe Damien, and he had just left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for Edward to tell Jessie, again, to leave me alone. He\u0027d be doing so to protect his own interests, but that protection was the only nicety I got from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Will\u0027s voice drifted through the house. \"Forget about Zee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\" Jessie\u0027s sigh was heavy with regret. \"Killing your best friend, even when she is a wolf god, is something you don\u0027t put behind you in a few months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence descended, broken only by moist, smacking sounds. They were making out. Which meant...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward wasn\u0027t even here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slammed out the front door and sprinted across the street. The antiques shop was locked, no shit. So I hurried to the alley, then around the back, where a wooden staircase led to the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, I knocked. No one answered, though I could have sworn I heard a muffled sound from inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand tested the brass knob. Locked. Not much of a challenge for me. I turned it, hard, and something went crunch. I stepped into an empty apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s space consisted of a living area with a bed, kitchen table, and sink all in one room. Three doors were placed at intervals opposite the entrance. One led to a bathroom, the second held the furnace and an ironing board, the third held Nic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll tied up and nowhere to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled at me from behind a strip of gaff tape. Edward had bound his hands into the prayer position, making it impossible for Nic to open the door and escape the closet, even if he could walk with his feet anchored sole to sole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say to him?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMust have been something really annoying to warrant this treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic started talking, but with tape over his mouth, he was a little hard to understand. Leaning over, I ripped it free with a single yank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell. Shit. Damn! That hurt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One quick yank always works best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about we test that theory on your mouth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. Where\u0027s Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was going to call my boss. As if that\u0027ll change anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed to the window and gazed at the still and silent street. Edward hadn\u0027t been at the cabin; he wasn\u0027t here; his car remained below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure several buildings away caught my eye. Long and gaunt - that had to be him. He must have gone outside for better cell service. If I wanted to cut Nic loose, I\u0027d better do it quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found a knife in a drawer next to the sink and sawed at the bindings on Nic\u0027s hands. The knife was dull; this could take more time than I had. If I distracted him, I could rip the tape with my bare hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did he convince you to step into the closet and let him tie you up?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very funny. He said he wanted to talk to me, then rapped me on the head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Nic spoke, I severed the tape with one yank, then paused to peer into his eyes. Two injuries in such a short period couldn\u0027t be good. And if you added how I\u0027d knocked him into a wall when I first saw him again -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sick to your stomach?\" I demanded. \"Dizzy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just finish. There\u0027s no telling what he\u0027s got planned for me next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to argue, to say Edward wouldn\u0027t hurt him, but that wasn\u0027t true. Edward might do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mandenauer\u0027s flipped his lid,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is pretty much his usual lid.\" Glancing up,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught Nic\u0027s incredulous expression. \"I warned you. He\u0027s not a man you want to screw with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged and the binding around Nic\u0027s feet came apart with a sharp split. Before I could get up, he grabbed me by the shoulders and gave me a single, rough shake. \"We have to leave right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not kidding, Elise. He\u0027s nuts. What\u0027s with all the guns and ammo? And the other agents - don\u0027t they strike you as a little over the top? I feel like I\u0027ve stepped into a lost episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle did he know how close to the truth he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were they shooting at when we got here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lies came so damn easy, I didn\u0027t even have to think about them anymore before they fell out of my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember the new strain of rabies I was telling you about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The virus needs to be eradicated before it spreads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there were five agents with guns in the woods blasting infected wolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared him straight in the eye. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers tightened on my shoulders. \"I don\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed him. Maybe he\u0027d believe that, because it was the only real thing I could give. Not the truth about the J��ger-Suchers, Edward, the others, or even myself. But I could touch my lips to his, sweep my tongue inside, murmur, moan, and mean all of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me closer; I dropped the knife. I ended up in his lap, arms around his neck. So what if we were on the floor of an empty closet, in a rented room, in a town I\u0027d never heard of before yesterday?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were together again, and Nic was making me feel things I hadn\u0027t felt since the last time I\u0027d touched him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tasted tape on his lips, mint on his tongue. My fingers brushed the back of his neck, missing the longer length of his hair. I\u0027d always loved tangling my hands in the silky strands, but he\u0027d shorn them off and only a dark, short thatch remained. The difference in his hair brought back the difference in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuthlessly I shoved aside the memory, my fears. I needed this, needed him, as much as I needed Nic to stop asking the questions that could get both of us killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to pull away, but I nipped his lip and shifted in his lap, my rear end rolling over his erection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing his gasp, both pain and arousal, I coaxed his tongue into my mouth and suckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis palm lay against my stomach, and when I drew on his tongue, his fingers flexed. The muscles beneath my skin fluttered, and he traced them with his thumb, lower and lower, until his entire hand crept under the waistband of my sweatpants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wore no underwear, no bra - neither one had been available for purchase at the gas station. He stroked the underside of my breasts, the swell of my rear, his thumb rode the curve of my hip. I had to get closer, so I swung my leg over his and scooted in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis zipper bulged, and that couldn\u0027t be comfortable. He didn\u0027t seem to mind. I considered opening his pants and running my tongue along his length, but I gave up the idea when he arched and hard met soft so perfectly I couldn\u0027t put a stop to it even to have his heat in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYears had passed since I\u0027d been touched in any way but casual or violent. The only men I\u0027d seen besides Edward were other J��ger-Suchers and guards, who\u0027d been threatened with dire consequences should they look at me crosswise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and the demonic entities who wanted to fuck me for no other reason than that I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered at the memory of Billy, and Nic pulled me closer, murmuring nonsensical encouragement. He thought I was coming, and I was close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis palms slid under my T-shirt, across my back, then up to cup my breasts. The firm, solid length of him ground against me, and I tightened my thighs around his hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an effort to pull me nearer, he grabbed my waist, and his hand closed over the pocket that held the talisman. Trapped between me and him, the thing purred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm,\" Nick answered against my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have the heart to tell him the murmur of appreciation hadn\u0027t been mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin was warm; he smelled so alive. A vein pulsed and I captured his flesh between my teeth. Blood flowed beneath the surface, calling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis palm still covered the talisman, and when his fingers clenched, heat coursed between us like an electric current.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon erupted behind my closed eyelids - stark and potent, both agony and ecstasy. Cool silver in the midst of summer, warm and golden in the depths of winter. Power rushed through me. I believed I could do anything, save anyone, become...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic stiffened, pulsing as he whispered my name. The sound, the sensation brought me around. What the hell had happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes. Nic stared back, nothing but curiosity in his. I couldn\u0027t have done anything too weird, too wolfy, or he\u0027d be wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze was drawn to his pulse. I could still taste his skin, smell it, too. I wanted to bury my face in the curve of his neck and hold on to him forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you feel anything move?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t meant to voice the question, but when I did, Nic flexed his hips. \"Oh, yeah. You were moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face flushed. I dropped my hand to my pocket, but the plastic was just plastic again. No heat. Not a shimmy or a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I imagined everything? No. Nic had heard the talisman purr, just as I had. However, I didn\u0027t know what that meant. I needed to show the icon to Will and soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to stand; Nic tightened his hold. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe covered my fingers with his and I tensed, but nothing leaped but my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can attack me in a closet any day or night.\" Nic leaned forward and brushed his mouth against mine. \"But I\u0027m a big boy now. I\u0027d rather do this naked, in a bed, anywhere but here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue flicked out. The sensation was a lightning strike, bringing back all we\u0027d just shared, making me long for things we hadn\u0027t. I wanted Nic to use his no teeth on me, along with several other body parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoose bumps raced over my skin and I murmured, \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic lifted his head. \"Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to remember what he\u0027d asked, what I\u0027d agreed to. \"I meant... sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I tried to get off him. Again, he wouldn\u0027t let me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you can. You just don\u0027t want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I wanted to. More than I should. Which was what disturbed me. Certainly I was attracted to Nic, but I shouldn\u0027t have to fight the urge to tear off his clothes every time he touched me. Should I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one way to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nic,\" I breathed and hugged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, distracted, still aroused, and, let\u0027s face it, a guy, he dropped the questions to hug me back. I tossed the talisman into the corner and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tasted the same, sticky plus mint. His hands roved under my shirt, over my skin. Pressing my body closer, I opened my mind. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-12.html","bookId":2090,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM"}
