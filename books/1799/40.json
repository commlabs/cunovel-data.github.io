And to be honest, I thought I’d have to wait a long time for it. I love you so much, baby. I can’t wait to make you my wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs me by the waist and picks me up from the bed, not breaking our connection. He walks me down the hall to his office, around his desk, and sits in his big chair, all while keeping his cock in me, with me wrapped around his hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching over, he pulls out a black velvet box and hands it to me. There’s a receipt on top, and the date is circled. It’s from almost exactly a year ago today, and I look up at him in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since I first laid eyes on you, Josephine.” He pulls out the ring—an emerald-cut black diamond. “You’ve always been the only one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slides the ring onto my finger, and my lips fall on his, telling him what I can’t find the words to say. As he lays me back on the desk and makes love to me, I realize that he wanted me before he knew me. He took one look at me and knew I would be his best friend, his partner, his wife, and the mother of his children. He saw more in me in one glance than I’d seen in myself my whole life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddamn, I’m a lucky woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLAW\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen years later…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve told you three times, I’m not doing it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Josephine, I swear it’s an emergency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the phone click, and I know she hung up on me. I feel the smug smile on my face as I lean my ass against my cruiser and wait for her to show up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kids are with Paine and Penelope this weekend, and what better way to start off our time alone than with a little fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been together so long that I’m sure she knows my game, but that sassy hard-ass of hers likes to play hard to get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings between us have only gotten better over time, and I still can’t get enough of her. She’s the love of my life, and even though things get hectic, we still find time to remember why we fell in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t have to wait long before she pulls up in her Corvette. I bought her the classic for her thirtieth birthday, and she looks sexy as fuck in it. She steps out, and my eyes roam up and down her tight body. She’s got on a black tank top, tight jeans, and her work boots. Her black hair is in messy waves down her back, and she looks like a fucking sex goddess. She stomps over to me and crosses her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong with it?” She looks over my shoulder to see the hood of my cruiser up and raises an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t know. Damn thing won’t start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bites her lip to keep from smiling and elbows past me to check it out. It won’t take her long to see the battery cable disconnected, but the real fun will begin after I get the cuffs on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile as I turn and follow her, thinking this is going to be a hell of a weekend. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mechanic-breeding-2/page-40.html","bookId":1799,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:44 PM"}
