Bruenor shifted abruptly in his stone seat. \"Ye forgotten the treatment the Nesme dogs gave ye when first we passed through their land?\" he asked the drow. Drizzt shook his head, the notion actually bringing a smile to his face. \"Never,\" he replied, but his calm tones and expression revealed that, while he had not forgotten, he apparently had forgiven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at his ebon-skinned friend, so at peace and content, the huffy dwarf\u0027s rage was soon deflated. \"Ye think I should let them come to the wedding, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a king now,\" answered Drizzt, and he held out his hands as though that simple statement should explain everything. Bruenor\u0027s expression showed clearly that it did not, though, and so the equally stubborn dark elf promptly elaborated. \"Your responsibilities to your people lie in diplomacy/\u0027 Drizzt explained. \"Nesme will be a valuable trading partner and a worthwhile ally. Besides, we can forgive the soldiers of an oft-imperiled town for their reaction to the sight of a dark elf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah, ye\u0027re too soft-hearted, elf,\" Bruenor grumbled, \"and ye\u0027re taking me along with ye!\" He looked to the huge barbarian, obviously akin to Wulfgar, and nodded. \"Send out me welcome to Nesme, then, but I\u0027ll be needing a count o\u0027 them that\u0027s to attend!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barbarian cast an appreciative look at Drizzt, then bowed and was gone, though his departure did little to stop Bruenor\u0027s grumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hunnerd things to do, elf,\" the dwarf complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You try to make your daughter\u0027s wedding the grandest the land has ever seen,\" Drizzt remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I try,\" Bruenor agreed. \"She\u0027s deserving it, me Catti-brie. I\u0027ve tried to give her what I could all these years, but. . .\" Bruenor held his hands out, inviting a visual inspection of his stout body, a pointed reminder that he and Catti-brie were not even of the same race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt put a hand on his friend\u0027s strong shoulder. \"No human could have given her more,\" he assured Bruenor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf sniffled; Drizzt did well to hide his chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But a hunnerd damned things!\" Bruenor roared, his fit of sentimentality predictably short-lived. \"King\u0027s daughter has to get a proper wedding, I say, but I\u0027m not for getting much help in doing the damned thing right!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt knew the source of Bruenor\u0027s overblown frustration. The dwarf had expected Regis, a former guildmaster and undeniably skilled in etiquette, to help in planning the huge celebration. Soon after Regis had arrived in the halls, Bruenor had assured Drizzt that his troubles were over, that \"Rumblebelly\u0027ll see to what\u0027s needin\u0027 seein\u0027 to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, Regis had taken on many tasks, but hadn\u0027t performed as well as Bruenor had expected or demanded. Drizzt wasn\u0027t sure if this came from Regis\u0027s unexpected ineptitude or Bruenor\u0027s doting attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dwarf rushed in, then, and handed Bruenor twenty different scrolls of possible layouts for the great dining hall. Another dwarf came in on the first one\u0027s heels, bearing an armful of potential menus for the feast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor just sighed and looked helplessly to Drizzt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will get through this,\" the drow assured him. \"And Catti-brie will think it the grandest celebration ever given.\" Drizzt meant to go on, but his last statement gave him pause and a concerned expression crossed his brow that Bruenor did not miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re worried for the girl,\" the observant dwarf remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More for Wulfgar,\" Drizzt admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor chuckled. \"I got three masons at work to fixing the lad\u0027s walls,\" he said. \"Something put a mighty anger in the boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt only nodded. He had not revealed to anyone that he had been Wulfgar\u0027s target on that particular occasion, that Wulfgar probably would have killed him blindly if the barbarian had won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boy\u0027s just nervous,\" Bruenor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the drow nodded, though he wasn\u0027t certain he could bring himself to agree. Wulfgar was indeed nervous, but his behavior went beyond that excuse. Still, Drizzt had no better explanations, and since the incident in the room, Wulfgar had become friendly once more toward Drizzt, had seemed more his old self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll settle down once the day gets past,\" Bruenor went on, and it seemed to Drizzt that the dwarf was trying to convince himself more than anyone else. This, too, Drizzt understood, for Catti-brie, the orphaned human, was Bruenor\u0027s daughter in heart and soul. She was the one soft spot in Bruenor\u0027s rock-hard heart, the vulnerable chink in the king\u0027s armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWulfgar\u0027s erratic, domineering behavior had not escaped the wise dwarf, it seemed. But, while Wulfgar\u0027s attitude obviously bothered Bruenor, Drizzt did not believe the dwarf would do anything about it - not unless Catti-brie asked him for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Drizzt knew that Catti-brie, as proud and stubborn as her father, would not ask - not from Bruenor and not from Drizzt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where ye been hiding, ye little trickster?\" Drizzt heard Bruenor roar, and the dwarf\u0027s sheer volume startled Drizzt from his private contemplations. He looked over to see Regis entering the hall, the halfling looking thoroughly flustered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ate my first meal of the day!\" Regis shouted back, and he got a sour look on his cherubic face and put a hand on his grumbling tummy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No time for eating!\" Bruenor snapped back. \"We got a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hunnerd things to do,\" Regis finished, imitating the dwarf\u0027s rough accent and holding up his chubby hand in a desperate plea for Bruenor to back off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor stomped a heavy boot and stormed over to the pile of potential menus. \"Since ye\u0027re so set on thinking about food, . . .\" Bruenor began as he gathered up the parchments and heaved them, showering Regis. \"There\u0027ll be elves and humans aplenty at the feast,\" he explained as Regis scrambled to put the pile in order. \"Give \u0027em something their sensitive innards\u0027ll take!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis shot a pleading look at Drizzt, but when the drow only shrugged in reply, the halfling picked up the parchments and shuffled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d\u0027ve thought that one\u0027d be better at this wedding planning stuff,\" Bruenor remarked, loudly enough for the departing halfling to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And not so good at fighting goblins,\" Drizzt replied, remembering the halfling\u0027s remarkable efforts in the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor stroked his thick red beard and looked to the empty doorway through which Regis had just passed. \"Spent lots of time on the road beside the likes of us,\" the dwarf decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too much time,\" Drizzt added under his breath, too quietly for Bruenor to hear, for it was obvious to the drow that Bruenor, unlike Drizzt, thought the surprising revelations about their halfling friend a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short while later, when Drizzt, on an errand for Bruenor, neared the entrance to Cobble\u0027s chapel, he found that Bruenor was not the only one flustered by the hectic preparations for the upcoming wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for all the mithril in Bruenor\u0027s realm!\" he heard Catti-brie emphatically shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be reasonable,\" Cobble whined back at her. \"Yer father\u0027s not asking too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt entered the chapel to see Catti-brie standing atop a pedestal, hands resolutely on her slender hips, and Cobble down low before her, holding out a gem-studded apron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie regarded Drizzt and gave a curt shake of her head. \"They\u0027re wanting me to wear a smithy\u0027s apron!\" she cried. \"A damned smithy\u0027s apron on the day o\u0027 me wedding!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt prudently realized that this was not the time to smile. He walked solemnly to Cobble and took the apron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Battlehammer tradition,\" the cleric huffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any dwarf would be proud to wear the raiment,\" Drizzt agreed. \"Must I remind you, though, that Catti-brie is no dwarf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A symbol of subservience is what it is,\" the auburn-haired woman spouted. \"Dwarven females are expected to labor at the forge all the day. Not ever have I lifted a smithy\u0027s hammer, and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt calmed her with an outstretched hand and a plaintive look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s Bruenor\u0027s daughter,\" Cobble pointed out. \"She has a duty to please her father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" Drizzt, the consummate diplomat, agreed once more, \"but remember that she is not marrying a dwarf. Catti-brie has never worked the forge - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s symbolic,\" Cobble protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - and Wulfgar lifted the hammer only during his years of servitude to Bruenor, when he was given no choice,\" Drizzt finished without missing a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCobble looked to Catti-brie, then back to the apron, and sighed. \"We\u0027ll find a compromise,\" he conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt threw a wink Catti-brie\u0027s way and was surprised to realize that his efforts apparently had not brightened the young woman\u0027s mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have come from Bruenor,\" the drow ranger said to Cobble. \"He mentioned something about testing the holy water for the ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tasting,\" Cobble corrected, and he hopped all about, looking this way and that. \"Yes, yes, the mead,\" he said, obviously flustered. \"Bruenor\u0027s wanting to settle the mead issue this day.\" He looked up at Drizzt. \"We\u0027re thinking that the dark stuff will be too much for the soft-bellied group from Silverymoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCobble rushed about the large chapel, scooping buckets from the various fonts that lined the walls. Catti-brie offered Drizzt an incredulous shrug as he silently mouthed the words, \"Holy water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePriests of most religions prepared their blessed water with exotic oils; it should have come as no surprise to Drizzt, after many years beside rowdy Bruenor, that the dwarven clerics used hops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bruenor said you should bring a generous amount,\" Drizzt said to Cobble, instructions that were hardly necessary given that the excited cleric already had filled a small cart with flasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re done for the day,\" Cobble announced to Catti-brie. The dwarf ambled quickly to the door, his precious cargo bouncing along. \"But don\u0027t ye be thinking that ye\u0027ve had the last word in all of this!\" Catti-brie snarled again, but Cobble, rambling along at top speed, was too far gone to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt and Catti-brie sat side by side on the small pedestal in silence for some time. \"Is the apron so bad?\" the draw finally mustered the nerve to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie shook her head. \"Tis not the garment, but the meaning of the thing I\u0027m not liking,\" she explained. \"Me wedding\u0027s in two weeks. I\u0027m thinking that I\u0027ve seen me last adventure, me last fight, except for those I\u0027m doomed to face against me own husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blunt admission struck Drizzt profoundly and alleviated much of the weight of keeping his fears private.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goblins across Faerun will be glad to hear that,\" he said facetiously, trying to bring some levity to the young woman\u0027s dark mood. Catti-brie did manage a slight smile, but there remained a profound sadness in her blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You fought as well as any,\" Drizzt added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did ye not think I would?\" Catti-brie snapped at him, suddenly defensive, her tone as sharp as the edges of Drizzt\u0027s magical scimitars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you always so filled with anger?\" Drizzt retorted, and his accusing words calmed Catti-brie immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just scared, I\u0027m guessing,\" she replied quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt nodded, understanding and appreciating his friend\u0027s growing dilemma. \"I must go back to Bruenor,\" he explained, rising from the pedestal. He would have left it at that, but he could not ignore the pleading look Catti-brie then gave him. She turned away immediately, staring straight ahead under the cowl of her thick auburn locks, and that despondence struck Drizzt even more profoundly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not my place to tell you how you should feel,\" Drizzt said evenly. Still the young woman did not look back to him. \"My burden as your friend is equal to the one you carried in the southern city of Calimport, when I had lost my way. I say to you now: The path before you turns soon in many directions, but that path is yours to choose. For all our sakes, and mostly yours, I pray that you consider your course carefully.\" He bent low, pushed back the side of Catti-brie\u0027s hair and kissed her gently on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not look back as he left the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf of Cobble\u0027s cart was already empty by the time the drow entered Bruenor\u0027s audience hall. Bruenor, Cobble, Dagna, Wulfgar, Regis, and several other dwarves argued loudly over which pail of the \"holy water\" held the finest, smoothest taste - arguments that inevitable produced further taste tests, which in turn created further arguments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one!\" Bruenor bellowed after draining a pail and coming back up with his red beard covered in foam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That one\u0027s good for goblins!\" Wulfgar roared, his voice dull. His laughter ended abruptly, though, when Bruenor plopped the pail over his head and gave it a resounding backhand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could be wrong,\" Wulfgar, suddenly sitting on the floor, admitted, his voice echoing under the metal bucket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what ye think, drow,\" Bruenor bellowed when he noticed Drizzt. He held out two sloshing buckets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt put up a hand, declining the invitation. \"Mountain springs are more to my liking than thick mead,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor threw the buckets at him, but the drow easily stepped aside, and the dark, golden liquid oozed slowly across the stone floor. The sheer volume of the ensuing protests from the other dwarves at the waste of good mead astounded Drizzt, but not as much as the fact that this probably was the first time he had ever seen Bruenor scolded without finding the courage to fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me king,\" came a call from the door, ending the argument. A rather plump dwarf, fully arrayed in battle gear, entered the audience hall, the seriousness of his expression deflating the mirth in the tasting chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven kin have not returned from the newer sections,\" the dwarf explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking their time, is all,\" Bruenor replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They missed their supper,\" said the guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble,\" Cobble and Dagna said together, suddenly solemn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah!\" snorted Bruenor as he waved his thick hand unsteadily in front of him. \"There be no more goblins in them tunnels. The groups down there now\u0027re just hunting mithril. They found a vein o\u0027 the stuff, I tell ye. That\u0027d keep any dwarf, even from his supper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCobble and Dagna, even Regis, Drizzt noted, wagged their heads in agreement. Given the potential danger whenever traveling the tunnels of the Underdark (and the deepest tunnels of Mithril Hall could be considered nothing less), the wary drow was not so easily convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re ye thinking?\" Bruenor asked Drizzt, seeing his plain concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt considered his response for a long while. \"I am thinking that you are probably right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably?\" Bruenor huffed. \"Ah, well, I never could convince ye. Go on, then. It\u0027s what ye want. Take yer cat and go find me overdue dwarves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt\u0027s wry smile left no doubt that Bruenor\u0027s instructions had been his intention all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Wulfgar, son of Beornegar! I will go!\" Wulfgar proclaimed, but he sounded somewhat ridiculous with his head still under the bucket. Bruenor leveled another backhand to silence his spouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And elf,\" the king called, turning Drizzt back to him. Bruenor offered a wicked smile to all of those about him, then dropped it fully over Regis. \"Be taking Rumblebelly with ye,\" the dwarf king explained. \"He\u0027s not doing me much good about here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis\u0027s big, round eyes got even bigger and rounder. He ran plump, soft fingers through his curly brown hair, then tugged uncomfortably at the one dangling earring he wore. \"Me?\" he asked meekly. \"Go back down there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye went once,\" Bruenor reasoned, making his argument more to the other dwarves than to Regis. \"Got yer-self a few goblins, if me memory\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have too much to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get ye going, Rumblebelly,\" Bruenor growled, leaning forward in his seat and nearly overbalancing in the process. \"For the first time since ye come running back to us - and know that we\u0027re knowing ye\u0027re running! - do what I ask of ye without yer back talk and excuses!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seriousness of Bruenor\u0027s grim tone surprised everyone in the room, apparently even Regis, for the halfling offered not another word, just got up and walked obediently to stand beside Drizzt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we stop by my room?\" Regis quietly asked the drow. \"I would like my mace and pack, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt draped an arm over his three-foot-tall companion\u0027s slumping shoulders and turned him about. \"Fear not,\" he said under his breath, and to accentuate the point he dropped the onyx figurine of Guenhwyvar into the halfling\u0027s eager hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegis knew he was in fine company. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-legacy-legacy-of-the-drow-1/page-7.html","bookId":2127,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:18 PM"}
