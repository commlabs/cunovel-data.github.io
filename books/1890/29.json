Make sure my sister doesn’t break your dear friend\u0027s heart. He has no idea what he\u0027s in for and he is awfully sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"Not my problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slapped his chest, \"See you later.\" I turned and walked out into the hallway—the most beautiful hallway I had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cab ride back to the room I’d rented was refreshingly free. I hadn’t a single worry in the world. I had run away from them both. Luce was a safe temptation and Mike was easily distracted. Neither were a real threat to my discovering myself, not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, I was just finished packing up my room in Rome, when there was a knock at the door. I pulled the towel off my head and opened it, instantly disappointed. It wasn’t just Mike. It was a very drunk Mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God you’re here. I fucked up, Jack.\" He staggered in, still in his tux and smelling like hell. He collapsed on my rented sofa and groaned, \"Baby, I did something bad last night. I didn’t even know I did it until it was over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned and closed the door, “What?” My stomach was aching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and looked at me, giving me a heartbroken look, “I slept with Daniela last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced, \"Oh God, why?” I lifted my hand to my mouth, covering it. I didn’t want him to see the disgust on my face but I couldn’t help feeling it. He was loaded and stupid. I felt tears slipping into my eyes, “Fuck, Mike. Why would you do that? Tex is going to be heartbroken. What if you got her pregnant? You\u0027re an asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, covering his eyes, \"I know. I just got so drunk and then the next thing I knew, we were in one of those rooms. She was undoing my pants and then I blinked and we were done. I called her your name and she got mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered my eyes, holding back my pain. Technically, we were not together. I tried to be his friend, which it was clear that was all I was, \"Did anyone see you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t know. I don’t care. I shouldn’t have done it.\" He got up quickly and dropped to his knees in front of me, \"I don’t want it to fuck things up for me and you. That’s why I had to come and tell you right away. I can’t hurt you, Jack, but I can’t lie either. I don’t want secrets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and cried a little at the same time, “That has kind of happened though, hasn’t it? I am hurt and Tex will be too.” I didn’t know how to feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes, wishing I had blue pills for the first time in a long time. I wanted the exploding feeling in my chest to go away. I let the sunset amongst the tents, the charming smile of Luce, and talking about movies and wine take over my mind and become my new blue pill. I dropped to my knees too, \"Mike, there is no me and you. You\u0027re drunk right now, so it feels like maybe that almost sex we had yesterday was something. But let\u0027s think about this for a minute. Me and you have never had anything beyond having fun and having sex and taking naps. We have always been that couple who was never really a couple. You\u0027re funny, cute, and sexy as hell, but we won\u0027t ever be anything but what we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked impassioned, \"I think I knew that. I watched you slipping away. I can feel it, I’m losing you.\" A tear slipped down his cheek. I wasn’t sure drunk tears counted, but it was an effort. He sniffled, “I don’t want to lose you. I need you. Can we go back? Can we be friends again? I miss you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed his cheek softly, \"I miss you too, but I mostly just miss being your friend. I miss being your family. I miss listening to your stories and laughing. Like the one about you and your brothers when you went fishing and one caught some underwear and chased you with them. I like us as friends.\" I wasn’t sure if it was true or just words I spoke to avoid my broken heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked devastated, \"I can change, Jack. I can be what you need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I don’t want that. I like you just the way you are, but I can\u0027t love you the way you want me to. It took me all this time of not having you around to see that we are always going to be best friends. Always. I will always be your Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"Baby, I love you. I know I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I know you do. I know you love me in your special way and I\u0027m the only girl who says no to you and makes you crazy but that isn’t the marrying kind of love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You love someone else? Someone like Luce, who your parents will love? Fuck you! Don’t tell me you love me but don’t want to be with me.\" He got up and walked to the door. I grabbed the back of his shirt and dragged him to my bed. I shoved him down on it and laid beside him, \"We are not arguing right now. You are drunk and stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don’t sneak away this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I won\u0027t.\" I closed my eyes, \"I don’t want to lose you, Mike. If you want to be with me, then you need to prove it. You couldn’t even do three months of celibacy. I know you were with other girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, \"They don\u0027t ever mean anything, Jack. And I did cut back, a lot. I only slipped twice when I was at a couple parties. I woke up and realized what I’d done. I tried to tell you, but I didn\u0027t know how. I knew you’d be disappointed in me. I am trying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kissed his forehead, \"I\u0027m not kidding around. I\u0027m disgusted you would sleep with Daniela and hurt Tex and me like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tex did it to me first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"That\u0027s mature.\" And that was exactly the point my heart was making. \"Mike, this careless, sexy, slutty, hockey player thing you have going for yourself was hot ten years ago. It\u0027s not hot anymore. You\u0027re getting older, time to grow up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nuzzled into me, \"I\u0027m like Peter Pan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, trying to stifle my laugh, \"No, you aren’t. It\u0027s time to see what big boy Mike is like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt him smile, \"I can show you big boy Mike right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly gagged, \"You stink and you just had sex with another woman. A married woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, \"You walked into that one, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him fall asleep, forcing myself to see slutty, gross Mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that night, as he shoved my bags into the back of the cab, he gave me a sour-looking expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudged him and smiled sweetly, \"I\u0027ll see you at the end of May.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike scowled, \"Just come home. I swear you can watch me grow. Muriel will be excited to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, folding my arms over my shirt, \"Sorry. I need this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my gaze, \"My sister is having sex with Will, who probably loves her and she probably loves him. But you know what\u0027s sad? She will never be with him. She won\u0027t sacrifice her social status and choose love. Tex was screwing Daniela the entire time you were with her—she\u0027s a whore. Let\u0027s face it. You wait for him to marry her and then pay him back—that\u0027s sick. I nearly sleep with you and then nearly bed hop from you to Luce.\" His face darkened but I shoved his chest, \"Stop. You fucked Daniela; you have no right to judge me. To top all that shit off, I nearly married a sadistic bastard because my dad told me to. I have NEVER just been away from the toxicity of it all. All these near misses would have happened, had I still been taking several types of prescription medicine. You see how fucked up that is? My life sounds like a soap opera. I\u0027m waiting for someone to come back from the dead and I\u0027m just going to find a script writer and produce this shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted, \"You\u0027re making it sound worse than it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, exasperated, \"NO. That’s the worst part, Mike. I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"STOP CALLING ME MIKE!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned into his savage look, \"THEN EARN MY LOVE, FRANCE! STOP EXPECTING THAT YOU DESERVE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE HISTORY!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my shoulders but stopped himself. We hovered in that awkward silence for a minute. The one where we stared at each other\u0027s quivering lips and prayed desperately that the other person would move that last ten percent. Both stubborn and scared, neither of us did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a hurt look, \"I went to the Empire State Building for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, I couldn’t fight it, \"I loved that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis ragged breath sounded like it might catch in his throat. \"I can\u0027t lose you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Then act like it. Act like missing me isn’t just a sober thing for you. Act like I am the person you want to be with and think about the person I want to be with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved the last ten percent but I pressed my lips against his flushed cheeks. He pressed into the kiss. I whispered, \"See you in May.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away from him and climbed into the cab. Before I closed the door, I turned back to him. He looked tragic and on the verge of doing something crazy. I hoped he would, just a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Brandi I said she is a hateful slut and I will see her in May too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to laugh but it sounded close to crying, \"I love you, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I love you too, France.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got onto the flight for Greece, I pulled the handkerchief from my pocket. I smelled it and sighed. It was the smell of the hillside, the setting sun, and the Valpolicella. I opened it up to see a note written inside of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made me smile. Inside was a note,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacqueline,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs per our previous agreement, I will be waiting for you May 9th at the Gallery of Ancient Art in Rome at 7 pm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYours,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my breath hitch as I reread it. He had planned all along to give me the handkerchief. He had planned it like a romantic movie, long before we even spoke of movies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach tightened as the plane took off. He would be the right choice; I could love a man like Luce so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday, The End of April\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shelved the last of the bottles, \"I think this is it. Now we just have to go and see if the guys are ready with the pruning and burning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRita smiled at me, \"You work hard for an American. I have never seen anyone work so hard.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-29.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
