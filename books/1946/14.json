Oh, Paul, I heard the rest of the story and it’s so beautiful, so compelling, you’ll see why she loved him as much as she did.

Crazy. Crazy in love with you. If having the marines as your career means that much to you, then I’ll adjust. I’ll find a way to make it work. But you need to compromise, too, when it comes to my career. I can’t just leave a teaching job in order to follow you somewhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing Ruth expected after her admission was a long stretch of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, “Are you serious? You’ll accept my being in the military?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Do you think I’d do this otherwise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he admitted. “But what you don’t know is that I’ve been thinking about giving up the marines.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because of me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were?” Never once had it occurred to Ruth that he’d consider such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dad and I have had a couple of long talks about it,” he went on to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You already know this part—I’m crazy about you, too. I wasn’t convinced I could find a way to live the rest of my life without you. One option I’ve looked into is training. I’ve already talked to my commander about it, and he thinks it’s a good possibility I’d be able to stay in the marines, but I’d be stationed in one place for a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth slumped onto a kitchen stool, feeling deliciously weak, too weak to stay upright. “Oh, Paul, that’s wonderful!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I felt like a fool,” he said. “I made my big stand, and I honestly felt I was right, but I didn’t have to force you to decide that very minute. My pride wouldn’t allow me to back off, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pride carried me the first week,” she said. “Then I went to see my grandmother, and she told me how she met my grandfather at the end of the war.

Yes, Ruth has agreed to marry Paul Gordon, the young man she introduced me to in April. They’ve decided to have a December wedding in Oregon, where her family lives. Paul is a fine young man and I feel she’s chosen well. Yes, my dear friend, I’ll meet you in Seattle and we’ll board the ferry for Victoria together. It’s been far too long since we’ve had an extended visit. I’m looking forward to hearing about your granddaughters. I’m feeling good. Ruth and my sons know all about my war adventures. It was time, as you’ve been telling me all these years. Ruth has the tapes and is making copies for everyone in the family. She claims this is more than family history, this is history. Maybe she’s right…. I’ll see you next week.

It was difficult to imagine my charming Uncle Bill as a sailor in the Pacific, or Uncles Karl and Knute as soldiers in North Africa. They were funny and lovable and kind—how could they be warriors?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an adult, it is just as awe inspiring to me to hear reports of our military men and women. Thus, the opportunity to explore whether a cautious English professor like Chloe Abbott and a battle-hardened soldier like Jake Morrissey could find a future together was irresistible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m delighted to be sharing this collection with two of my favorite authors and dear friends, Debbie Macomber and Katherine Stone.

My bridge club loved it and I feel quite proud to have an “apple expert” as my dear friend.:-)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe postman brought a letter from Helen yesterday. (We must find a way to convince her to try the World Wide Web so she can share morning e-mail with us!) I was so pleased to learn she’s talked to her granddaughter about her wartime experiences. I confess I was a bit surprised that she chose her granddaughter, Ruth, as her confidante—I thought she might have told her son first. But I don’t think it matters who she told, as long as she told someone in her family. As far as I know, Ruth is the first person Helen has talked to about her involvement in the French Underground—except for her husband, me and you, Clara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never forgotten her torment and the pain in her eyes when she told us. I think that was the moment when the three of us bonded, crying together in her hotel room while our husbands waited downstairs in the lobby with Sam. She seemed so fragile, clutching her wedding bouquet. Remember how she wept when she told us about losing her husband in France? And how worried she was about whether she was being fair to Sam by marrying him when she was still devastated by what happened in France? I’m so glad we were there to support her that morning and convince her to go through with her wedding, especially since her marriage to Sam turned out so well. Now that she’s shared her secrets with Ruth, too, I’m hopeful she’ll find a measure of peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelen’s note said her granddaughter’s in love! There must be something in the air this spring—first we learn your granddaughter, Elizabeth, is engaged and now Helen’s Ruth finds love with Paul. I’m so delighted for both of you. What happy times are in store for you and Helen with engagements, weddings and great-grandchildren on the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI confess I’m envious, Clara, since my own three granddaughters show no signs of hurrying toward marriage. Chloe, Alexie and Lily are busy with their careers, and when I ask them about marriage, their response inevitably is “no time, Gran.” Sigh. Perhaps I should try a bit of matchmaking, since I’m apparently the only one with free time to search for husbands for them. :-)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do wish we lived closer so I could pop in and visit you daily for coffee and a nice long chat. I vividly remember how difficult it was for me the first year after I lost my Richard. He’s been gone for six years now, and although I still miss him every day, the awful sadness and sense of being lost and adrift gradually eased. I know the grief will grow less for you, too, Clara, but until it does, please remember you can call me anytime, day or night, if you need to talk. I’m sure Helen would say the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must stop chattering and get busy—I have a Women’s Club meeting today. We’re working with the Rehabilitation Department at the University of Washington Medical Center on a project that’s dear to my heart. I’ve even convinced Chloe to get involved—such fun to work with my granddaughter! Have a wonderful day, Clara.

He pushed open the big double doors and looked for his friend, Dan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was surprisingly uncrowded. Across from him, two women talked with a doctor wearing a lab coat. The white-haired older woman and the doctor faced him, the other woman had her back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a very nice back it was. Tall and slender, she wore a simple, curve-hugging white dress, and her black hair was a sleek fall that brushed her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClassy, he thought. Wonder what the front view is like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nurse in operating-room scrubs joined the group, and the brunette turned to greet her. She smiled, her eyes glowing emerald-green against fair skin, her face lit with amusement as she spoke to the nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake went from idle appreciation of a beautiful female to serious lust. The unusual reaction stunned him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Sarge.” Dan’s voice broke the spell that held Jake motionless, staring at the brunette. He turned to his right and saw Dan, seated in a wheelchair farther down the room. A male nurse walked behind him, but the young soldier himself propelled the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dan.” Jake moved toward him and the two met halfway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA broad grin split the young marine’s face as they shook hands. “Man, it’s good to see you! What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been out of town. I didn’t know you were in Seattle until I flew back last night.
