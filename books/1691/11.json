The announcer said that a lone Muslim extremist had claimed responsibility for the blast, and the camera closed once again on Peta. Encircled by a gold bezel, suspended from a gold chain, was a fragment of the artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiling away the certainty that she knew everything Arthur had known, he turned his attention to the people in the room. \"Meeting\u0027s in order,\" he said. \"You go first, Ray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith visible reluctance, Ray pulled a videotape out of his coat pocket and slipped it into the VCR. It began with Channel 8 hype about the preopening advertising for his hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ray Arno, owner of the new Daredevil Casino, is much more than a wealthy investor in a business suit,\" Paula Francis ofEyewitness News began. \"He\u0027s a well-known Hollywood stuntman, an Evel Knievel, if you will. You\u0027re about to see him perform a spectacular, death-defying stunt to highlight his new adventure hotel, with its theme park full of thrill rides and its high-stakes casino.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Behold one of those stupid macho stunts Peta was talking about,\" Ray said. \"You will notice that there is no safety net.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowed by cameras and reporters, Ray could be seen climbing to the top of Las Vegas\u0027s Stratosphere Tower - the tallest observation tower west of the Mississippi. He smiled, took a deep breath, and leaped into space. The camera tracked his shrinking figure until a rectangular skydiver\u0027s parachute unfurled behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera angle changed to a shot of a wedge-shaped building with what looked like a space shuttle jutting from one side. A large neon sign in front of the structure proclaimedTHE DAREDEVIL . The image panned up to show Ray in his bright jumpsuit, expertly gliding toward the roof of the casino.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe report switched to a cameraman on the Daredevil\u0027s rooftop helipad. As Ray stuttered to a stop and removed his parachute, he said into the camera, \"Follow me to the Daredevil.You may use the front door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen filled with snow as the tape ended. \"That\u0027ll do,\" Frik said. No one disagreed. \"Who\u0027s next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriefly, as if they were reading Cliff\u0027s Notes, each of them, including Frik, added a tale of derring-do. Frik summarized an African man-faces-rhino ecoadventure that sounded like an outtake from Hemingway\u0027sGreen Hills of Africa ; Keene and McKendry gave a precis about having infiltrated a white-supremacist group to rescue a black professor who had been taken hostage; and Simon described a shark attack during the exploration of a wreck near the Bermuda Triangle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, everyone,\" Ray said after Simon had finished. \"Why not talk about next year and call it a night? We obviously won\u0027t be able to meet here from now on, so how about my place in Vegas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your place?\" Joshua Keene looked amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My new hotel. Look, I realize this apartment was Damon Runyan\u0027s home, which made it perfect for us, and the Strip isn\u0027t Times Square - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s the next best thing to being here.\" Keene lifted his glass in a mock toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKendry chuckled, appreciative as always of his friend\u0027s sense of humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someday I\u0027m going to buy this place and turn it into a casino,\" Ray said. \"But that\u0027s not happening quite yet. Meanwhile, why not some desert R and R away from the...um\" - he glanced at Arthur\u0027s bedroom - \"the memories?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe venue was readily agreed upon. Glasses were refilled, and a few people munched on pretzels and nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About next year.\" Frik got ready for what needed to be a convincing performance. \"I have something to propose. Something urgent that I cleared with Arthur, on condition the rest of you agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe too glanced toward the bedroom where Peta had gone, then sat back and put forth his proposal. He went over what information he wished to divulge: the discovery of the artifacts; the fire that had killed Paul Trujold; a description of how he had sustained third-degree burns on his face and left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving gained the group\u0027s attention, he went on to talk about his suspicion that Selene Trujold had at least one piece of the device, sent by her father, and he recounted her threats to destroy Oilstar. Of course, he said nothing about his true purpose, making it easy for everyone to agree upon a treasure hunt for the missing pieces of the artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean to minimize what you\u0027re suggesting, Frik,\" Keene said grimly, \"but shouldn\u0027t we be putting our energies into finding out who killed Arthur?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, Josh,\" Ray said quickly. \"Given the relative skills of the rest of you, you\u0027ll have no difficulty divvying up Frik\u0027s search. I\u0027ll handle Arthur\u0027s death on my own. I can always call on the rest of you if I need help. Sound reasonable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik held his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence while the others thought everything through. \"Sounds more than reasonable to me. I\u0027ll dive for the piece that was left behind,\" Brousseau said, not mentioning what Frik already knew -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that his doctor had warned him that his heart condition made deep-sea dives not just dangerous, but potentially suicidal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik said nothing about it. Simon\u0027s reaction was perfect, imperative to his plan. The only risk was that Simon could mess things up by dying underwater before retrieving the piece, but that was a chance he was willing to take. \"You can fly back with me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon shook his head. \"I have to take care of some things in Miami first. Tell you what. Bring theAssegai to Grenada. I\u0027ll fly in there in a couple of weeks and you can sail me to Trinidad. I could use a good sail, a little time on top of the ocean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeene and McKendry volunteered to track Selene Trujold and her gang of ecoterrorists. From her father\u0027s notes and earlier comments, Frik knew that she had tended to focus her Green Impact activities in the main Venezuelan oil fields, near Maracaibo. If he was right, that was about to change. Now Oilstar\u0027s large newValhalla rig, just beginning production in the Orinoco Delta, would become her prime target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is something elseyou can do,\" Frik said to Ray. \"Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but I seem to remember that you told me you were building a state-of-the-art laboratory adjacent to your penthouse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. In my guilty moments I tell myself that I built it to develop a new means of detecting and neutralizing land mines and live shells in war zones. Really, though, I\u0027m just a kid with a four-million- dollar chemistry set,\" Ray said, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A useful one. If you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027ll have Trujold\u0027s computer models and results transmitted from our mainframe in Trinidad to your computer in Las Vegas. I need you to study them and determine if his findings were correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay with me,\" Ray said. \"Now if you\u0027ll all excuse me, I have to check on preparations my people are making for an important guest at the Daredevil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the room to use the phone in Arthur\u0027s kitchenette. By the time he returned, Peta had reentered the room. Frik could see her closed suitcase standing upright on the floor near the open doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fly back with me in the Oilstar jet,\" he said to her. \"I\u0027ll divert and take you to Grenada before going on to Trinidad. Sure you won\u0027t come with us, Simon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon shook his head. \"Aside from anything else, there\u0027s some diving gear I want to pick up in Miami.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diving gear?\" Peta sounded shocked. \"Are youtrying to kill yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Ray asked. \"He\u0027s been diving forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a doctor, remember,\" Peta said. \"I don\u0027t need to do an EKG to see that he has a heart problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that true?\" Ray looked at Simon as if he hadn\u0027t really seen him before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave him alone, both of you,\" Frik said, more brusquely than he had intended. \"He\u0027s over twenty- one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Stop fussing over me. I\u0027m going to do this.\" Simon crossed his fingers, put his hand behind his back, and grinned like a little boy. \"Tell you what, though. I promise you, this will be my last dive.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-11.html","bookId":1691,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM"}
