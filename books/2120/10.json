Her grandfather had turned out to be useless: a scared old man with nothing to live for but his books, his cigars, and his port wine. What had she expected? A tutor, a guide, a patron...a father. Someone who would take the burden off her shoulders for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she packed her bags in her hotel room the next morn- ing, Schuyler remembered Lawrence\u0027s parting words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sorry, Schuyler. Cordelia was wrong in sending you to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then began to pace in front of the fire. \"The truth is, I no longer have any interest in Blue Blood affairs. I have washed my hands of their plight, ever since Roanoke. They chose to follow Michael then, as they have always done,\" he said, meaning the coven leadership had reinstalled Michael as Regis when the crisis at Roanoke had been discovered and it looked as if the Silver Bloods had returned. \"And if I\u0027m not mistaken, they still choose to follow him today as Charles Force.\" Lawrence shook his head. \"When he turned his back on the family and renounced the Van Alen name, I vowed that I would never return to the coven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alas, you have traveled to Venice in vain. I am an old man. I would prefer to live out my immortal life in peace. I have nothing to offer you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Cordelia said...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cordelia placed too much faith in me, as always. The key to defeating the Silver Bloods lies with Charles and Allegra, not with me. Only the Uncorrupted can save Blue Bloods from the Silver Blood Abominations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sorry I cannot be of much help. I swore off the Blue Bloods forever when I went into exile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Charles Force was right about you,\" Schuyler said, her voice shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you mean?\" Lawrence asked darkly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said you weren\u0027t half the man Cordelia wished you to be. That I would only find sorrow and confusion if I traveled to Venice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence stepped back as if he had received a physical blow. His face registered a myriad of emotions--shame, anger, pride--but he remained silent. In the end, he abruptly turned his back on her and left the room, slamming the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell. That was that. Schuyler zipped up her carryall, lugged it over her shoulder, and walked out to the elevator, where Oliver was waiting. He didn\u0027t say hello or good morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that if she wanted to, she could catch a glimpse of his mind--his thoughts broadcast as if on satellite radio. But she always switched the signal. She didn\u0027t feel it was right to pry. Besides, she didn\u0027t need any of her special powers to figure out he was still annoyed with her for not calling him the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence\u0027s chauffeur had brought her back to the hotel late the previous evening, and Schuyler had found several frantic messages from her friend on her cell phone and hotel voice mail. She would have called him back, but it was so late she hadn\u0027t wanted to wake him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were dead,\" Oliver accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I was, you could have my iPod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha. Yours sucks. It doesn\u0027t even have video.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler repressed a smile. She knew Oliver couldn\u0027t stay mad at her for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, you missed a hilarious European music awards show on TV. David Hasselhoff swept all the categories.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sucks to be me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted. \"Dad\u0027s gone, he took an earlier flight. Had to get back for some shareholders\u0027 meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler glanced sideways at her friend. Oliver\u0027s chestnut shag covered his forehead, and his warm hazel eyes, flecked with green and topaz, were filled with hurt and con- cern. Schuyler restrained herself from touching his neck, which looked so vulnerable and inviting. Lately she had been sensing a new desire in her blood to feed. The thirst was a low hum, like music in the back of your head that you didn\u0027t even notice, but once in a while it would raise its voice, and there was no mistaking it. She found herself drawn to Oliver in a new way, and she blushed when she looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to Schuyler that her human father had been her vampire mother\u0027s familiar, and Allegra had taken him as her husband against vampire law. For the first time in the history of the Blue Bloods, the lines between the races had blurred, and the result had been Schuyler. Half human, half vampire. Dimidium Cognatus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler had been made aware of her ancestry only a few months ago, but now she understood that her blood was her destiny, formed in an intricate pattern of veins underneath her skin. Blood calling for blood. Oliver\u0027s blood...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never noticed how handsome her best friend was. How soft his skin looked. How much she wanted to reach out with her fingers and touch that spot below his Adam\u0027s apple, and kiss him there, and then, maybe, to prick the skin with her teeth, to sink in her fangs...and feed....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you, anyway?\" Oliver asked, breaking her train of thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story,\" Schuyler said. The elevator doors opened and they both stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they made their way in a rickety cab through the cobblestone streets to the tiny regional airport, Schuyler filled Oliver in on everything that had happened, and her friend listened attentively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a goddamn shame,\" Oliver said. \"But maybe he\u0027ll change his mind one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler shrugged. She had pleaded her case, she had done as her grandmother had asked, but she had still been spurned. She really didn\u0027t think there was anything she could do about it anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, maybe not. Let\u0027s stop talking about it,\" she sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir flight to Rome was delayed, so Schuyler and Oliver killed time by browsing the duty-free and souvenir shops. Oliver grinned as he showed Schuyler a racy Italian magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler grabbed several magazines, a bottle of water, and gum to ease the air pressure in her ears during takeoff and landing. She was waiting on line for the cashier to ring her up when she noticed a stack of Venetian masks. The city was full of sidewalk vendors hawking them, even though Carnevale was still a few months away. She had hardly paid any attention to the cheap trifles, but one mask in particular in the airport display caught her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a full-face mask with only holes for eyes, and was made of the finest porcelain, with gold-and-silver beading. \"Look,\" she said, holding it up to show Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want that tacky thing for?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t have anything to remind me of Venice. I\u0027m getting it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir flight to Rome was bumpy, and the flight to New York was even worse--so much turbulence that Schuyler thought she would go crazy from her teeth chattering against each other every time the plane bounced. But once she looked out the window and saw the New York skyline, she felt a rush of love for the city, tinged with sadness to know that there was no one waiting for her at home except two loyal servants who were now her legal guardians, as per Cordelia\u0027s will. At least there was Beauty, her bloodhound, a true friend and protector. Beauty was another part of the transformation, a part of Cordelia\u0027s soul that had transferred to the physical world to protect Schuyler until she was in full control of her powers. She had missed her dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made their way to the concourse to retrieve their bags from the carousel, weary from their journey. After traveling for almost fifteen hours straight, both of them looked peaked, and it was dusk when they arrived in New York. They walked out to find a light dusting of snow. It was the first week of December, and winter had finally arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver found his family\u0027s car and driver idling by the curb, and led Schuyler toward the black Mercedes Maybach. They settled inside the cozy leather interior, Schuyler thanking the gods for giving her Oliver. His family fortune (intact) definitely came in handy during times like these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them were quietly absorbed in their own thoughts as they rode back to the city. Traffic was light on the freeway for a change, and they made it to Manhattan in half an hour. The car drove over the George Washington Bridge and exited on 125th Street, making its way down Riverside to the Van Alen mansion on the corner of 101st and Riverside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this is me,\" Schuyler said. \"Thanks again for every- thing, Ollie. I wish it had worked out with my grandfather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, no worries. `Protect and serve,\u0027 that\u0027s my motto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver leaned over to kiss her on the cheek like he always did, but at the last minute Schuyler turned her head so that their noses bumped into each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver looked embarrassed, and they embraced awkwardly instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was wrong with her? He was her best friend. Why was she acting so lame? She was about to open the car door when he cleared his throat. She turned to him. \"Did you say something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, uh, I guess you\u0027re going to that thing tonight, huh?\" he asked, scratching his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler blinked. \"Thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, uh, Four Hundred Ball,\" Oliver said, rolling his eyes and making exaggerated scare quotes with his fingers. \"The big bloodsuckers shindig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, right.\" She had almost forgotten about that. Her presence would be required as part of The Committee. She was too young to be officially presented at the ball, unlike Mimi and Jack Force. Jack Force--for weeks now she had suppressed her feelings for him, but the thought of the Four Hundred Ball brought his image to the forefront of her mind. Tall, painfully handsome, the sun shining on his golden hair and skin, laughing with his piercing green eyes, showing his even, dazzlingly white teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had been the first to suspect there was more to the story of Aggie\u0027s death than anyone on The Committee would have liked to believe. He was the one who had been determined to find out the truth. She had sought him out after she had been attacked, and after he had comforted her, they had kissed. The memory of his kiss was still pressed like an imprint on her lips. If she closed her eyes she could still smell him, clean and fresh like newly laundered linen, with a hint of woodsy aftershave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Force...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho had turned his back on her when she had mistak- enly accused his father of being a Silver Blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered if Jack had a date for the ball, and if he did, who it was. She felt a bright flare of jealousy at the thought of another girl in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to go with me?\" She hadn\u0027t even given any thought to a dress or a date until Oliver mentioned it. Oliver blushed and looked pained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s, um...vampires only. Kind of a rule. No human familiars or Conduits allowed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t know,\" Schuyler said. \"Maybe I won\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver looked out the window, where snow had covered the rooftops and sidewalks with a glaze of white crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should,\" Oliver said quietly. \"Cordelia would have wanted you to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler knew he was right. She was the remaining Van Alen in New York. She would have to represent the family. \"All right, I\u0027ll go. But I\u0027ll leave early and maybe we can meet up later on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver smiled wistfully. \"Sure.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/masquerade-blue-bloods-2/page-10.html","bookId":2120,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:01:05 PM"}
