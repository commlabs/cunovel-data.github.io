My best friend was always a force of nature, but this just defied logic. Did she really just tell me she bought me a business? With every step of my life I felt like I’d made wrong turns. Nothing was going the way I planned. I wanted this more than anything, but part of me was afraid to really get my hopes up. Who knows though? Maybe good things were finally going to start happening in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the clock on the dashboard and realized I spent entirely too long sitting in my car and now I was late for my shift. I ran through the parking lot and threw open the side door, tying my little black apron around my waist as I went. Mr. and Mrs. Foster have seen one too many episodes of True Blood and recently decided we should adopt the same uniform as Merlotte\u0027s. Tiny black shorts and tiny white t-shirts with the word \"Fosters\" stamped across our tits in green. It could be worse. At least I don’t have to make sure I’m wearing enough “flare” or sing some demented version of happy birthday with the rest of the staff. “Happy birthday to you, with beer goggles on you don’t look like you should moo, happy birthday dear random stranger who’s dressed like a hooker, happy birthday to you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran behind Liz already seated on a stool at the bar sipping her usual drink of vanilla vodka and Diet Coke and waved to T.J., the bartender I was taking over for tonight. Thankfully the men didn\u0027t have to wear the same uniform. I didn\u0027t think I could handle seeing a couple of these guys in tiny shorts with their hairy balls popping out of the leg holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a slow night, I would have just hopped my ass up onto the bar and swung my legs around to get behind it, but the place was packed tonight. I had to do it the right way and go under the hinged, lift-top part of the bar at the opposite end. I jogged past some poor drunk schmuck that held his head in his hands, moaning, and made a mental note to call him a cab if he was here by himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I was behind the bar and got the skinny from T.J. on the customers here tonight and what they were drinking, he left to go home and I got to work getting refills for the regulars. One of the waitresses brought in an order for ten shots of the cheapest whiskey we had. I rolled my eyes and went to the end of the bar where we kept all of the whiskey. What is wrong with these people? Cheap whiskey equals a bad hangover and having the craps all the next day. I started lining up the shot glasses on my tray when I heard the drunken moaner speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We never found her, did we big guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh Jesus. I hate the really tanked ones. I hope this guy isn\u0027t a crier. He sounds pitiful. And if he pukes on my bar I’m going to rub his nose in it like a dog that shit on the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you speaking to anyone in particular or do your shot glasses usually respond?\" I asked without looking up as I added a few more shot glasses to the tray and reached under the bar for the bottle of Wild Turkey, trying not to make gagging noises as I unscrewed the top and the disgusting smell wafted up to my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Return of the Living Drunk whip his head up out of the corner of my eye while I filled the glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, the first sign of insanity is when inanimate objects talk to you. Or maybe it\u0027s the first sign of alcohol poisoning,\" I mused to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the hell is ordering that rot gut? They\u0027re going to have the shits all day tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed that even drunk, he was able to come to the same conclusion as me. Picking up the tray of shots and a bowl of lemon slices, I turned around to tell him so - and stopped dead in my tracks at the sight before me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat. The. Fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the tray full of glass and booze tipping out of my raised hand but there was nothing I could do to stop its descent to the floor. I stood there like a statue, staring straight ahead as the glasses shattered around my feet and liquid splashed up onto my legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Snickers Finger Arm Teeth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happened in slow motion. Well, for me it happened in slow motion. Probably because the amount of alcohol I\u0027ve consumed tonight has digested half of my brain cells, and I feel like I\u0027m in the Matrix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if I could lean back on my bar stool and do that cool move from the movie where I dodge bullets in slow motion while suspended in mid-air? I need a cool black leather jacket and my hair slicked back. I wonder if they used wires or if that Keanu guy could really bend like that? I bet he does that yoga shit. He looks like the kind of guy that does Downward Facing Dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeh, heh, downward dog. That\u0027s funny. I should get a dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, what was I doing? Oh, yeah. The bartender turned around and stared at me and before I could even get a good non-drunken haze look at her. I watched the entire tray of shots tip right out of her hand. They crashed to the floor before I had a chance to react, the sound of glass breaking rising above the drone of music and loud voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have jumped into action and vaulted across the bar to help her. Because you know, right now I had cat-like reflexes—if the cat drank three times its weight in tequila because it just found out its girlfriend of two years never wanted to have kids and decided to turn her vagina into a wiener-warmer for half the population of Toledo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should get a cat or two. They\u0027re pretty low maintenance. Maybe I can even teach it to piss in the toilet like Jinxy from \"Meet the Fockers.\" Can a guy turn into a crazy cat lady? I suddenly pictured myself as an old man shuffling along the sidewalk covered in cat hair and meowing at everyone who walked by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn second thought, no cats. I shouldn’t be allowed to think when I’m drinking. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-13.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM"}
