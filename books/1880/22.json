I can\u0027t concentrate on anything because my mind keeps going back to what Jack Henry said—he envisions his future with me and little people who look like us. It seems like I\u0027m thinking about it constantly. Even now as we\u0027re riding this elevator up to Randy\u0027s room for the after-show meeting, my mind drifts as I think about what our lives would be like if he and I were married with a family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snaps his fingers in front of my face. \"Baby, what\u0027s wrong? You\u0027ve been somewhere else for days now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing is wrong.\" Everything is right, dammit. Why couldn\u0027t it have been like this before I walked away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls me into his arms. \"Something\u0027s up. You\u0027re not yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have stuff on my mind. This is…,\" I pause to choose my words carefully but I\u0027m saved when Jack Henry\u0027s phone rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Harold. I should probably take this.\" He answers the call and I can tell by the expression on his face that something is wrong. The elevator doors open and we step off, but he stops in the corridor and I see that wrinkle form on his forehead—the one he gets when he\u0027s worried about something. \"Hold on a minute.\" He takes the phone away from his ear. \"There\u0027s a problem at Avalon and I really need to talk to Harold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everything okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It sounds like Audrey has struck again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it going to take for that crazy bitch to leave him alone? \"Okay. I\u0027ll go on ahead. You talk to Harold and I\u0027ll meet you in the room when I\u0027m finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses the top of my head. \"Okay, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove. He\u0027s never called me that before. I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys are already in the room, beers in hand, when I walk in. Charlie takes one from the mini-fridge and twists the top before he holds it out for me. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have some great news. A fan at the Dallas show recorded your acoustical performance on her phone and uploaded it. It\u0027s gone viral and fans are going crazy over it, so we think it\u0027s a good idea to get you back into the studio at Nashville to record it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy acoustical performance, I assume he\u0027s referring to the song I sang for Jack Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said we think it\u0027s a good idea. I guess that means he\u0027s been discussing my performance with the guys and they\u0027re talking about things behind my back. I\u0027m still new to this group, but I won\u0027t put up with them making decisions without me, especially when it concerns my personal songs. I think I\u0027d better let them know that right now. I\u0027m a part of this band just like every one of them, even if I am the newest member.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you\u0027ve all decided this without consulting me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie holds up his hands. \"Whoa, Laurelyn. The guys and I haven\u0027t discussed anything. We\u0027re hearing this for the first time just like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Randy said we think it\u0027s a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the other part of we.\" I stiffen as I hear the familiar voice behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys, this is one of my producer buddies, Blake Phillips. It was his idea to bring you back to Nashville for the recording and I couldn\u0027t agree more. The song is hot, so now\u0027s the time to strike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury. That\u0027s the only word that can describe what I\u0027m feeling right now. \"That song wasn\u0027t meant for the world. It was only meant for one person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you didn\u0027t sing it for one person,\" Randy reminds me. \"You sang it in front of a crowded concert and now your fans are going crazy over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat song is personal. The lyrics are me baring my heart and soul to Jack Henry. \"I don\u0027t think I want to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie, the peacekeeper, attempts to intercede on my behalf. \"Maybe you should give her a little time to think about it, Randy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake smirks at me and I want to kick him in his nuts all over again. \"This isn\u0027t a request, Laurelyn. Southern Ophelia is going to record that song. I\u0027ve already set it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what Randy is thinking—I owe Blake for letting me out of my contract. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s what they\u0027re all thinking. And that I\u0027m an ungrateful bitch for not going along with what he\u0027s asking of me. Is this ever going to end? Am I always going to look like the villain while Blake walks on water? \"I need to get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t look back as I leave Randy\u0027s room to walk the corridor toward my own at the opposite end of the hall. I\u0027m flustered as I slide my keycard into the slot. It takes three attempts for the little light to turn green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push the door open and a hand comes over my mouth from behind. I\u0027m pulled back against someone and shoved into the room. I hear the click of the door and I struggle against the arms wrapped around me. I feel warm breath against my ear and hear Blake whisper, \"Stop fighting me, Laurie. I only want to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere is Jack Henry? We were supposed to meet in the room but he\u0027s not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake says he wants to talk? I don\u0027t think so. Talking doesn\u0027t involve being shoved into a room with a hand clamped over your mouth. My gift of fear is speaking loudly and it\u0027s warning me that he\u0027s here for much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite his hand and he immediately jerks it away from my mouth. I\u0027m able to scream briefly before he backhands me so hard, my ears ring. He shoves me onto the bed and sits on top of me as he stretches my arms above my head. I\u0027m mildly dazed but it passes quickly—or at least I think it does. \"Ohh,\" I moan as I register the pain in the side of my face where he smacked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell. I\u0027m sorry, Laurie. I didn\u0027t mean to hit you.\" He hovers above me as he examines my face. \"I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s going to leave a mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow hard did he hit me if he can already tell that there\u0027s going to be a bruise? \"You\u0027re hurting me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he apologizes as he releases my arms. I alternate massaging my wrists where he was grasping me tightly and I can tell they\u0027re going to be tender later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolls off me to his back and puts his palms on his forehead, looking up at the ceiling. \"God, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t plan this. I just wanted to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie motionless on the bed as I recall the way he pinned me to my car at the studio. Now he\u0027s slapped me around after forcing his way into my room. I hadn\u0027t considered him a threat, but I see now that I should. I have no idea where his head is or what he\u0027s capable of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sits up and stares straight ahead as he speaks. \"You pretend like we meant nothing, like we never even happened. Do you have any idea how much that hurts me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all becoming clear now. \"You coming here was never about us recording my song, was it? It was about you finding a way to get to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitates briefly before answering. \"You\u0027re a smart girl, Laurie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe can forget it. I wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with him, even if Jack Henry weren\u0027t in my life. \"You need to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving until I tell you how I feel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach up and touch my face. It hurts like hell. \"There\u0027s no point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong.\" He turns to look at me. \"I love you, Laurie, and I know we can make us work. I told Beth I want a divorce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would he do that? We\u0027re not even in a relationship. \"I hope you didn\u0027t do that for me because it changes nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I did it for you,\" he yells at me. He closes his eyes and takes a breath before he opens them and slowly releases the air from his lungs. \"We can get it back—everything we had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s under the wrong impression if he believes I would have anything to do with him again. \"No, we can\u0027t. I love someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twists from where he\u0027s sitting on the bed to face me. \"I can\u0027t fucking believe this! I told my wife I wanted a divorce so I could be with you, and now you\u0027re telling me you love someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s not blaming me with this. It\u0027s his own fault. \"I didn\u0027t tell you to ask your wife for a divorce. I think I recall kicking you in the nuts and telling you what a lousy lay you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs my shoulders roughly. \"I threw my marriage away for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m frightened but not enough to keep my mouth shut. \"Don\u0027t act like I ruined your marriage. You threw it away without any help from me. Now, I think it\u0027s well past time for you to get the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushes me roughly against the bed. He grabs my wrists and pins them over my head again. \"I came here for you and I\u0027m not leaving until I have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil he has me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0027t register immediately what he means to do until he puts one of his knees between my legs and forces them apart. Oh, God, no. \"No! Please, don\u0027t do this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tries to kiss my mouth but I turn my head and feel his rough stubble scrape harshly down the side of my face and neck. \"Please, stop, Blake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so dramatic. It\u0027s not like we\u0027ve never done this before.\" He grips both of my wrists in one of his large hands and his free one moves down my body until I feel it pull up my dress. I struggle to close my legs, to buck him off, to kick him in the balls—anything to make him stop—but nothing I do is any match for his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m screaming as loud as my voice will let me, but by the time anyone hears me and gets in here, it\u0027ll be too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God. He\u0027s going to do this to me and I can\u0027t stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy realization sends me well beyond full-blown panic mode. My fight-or-flight response kicks in as I jerk my head up from the mattress as hard as I can to head-butt him directly in the face. It hurts like hell, but it\u0027s enough of a blow to make him release me for my one chance at getting away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI streak off the bed but he catches my ankle and forces me down to the floor onto my stomach. My arms are trapped beneath me by the weight of him lying on my back. My chest is pressed into the floor so hard, I can barely breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the warm ooze of what I know is blood running down my forehead and it gets into my eyes, blinding me. I blink to clear my vision so I can see to run when I get another opportunity, but then I feel his hand up the back of my dress and inside my underwear. I feel his fingers there and he gives my panties a quick jerk, forcefully pulling them down my legs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-22.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
