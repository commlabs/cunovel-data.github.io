Somewhere in there was one of the best compliments I had ever received. It wasn’t true, of course, what she said about me. If it hadn’t been for Nina, I probably would have acted like all the other men in Heavenly’s life. She didn’t need to know that, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe if you…” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe if I what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother was very beautiful. She died when I was just a kid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, McKenzie, I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the few things I remember about her, she used to say, ‘Pretty is as pretty does.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavenly snickered at that. “It’s easy to have morals when you’re rich,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think people buy them off the shelf at Neiman Marcus? Besides, my mother wasn’t rich. She was a middle-class housewife living in Merriam Park.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this a teaching moment, McKenzie?” she asked. “Are you trying to teach me a lesson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t come here just to get slapped, did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted you to know that I was sorry about what happened last night and that—that I didn’t mean you any harm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I asked you before if you knew who stole the Jade Lily, when we were in the van, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last night didn’t teach you anything, did it, Heavenly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m still going after the Lily, McKenzie. Don’t try to stop me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavenly, you’re alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The story of my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C’mon, give it up, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavenly set two fingers on the fifty-dollar bill and slid it across the table to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can take care of myself,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments later, she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few moments after that, Nina joined me in the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some people never learn,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch was a walleye po’ boy for me and a baby beet and apple salad for Nina. Rickie’s had one of the best menus in town courtesy of her chef, Monica Meyer, a temperamental young woman who once worked for Wolfgang Puck. I liked to tease her because, well, she was so teaseable. If Monica had been there, I probably would have said something about going to Taco Bell to get some real food, but she wasn’t, so I said, “This is fantastic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll tell Monica you said so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you do, I’ll only deny it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it with you and Monica, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s incredibly good at what she does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you harass her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One of the things that I admire most is competence,” I said. “I don’t care what you do as long as you do it well—you could be an accountant, a janitor, a cook, the guy who sharpens my hockey skates, if you’re really good at what you do, you get my admiration and respect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You tease Monica because you admire and respect her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll notice I never pick on people I don’t like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie, if you were a woman you’d be a blonde.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you teasing me, Nina?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder if I should take a sandwich out to the guy who’s following me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina stopped chewing her salad and stared at me from across the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone is following you?” she said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cherry red Acura parked up the street.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” I was skimming the menu. “What’s the least expensive thing you have? Kalua pork quesadilla? That’s way too good for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think he’d like a turkey meatball sandwich?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who wouldn’t? McKenzie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The guy’s an amateur. I could lose him in a minute, don’t worry about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I meant about everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honestly, Nina, I don’t know. Apparently everybody and his brother want the Jade Lily, and they all expect me to either lead them to it or give it up after I make the exchange with the artnappers. I’d like to blow off the whole thing, only I’m afraid of the State Department. I guess I’ll decide what to do with the Lily once I have it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re still going after it despite everything that’s happened, that’s what you’re telling me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dumb blonde. Dumb dishwater blonde.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went on like that for a while, talking about this and that, none of it worth repeating until my cell phone rang. I was prepared to let the call roll over to voice mail—I was having lunch with Nina, after all—until I saw the name of the caller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Chopper,” I said into the microphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie, you still wantin’ t’ meet El Cid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided against buying lunch for my tail. Let the SOB starve. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/curse-of-the-jade-lily-mac-mckenzie-9/page-49.html","bookId":2218,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:54 PM"}
