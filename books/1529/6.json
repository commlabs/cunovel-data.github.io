Gray suspected he was not so much hiding from the world as circling the wagons, seeking a solitary place to protect what remained of his faculties, finding solace in the curl of oak from his wood planer or turn of a well-seated screw. Yet, despite this manner of meditation, Gray recognized the growing fear behind his father\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll let them know,\" Gray mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Painter departed, the last of the straggling partygoers followed in his wake. Some stopped inside to wish his mother well while Gray said his goodbyes to the others. Soon he had the porch to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gray!\" his mother called from inside. \"The trash!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, he bent and recollected the bin with empty bottles, cans, and plastic cups. He would help his mother clean up, then bicycle the short way back across town to his apartment. As he let the screen door clap behind him, he switched off the porch light and headed across the wood floor toward the kitchen. He heard the dishwasher humming, and the clatter of pans in the sink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, I\u0027ll finish up,\" he said as he entered the kitchen. \"Go rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother turned from the sink. She wore navy cotton slacks, a white silk blouse, and a damp checkered apron. At moments like this, harried as she was from an evening of entertaining, his mother\u0027s advancing age suddenly struck him. Who was this gray-haired old woman in his mother\u0027s kitchen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she snapped a wet towel at him and broke the delusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just get the trash. I\u0027m almost finished here. And tell your father to get inside. The Edelmanns do not appreciate his nocturnal woodworking. Oh, and I\u0027ve wrapped up the leftover barbecued chicken. Could you take that to the refrigerator in the garage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to make a second trip.\" He hauled up the two plastic sacks of garbage in one hand and cradled the bin of empty bottles under his arm. \"Be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used his hip to push through the rear door and out into the shadowy backyard. Carefully climbing down the two back steps, he crossed toward the garage and the line of garbage cans along its flank. He found himself moving with a soft tread, attempting to keep the clink of bottles silenced. A Rainbird water sprinkler betrayed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tripped and the bin of bottles rattled as he caught his balance. The back neighbor\u0027s Scottish terrier barked a complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father swore sharply from the garage. \"Gray? If that\u0027s you . . . gimme a goddamn hand in here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray hesitated. After one near shouting match with his father this evening, he didn\u0027t want a midnight encore. Over the past couple years, the two had been getting along fairly well, finding common ground after a lifetime of estrangement. But the past month, as some of his father\u0027s cognitive tests began to slide downward again, an all-too-familiar and unwelcome brittle edge had returned to the taciturn man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gray!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on!\" He dropped the garbage into one of the open cans and settled the bottle bin next to it. Girding himself, Gray crossed into the light flowing from the open garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scent of sawdust and shop oil struck him, reminding him of worse days. Get the goddamn strap, you piece of. . . I\u0027ll make you think twice about using one of my tools. . . get your head out of your ass before I knock you clear to . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father knelt on the floor beside a spilled coffee can of sixpenny nails. He was brushing them up. Gray noted the streak of blood on the floor, from his father\u0027s left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father craned up as Gray stepped inside. Under the fluorescent lights, there was no denying their familial ties. His father\u0027s blue eyes held the same steel as Gray\u0027s. Their faces were both carved into the sharp angles and clefts, marking their Welsh heritage. There was no escaping it. He was becoming his father. And though Gray\u0027s hair was still coal black, he had a few gray hairs to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpotting the bloodied hand, Gray crossed and motioned his father to the back sink. \"Go wash that up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray opened his mouth to argue, thought better, and bent down to help his father. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was looking for wood screws.\" His father waved his cut hand toward the workbench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But these are nails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father\u0027s eyes lit upon him. \"No shit, Sherlock.\" There was a well of anger in his gaze, barely constrained, but Gray knew it wasn\u0027t directed at him lor once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecognizing this, he remained silent and simply gathered the nails back into the coffee can. His father stared down at his hands, one bloody, one not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large man shook his head, then finally said softly, \"Goddamn it. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray offered no argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Gray was young, his father had worked the Texas oil fields until an industrial accident had disabled him, taking a leg off at the knee, turning an oilman into a housewife. Gray had found himself bearing the brunt of his frustration, always found wanting, never able to be the man his father wanted him to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray watched his father stare at his hands and recognized a hard truth. Maybe all along his old man\u0027s anger had been directed inward. Like now. Not so much frustration with a son as a father\u0027s anger at failing to be the man he wanted to be. And now once again, disability was slowly taking even that away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray sought some words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he searched, the roar of a motorcycle sliced through any further contemplation. Down the street, tires squealed, vandalizing asphalt with rubber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray straightened and placed the coffee can atop the bench. His father cursed the rude driver, probably a drunken reveler. Still, Gray swept an arm and doused the garage lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you—?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay down,\" Gray ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cycle appeared, a black and muscular Yamaha V-max. It roared into view, skidding sideways. Its headlamp was off. That\u0027s what had set Gray\u0027s nerves jangling. No spear of light had blazed up the street, fleeing ahead of the engine\u0027s growl. The cycle was running dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout slowing, it skidded sideways. Rear tires smoked as it tried to make the sharp turn into their driveway. It hesitated, balanced, then ripped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell!\" his father barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rider overcompensated for the turn. The bike bobbled, then the bump of the curb sent the vehicle careening to the side. The rider fought for control, but the rear fender caught the edge of the porch step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bike went down in a showering skid of red sparks, becoming yet another Fourth of July display. Thrown, the rider shoulder-rolled end over end, landing in a sprawl not far from the open garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarther down the drive, the bike\u0027s engine choked and died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparks blew out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus H. Christ!\" his father exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray held a hand back for his father to stay in the garage. His other hand pulled a 9mm Glock from an ankle holster. He crossed toward the prone figure, all dressed in black: leather, scarf, and helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft groan revealed two things: The rider was still alive, and it was a woman. She lay curled on her side, leathers ripped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray\u0027s mother appeared at the back door to the house, standing in the porchlight, drawn by the noise. \"Gray . .. ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay there!\" he called to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Gray approached the downed rider, he noticed something lying steps away from the bike, its black shape crisp against the white cement of the driveway. It looked like some stubby pillar of black stone, cracked from the impact. From out its dark interior, the glint of a metallic core reflected the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was the glint of another bit of silver that caught his eye as he stepped to the rider\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small pendant around the woman\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the shape of a dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray recognized it immediately. He wore the same around his own neck, a gift from an old enemy, a warning and a promise when next their paths crossed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grip on his pistol tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled from her shoulder to her back with another small groan. Blood streamed across the white cement, a black river forging toward the mowed back lawn. Gray recognized a raw exit wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShot from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand reached up and pulled back the helmet. A familiar face, tight with agony, stared up at him, framed in black hair. Tanned skin and almond eyes revealed her Eurasian descent and her identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seichan . ..\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand reached to him, scrabbling. \"Commander Pierce . .. help me .. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the pain in her words—but also something he\u0027d thought he\u0027d never hear from this cold enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloody Christmas\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 5, 11:02 a.m. Christmas Island\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJUST ANOTHER LAZY DAY at the beach . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk Kokkalis followed his guide along the narrow strand. Both men wore identical Bio-3 contamination suits. Not the best choice of apparel for strolling along a tropical beach. Under his suit, Monk had stripped to a pair of boxer trunks. Still, he felt overdressed as he slowly baked inside the sealed plastic. Shading his eyes against the midday glare, he stared out at the nearby horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe western bay of Christmas Island frothed and churned with the dead, as if hell itself had washed up out of the deep. Mounds of fish carcasses marked last night\u0027s high tide. Larger hillocks of shark, dolphin, turtle, even a pygmy whale, dotted the beach—though it remained hard to tell where one began and the other ended, flesh and scale melted into a reeking mass of bone and rotting tissue. There were also scores of Seabirds, contorted and dead, on the beach and in the water, perhaps attracted by the slaughter only to succumb to the same poisoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nearby blowhole in the rock spewed a fountain of sludgy seawater with a ringing bellow, as if the ocean itself were gasping its last breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDucking under the spray, the pair of men worked north along the beach, traversing a narrow trail of clear sand between the foulness of the tidal zone and steep jungle-shrouded cliffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remind me to skip the seafood buffet back on the ship,\" Monk mumbled through the rasp of his respirator. He was glad for his suit\u0027s canned air. He could only imagine the reek that must accompany this tidal graveyard. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-6.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
