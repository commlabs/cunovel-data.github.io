The word is that it\u0027s going to be hot! Hot! Hot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara slammed the newspaper down. It had to be Gertrude Meeks, the secretary she had fired! Lara sent for Jerry Town send. \"Have you seen Liz Smith\u0027s column this morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I just read it. There isn\u0027t much we can do about it, boss. If you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a lot we can do. All my employees sign an agreement that they will not write anything about me dur ing or after their employment here. Gertrude Meeks has no right to do this. I\u0027m going to sue the publisher for all he\u0027s worth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry Townsend shook his head. \"I wouldn\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it will create a lot of unfavorable publicity. If you let it ride, it becomes a small wind that will blow over. If you try to stop it, it will become a hurricane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened, unimpressed. \"Find out who owns the com pany,\" Lara ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hour later Lara was speaking on the phone to Henry Seinfeld, the owner and publisher of Candlelight Press.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Lara Cameron. I understand you intend to publish a book about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You read the Liz Smith item, huh? Yes, it\u0027s true, Miss Cameron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to warn you that if you publish the book, I\u0027m going to sue you for invasion of privacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice at the other end of the phone said, \"I think perhaps you should check with your attorney. You\u0027re a public figure, Miss Cameron. You have no right of privacy. And according to Gertrude Meeks\u0027s manuscript, you\u0027re quite a colorful character.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gertrude Meeks signed a paper forbidding her to write anything about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s between you and Gertrude. You can sue her...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut by then, of course, the book would be out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want it published. If I can make it worth your while not to publish it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on. I think you\u0027re treading on dangerous ground. I would suggest that we terminate this conversation. Good bye.\" The line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn him! Lara sat there thinking. She sent for Howard Keller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know about Candlelight Press?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"They\u0027re a small outfit. They do exploitation books. They did a hatchet job on Cher, Madonna...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller had a headache. It seemed to him that he was getting a lot of headaches lately. Not enough sleep. He was under pressure, and he felt that things were moving too rapidly. He had to find a way to slow Lara down. Maybe this was a hunger headache. He buzzed his secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bess, order some lunch in for me, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you joking, Mr. Keller?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joking? No, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just had your lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller felt a chill go through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you\u0027re still hungry...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. \"He remembered now. He had had a salad and a roast beef sandwich and...My God, he thought, what\u0027s happening to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just kidding, Bess,\" he said. Who am i kidding?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opening of the Cameron Palace in Reno was a smash. The hotel was fully booked, and the casino was crowded with players. Lara had spared no expense to see that the invited celebrities were well taken care of. Everyone was there. There\u0027s only one person missing, Lara thought. Philip. He had sent an enormous bouquet of flowers with a note: \"You\u0027re the music in my life. I adore you and miss you. Hub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Martin arrived. He came up to Lara. \"Congratula tions. You\u0027ve outdone yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks to you, Paul. I couldn\u0027t have done it without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was looking around. \"Where\u0027s Philip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t be here. He\u0027s on tour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s out playing piano somewhere? This is a big night for you, Lara. He should be at your side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara smiled. \"He really wanted to be. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager of the hotel came up to Lara. \"This is quite a night, isn\u0027t it? The hotel is fully booked for the next three months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s keep it that way, Donald.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara had hired a Japanese and a Brazilian agent to bring in big players from abroad. She had spent a million dollars on each of the luxury suites, but it was going to pay off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a gold mine here, Miss Cameron,\" the man ager said. He looked around. \"By the way, where\u0027s your husband? I\u0027ve been looking forward to meeting him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t be here,\" Lara said. He\u0027s out playing the piano somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entertainment was brilliant, but Lara was the star of the evening. Sammy Cahn had written special lyrics for \"My Kind of Town.\" It went, \"My kind of gal, Lara is...\" She got up to make a speech, and there was enthusiastic applause. Everyone wanted to meet her, to touch her. The press was there in full force, and Lara gave interviews for television, radio, and the press. It all went well until the interviewers asked, \"Where\u0027s your husband tonight?\" And Lara found herself getting more and more upset. He should have been at my side. The concert could have waited. But she smiled sweetly and said, \"Philip was so disappointed he couldn\u0027t be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the entertainment was over, there was dancing. Paul Martin walked up to Lara\u0027s table. \"Shall we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara rose and stepped into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does it feel owning all this?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It feels wonderful. Thanks for all your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are friends for? I notice that you have some heavy weight gamblers here. Be careful with them, Lara. Some of them are going to lose big, and you have to make them feel like they\u0027re winners. Get them a new car or girls or anything that will make them feel important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll remember,\" Lara said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to hold you again,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Do you remember what I said about your husband taking good care of you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t seem to be doing a very good job. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip wanted to be here,\" Lara said defensively. And even as she said it, she thought, Did he really? He telephoned her late that night, and the sound of his voice made her twice as lonely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lara, I\u0027ve been thinking about you all day, darling. How did the opening go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderfully. I wish you could have been here, Philip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I. I miss you like crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why aren\u0027t you here with me? \"I miss you, too. Hurry home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller walked into Lara\u0027s office carrying a thick manila envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to like this,\" Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller laid the envelope on Lara\u0027s desk. \"This is a copy of Gertrude Meeks\u0027s manuscript. Don\u0027t ask me how I got hold of it. We could both go to jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you read it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Yes. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027d better read it yourself. She wasn\u0027t even working here when some of these things happened. She must have done a lot of digging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Howard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara waited until he left the office; then she pressed down the key on the intercom. \"No calls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the manuscript and began to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was devastating. It was a portrait of a scheming, domi neering woman who had clawed her way to the top. It depicted her temper tantrums and her imperious manner with her em ployees. It was meanspirited, filled with nasty little anec dotes. What the manuscript left out was Lara\u0027s independence and courage, her talent and vision and generosity. She went on reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...One of the Iron Butterfly\u0027s tricks was to schedule her business meetings early on the first morning of negotia tions, so that the others were jet-lagged and Cameron was fresh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...At a meeting with the Japanese, they were served tea with Valium in it, while Lara Cameron drank coffee with Ritalin, a stimulant that speeds up the thought process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...At a meeting with some German bankers, they were served coffee with Valium, while she drank tea with Ritalin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...When Lara Cameron was negotiating for the Queens property and the community board turned her down, she got them to change their mind by making up a story that she had a young daughter who was going to live in one of the build ings...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...When tenants refused to leave the building at the Dorchester Apartments, Lara Cameron filled it with homeless people....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing had been left out. When Lara finished reading it, she sat at her desk for a long time, motionless. She sent for Howard Keller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to run a Dun and Bradstreet on Henry Seinfeld. He owns Candlelight Press.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was back fifteen minutes later. \"Seinfeld has a D-C rating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the lowest rating there is. A fourth-line credit rating is poor, and he\u0027s four notches below that. A good stiff wind would blow him over. He lives from book to book. One flop and he\u0027s out of business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Howard.\" She telephoned Terry Hill, her attor ney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terry, how would you like to be a book publisher?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you have in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to buy Candlelight Press in your name. It\u0027s owned by Henry Seinfeld.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That should be no problem. How much do you want to pay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to buy him out for five hundred thousand. If you have to, go to a million. Make sure that the deal includes all the literary properties he owns. Keep my name out of it. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe offices of Candlelight Press were downtown in an old building on Thirty-fourth Street. Henry Seinfeld\u0027s quarters consisted of a small secretarial office and a slightly larger office for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeinfeld\u0027s secretary said, \"There\u0027s a Mr. Hill to see you, Mr. Seinfeld.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry Hill had called earlier that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked into the shabby little office. Seinfeld was sitting behind the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you, Mr. Hill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m representing a German publishing company that might be interested in buying your company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeinfeld took his time lighting a cigar. \"My company\u0027s not for sale,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s too bad. We\u0027re trying to break into the Ameri can market, and we like your operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve built this company up from scratch,\" Seinfeld said. \"It\u0027s like my baby. I\u0027d hate to part with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand how you feel,\" the lawyer said sympatheti cally. \"We\u0027d be willing to give you five hundred thousand dollars fork. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeinfeld almost choked on his cigar. \"Five hundred? Hell, I\u0027ve got one book coming out that\u0027s going to be worth a million dollars alone. No, sir. Your offer\u0027s an insult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My offer\u0027s a gift. You have no assets, and you\u0027re over a hundred thousand dollars in debt. I checked. Tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll go up to six hundred thousand. That\u0027s my final offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d never forgive myself. Now, if you could see your way clear to going to seven...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry Hill rose to his feet. \"Good-bye, Mr. Seinfeld. I\u0027ll find another company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" Seinfeld said. \"Let\u0027s not be hasty. The fact is, my wife\u0027s been after me to retire. Maybe this would be a good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry Hill walked over to the desk and pulled a contract out of his pocket. \"I have a check here for six hundred thousand dollars. Just sign where the X is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara sent for Keller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We just bought Candlelight Press.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.

Jack Hellman, Hellman Realty. Dear Jack, I discussed your offer with Miss Cameron, and we feel that it would be unwise to go into your venture at this time. However, we want you to know that we would be interested in any future...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis secretary had stopped taking notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller looked up. \"Do you have that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was staring at him. \"Mr. Keller?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dictated this letter yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller swallowed. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s already gone out in the mail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller tried to smile. \"I guess I\u0027m on over load.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt four o\u0027clock that afternoon Keller was being examined by Dr. Seymour Bennett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem to be in excellent shape,\" Dr. Bennett said. \"Physically, there\u0027s nothing wrong with you at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about these lapses of memory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long since you\u0027ve had a vacation, Howard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller tried to think. \"I guess it\u0027s been quite a few years,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve been pretty busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Bennett smiled. \"There you are. You\u0027re on overload.\" That word again. \"This is more common than you think. Go somewhere where you can relax for a week or two. Get business off your mind. When you come back, you\u0027ll feel like a new man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller stood up, relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller went to see Lara in her office. \"Could you spare me for a week?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About as easily as I can spare my right arm. What did you have in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The doctor thinks I should take a little vacation, Lara. To tell you the truth, I\u0027ve been having some problems with my memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was watching him, concerned. \"Anything serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not really. It\u0027s just annoying. I thought I might go to Hawaii for a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the jet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, you\u0027ll be using it.

I don\u0027t want anything to happen to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope he\u0027s all right, Lara thought. He\u0027s got to be all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip telephoned the next day. When Marian Bell said, \"Mr. Adler is calling from Taipei,\" Lara hurriedly picked up the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, darling.

How is the tour going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the usual. I miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the background Lara could hear music and voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they\u0027re giving a little party for me. You know how it is. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara could hear the sound of a woman laughing. \"Yes, I know how it is. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be home Wednesday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Philip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, darling.

She was filled with a sense of jealousy so strong that it almost smothered her. She had never been jealous of anyone in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything is so perfect, Lara thought. / don\u0027t want to lose it. I can\u0027t lose it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay awake thinking about Philip and what he was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller was stretched out on Kona Beach at a small hotel on the big island of Hawaii. The weather had been ideal. He had gone swimming every day. He had gotten a tan, played some golf, and had daily massages. He was completely relaxed and had never felt better. Dr. Bennett was right, he thought. Overload. I\u0027m going to have to slow down a little when I get back. The truth was that the episodes of memory loss had frightened him more than he wanted to admit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it was time to return to New York. He took a midnight flight back and was in Manhattan at four o\u0027clock in the afternoon. He went directly to the office. His secretary was there, smiling. \"Welcome back, Mr. Keller. You look great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you...\" He stood there, and his face drained of color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not remember her name. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-27.html","bookId":2364,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM"}
