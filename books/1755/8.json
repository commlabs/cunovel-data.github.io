He made no actual motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice remained under strict control. He said, \"Whose son? What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure of it.\" The hermit leaned forward, seizing Lucky\u0027s wrist earnestly. \"I knew Lawrence Starr well. He was my friend. He helped me once when I needed help. And you\u0027re his image. I couldn\u0027t be wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky pulled his hand away. \"You\u0027re not making sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, son, it may be important to you not to give away your identity. Maybe you don\u0027t trust me. All right, I\u0027m not telling you to trust me. I\u0027ve been working with the pirates and I\u0027ve admitted it. But listen to me anyway. The men of the asteroids have a good organization. It may take them weeks, but if Anton suspects you, they won\u0027t stop till you\u0027re checked from the ground up. No phony story will fool them. They\u0027ll get the truth and they\u0027ll learn who you are. Be sure of that! They\u0027ll get your true identity. Leave, I tell you. Leave!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"If I were this guy you say I am, old-timer, aren\u0027t you getting yourself into trouble? I take it you want me to use your ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what would you do when the pirates returned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be here. Don\u0027t you see? I want to go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And leave all you have here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man hesitated. \"Yes, it\u0027s hard. But I won\u0027t have a chance like this again. You\u0027re a man of influence; you must be. You\u0027re a member of the Council of Science, perhaps. You\u0027re here on secret work. They\u0027ll believe you. You could protect me, vouch for me. You would prevent prosecution, see that no harm came to me from the pirates. It would pay the Council, young man. I would tell them all I know about the pirates. I would co-operate in every way I could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Where do you keep your ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a deal, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just asking to see your ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship was a small one indeed. The two reached it through a narrow corridor, walking single file, their figures grotesque again in space-suits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Is Ceres close enough to pick out by ship\u0027s telescope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could recognize it without trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get on board, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fore end of the airless cavern that housed the ship opened outward as soon as the ship\u0027s motors were activated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Radio control,\" explained Hansen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship was fueled and provisioned. It worked smoothly, rising out of its berth and into space with the ease and freedom possible only where gravitational forces were virtually lacking. For the first time Lucky saw Hansen\u0027s asteroid from space. He caught a glimpse of the valley of the discarded cans, brighter than the surrounding rock, just before it passed into shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHansen said, \"Tell me, now. You are the son of Lawrence Starr, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky had located a well-charged blaster and a holster belt to boot. He was strapping it on as he spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name,\" he said, \"is David Starr. Most people call me Lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeres is a monster among the asteroids. It is nearly five hundred miles in diameter, and, standing upon it, the average man actually weighs two full pounds. It is quite spherical in shape, and anyone very close to it in space could easily think it a respectable planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, if the Earth were hollow, it would be possible to throw into it four thousand bodies the size of Ceres before filling it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman stood on the surface of Ceres, his figure bloated in a space-suit which had been loaded to bursting with lead weights and on shoes the soles of which were foot-thick lead clogs. It had been his own idea, but it was quite useless. He still weighed less than four pounds and his every motion threatened to twist him up into space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been on Ceres for days now, since the quick space flight with Conway and Henree from the Moon, waiting for this moment, waiting for Lucky Starr to send in the radio message that he was coming in. Gus Henree and Hector Conway had been nervous about it, fearing Lucky\u0027s death, worrying about it. He, Bigman, had known better. Lucky could come through anything. He told them that. When Lucky\u0027s message finally came, he told them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just the same, out here on Ceres\u0027 frozen soil with nothing between himself and the stars, he admitted a sneaking sensation of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom where he sat he was looking directly at the dome of the Observatory, its lower reaches dipping just a little below the close horizon. It was the largest observatory in the Terrestrial Empire for a very logical reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that part of the Solar System inside the orbit of Jupiter, the planets Venus, Earth, and Mars had atmospheres and were by that very fact poorly suited for astronomic observation. The interfering air, even when it was as thin as that of Mars, blotted out the finer detail. It wavered and flickered star images and spoiled things generally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe largest airless object inside Jupiter\u0027s orbit was Mercury, but that was so close to the Sun that the observatory in its twilight zone specialized in solar observations. Relatively small telescopes sufficed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second largest airless object was the Moon. Here again circumstances dictated specialization. Weather forecasts on Earth, for instance, had become an accurate, long-range science, since the appearance of Earth\u0027s atmosphere could be viewed as a whole from a distance of a quarter of a million miles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the third largest airless object was Ceres, and that was the best of the three. Its almost nonexistent gravity allowed huge lenses and mirrors to be poured without the danger of breakage, without even the question of sag, due to its own weight. The structure of the telescope tube itself needed no particular strength. Ceres was nearly three times as far from the Sun as was the Moon and sunlight was only one eighth as strong. Its rapid revolution kept Ceres\u0027 temperature almost constant. In short, Ceres was ideal for observation of the stars and of the outer planets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the day before Bigman had seen Saturn through the thousand-inch reflecting telescope, the grinding of the huge mirror having consumed twenty years of painstaking and continuous labor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I look through?\" he had asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey laughed at him. \"You don\u0027t look through anything,\" they said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey worked the controls carefully, three of them, each doing something that co-ordinated with the other two, until all were satisfied. The dim red lights dimmed further and in the pit of black emptiness about which they sat a blob of light sprang into being. A touch at the controls and it focused sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman whistled his astonishment. It was Saturn!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Saturn, three feet wide, exactly as he had seen it from space half a dozen times. Its triple rings were bright and he could see three marble-like moons. Behind it was a numerous dusting of stars. Bigman wanted to walk about it to see how it looked with the night shadow cutting it, but the picture didn\u0027t change as he moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just an image,\" they told him, \"an illusion. You see the same thing no matter where you stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, from the asteroid\u0027s surface, Bigman could spot Saturn with the naked eye. It was just a white dot, but brighter than the other white dots that were the stars. It was twice as bright as it appeared from Earth, since it was two hundred million miles closer here. Earth itself was on the other side of Ceres near the pea-size Sun. Earth wasn\u0027t a very impressive sight, since the Sun invariably dwarfed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman\u0027s helmet suddenly rang with sound as the call flooded his left-open radio receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Shortie, get moving. There\u0027s a ship coming in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman jumped at the noise and moved straight upward, limbs flailing. He yelled, \"Who\u0027re you calling Shortie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the other was laughing. \"Hey, how much do you charge for flying lessons, little boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll little boy you,\" screamed Bigman furiously. He had reached the peak of his parabola and was slowly and hesitatingly beginning to settle downward once more. \"What\u0027s your name, wise guy? Say your name, and I\u0027ll crack your gizzard as soon as I get back and peel the suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think you can reach my gizzard?\" came the mocking rejoinder, and Bigman would have exploded into tiny pieces if he had not caught sight of a ship slanting down from the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loped in giant, clumsy strides about the leveled square mile of ground that was the asteroid\u0027s space-port, trying to judge the exact spot on which the ship would land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt dropped down its steaming jets to a feather-touch planetary contact and when the air-locks opened and Lucky\u0027s tall, suited figure emerged, Bigman, yelling his joy, made one long leap of it, and they were together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConway and Henree were less effusive in their welcome, but no less joyful. Each wrung Lucky\u0027s hand as though to confirm, by sheer muscular pressure, the reality of the flesh and blood they beheld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky laughed. \"Whoa, will you? Give me a chance to breathe. What\u0027s the matter? Didn\u0027t you think I was coming back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look here,\" said Conway, \"you\u0027d better consult us before you take off on just any old fool notion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, now, not if it\u0027s too much of a fool notion, please, or you won\u0027t let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind that. I can ground you for what you\u0027ve done. I can have you put under detention right now. I can suspend you. I can throw you off the Council,\" said Conway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which of them are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of them, you darned overgrown young fool. But I may beat your brains out one of these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky turned to Augustus Henree. \"You won\u0027t let him, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frankly, I\u0027ll help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I give up in advance. Look, there\u0027s a gentleman here I\u0027d like to have you meet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil now Hansen had remained in the background, obviously amused by the interchange of nonsense. The two older Councilmen had been too full of Lucky Starr even to be aware of his existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Conway,\" said Lucky, \"Dr. Henree, this is Mr. Joseph P. Hansen, the man whose ship I used to come back. He has been of considerable assistance to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old hermit shook hands with the two scientists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose you can possibly know Drs. Conway and Henree,\" said Lucky. The hermit shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he went on, \"they\u0027re important officials in the Council of Science. After you\u0027ve eaten and had a chance to rest, they\u0027ll talk to you and help you, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later the two Councilmen faced Lucky with somber expressions. Dr. Henree tamped tobacco into his pipe with a little finger, and smoked quietly as he listened to Lucky\u0027s accounts of his adventures with the pirates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you told this to Bigman?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve just spent some time talking to him,\" said Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he didn\u0027t assault you for not taking him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t pleased,\" Lucky admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Conway\u0027s mind was more seriously oriented. \"A Sirian-designed ship, eh?\" he mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Undoubtedly so,\" said Lucky. \"At least we have that piece of information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The information wasn\u0027t worth the risk,\" said Conway, dryly. \"I\u0027m much more disturbed over another piece of information we have now. It\u0027s obvious that the Sirian organization penetrates into the Council of Science itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenree nodded gravely. \"Yes, I saw that, too. Very bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"How do you make that out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Galaxy, boy, it\u0027s obvious,\" growled Conway. \"I\u0027ll admit that we had a large construction crew working on the ship and that even with the best intentions careless slips of information can take place. It remains truth, though, that the fact of the booby-trapping and particularly the exact manner of the fusing were known only to Council members and not too many of those. Somewhere in that small group is a spy, yet I could have sworn that all were faithful.\" He shook his head. \"I still can\u0027t believe otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to,\" said Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? And why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the Sirian contact was quite temporary. The Sirian Embassy got their information from me\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-pirates-of-the-asteroids-lucky-starr-2/page-8.html","bookId":1755,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 AM"}
