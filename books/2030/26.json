There were six guards blocking the exits and another four at the door, checking everyone as they left. Ten total. All in body armor and masks, explaining patiently that there had been a bomb threat and it was important to evacuate as quickly as possible. No one questioned why they were armed with the automatic weapons they kept using to push the crowd along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one except Dr. Trope, who went up to one of them and said, \"Young man, I ask you to keep your weapons away from my students,\" distracting him just long enough for Miranda and Sibby to get swallowed into the middle of the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d navigated by the first two storm troopers, with only two left when Ariel yelled, \"Dr. Trope? Dr. Trope? Look, there she is, Miranda Kiss. I told you she crashed the prom. She\u0027s right there in the middle. You have to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour men with automatic weapons suddenly swiveled and waded into the mass of students. Miranda whispered, \"Duck,\" to Sibby and the two of them bobbed beneath the surface of the crowd, crawling back into the Great Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her she heard Dr. Trope saying, \"Where is she? Where did she go? I\u0027m not leaving one of my pupils in there.\" And the storm trooper saying, \"Please, sir, you need to evacuate. We\u0027ll find her. Rest assured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda decided that if she got out of this alive, she\u0027d be a lot nicer to Dr. Trope. If.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dragged Sibby over to Old Faithful and said, \"In there. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t I hide in the White House? Why does it have to be in the volcano?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might need part of the White House. Please, just do it. They won\u0027t be able to make you out if they have night goggles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you? You\u0027re wearing white.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I match the decorations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, you\u0027re really good at this. This planning stuff. How\u0027d you learn how to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda was wondering the same thing. Wondering why as soon as she\u0027d heard the announcement some part of her brain had started measuring her distance to the exits, looking around for weapons, watching the door. Her senses going into overdrive was a relief; it meant some of her powers were cooperating. But did she have the strength to take on ten armed men? The most she\u0027d ever taken on at one time before was three, and they hadn\u0027t been toting machine guns. She\u0027d have to be crafty rather than direct. She said to Sibby, \"Give me your boots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To get rid of some of our competition so we can get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I really like these-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give them to me. And also a rubber bracelet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda set her trap, then held her breath as a guard approached. She heard him say into the walkie-talkie, \"Southwest pillar. I\u0027ve got one,\" and saw the ribbons stir as he used the butt of his gun to push them aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeard him say, \"What the-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd fired George Washington\u0027s sugar nose at him with the slingshot she\u0027d made out of Sibby\u0027s rubber bracelet and a fork. All her target work paid off because it hit him at exactly the right point to send him plunging forward. He went down headfirst just hard enough to be disoriented and docile while she tied his hands and feet with the ribbons from the pillar. \"I\u0027m really sorry,\" she said, flipping him over to gag him with a piece of dinner roll, then smiled. \"Oh, hi, Craig. Not your day, is it? I hope your head\u0027s feeling better. What? It\u0027s not? It will. Try rubbing some insta-hot on your wrists and ankles when they untie you. Bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d just grabbed the boots she\u0027d used at the base of the column as a decoy when she heard another guard coming fast from her left. She threw a boot at him Frisbee style and heard a satisfying swack as he fell down, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo down, eight to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was apologizing to the one she\u0027d hit with the shoe, who was out cold-it was nice to know ankle boots were good for something-when the walkie-talkie on his belt came to life. \"Leon, this is the Gardener. Where are you? State your position. Copy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda picked up the unconscious guard\u0027s walkie-talkie and said into it, \"I thought your name was Caleb Reynolds, Deputy. Why the Gardener stuff? Or, as my friend likes to call you, Plant Boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crackle. Then Deputy Reynolds\u0027s voice through the walkie-talkie. \"Miranda? Is that you? Where are you? Miranda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here,\" she whispered in his ear. She\u0027d snuck up behind him, and now as he turned, her arm came around his neck with the heel of the boot pointed at his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you stabbing me with?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All you need to know is that it\u0027s going to cause you a lot of pain and probably a bad infection if you don\u0027t start telling me how many people there are here and what their plan is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are ten in here, five more watching the exits outside. But I\u0027m on your side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, Gardener? That\u0027s not how it looked at the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t give me a chance to talk to the girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have to do better than that. I\u0027m not a mix tape, you can\u0027t play me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea what she is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" What she is? Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart rate sped up now. \"She\u0027s a real-life flesh-and-blood prophet. The Cumean Sibyl. She\u0027s one of ten people who between them supposedly know and can control the whole future of the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. I thought she was just an annoying fourteen-year-old with wild hormones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Sibyl operates through different bodies. Or that\u0027s what they think. These people I\u0027m working with. Wack jobs. They pretend they want to protect her, keep her prophecies from being exploited by the unscrupulous, but I think they\u0027re actually into extortion. I heard one of them say they could ransom the girl for eight figures.\" His heart rate slowed as he talked. \"My job was to find out where she was supposed to be picked up, so they could send someone there with some trinket of hers to show we had her, and get the Overseer to pay up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda didn\u0027t like the sound of the word trinket at all. \"But you weren\u0027t going to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re just using this religion stuff as a cover for their greed. It\u0027s disgusting. I\u0027m all set to stop them, and then you\"-getting agitated, his heartbeat spiking-\"you come along in the middle and mess it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda knew he was genuinely angry. \"Stop them how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was supposed to be getting the location of her pickup place from her, right? When you crashed in, I was going to tell her what to say, a place I\u0027d picked out with the task force, then when the wackos went there, they\u0027d be picked up by the police. Meanwhile I\u0027d get the Sibyl safely to the real rendezvous. But you come in and blow it. Months of police work down the tubes.\" His heartbeat was slow and even again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda let him go. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to scowl at her, changing it to a half smile when he saw what she was wearing. \"Nice look on you.\" He paused for a second, then said, \"You know, there\u0027s a way we could still make this work. Do you have another outfit like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My skating uniform? Yeah. But it\u0027s not the same color. It\u0027s more blue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter as long as it\u0027s close. With you two dressed as twins we\u0027ll be able to fool them into thinking that you\u0027re the Sibyl, use you as a decoy while we sneak her out to safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalking quickly, he outlined the rest of his plan. Miranda said, \"It would be better if we wore the wigs and masks, too. To complete the disguise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. Perfect. Go toward the employee entrance, the one you used to sneak in. There\u0027s someone guarding the outer door but there\u0027s a door on the left that is clear. It goes to an office. I\u0027ll deal with these guys and then come-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped talking, lifted his gun, and fired behind her. Turning, Miranda saw he\u0027d shot one of the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He saw us together,\" he told her. \"I couldn\u0027t let one of those bastards get you or tell the others. I\u0027ll distract them, keep them over here. You get the Sibyl, change, and wait for me in the office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was already moving away when she paused and said, \"How did you find us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heartbeat slowed. \"Put out a bulletin on your car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have thought of that,\" Miranda said, then took off as he radioed, \"Man down-man down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby was frantic when Miranda got back to her. \"What happened? Did you get shot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I got us a ride out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda explained as they changed, then skirted the edges of the Great Hall toward the director\u0027s office. As they moved, she heard Deputy Reynolds barking orders to the guards, keeping them busy in other parts of the room, saying at one point, \"No, don\u0027t turn on the lights-that will give them an advantage!\" At another, heard a grunt of pain that sounded like someone being knocked out. She was impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the director\u0027s office without running into anyone. Sibby sat in the desk chair. Miranda was pacing, walking back and forth to the ticktock of the big clock on the director\u0027s mantelpiece, picking up and putting down objects, a crystal bowl, a box of stationery, weighing them in her hand. A family picture of a man, woman, two small boys, a dog sitting together at the edge of a pier with the sun setting behind them. The dog was wearing someone\u0027s hat, a real full member of the family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand came down in front of the picture. \"Hello, Miranda? I was asking you something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda put the picture down. \"Sorry. What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know you\u0027re right about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just do. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you\u0027re wrong-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clock ticked. Miranda paced. Sibby said, \"I hate that clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTick. Pace. Sibby: \"I\u0027m not sure I can do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda stopped and looked at her. \"Of course you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not brave like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me? The girl who got-how many guys is it now? Twenty-three?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-four guys to kiss her? You\u0027re brave.\" Miranda hesitated. \"Know how many guys I\u0027ve kissed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSibby gaped at her, burst out laughing. \"Gods, no wonder you\u0027re so repressed. This had better work or you\u0027ll have had one seriously sad life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-26.html","bookId":2030,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM"}
