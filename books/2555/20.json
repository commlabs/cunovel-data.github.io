It all seems implausible and impossible. Has anything actually happened at all? I still can\u0027t help wondering if this is all just the result of peoples\u0027 fucked-up and overenthusiastic imaginations or whether there really is something more sinister and bizarre going on? In the cold light of morning it\u0027s difficult to try and comprehend all that I\u0027ve seen and heard. I start trying to convince myself to get a grip, get up and get ready for work. But then I remember what I saw in Millennium Square yesterday and I\u0027m overcome with nerves and uncertainty as the reality of it all hits me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no point just lying here. Lizzie and the kids are asleep. It\u0027s still dark outside but I get up and shuffle through to the living room. I peer out of the window. The car belonging to the people upstairs still hasn\u0027t returned. What happened up there? My mind starts to wander and play tricks. Was there a Hater upstairs? It scares me to think that my kids could have been so close to one of them. I force myself to remember Lizzie\u0027s words when we were awake earlier. I have to ignore what\u0027s going on everywhere else and concentrate on keeping the people on this side of the front door safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flat feels colder than ever this morning and the low temperature makes me feel old beyond my years. I fetch some breakfast and then sit in front of the TV. I watch cartoons. I can\u0027t cope with anything more serious. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m halfway through a bowl of dry cereal and I can\u0027t eat any more. I don\u0027t have much of an appetite. I feel uneasy all the time and I can\u0027t stop thinking about what\u0027s happening out there. What the hell is going on? I think about all the unconnected events I\u0027ve witnessed and the hundreds - probably thousands - of other incidents which have happened elsewhere. No-one can see any connection and yet how can all of these things not be connected? That, I decide, is the most frightening aspect of all. How can so many people from so many different walks of life begin to behave so irrationally and erratically in such a short period of time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at the clock and realise that I should be getting ready for work now. My stomach starts to turn somersaults when I think about having to phone in and speak to Tina. Christ knows what she\u0027s going to say or what I\u0027m going to tell her. Maybe I just won\u0027t phone at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy curiosity and apprehension gets the better of me. I finally relent and switch on the news. Half of me wants to know what\u0027s happening today, the other half wants to go back to bed, put my head under the pillow and not get up again until it\u0027s all over. And that causes me to ask myself yet another unanswerable question - how will this end? Will this wave of violence and destruction just fade and die out, or will it keep building and building?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe TV news channel looks different this morning, and for a while I can\u0027t put my finger on why. The set is the same and the female presenter is familiar. I don\u0027t recognise the man who\u0027s sitting next to her. Must be a stand-in. I guess the usual newsreader didn\u0027t turn up for work today. Half the staff didn\u0027t turn up at my office yesterday. There\u0027s no reason why things should be any different for the people on TV, is there? Except, perhaps, the fact that they get paid a hell of a lot more than me for doing a hell of a lot less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe news is running on a loop again. It seems to be just the headlines on repeat, introduced by these two presenters. There\u0027s no sport or entertainment or business news anymore, and the reports I\u0027m watching are all similar to those we\u0027ve seen before. No explanations, just basic information. Occasionally the cycle is interrupted when one of the newsreaders interviews someone in authority. I\u0027ve seen politicians, religious leaders and others being interviewed over the last few days. They can all talk the talk and most of them know how to play up to the camera, but none of them can disguise the fact that they seem to know as little about what\u0027s happening as the rest of us. And there are other people who I would have expected to see interviewed who have been conspicuous by their absence. What about the Prime Minister and other top-level politicians? Why aren\u0027t they showing their faces? Are they too busy trying to personally deal with the crisis (I doubt it) or could it be that they\u0027re no longer in office? Could the head of government or the chief of police be Haters?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male newsreader is talking about schools and businesses remaining closed when a sudden flurry of movement in front of the camera interrupts him. He looks up as a scruffy figure carrying a clipboard and wearing headphones stumbles into view. It\u0027s a tall, willowy woman who walks back until she\u0027s almost standing right against the newsreaders\u0027 desk. Is she a producer or director or something like that? She crouches down slightly to make sure the camera is properly focussed on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t listen to any more of this rubbish,\u0027 she says, her weary face desperate and tear-streaked. \u0027You\u0027re only being told half the story. Don\u0027t listen to anything they tell you...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she\u0027s gone. There\u0027s more movement all around her before the pictures disappear and the screen goes black. After a wait of a few more long and uncomfortable seconds the broadcast returns. It\u0027s a report about personal safety and security that I\u0027ve seen at least five times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it that we\u0027re not being told? That woman looked desperate, like she\u0027d been trying to get an opportunity to speak out for days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI phoned the office a few minutes ago but there was no answer. I was relieved when I didn\u0027t have to speak to anyone but then I started to panic again when I thought about how bad things must have got if no-one\u0027s turned up for work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s nothing else to do now except sit back on the sofa in front of the TV and watch the world fall apart. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hater-hater-1/page-20.html","bookId":2555,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:46:24 AM"}
