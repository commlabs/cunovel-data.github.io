Bai Xiaochun’s Undying Emperor’s Fist engulfed everything in the area, unleashing quintuple his ordinary fleshly body power to create a force that was like a meteor that could destroy the world!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMaster Cloud Lightning’s Forefather Transformation was similarly a peak-level divine ability, something that could fundamentally alter the structure of one\u0027s body!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe forefather of all humanity was none other than the legendary ancestor of everyone in the Heavenspan Realm. Of course, the forefather’s body that was created by this technique couldn’t compare at all to the actual forefather. And yet, even a sliver of that forefather’s strength could give Master Cloud Lightning the ability to crush everything in his path.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs the meteor and the lightning slammed into each other, a huge boom echoed out!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA massive shockwave roared out across the vast plain, destroying all of the plants and vegetation it touched!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere were also many living things hidden underneath the grass which were transformed into nothing but ash….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMany other cultivators in the trial by fire also noticed what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Heavens! Those fluctuations…. Don’t tell me some devas are fighting!?!? But even a fight between devas shouldn’t cause fluctuations like that!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was completely and utterly shocked. As for Master Thousand-Ghost, he suddenly stopped in place and turned to look back in the direction of the battlefield he had just left, his pupils constricting.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Master Cloud-Lightning is strong. Everybody knows that. But this Bai Xiaochun… I can’t believe he’s able to fight back, and send out fluctuations like this….” A thoughtful look suddenly appeared in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, in a location near the border between the jungle and the vast plain, Du Lingfei and that strange young man were together with their team, traveling along.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey had already explored the desert, the swamp, and the jungle, and were now working on the plain.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen the fluctuations reached them, Du Lingfei suddenly turned and looked over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Ignore it,” the strange young man said coolly. Not even those shocking fluctuations seemed worthy of his notice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDu Lingfei nodded in response. All she could tell at the moment was that the fluctuations were coming from some distance away. There was no way for her to tell any detailed information about what was happening. Without putting much more thought into the matter, she proceeded along deeper into the plain.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs the shockwave rolled out from the point of impact between Bai Xiaochun and Master Cloud Lightning, the lands were ripped to pieces, and a huge crater appeared. As for Bai Xiaochun, blood sprayed out of his mouth as he was flung violently backward.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis vision swam and then began to fade, and he could feel stabs of pain throughout his body. He currently felt so weak that he wasn’t sure he could even lift his hand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis fleshly body power was mostly drained, but his cultivation base was still in place. Drawing upon its power, he turned into a beam of light that shot off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis aura was unstable, and his heart was pounding. The backlash from his attack had been significant. Master Cloud Lightning’s divine ability had been shockingly powerful, so strong that, for the first time, the Undying Emperor’s Fist couldn’t stand up to the force, and had been vanquished.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Master Cloud Lightning’s forefather incarnation had also been crushed. Bai Xiaochun’s Undying Emperor’s Fist could destroy someone in the mid Deva Realm, and could still be shocking to someone in the late realm!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately for Master Cloud Lightning, were it not for his misgivings, he could easily have dispelled the attack. But instead… he ended up in worse state than Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe was trembling from head to toe, and his combined form was beginning to split apart again. At the same time, strange words were spilling from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Brother, let’s split apart. From now on, you’re you, and I\u0027m me!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Little brother, you can’t be like this! We\u0027re the same person….”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMaster Cloud Lightning felt like he was about to go crazy. When in his combined state, his divine soul was complete. And yet despite that, he still seemed to have split into two parts who were arguing and rejecting each other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, his body seemed to be going back and forth between wanting to split apart and wanting to stay together. The overall sensation had him hovering on the verge of mental collapse.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he threw his head back and roared, drawing fully upon his secret magic to suppress the second consciousness within him and maintain his combined state. However, his aura was weakening, and he was now barely as powerful as he had been when he had first started the process.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m gonna kill you, Bai Xiaochun!!” he howled, shooting after Bai Xiaochun at rapid speed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun gasped at how powerfully Master Cloud Lightning was being affected by the Breakup Pills. It was a good thing he had concocted such pills to begin with, otherwise, it would have been a terrifying challenge to face the combined Master Cloud Lightning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe man really was too strong after combining, and seemed far too powerful to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Not even my Undying Emperor’s Fist did any good. Don’t tell me I\u0027m going to have to use the Godkiller again….” The vile repercussions of using the Godkiller technique were almost too painful to think about.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Complete and utter bullying. He ganged up on me in the staring contest, and now he\u0027s ganging up on me again!!” He was very displeased by the whole situation, and yet was helpless to do anything about it. It was quite depressing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! I guess the Breakup Pill dosage was too low. I need to up the strength!” Even as he scrambled to think of what exactly to do next, numerous lightning bolts shot down toward him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eScalp tingling with fear, he dodged out of the way, and then threw out a Breakup Pill. Master Cloud Lightning’s eyes widened, and he leaped off to the side. By now, he truly feared Bai Xiaochun’s medicinal pills.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“This guy’s pills are completely malicious!!” he thought. Obviously, he had long since connected the dots, and come to realize that his current difficulties were because of the medicinal mist that Bai Xiaochun’s pills had created earlier.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of how Bai Xiaochun’s pills could affect him caused his killing intent to grow stronger by the moment. By this point, the chase had led to the border of the plain, where it began to give way to the jungle.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMaster Cloud Lightning’s relentless pursuit had pushed Bai Xiaochun into a state of madness, and he was just preparing to go all out by using his Godkiller technique.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, just as he was about to destroy a drop of Undying Blood, he suddenly saw a group of people off in the distance….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized them immediately. Du Lingfei was there, as well as that strange young man, the two of them flanked by a handful of special guards. By now, it had been several months since he had first encountered them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlmost as soon as he caught sight of them, Du Lingfei saw him, and her eyes widened at the sight of Master Cloud Lightning chasing him with murderous intentions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMaster Cloud Lightning also noticed Du Lingfei and her group.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHaving been a deva patriarch in the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect for many years, he was very well aware of Du Lingfei’s status. Even if he were more powerful than he currently was, he wouldn\u0027t dare to do anything rash in front of her. Therefore, he slowed down a bit in his pursuit of Bai Xiaochun, although he didn’t stop completely.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn his opinion, the grudge between himself and Bai Xiaochun was a personal matter, and Heavenspan Island usually didn’t interfere in such things. As long as he acted respectfully, he could continue his chase. However, he did prepare a quick explanation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot forgetting to clasp his hands as he continued to give chase, he addressed Du Lingfei in respectful fashion and said, “Goddess Du, this matter between Bai Xiaochun and myself is--”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before he could finish his statement, Bai Xiaochun interrupted him with words that nearly caused him to fall out of the sky….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Wifey, save me! Save me, oh my wifey of mine!” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen he shot toward Du Lingfei and her group at top speed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis voice rang out loud and clear for everyone to hear, and brimmed with profound passion and sincerity.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Du Lingfei heard Bai Xiaochun’s words, her jaw dropped. And there was little need to mention the special guards around her. Their eyes went wide with disbelief as they stared at Bai Xiaochun rushing toward them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs for the young man in the group, he looked at Bai Xiaochun with a cold gaze.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the shock Master Cloud Lightning felt surpassed the combined shock of everyone else. He was dumbfounded, completely swept away, even more so than he had been by the chaos of the Breakup Pill. Shivering incredulously, he tried to determine whether or not he had just heard correctly….\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStammering, he said, “Wh-what… what did you just call Goddess Du…?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-940\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-942\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-941","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:10 AM"}
