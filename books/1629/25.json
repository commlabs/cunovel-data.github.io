No other small god is trying to usurp me. Did I ever tell you about old Ur-Gilash? No? He was the god back in what\u0027s now Omnia before me. Not much of one. Basically a weather god. Or a snake god. Some?thing, anyway. It took years to get rid of him, though. Wars and everything. So I\u0027ve been thinking . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Om still exists,” said the tortoise. “I mean the shell.

It was vaguely feminine. There was a penguin perched on one shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patina, Goddess of Wisdom,” said Brutha. “The one with a penguin. Why a penguin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can\u0027t imagine,” said Om hurriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing wise about penguins, is there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shouldn\u0027t think so.

There\u0027s still some melon. I mean loaf.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha wandered out into the dusk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis was sitting on a bench under a tree, as still as a statue in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertainty, Brutha thought. I used to be certain. Now I\u0027m not so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Brutha. You will accompany me on a little stroll. We will take the evening air.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, lord.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have enjoyed your visit to Ephebe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis seldom asked a question if a statement would do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It has been . . . interesting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis put one hand on Brutha\u0027s shoulder and used the other to haul himself up on his staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what do you think of it?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They have many gods, and they don\u0027t pay them much attention,” said Brutha. “And they search for ignorance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And they find it in abundance, be sure of that,” said Vorbis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed his staff into the night. “Let us walk,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the sound of laughter, somewhere in the darkness, and the clatter of pans. The scent of evening-opening flowers hung thickly in the air. The stored heat of daytime radiating from the stones, made the night seem like a fragrant soup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ephebe looks to the sea,” said Vorbis after a while. “You see the way it is built? All on the slope of a hill facing the sea. But the sea is mutable. Nothing lasting comes from the sea. Whereas our dear Citadel looks towards the high desert. And what do we see there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstinctively Brutha turned, and looked over the rooftops to the black bulk of the desert against the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw a flash of light,” he said. “And again. On the slope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. The light of truth,” said Vorbis. “So let us go forth to meet it. Take me to the entrance to the labyrinth, Brutha. You know the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My lord?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Brutha?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would like to ask you a question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened to Brother Murduck?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the merest suggestion of hesitation in the rhythm of Vorbis\u0027s stick on the cobbles. Then the exquisitor said, “Truth, good Brutha, is like the light. Do you know about light?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It . . . comes from the sun. And the moon and stars. And candles. And lamps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so on,” said Vorbis, nodding. “Of course. But there is another kind of light. A light that fills even the darkest of places. This has to be. For if this metalight did not exist, how could darkness be seen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha said nothing. This sounded too much like philosophy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so it is with truth,” said Vorbis. “There are some things which appear to be the truth, which have all the hallmarks of truth, but which are not the real truth. The real truth must sometimes be protected by a labyrinth of lies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Brutha. “Do you understand me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Lord Vorbis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean, that which appears to our senses is not the fundamental truth. Things that are seen and heard and done by the flesh are mere shadows of a deeper reality. This is what you must understand as you progress in the Church.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But at the moment, lord, I know only the trivial truth, the truth available on the outside,” said Brutha. He felt as though he was at the edge of a pit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is how we all begin,” said Vorbis kindly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So did the Ephebians kill Brother Murduck?” Brutha persisted. Now he was inching out over the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am telling you that in the deepest sense of the truth they did. By their failure to embrace his words, by their intransigence, they surely killed him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But in the trivial sense of the truth,” said Brutha, picking every word with the care an inquisitor might give to his patient in the depths of the Citadel, “in the trivial sense, Brother Murduck died, did he not, in Omnia, because he had not died in Ephebe, had been merely mocked, but it was feared that others in the Church might not understand the, the deeper truth, and thus it was put about that the Ephebians had killed him in, in the trivial sense, thus giving you, and those who saw the truth of the evil of Ephebe, due cause to launch a-a just retaliation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked past a fountain. The deacon\u0027s steelshod staff clicked in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see a great future for you in the Church,” said Vorbis, eventually. “The time of the eighth Prophet is coming. A time of expansion, and great opportunity for those true in the service of Om.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha looked into the pit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Vorbis was right, and there was a kind of light that made darkness visible, then down there was its opposite, the darkness where no light could ever reach: darkness that blackened light. He thought of blind Didactylos and his empty lantern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard himself say, “And with people like the Ephebians, there is no truce. No treaty can be held binding, if it is between people like the Ephebians and those who follow a deeper truth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis nodded. “When the Great God is with us,” he said, “who can stand against us? You impress me, Brutha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was more laughter in the darkness, and the twang of stringed instruments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A feast,” sneered Vorbis. “The Tyrant invited us to a feast! I sent some of the party, of course. Even their generals are in there! They think themselves safe behind their labyrinth, as a tortoise thinks himself safe in his shell, not realizing it is a prison. Onward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inner wall of the labyrinth loomed out of the darkness. Brutha leaned against it. From far above came the chink of metal on metal as a sentry went on his rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gateway to the labyrinth was wide open. The Ephebians had never seen the point of stopping people entering. Up a short side-tunnel the guide for the first sixth of the way slumbered on a bench, a candle gut?tering beside him. Above his alcove hung the bronze bell that would-be traversers of the maze used to sum?mon him. Brutha slipped past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brutha?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, lord?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lead the way through the labyrinth. I know you can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is an order, Brutha,” said Vorbis, pleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no hope for it, Brutha thought. It is an order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then tread where I tread, lord,” he whispered. “Not more than one step behind me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Brutha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I step around a place on the floor for no reason, you step around it too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Brutha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha thought: perhaps I could do it wrong. No. I took vows and things. You can\u0027t just disobey. The whole world ends if you start thinking like that . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let his sleeping mind take control. The way through the labyrinth unrolled in his head like a glow?ing wire .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . diagonally forward and right three and-a-half paces, and left sixty-three paces, pause two seconds?where a steely swish in the darkness suggested that one of the guardians had devised something that won him a prize-and up three steps . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could run forward, he thought. I could hide, and he\u0027d walk into one of the pits or a deadfall or some?thing, and then I could sneak back to my room and who would ever know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . forward nine paces, and right one pace, and forward nineteen paces, and left two paces . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a light ahead. Not the occasional white glow of moonlight from the slits in the roof, but yel?low lamplight, dimming and brightening as its owner came nearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone\u0027s coming,” he whispered. “It must be one of the guides!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis had vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha hovered uncertainly in the passageway as the light bobbed nearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn elderly voice said, “That you, Number Four?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light came round a corner. It half-illuminated an old man, who walked up to Brutha and raised the candle to his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where\u0027s Number Four?” he said, peering around Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA figure appeared behind the man, from out of a side?passage. Brutha had the briefest glimpse of Vorbis, his face strangely peaceful, as he gripped the head of his staff, twisted and pulled. Sharp metal glittered for a moment in the candlelight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-25.html","bookId":1629,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM"}
