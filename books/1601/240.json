Soil coated Juilin’s hair, and stuck in clumps to the blood on his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold!\" Juilin shouted to his men. \"Burn you, we need to hold!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe attacked another Sharan who came at him. One of the pikemen raised his weapon in time to pin the man on the shoulder, and Juilin speared him through his leather-clad chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air trembled. His ears rang faintly from all of the explosions. Juilin pulled back, yelling orders to his men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t supposed to be here. He was supposed to be someplace warm, with Amathera, thinking about the next criminal he needed to catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe figured that every man on the field felt they should be someplace else. The only thing to do was keep on fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou look good in black, Androl sent to Pevara as they moved through the enemy army on top of the Heights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, she replied back, is something one should never, never say to an Aes Sedai. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis only response was a sense of nervousness through the bond. Pevara understood. They—wearing inverted weaves of the Mask of Mirrors—walked among Darkfriends, Shadowspawn and Sharans. And it was working. Pevara wore a white dress and a black cloak over it—those weren’t part of a weave—but anyone looking into her cloak’s hood would see the face of Alviarin, a member of the Black Ajah. Theodrin wore the face of Rianna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol and Emarin wore weaves that gave them the faces of Nensen and Kash, two of Taim’s cronies. Jonneth looked very unlike himself, wearing the face of a nondescript Darkfriend, and he played the part well, skulking behind and carrying their gear. One would never have seen the good-natured Two Rivers man in that hawk-faced man with the greasy hair and nervous manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved at a brisk pace along the back lines of the Shadow’s army on the Heights. Trollocs hauled bundles of arrows forward; others left the lines to feast on piles of corpses. Cookpots boiled here. That shocked Pevara. They were stopping to eat? Now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly some of them, Androl sent. It’s common for human armies too, though these moments don’t make it into the ballads. The fighting has lasted all day, and soldiers need energy while fighting. Usually, you rotate in three batches. Your front lines, your reserves, and your off-duty—troops who will trudge away from the fight and eat as quickly as they can before grabbing a little sleep. Then back to the front lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d once seen war differently. She’d imagined every man committed every moment of the day. A true battle, however, was not a sprint; it was an extended, soul-grinding trudge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late afternoon already, approaching evening. To the east, below the Heights, battle lines extended far in both directions along the dry riverbed. Many thousands of men and Trollocs fought back and forth there. Large numbers of Trollocs fought there, but others were rotated back up the Heights to either eat or collapse into unconsciousness for a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not look too closely at the cookpots, though Jonneth fell to his knees and sicked up beside the path. He had noticed the body parts floating in the thick stew. As he emptied his stomach onto the ground, a passing group of Trollocs snorted and hooted in mockery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are they pushing off the Heights to take the river? she sent to Androl. It seems to be a better position up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it is, Androl sent. But the Shadow is the aggressor. If they stay in this position, it serves Cauthon\u0027s army. Demandred needs to keep pressing him. That means crossing the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Androl understood tactics, too. Interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve picked up a few things, he sent. I wont be leading a battle any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust curious how many lives you’ve led, Androl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn odd statement, coming from a woman who is old enough to be my grandmother’s grandmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued along the eastern side of the Heights. Distant, on the far western side, the Aes Sedai were battling their way up to the top—but for now, the Heights were held by Demandred’s forces. This area Pevara walked through was full of Trollocs. Some bowed in a lumbering way as Pevara and the others passed, others curled up on the stones to sleep, with no cushions or blankets. Each one kept its weapon at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This does not look promising\", Emarin said softly from behind his mask. \"I do not see Taim associating with Trollocs any more than he has to\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahead\", Androl said. \"Look there\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trollocs were separated from a group of Sharans who could be seen up ahead, wearing unfamiliar uniforms. They wore armor that was wrapped in cloth, so none of the metal showed except on the very back, though the shape of the breastplates was still obvious. Pevara looked to the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could see Taim being part of that group\", Emarin said. \"It’s likely to smell far less putrid than over here among the Trollocs, for one thing\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePevara had been ignoring the stench—she had learned to do that years ago, snuffing out powerful scents in the same way she ignored heat and cold. As Emarin said it, however, a hint of what the others were smelling seeped through her defenses. She quickly regained control. It was awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will the Sharans let us pass?\" Jonneth asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall see\", Pevara said, setting off toward the Sharans; their group fell in around her. The Sharan guards maintained an uneasy line against the Trollocs, watching them as they would enemies. This alliance, or whatever it was, did not sit terribly well with the Sharan soldiers. They didn’t try to mask their looks of disgust, and many had tied cloths around their faces to mask the odors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Pevara passed their line, a nobleman—or such she assumed him to be, from his armor of brazen rings—moved to confront her. A well-practiced Aes Sedai look staved him off. I am far too important for you to bother, that look said. It worked beautifully, and they were in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sharan reserve camp was orderly as men rotated in from the west, where they fought the White Tower forces. The fierce channeling from that direction kept drawing Pevara’s attention, like a bright light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think? Androl sent to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re going to need to talk to someone. The battlefield is just too big for us to find Taim on our own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sent back his agreement. Not for the first time, Pevara found their bond distracting. She not only had to deal with her own nervousness, but Androl’s as well. That crept from the back of her mind, and she had to constrain it forcefully, using breathing exercises she’d learned \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-240.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
