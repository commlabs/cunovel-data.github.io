There were altogether 12 caves, and each could be opened by themselves. These caves were created by Xiantian masters cutting through the mountain themselves; one could still see glaring sword marks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWood Puppet Lane was filled with wooden puppets; the deeper one went, the more formidable these puppets would be, and the more there were.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese wooden puppets were from one of the seven inheritances of the Seven Profound Valleys, the masterpieces of the Puppet Faction. The Puppet Faction was a very mysterious faction within the Seven Profound Valleys. Sky Fortune Kingdom’s Seven Profound Martial House did not have any of these factions’ cultivation methods or secret techniques, so they had never had much exposure to it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeeing the crowds of wooden puppets increase, Lin Ming did not hurry to attack. He hadn’t even taken out the Penetrating Rainbow spear.

The weapons that these wooden puppets all used were completely made of wood, such as wooden clubs, or wooden sabers. A wooden weapon may not have seemed like a very dangerous weapon, but even so, if one was pounded by a wooden club or saber, they would still be dealt a crushing blow and vomit blood from a severe wound.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming watched as a wooden club came at him and waited until it was just in front of him. He closed his eyes and gently pushed with his toes. His body flickered backwards half a step, and as a result, the descending club that would have smashed Lin Ming’s nose was just avoided with not too much or too little distance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhiz!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e Another wooden puppet cut towards Lin Ming’s waist with a wooden saber. This time, Lin Ming leapt into the air. His body floated in the air, and because of inertia, he floated backwards. Another wooden puppet cut towards Lin Ming’s waist from behind, and this attack didn’t seem as if it could be evaded. But then Lin Ming gently waved his sleeves, and his body became like a leaf that was blown away by a gently breeze. It seemed as if he completely violated the rules of physics, and he appeared two feet to the side, dodging that hidden saber by just a hair’s width once more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSwish swish swish!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e The wooden puppet continuously attacked Lin Ming, but Lin Ming did not counter.

It was as if the puppets did not have a weapon in their hands, but instead a fan.

There were some abnormal individuals, like Ling Sen and Ta Ku, who would cause a quick consumption of true essence stones after entering Wood Puppet Lane. Sometimes, just looking at this wasteful sight made the deacon senior apprentice brother’s heart hurt deeply.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut Lin Ming had already gone in for such a long time, yet he had only consumed a small number of true essence stones. Obviously Lin Ming was struggling in dealing with these wooden puppets, and had only managed to take down a few.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRealizing this, the deacon senior apprentice brother let out a soft sigh of relief, “Fortunately, Junior Apprentice Brother Lin isn’t that abnormal. Indeed, it seems that he still isn’t able to challenge the eleventh level of difficulty of Wood Puppet Lane in such a short time!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Junior Apprentice Brother Lin is just too impatient.

The array heart was still only consuming true essence at a very slow speed; he even suspected that Lin Ming had encounter some troubles inside and been killed by the wooden puppets.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What’s going on?

Here, the wooden puppets’ strength was at a much higher level, and they were also large. What was most peculiar though, was that the surface of their bodies was a strange dark red, as if they had been dyed in blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFacing so many more advanced puppets, Lin Ming felt an intense amount of pressure.

Back when he was at the Viscera Training stage, a single strike from his spear was able to turn a thick stone column dozens of feet high into nothing more than crumbled rock. Now that his strength had increased even further, he might even be able to split apart a hall with just a few spear moves!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now that he had struck at these wooden puppets, only one had died!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The more resilient they are, the better.
