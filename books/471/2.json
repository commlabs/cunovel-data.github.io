\u0026nbsp;Were they, like him, merely the puppets of a monstrous show?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And yet it was not the mystery, but the comedy of suffering that struck him; its absolute uselessness, its grotesque want of meaning. \u0026nbsp;How incoherent everything seemed! \u0026nbsp;How lacking in all harmony! \u0026nbsp;He was amazed at the discord between the shallow optimism of the day, and the real facts of existence. \u0026nbsp;He was still very young.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After a time he found himself in front of Marylebone Church. \u0026nbsp;The silent roadway looked like a long riband of polished silver, flecked here and there by the dark arabesques of waving shadows. \u0026nbsp;Far into the distance curved the line of flickering gas-lamps, and outside a little walled-in house stood a solitary hansom, the driver asleep inside. \u0026nbsp;He walked hastily in the direction of Portland Place, now and then looking round, as though he feared that he was being followed. \u0026nbsp;At the corner of Rich Street stood two men, reading a small bill upon a hoarding. \u0026nbsp;An odd feeling of curiosity stirred him, and he crossed over. \u0026nbsp;As he came near, the word ‘Murder,’ printed in black letters, met his eye. \u0026nbsp;He started, and a deep flush came into his cheek. \u0026nbsp;It was an advertisement offering a reward for any information leading to the arrest of a man of medium height, between thirty and forty years of age, wearing a billy-cock hat, a black coat, and check trousers, and with a scar upon his right cheek. \u0026nbsp;He read it over and over again, and wondered if the wretched man would be caught, and how he had been scarred. \u0026nbsp;Perhaps, some day, his own name might be placarded on the walls of London. \u0026nbsp;Some day, perhaps, a price would be set on his head also.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The thought made him sick with horror. \u0026nbsp;He turned on his heel, and hurried on into the night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Where he went he hardly knew. \u0026nbsp;He had a dim memory of wandering through a labyrinth of sordid houses, of being lost in a giant web of sombre streets, and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in Piccadilly Circus. \u0026nbsp;As he strolled home towards Belgrave Square, he met the great waggons on their way to Covent Garden. \u0026nbsp;The white-smocked carters, with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair, strode sturdily on, cracking their whips, and calling out now and then to each other; on the back of a huge grey horse, the leader of a jangling team, sat a chubby boy, with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat, keeping tight hold of the mane with his little hands, and laughing; and the great piles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky, like masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous rose. \u0026nbsp;Lord Arthur felt curiously affected, he could not tell why. \u0026nbsp;There was something in the dawn’s delicate loveliness that seemed to him inexpressibly pathetic, and he thought of all the days that break in beauty, and that set in storm. \u0026nbsp;These rustics, too, with their rough, good-humoured voices, and their nonchalant ways, what a strange London they saw! \u0026nbsp;A London free from the sin of night and the smoke of day, a pallid, ghost-like city, a desolate town of tombs! \u0026nbsp;He wondered what they thought of it, and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its shame, of its fierce, fiery-coloured joys, and its horrible hunger, of all it makes and mars from morn to eve. \u0026nbsp;Probably it was to them merely a mart where they brought their fruits to sell, and where they tarried for a few hours at most, leaving the streets still silent, the houses still asleep. \u0026nbsp;It gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by. \u0026nbsp;Rude as they were, with their heavy, hob-nailed shoes, and their awkward gait, they brought a little of a ready with them. \u0026nbsp;He felt that they had lived with Nature, and that she had taught them peace. \u0026nbsp;He envied them all that they did not know.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the time he had reached Belgrave Square the sky was a faint blue, and the birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2839/78436.html","bookId":471,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:44:11 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:44:11 AM"}
