She’d mentioned her dream of helping children whose parents couldn’t, or wouldn’t, properly care for them shortly after her quiet wedding to Luc, and within days he had a building purchased and the first plans drawn up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first his driving force had made her head spin, but she’d quickly adjusted, and now they were a true power couple, dividing their time between Vegas and New York.
