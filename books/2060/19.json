I\u0027d held on to so many secrets for so long, doing what I believed best protected Lissa. But hiding her cutting did nothing to protect her. I hadn\u0027t been able to make her stop - and really, I now wondered if it was my fault she\u0027d ever started. None of this had happened until she healed me in the accident. What if she\u0027d left me injured? Maybe I would have recovered. Maybe she would be all right today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed in the clinic while Dimitri went to get Alberta. He hadn\u0027t hesitated for a second when I told him where she was. I\u0027d said she was in danger, and he\u0027d left immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything after that moved like some sort of slow-motion nightmare. The minutes dragged on while I waited. When he finally returned with an unconscious Lissa, a flurry arose at the clinic, one everyone wanted me kept out of. She had lost a lot of blood, and while they had a feeder on hand right away, rousing her to enough consciousness to drink proved difficult. It wasn\u0027t until the middle of the Academy\u0027s night that someone decided she was stable enough for me to visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true?\" she asked when I walked into the room. She lay on the bed, wrists heavily bandaged. I knew they\u0027d put a lot of blood back into her, but she still looked pale to me. \"They said it was you. You told them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to,\" I said, afraid to get too close. \"Liss...you cut yourself worse than you ever have. And after healing me...and then everything with Christian...you couldn\u0027t handle it. You needed help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes. \"Christian. You know about that. Of course you do. You know about everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I just wanted to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to what Ms. Karp said? About keeping it all secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was talking about the other stuff. I don\u0027t think she\u0027d want you to keep cutting yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you tell them about the ¡®other stuff\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned toward me, eyes cold. \" ¡®Yet.\u0027 But you\u0027re going to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to. You can heal other people...but it\u0027s killing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I healed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have been okay eventually. The ankle would have healed. It\u0027s not worth what it does to you. And I think I know how it started...when you first healed me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explained my revelation about the accident and how all of her powers and depression had started after that. I also pointed out how our bond had formed after the accident too, though I didn\u0027t fully understand why yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on, but this is beyond us. We need someone\u0027s help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll take me away,\" she said flatly. \"Like Ms. Karp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they\u0027ll try to help you. They were all really worried. Liss, I\u0027m doing this for you. I just want you to be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away from me. \"Get out, Rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey released her the next morning on the condition that she\u0027d have to come back for daily visits to the counselor. Dimitri told me they also planned on putting her on some sort of medication to help with the depression. I wasn\u0027t a big fan of pills, but I\u0027d cheer on anything that would help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, some sophomore had been in the clinic for an asthma attack. He\u0027d seen her come in with Dimitri and Alberta. He didn\u0027t know why she\u0027d been admitted, but that hadn\u0027t stopped him from telling people in his hall what he\u0027d seen. They then told others at breakfast. By lunch, all the upperclassmen knew about the late-night clinic visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd more importantly, everyone knew she wasn\u0027t speaking to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like that, whatever social headway I\u0027d made plummeted. She didn\u0027t outright condemn me, but her silence spoke legions, and people behaved accordingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole day, I walked around the Academy like a ghost. People watched and occasionally spoke to me, but few made much more effort than that. They followed Lissa\u0027s lead, imitating her silence. No one was openly mean to me - they probably didn\u0027t want to risk it in case she and I patched things up. Still, I heard \"blood whore\" whispered here and there when someone thought I wasn\u0027t listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason would have welcomed me to his lunch table, but some of his friends might not have been so nice. I didn\u0027t want to be the cause of any fights between him and them. So I chose Natalie instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard Lissa tried to run away again, and you stopped her,\" Natalie said. No one had a clue why she\u0027d been in the clinic yet. I hoped it stayed that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning away? Where in the world had that come from? \"Why would she do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" She lowered her voice. \"Why\u0027d she leave before? It\u0027s just what I heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat story raged on as the day passed, as did all sorts of rumors about why Lissa might have gone to the med clinic. Pregnancy and abortion theories were eternally popular. Some whispered she might have gotten Victor\u0027s disease. No one even came close to guessing the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving our last class as quickly as possible, I was astonished when Mia started walking toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" I demanded. \"I can\u0027t come out and play today, little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure have an attitude for someone who doesn\u0027t exist right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As opposed to you?\" I asked. Remembering what Christian had said, I did feel a little sorry for her. That guilt disappeared after I took one look at her face. She might have been a victim, but now she was a monster. There was a cold, cunning look about her, very different from the desperate and depressed one from the other day. She hadn\u0027t stayed beaten after what Andre had done to her - if that was even true, and I believed it was - and I doubted she would with Lissa either. Mia was a survivor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She got rid of you, and you\u0027re too high and mighty to admit it.\" Her blue eyes practically bugged out. \"Don\u0027t you want to get back at her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you more psycho than usual? She\u0027s my best friend. And why are you still following me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMia tsked. \"She doesn\u0027t act like it. Come on, tell me what happened at the clinic. It\u0027s something big, isn\u0027t it? She really is pregnant, right? Tell me what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you tell me, I\u0027ll get Jesse and Ralf to say they made all that stuff up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped walking and spun around to face her. Scared, she took a few steps backward. She must have recalled some of my past threats of physical violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already know they made it all up, because I didn\u0027t do any of it. And if you try to turn me against Lissa one more time, the stories are going to be about you bleeding, because I\u0027ll have ripped your throat out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice grew louder with each word until I practically shouted. Mia stepped back further, clearly terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really are crazy. No wonder she dropped you.\" She shrugged. \"Whatever. I\u0027ll find out what\u0027s going on without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the dance came that weekend, I decided I really didn\u0027t want to go. It had sounded stupid to begin with, and I\u0027d only been interested in going to the after-parties anyway. But without Lissa, I wasn\u0027t likely to gain admission to those. Instead, I holed up in my room, trying - and failing - to do some homework. Through the bond, I felt all sorts of mixed emotions from her, particularly anxiety and excitement. It had to be hard hanging out all night with a guy you didn\u0027t really like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout ten minutes after the dance\u0027s start time, I decided to clean up and take a shower. When I came back down the hall from the bathroom, a towel wrapped around my head, I saw Mason standing outside my door. He wasn\u0027t exactly dressed up, but he also wasn\u0027t wearing jeans. It was a start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are, party girl. I was about ready to give up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you start another fire? No guys allowed in this hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. Like that makes a difference.\" True. The school might be able to keep Strigoi out, but they did a horrible job at keeping the rest of us away from each other. \"Let me in. You\u0027ve got to get ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a minute to realize what he meant. \"No. I\u0027m not going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" he prodded, following me inside. \" ¡®Cause you had a fight with Lissa? You guys are going to make up soon. No reason for you to stay here all night. If you don\u0027t want to be around her, Eddie\u0027s getting a group together over in his room later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy old, fun-loving spirit perked its head up just a bit. No Lissa. Probably no royals. \"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing that he was starting to get me, Mason grinned. Looking at his eyes, I realized again how much he liked me. And again I wondered, Why couldn\u0027t I just have a normal boyfriend? Why did I want my hot, older mentor - the mentor I\u0027d probably end up getting fired?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll just be novices,\" Mason continued, oblivious to my thoughts. \"And I have a surprise for you when we get there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it in a bottle?\" If Lissa wanted to ignore me, I had no reason to keep myself sober.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s at Eddie\u0027s. Hurry up and get dressed. I know you aren\u0027t wearing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at my ripped jeans and University of Oregon T-shirt. Yeah. Definitely not wearing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, we cut across the quad back over to the commons, laughing as we recounted how a particularly clumsy classmate of ours had given himself a black eye in practice this week. Moving quickly over the frozen ground wasn\u0027t easy in heels, and he kept grabbing my arm to keep me from falling over, half-dragging me along. It made us laugh that much more. A happy feeling started to well up in me - I wasn\u0027t entirely rid of the ache for Lissa, but this was a start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I didn\u0027t have her and her friends, but I had my own friends. It was also very likely that I was going to get head-over-heels drunk tonight, which, while not a great way to solve my problems, would at least be really fun. Yeah. My life could be worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we ran into Dimitri and Alberta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were on their way somewhere else, talking guardian business. Alberta smiled when she saw us, giving us the kind of indulgent look older people always give to younger people who appear to be having fun and acting silly. Like she thought we were cute. The nerve. We stumbled to a halt, and Mason put a hand on my arm to steady me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ashford, Miss Hathaway. I\u0027m surprised you aren\u0027t already in the commons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason gave her an angelic, teacher\u0027s-pet smile. \"Got delayed, Guardian Petrov. You know how it is with girls. Always got to look perfect. You especially must know all about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally I would have elbowed him for saying something so stupid, but I was staring at Dimitri and incapable of speech. Perhaps more importantly, he was staring at me too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had on the black dress, and it was everything I\u0027d hoped it could be. In fact, it was a wonder Alberta didn\u0027t call me on the dress code right there and then. The fabric clung everywhere, and no Moroi girl\u0027s chest could have held this dress up. Victor\u0027s rose hung around my neck, and I\u0027d done a hasty blow-dry of my hair, leaving it down the way I knew Dimitri liked it. I hadn\u0027t worn tights because no one wore tights with dresses like this anymore, so my feet were freezing in the heels. All for the sake of looking good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was pretty sure I looked damn good, but Dimitri\u0027s face wasn\u0027t giving anything away. He just looked at me - and looked and looked. Maybe that said something about my appearance in and of itself. Remembering how Mason sort of held my hand, I pulled away from him. He and Alberta finished up their joking remarks, and we all went our separate ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic blasted inside the commons when we arrived, white Christmas lights and - ugh - a disco ball casting the only light in the otherwise darkened room. Gyrating bodies, mostly underclassmen, packed the dance floor. Those who were our age stood in too-cool clusters along the edges of the room, waiting for an opportune time to sneak off. An assortment of chaperones, guardians and Moroi teachers alike, patrolled around, breaking up those dancers who did a little too much gyrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I saw Kirova in a sleeveless plaid dress, I turned to Mason and said, \"Are you sure we can\u0027t hit the hard liquor yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snickered and took my hand again. \"Come on, time for your surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting him lead me, I walked across the room, cutting through a cluster of freshmen who looked way too young to be doing the kind of pelvic thrusts they were attempting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere were the chaperones when you needed them? Then I saw where he was leading me and came to a screeching halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, not budging when he tugged my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, it\u0027s going to be great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re taking me to Jesse and Ralf. The only way I can ever be seen with them is if I\u0027ve got a blunt object, and I\u0027m aiming between their legs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me again. \"Not anymore. Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctant, I finally started moving: my worst fears were realized when a few pairs eyes turned our way. Great. Everything was starting all over again. Jesse and Ralf didn\u0027t notice us at first, but when they did, an amusing array of expressions played over their faces. First they saw my body and the dress. Testosterone took over as pure male lust shone out of their faces. Then they seemed to realize it was me and promptly turned terrified. Cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason gave Jesse a sharp poke in the chest with the end of his finger. \"All right, Zeklos. Tell her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesse didn\u0027t say anything, and Mason repeated the gesture, only harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot meeting my eyes, Jesse mumbled, \"Rose, we know none of that stuff happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost choked on my own laughter. \"Do you? Wow. I\u0027m really glad to hear that. Because you see, until you said that, I\u0027d been thinking it had happened. Thank God you guys are here to set me straight and tell me what the hell I have or haven\u0027t done!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey flinched, and Mason\u0027s light expression darkened to something harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knows that,\" he growled. \"Tell her the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesse sighed. \"We did it because Mia told us to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" prompted Mason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we\u0027re sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason turned to Ralf. \"I want to hear it from you, big boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalf wouldn\u0027t meet my eyes either, but he mumbled something that sounded vaguely like an apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing them defeated, Mason turned chipper. \"You haven\u0027t heard the best part yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him a sidelong look. \"Yeah? Like the part where we rewind time and none of this ever happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next best thing.\" He tapped Jesse again. \"Tell her. Tell her why you did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesse looked up and exchanged uneasy looks with Ralf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys,\" warned Mason, clearly delighted about something, \"you\u0027re making Hathaway and me very angry. Tell her why you did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWearing the look of one who realized things couldn\u0027t get any worse, Jesse finally met my eyes. \"We did it because she slept with us. Both of us.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1/page-19.html","bookId":2060,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:00 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:00 AM"}
