Hansen was hit directly by the Treasure Eater\u0027s body tackle and was thrown into the air. He wasn\u0027t the only one aiming for his opponent\u0027s weaknesses; the Treasure Eater was as well.

Even so, Hansen couldn\u0027t take his mind off of Lee Shin Woo. Even as he swung his bastard sword and blocked the Treasure Eater\u0027s charge, he continued to think about Lee Shin Woo.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0027How did he disguise himself as another?
