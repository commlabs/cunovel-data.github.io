They were kitsune, and they lived way up north in the kitsune sector around the Great Crossings...\"And she proceeded, albeit with many excited interruptions, to tel the story she had gotten from the star bal .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\"Bonnie concluded nervously, as she opened her eyes and realized that she\u0027d attracted quite a crowd with her story,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"that\u0027s the tale of the Seven Treasures, and - and I suppose the moral is - don\u0027t be too greedy, or you won\u0027t end up with anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lot of laughter, the nervous giggling of the girls and the \"Haw! Haw haw!\"kind of laughter from the crowd behind them. Which Bonnie now noticed was entirely male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne part of her mind started unconsciously to go into flirt mode. Another part immediately squashed it. These weren\u0027t boys looking for a dance; these were ogres and vampires and kitsune and even men with mustaches - and they wanted to buy her in her little black bubble dress, and as nice as the dress might be for some things, it wasn\u0027t like the long, jeweled gowns that Lady Ulma had made for them. Then they had been princesses, wearing a fortune\u0027s worth of jewels at their throats and wrists and hair - and besides, they had had fierce protection with them at al times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, she was wearing something that felt a lot like a baby-dol nightgown and delicate little shoes with silvery bows. And she wasn\u0027t protected because this society said you had to have men to be protected, and, worst of al ...she was a slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder,\"said a golden-haired man, moving through the girls around her, al of whom hurried out of his way except Mouse and Eren, \"I wonder if you would go upstairs with me and perhaps tel me a story - in private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie tried to swal ow her gasp. Now she was the one hanging on to Mouse and Eren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Al such requests must go through me. No one is to take a girl out of the room unless I approve,\"announced a woman in a ful -length dress, with a sympathetic, almost Madonna-like face. \"That wil be treated as theft of my mistress\u0027s property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m sure we don\u0027t al want to be arrested as if we\u0027d been caught carrying off the silverware,\"she said and laughed lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was equal y light laughter among the guests as Well, and movement toward the woman - at a sort of mannerly run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tel real y good stories,\"Mouse said in her soft voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s more fun than using a star bal .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mouse, here, is right,\"Eren said, grinning. \"You do tel good stories. I wonder if that place real y exists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I got it out of a star bal ,\"Bonnie said. \"One that the girl - um, Jil , put her memories in, I think - but then how did it get out of that tower? How did she know what happened to Jack? And I read a story about a giant dragon and that felt real too. How do they do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they trick you,\"Eren said, waving a dismissive hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have somebody go someplace cold for the scenery -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ean ogre probably, because of the weather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie nodded. She\u0027d met mauve-skinned ogres before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey only differed from demons in their level of stupidity. At this level, they tended to be stupid in society, and she\u0027d heard Damon say with a curled lip that the ones that were out of society were hired muscle. Thugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the rest they just fake somehow - I don\u0027t know. Never real y thought about it.\"Eren looked up at Bonnie. \"You\u0027re an odd one, aren\u0027t you, Bonny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\"Bonnie asked. She and the two other girls had revolved, without letting go of hands. This meant that there was some space behind Bonnie. She didn\u0027t like that. But, then, she didn\u0027t like anything about being a slave. She was starting to hyperventilate. She wanted Meredith. She wanted Elena. She wanted out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, you guys probably don\u0027t want to associate with me anymore,\"she said uncomfortably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"said Eren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"asked Mouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m running through that door. I have to get out. I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kid, calm down,\"Eren said. \"Just keep breathing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t understand.\"Bonnie put her head down, to shade out some of the world. \"I can\u0027t belong to somebody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sh, Bonny, they\u0027re - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stay here,\"Bonnie burst out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s probably al to the good,\"a terrible voice, right in front of her, said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we\u0027re in a new business we work hard,\"the Madonna-like woman\u0027s voice said. \"We look up at prospective customers. We don\u0027t misbehave or we are punished.\"And even though her voice was sweet as pecan pie, Bonnie somehow knew that the harsh voice in the night shouting at them to find a pal et and stay on it, had been this same woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now there was a strong hand under her chin and Bonnie couldn\u0027t keep it from forcing her head up, or from covering her mouth when she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of her, with the delicate pointed ears of a fox, and the long sweeping black tail of a fox but otherwise looking human, looking like a regular guy wearing jeans and a sweater, was Shinichi. And in his golden eyes she could see, twisting and turning, a little scarlet flame that just matched the red on the tip of his tail and the hair that fel across his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi. He was here. Of course he could travel through the dimensions; he Stillhad a ful star bal that none of Elena\u0027s group had ever found as well as those magical keys Elena had told Bonnie about. Bonnie remembered the horrible night when trees, actual trees, had turned into something that could understand and obey him. About how four of them each grabbed one of her arms and legs and pul ed, as if they were planning to pul her apart. She could feel tears leaking out behind her shut eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Old Wood. He\u0027d control ed every aspect of it, every creeper to trip you, every tree to fal in front of your car. Until Elena had blasted al but that one thicket of the Old Wood, it had been ful of terrifying insect-like creatures Stefan cal ed malach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now Bonnie\u0027s hands were behind her back and she heard something fasten with a very final-sounding click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo...oh, please no...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her hands were definitely fixed in place. And then someone - an ogre or a vampire - picked her up as the lovely woman gave Shinichi a smal key off a key ring ful of identical keys. Shinichi handed this to a big ogre whose fingers were so large that they eclipsed it. And then Bonnie, who was screaming, was quickly whisked up four flights of stairs and a heavy door thunked shut behind her. The ogre carrying her fol owed Shinichi, whose sleek scarlet-tipped tail swung jauntily from a hole in his jeans, back and forth, back and forth. Bonnie thought: That\u0027s satisfaction. He thinks he\u0027s won this already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut unless Damon real y had forgotten her completely, he would hurt Shinichi for this. Maybe he would kil him. It was an oddly comforting thought. It was even ro -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it\u0027s not romantic, you nitwit! You have to find a way to get out of this mess! Death is not romantic, it\u0027s horrible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had reached the final doors at the end of the hal .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi turned right and walked al the way down a long corridor. There the ogre used the key to open a door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room had an adjustable overhead gaslight. It was dim but Shinichi said, \"Can we have a little il umination, please?\"in a false polite voice, and the other ogre hurried and turned the light up to interrogation-lamp-in-your-face level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was a sort of bedroom-den combination, the kind you\u0027d get at a decent hotel. It had a couch and some chairs on the upper level. There was a window, closed, on the left side of the room. There was also a window on the right side of the room, where al the other rooms should be in a line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis window had no curtains or blinds that could be drawn and it reflected Bonnie\u0027s pale face back at her. She knew at once what it was, a two-way mirror, so that people in the room behind it could see into this room but not be seen. The couch and chairs were positioned to face it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the sitting room, off to her left, was the bed. It wasn\u0027t a very fancy bed, just white covers that looked pink, because there was a real window on that side that was almost in a line with the sun, sitting as it always was, on the horizon. Right now, Bonnie hated it more than ever before because it turned every light-colored object in the room pink, rose, or outright red. The bow at her own bodice was deep pink now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to die saturated with the color of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething on some deeper level told her that her mind was thinking of such things as distractions, that even thinking about hating to die in such a juvenile color was running away from the bit in the middle, the dying bit. But the ogre holding her moved her around as if she weighed nothing, and Bonnie kept having little thoughts - were they premonitions? Oh, God, let them not be premonitions! - about going out of that red window in a sitting position, the glass no impediment to her body being thrown at a tremendous force. And how many stories up were they? High enough, anyway, that there was no hope of landing without...Well, dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi smiled, lounging by the red window, playing with the cord to the blinds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t even know what you want from me!\"Bonnie found herself saying to Shinichi. \"I\u0027ve never been able to hurt you. It was you hurting other people - like me! - al the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there were your friends,\"murmured Shinichi. \"Although I seldom wreak my dread revenge against lovely young women with red-gold hair.\"He lounged beside the window and examined her, murmuring, \"Hair of red-gold; heart true and bold. Perhaps a scold...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie felt like screaming. Didn\u0027t he remember her? He certainly seemed to have remembered their group, since he\u0027d mentioned revenge. \"What do you want?\"she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a hindrance, I\u0027m afraid. And I find you very suspicious - and delicious. Young women with red-gold hair are always so elusive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie couldn\u0027t find anything to say. From everything she\u0027d seen, Shinichi was a nutcase. But a very dangerous psychopathic nutcase. And al he enjoyed was destroying things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn just one moment there could be a crash through the window - and then she\u0027d be sitting on air. And then the fal would begin. What would that feel like? Or would she already be fal ing? She only hoped that at the bottom it was quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem to have learned a lot about my people,\"Shinichi said. \"More than most.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\"Bonnie said desperately. \"If it\u0027s about the story - al I know about kitsune is that you\u0027re destroying my town. And - \"She stopped short, realizing that she could never let him know what had happened in her out-of-body experience. So she could never mention the jars or he\u0027d know that they knew how to catch him. \"And you won\u0027t stop,\"she finished lamely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And yet you found an ancient star bal with stories about our legendary treasures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what? You mean from that kiddy star bal ? Look, if you\u0027l just leave me alone I\u0027l give it to you.\"She knew exactly where she\u0027d left it, too, right beside her sorry excuse for a pil ow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, we\u0027l leave you alone...in time, I assure you,\"Shinichi said with an unnerving smile. He had a smile like Damon\u0027s, which wasn\u0027t meant to say \"Hel o; I won\u0027t hurt you.\"It was more like \"Hul o! Here\u0027s my lunch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find it...curious,\"Shinichi went on, Stillfiddling with the cord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very curious that just in the middle of our little dispute, you arrive here in the Dark Dimension again, alone, apparently without fear, and manage to bargain for a star bal . An orb that just happens to detail the location of our most priceless treasures that were stolen from us...a long, long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t care about anybody but yourself, Bonnie thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re suddenly acting al patriotic and stuff, but in Fel \u0027s Church you didn\u0027t pretend to care about anything but hurting people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In your little town, as in other towns throughout history, I had orders to do what I did,\"Shinichi said, and Bonnie\u0027s heart plunged right down to her shoes. He was telepathic. He knew what she was thinking. He\u0027d heard her thinking about the jars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi smirked. \"Little towns like the one on Unmei no Shima have to be wiped off the face of the earth,\"he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see the number of ley lines of Power under it?\"Another smirk. \"But of course you weren\u0027t really there, so you probably didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you can tel what I\u0027m thinking, you know that story about treasures was just a story,\"Bonnie said. \"It was in the star bal cal ed Five Hundred Stories for Young Ones. It\u0027s not real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How strange then that it coincides so exactly with what the Seven Kitsune Gates are supposed to have behind them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was in the middle of a bunch of stories about the - the D��z-Aht-Bhi\u0027iens. I mean the story right before it was about a kid buying candy,\"Bonnie said. \"So why don\u0027t you just go get the star bal instead of trying to scare me?\"Her voice was beginning to tremble. \"It\u0027s at the inn right across the street from the shop where I was - arrested. Just go and get it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course we\u0027ve tried that,\"Shinichi said impatiently. \"The landlady was quite cooperative after we gave her some...compensation. There is no such story in that star bal .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not possible!\"Bonnie said. \"Where did I get it, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027m asking you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStomach fluttering, Bonnie said, \"How many star bal s did you look at in that brown room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi\u0027s eyes went blurry briefly. Bonnie tried to listen, but he was obviously speaking telepathical y to someone close, on a tight frequency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinal y he said, \"Twenty-eight star bal s, exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie felt as if she\u0027d been clubbed. She wasn\u0027t going crazy - she wasn\u0027t. She\u0027d experienced that story. She knew every fissure in every rock, every shadow in the snow. The only answers were that the real star bal had been stolen, or - or maybe that they hadn\u0027t looked hard enough at the ones they had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The story is there,\"she insisted. \"Right before it is the story about little Marit going to a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We probed the table of contents. There is the story about a child and\" - he looked scornful - \"a sweetshop. But not the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie just shook her head. \"I swear I\u0027m tel ing the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I believe you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does it matter? How could I make something like that up? And why would I tel a story I knew would get me in trouble? It doesn\u0027t make any sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShinichi stared at her hard. Then he shrugged, his ears flat against his head. \"What a pity you keep saying that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Bonnie\u0027s heart was pounding in her chest, in her tight throat. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\"Shinichi said cool y, pul ing the blinds completely open so that Bonnie was abruptly drenched in the color of fresh blood, \"I\u0027m afraid that now we have to kil you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ogre holding her strode toward the window. Bonnie screamed. In places like this, she knew screams went unheard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what else to do. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-midnight-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-16.html","bookId":2037,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:32:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:32:33 PM"}
