The courtyard of the temple had just been swept clean, but it had already been covered with a layer of silvery white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning bell had already been sounded. The cold wind carried with it the indistinct sound of Buddhist chants as it flowed into a meditation room on the right hand side of the courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun sat silently on a prayer mat, listening, quietly drinking from a cold bottle of alcohol that he’d brought last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as cold as ice, but as he drank the baijiu, it felt like a scorching fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai had entered the room, and was staring at him coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun pretended not to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai finally spoke. “Isn’t a too early to be drinking?” he asked coldly. “If you want to drink today, shouldn’t you wait until a little bit later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you’re about to face a very formidable opponent. It’s very possible that he’s more powerful than either of us imagine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So if you want to drink, you should at least wait until after the duel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun suddenly laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why should I wait until then? Have you forgotten that I am the forever invincible Sima Chaoqun?” An indescribable derision filled his laughter. “In any case, I won’t lose. Even if I drink a whole jug, I still won’t lose. Because you’ve definitely arranged everything ahead of time, arranged every detail.” Sima Chaoqun laughed loudly. “That kid Gao Jianfei can’t get away with losing, and can’t get away without dying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai didn’t laugh, but he didn’t admit to what Sima Chaoqun said. Neither did he deny it. His face was completely expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun looked at him. “This time can you tell me what you arranged?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai was silent for a long time. “Some things just happen,” he said indifferently. “There’s no need to arrange anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you let Gao Jianfei, by chance, encounter some things like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Every person will eventually encounter things like that. Whatever people encounter them, they will all be equally helpless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly walked over and grabbed the bottle of baijiu from the short table next to the prayer mat, and poured a bit into a glass of clear water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alcohol and the water mixed together instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a very natural thing, isn’t it?” asked Zhuo Donglai of Sima Chaoqun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some people are just like this,” said Zhuo Donglai. “When they meet, they will mix together like alcohol and water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But after they mix together, the alcohol becomes diluted, and the quality of the water also changes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People are the same.

If they meet a certain person, they will become weaker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like the alcohol mixed into the water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct. Chance meetings. Chance partings. Anyone would be helpless.” His voice was still completely indifferent. “There are many situations like this in heaven and on earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you treat me so well?” he asked. “Why do you arrange everything so carefully for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you are Sima Chaoqun.” Zhuo Donglai’s answer was simple. “And because Sima Chaoqun must never be defeated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the Tang Dynasty, Gao Zong had the Great Wild Goose Pagoda built for his late mother, the Empress Wende. The preeminent monk Xuan Zang translated Buddhist sutras there. It originally had five stories, and was a Buddhist place of worship for the western regions. Later it was built up to seven stories, and became a Seven Story Buddhist Pagoda. \u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_2\"\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Jianfei stood at the bottom of the Great Wild Goose Pagoda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pagoda cast no shadow, because the sky was too cloudy, and no sunlight existed to cast a shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo shadow existed in Little Gao’s heart either. His heart was a blank space, with nothing in it at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in his hand was a sword. A sword wrapped in coarse cloth, a sword that few people had ever seen. There was only a sword, no box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had not taken the box with her. She shouldn’t have gone, and yet she left.

Zhuo Donglai was only a mere shadow cast by his brilliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai seemed to know this, and hence would always stand to the side, so as not to obstruct the brightness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing that Little Gao noticed at was Sima Chaoqun’s shining white eyes and black pupils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he walked a bit closer, and looked carefully, he might be able to see the traces of red in the whites of his eyes, strands of blood that seemed to be kindled by the burning fire of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sadly, Gao Jianfei couldn’t see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than Zhuo Donglai, no one accompanied Sima Chaoqun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are Gao Jianfei?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun looked at Little Gao. Looked at his eyes, his facial expression, his appearance. The Giant Wild Goose Pagoda did not cast a shadow, and yet it seemed as if his entire person were enveloped by darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun looked at him quietly for a long time, then suddenly turned around and began to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai didn’t obstruct his way, didn’t move, didn’t even blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Jianfei rushed forward to bar his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you leaving?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I don’t want to kill you.

The cloth bundle was not empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword inside the cloth bundle could take a person’s life in an instant. And just the same, it could give another person justification to take his life in an instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiima Chaoqun had stopped walking, and was looking off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t looking at Gao Jianfei, because he knew that the young man was drawing his sword, and that there was no way to stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also didn’t look at Zhuo Donglai, because he knew Zhuo Donglai would have no reaction to what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in his eyes could be seen a faint look of sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—How could such a worthy life become so meaningless after encountering such circumstances?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand gripped his sword, because in a situation like this, he had no other choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA click sounded out as the sword was freed from the scabbard, but Sima Chaoqun did not draw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause at that exact moment, the shadow of a person flitted down like a meteor from the top of the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat dropped down from the top of the pagoda was not just a shadow, but a person. But the speed was incredible, so fast that Sima Chaoqun couldn’t see the person clearly. He could only see a murky gray shadow that grabbed Gao Jianfei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Gao Jianfei flew up, not gradually, but as fast as a bird \u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_4\"\u003e[4]\u003c/a\u003e.

A long time passed, then he suddenly asked Zhuo Donglai: “Who was that person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima gave a cold laugh. “You know which person. The reason you told me not to give chase is because you were afraid of him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai stood and walked to the window. He opened it, closed it, then turned to face Sima.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are many great masters in the martial world, and many unique skills.

The Xiao part is a common surname, but the character itself also means “desolate or dreary,” as Zhuo Donglai emphasizes when he explains which “xiao” character it is. Incidentally, that poem is from the Song Dynasty, and is a relatively sad poem written to a departing loved one. The Leixue part of his name contains two characters. The first is 泪 as in “tears.” The second is 血 as in “blood.” So his given name could also be literally translated as “Tears of Blood” or “Blood Tears.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_6\"\u003e[6] Ou Yezi was a famous sword maker from the Spring and Autumn period http://goo.gl/Jd8J9R\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heros-shed-no-tears/hsnt-chapter-5\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heros-shed-no-tears/hsnt-chapter-7\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heros-shed-no-tears/hsnt-chapter-6","bookId":1504,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:34 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:34 AM"}
