However, the sharp edges and corners of his face, as well as those hawk-like eyes gave away his true nature. In Dragon City, there was pretty much no one who didn’t recognize this old man, the one who controlled great authority within the Black Dragonriders, General Josh Morgan.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Is this important?” Helen asked.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe sat on a couch on the other side of the light screen. Then, she pulled open the front of her jacket, exposing her entire upper body. Her skin was covered with fine beads of sweat, and the feeling of weakness was still extending through her body. This was a weakness that came from the anesthesialess surgery, as well as the residual effects of an overdose of ovum acceleration drugs. After taking some time to feel out her body’s current situation, Helen decided that she would use a vial of genetic restoration fluid. It could substantially increase her heart’s functions, as well as increase a bit of ability potential, but Helen had always been unwilling to use it before. Even though until now, there were no side effects discovered with its use, Helen was always skeptical on whether or not it was one of the main culprits of human genetic collapse.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, at this time, Helen still decided to use it once. After experiencing repeated extraction of ovums, her body had already entered an extremely dangerous and unstable state. She produced a special syringe and then stuck it into her chest. The needle entered between her ribs, inserting the recovery liquid into the vicinity of her heart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen continued to treat herself just like that in front of the light screen, because the video transmission was one-directional. She could see General Morgan, but Morgan could only hear her voice.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen he heard Helen’s reply, General Morgan displayed a rare moment of silence before setting his resolution and asking, “Helen, did those three end up doing something to you?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Impossible.

After the cigar was lit, only then did Morgan say, “I’ll still send out two people for you. I know you are quite smart, but intelligence can’t solve all problems. Even though Lynch isn’t bad either, his strength is still a bit too weak. As for those three…”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eGeneral took a deep breath of the cigar, the flickering embers making his face change between bright and dark. After pausing for a moment, only then did General Morgan say nonchalantly, “... we’ll just leave this matter at that. I will have Lanaxis give me a satisfactory explanation.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You wish to go to war with the Spider Empress?” Helen asked in a somewhat mocking manner.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRight now, the recovery liquid was slowly moving into Helen’s chest. Then, it moved rather fiercely towards her heart. This would cause quite a considerable amount of pain, as well as make her face even more pale. However, Morgan couldn’t see these things.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It’s not like we can’t. The core interest of all cannot be violated.” The general said calmly, as if his opponent was just a nobody.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Then after you join hands to wipe out the empress, what will you use to fend off Bevulas?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOld Morgan laughed and said, “Bevulas? He isn’t someone with crazy ambitions. For him, there are many things more important than authority. However, right now, he is but without a choice. Even if he doesn’t have interest in certain areas, those that have attached themselves to him will urge him to acquire them.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Bevulas or the Spider Empress… I don’t like either one of them, nor am I interested in the battle between them,” Helen said, “However, I want to remind you that soon, Bevulas will obtain many high level ability users, their numbers enough to tip over the balance of war.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Oh? Then that is to say, some kind of breakthrough should have been made in Project ‘Apostle’. Could it be that Connor has already produced an ‘apostle’?” General Morgan clearly didn’t care much about this, and he didn’t seem to have all that much confidence in Connor either.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What he has produced should be ‘chosen’, and experimental subjects that are still quite lacking. Forget about apostles, he can’t even produce complete chosen. The creation of life requires sufficient imagination, while that is something Connor clearly lacks.” Helen didn’t seem to hold back at all in her criticism.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMorgan nodded his head in agreement. He put out the finished cigar, and then he raised a cup of coffee before casually asking, “What have you been busy with recently?

Then, with her cold tone of dealing with official business, she said, “However, if the Black Dragonriders can afford the cost, I can provide for you all a new model of biological weapons in a few months. However, there might only be two, and it definitely won’t be cheap.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMorgan was clearly interested. “Oh?
