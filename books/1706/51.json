He flipped open his wallet and showed the guards his badge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" they said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother car pulled up, and Sarah got out with Ann Garner. Ann said, \"What\u0027s the fuss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little misunderstanding,\" Kenner said. He introduced himself to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know who you are,\" she said, with barely concealed hostility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you might,\" Kenner said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I have to say,\" she continued, \"it\u0027s guys like yousmart and unscrupulous and immoralwho have made our environment the polluted mess that it now is.

He turned to Evans. \"Why don\u0027t you confirm that that is all right with Mr. Lowenstein.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Evans said, and headed toward the flight office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just so you know,\" Ann said, \"we\u0027re going with you. I am, and so is Ted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will be delightful,\" Kenner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the flight office, Evans found Lowenstein hunched over a phone in the back room reserved for pilots. \"But I\u0027m telling you, the guy isn\u0027t going for it, he wants documentation,\" Lowenstein said. And then after a pause, \"Look, Nick, I\u0027m not going to lose my license over this one. The guy\u0027s got a law degree from Harvard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans knocked on the door. \"Everything okay for us to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute,\" Lowenstein said into the phone. He put his hand over the receiver. \"You\u0027re going to leave now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. Unless you have the document amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems there is some confusion about the exact status of Morton\u0027s estate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027re going, Herb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to the phone. \"They\u0027re leaving, Nick,\" he said. \"You want to stop them, do it yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the cabin, everyone was sitting down. Kenner went around passing out sheets of paper. \"What\u0027s this?\" Bradley said, with a glance to Ann.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a release,\" Kenner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn was reading aloud, \"Â¬ liable in the event of death, serious bodily injury, disability, dismemberment\u0027dismemberment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Kenner said. \"You need to understand that where we are going is extremely dangerous. I strongly advise both of you not to come. But if you insist on ignoring my advice, you need to sign that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" Bradley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you that until the plane is in the air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is it dangerous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a problem signing the form?\" Kenner said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Hell.\" Bradley scrawled his signature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ann?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn hesitated, bit her lip, and signed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot closed the doors. The engines whined as they taxied up the runway. The flight attendant asked what they would like to drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Puligny-Montrachet,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn said, \"Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To an island off the coast of New Guinea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a problem,\" Kenner said, \"that has to be dealt with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to be any more specific?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane rose above the cloud layer in Los Angeles, and turned west, over the Pacific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 74\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEN ROUTE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:10 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah felt relieved when Jennifer Haynes went to the front of the cabin to take a nap, falling instantly asleep. But she found it awkward to have Ann and Ted onboard. Conversation in the cabin was stilted; Kenner was not saying much. Ted was drinking heavily. He said to Ann, \"Just so you know, Mr. Kenner doesn\u0027t believe in anything that normal people believe in. Not even global warming. Or Kyoto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he doesn\u0027t believe in Kyoto,\" Ann said. \"He\u0027s an industry hit man. Representing coal and oil interests.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner said nothing. He just handed her his card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Institute for Risk Analysis,\" Ann read aloud. \"That\u0027s a new one. I\u0027ll add it to the list of phony right-wing fronts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s all disinformation,\" Ann said. \"The studies, the press releases, the flyers, websites, the organized campaigns, the big-money smears. Let me tell you, industry was thrilled when the US didn\u0027t sign Kyoto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner rubbed his chin, and said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn said, \"We\u0027re the world\u0027s largest polluter, and our government doesn\u0027t give a damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner smiled blandly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now the United States is an international pariah, isolated from the rest of the world and justifiably despised because we failed to sign the Kyoto Protocol to attack a global problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to goad him in this way, and finally, it seemed, he had had enough. \"Tell me about Kyoto, Ann,\" he said. \"Why should we have signed it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Because we have a moral obligation to join the rest of the civilized world in reducing carbon emissions to below 1990 levels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What effect would that treaty have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole world knows that. It would reduce global temperatures in the year 2100.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By how much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re driving at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you? The answer is well known. The effect of Kyoto would be to reduce warming by.04 degrees Celsius in the year 2100. Four hundredths of a degree. Do you dispute that outcome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly do. Four what? Hundredths of a degree? That\u0027s ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t believe that would be the effect of the Kyoto Protocol?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe because the United States didn\u0027t sign it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that would be the effect if we did sign it. Four hundredths of a degree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, shaking her head. \"I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The figure has been published a number of times in scientific journals. I can give you the references.\"* Raising his glass, Bradley said to Ann, \"This guy is real big on references.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As opposed to rhetoric,\" Kenner said, nodding. \"Yes. I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBradley belched. \"Four hundredths of a degree? In a hundred years? What a bunch of bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One could say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just did,\" Bradley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Kyoto\u0027s a first step,\" Ann said, \"that\u0027s the point. Because if you believe in the precautionary principle, as I do\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think the purpose of Kyoto was to take a first step,\" Kenner said. \"I thought the purpose was to reduce global warming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why make a treaty that won\u0027t accomplish that? That won\u0027t, in effect, do anything at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a first step, as I said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me: do you think it\u0027s possible to reduce carbon dioxide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. There are a host of alternative energy sources just waiting to be adopted. Wind power, solar, waste, geothermal\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom Wigley and a panel of seventeen scientists and engineers from around the world made a careful study and concluded it is not possible. Their paper was published in Science. They said there is no known technology capable of reducing carbon emissions, or even holding them to levels many times higher than today. They conclude that wind, solar, and even nuclear power will not be sufficient to solve the problem. They say totally new and undiscovered technology is required.\"* \"That\u0027s crazy,\" Ann said. \"Amory Lovins laid it all out twenty years ago. Wind and solar, conservation, energy efficiency. There\u0027s no problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently there is. Lovins predicted that thirty-five percent of US power would come from alternative energy by the year 2000. The actual figure turned out to be six percent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not enough subsidies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No country in the world produces thirty-five percent renewable energy, Ann.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But countries like Japan do much better than we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenner said, \"Japan is five percent renewable. Germany is five percent. England two percent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Denmark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eight percent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she said, \"it just means we have more work to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No question about that. Wind farms chop birds to pieces, so they might not be so popular. But solar panels would work. Silent, efficient amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Solar is great,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Kenner said. \"And all we need is about twenty-seven thousand square kilometers of panels to do the job. Just cover the state of Massachusetts with solar panels and we\u0027d be done. Of course by 2050 our energy needs will triple, so maybe New York would be a better choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or Texas. Nobody I know cares about Texas,\" Ann said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there you are,\" Kenner said. \"Cover ten percent of Texas, and you\u0027re in business. Although,\" he added, \"Texans would probably prefer to cover Los Angeles first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re making a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. Let\u0027s settle on Nevada. It\u0027s all desert anyway. But I\u0027m curious to hear about your personal experience with alternative energy. What about you yourself, Ann? Have you adopted alternative sources?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I have solar heating for my swimming pool. The maid drives a hybrid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you drive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I need a bigger car for the kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How big?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I drive an SUV.
