I mean, I hardly know you. Sure, you seem like a nice guy and you\u0027re sexy as sin, but a child is a big deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched down so he was at eye level with her. \"It is a big deal, but you\u0027re not alone. I was there, too, remember? I knew what I was doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No you didn\u0027t. If you\u0027d known I could get pregnant, you would never have touched me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes warmed with desire. \"Wanna bet? I\u0027d take you again right now if I had even a hint that you wouldn\u0027t try to slap me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t joking. Something inside her went liquid and hot in response to the completely sincere look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaby or not, the idea of getting naked with him again was a potent force, urging her to forget everything else around them and just give in. It would be so easy to just give in. Too easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d never slap you,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nostrils flared and his eyes darkened to midnight blue. He slid one blunt finger over her mouth, his eyes focused intently on his touch. \"Don\u0027t tempt me, Noelle. I\u0027m about two minutes away from meltdown and we still don\u0027t have any condoms, so unless you\u0027re willing to risk it, you\u0027d best not test my self-control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lungs seemed to malfunction and her skin was too hot and tight on her frame. Her body ached to feel the callused slide of his hand over her skin, his mouth at her breasts. And lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered remembering the way his tongue felt so hot and wet and excruciatingly gentle between her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMan, oh, man. If she lived to be a hundred, she\u0027d never forget the way it felt to fly apart with his fingers buried inside her and his tongue dancing circles over her clitoris. And that was nothing compared to the sheer power of coming around his erection while he thrust deep and hard, giving her no way to escape the force of her orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never known sex could be like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doubted that it would be like that with anyone besides David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body screamed at her to give in. Yeah, she mightget pregnant, but would that really be so bad? She was smart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d find a way to make things work for both herself and a baby. She had no illusions that David would be in the picture, but that didn\u0027t scare her. She would learn to be a good single mother. Lots of women did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat really scared her was knowing that every time she opened herself up to him physically, she was getting that much closer to falling for him. She wasn\u0027t a fool. Sex and love were too closely linked for her to ignore the correlation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that women fell in love with men who were wrong for them all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd David was definitely wrong for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was career military. She was opposed to violence of any kind. The two had no place together. Add to that the fact that he still had the death of his wife haunting him, and he was about as wrong for her as a man could get, no matter how right he felt in bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she fell for him, she\u0027d end up hurt. Her life was already such a mess that she just couldn\u0027t risk doing anything that would make it worse. Falling in love with a man she couldn\u0027t have would definitely make things much worse. Sex would just make him more appealing to her than he already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, she couldn\u0027t handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you won\u0027t. You already proved beyond a doubt that you can last night. Quite well in fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t regret what we did last night. I just don\u0027t think that\u0027s it\u0027s smart for us to be getting... distracted right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerked away, his movements harsh and angry. \"You\u0027re right, of course. You don\u0027t have to explain,\" he said through clenched teeth. \"I\u0027ll be outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cabin shook with the force of the door slamming behind him. Cold air swirled through the room, chilling Noelle both inside and out. She hated to see him go like that, but she didn\u0027t blame him for wanting to put some distance between them. It was the only way she was going to be able to resist him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle swallowed and urged her breathing to return to normal. She was itchy and agitated inside. Her body felt twitchy and unstable and she knew this had to be what sexual frustration felt like. She wished now more than ever that her normal, laser-focused tunnel vision would kick in, and the world—including her frustrated body— would fall away. But it didn\u0027t happen. Her focus was held captive by thoughts of David. Thoughts of what they\u0027d done last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she shouldn\u0027t have refused him. Lord knew she yearned for some companionship right now—someone she could turn to during this stressful time. Someone who would hold her and tell her it was going to be okay. She didn\u0027t even care how big a lie it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid was only human, no matter how formidable a human he seemed to be. What if he yearned for the same thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir situation was dangerous. Men had tried to abduct her, or kill her. Noelle could tell by David\u0027s steely determination that no matter how bad things got, he\u0027d protect her, even if it cost him his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, sometimes, when she looked at him, she wondered whether or not part of him didn\u0027t have a death wish. He grieved for his wife; the fact that he still held on toj his wedding ring and the way he spoke about her proved that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was why he was fearless in the face of danger. A man who didn\u0027t mind dying would have little to fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that didn\u0027t mean he didn\u0027t want companionship while he was still alive. No one wanted to die alone. Was David any different?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething deep in her gut told her that she\u0027d better be careful. She was falling for David. Hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle told that something to shut the hell up and getg back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had breached the perimeter David had set in the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid crouched low and went still, seeking out signs of where the intruder might have gone. They were good, he\u0027d give them that. The only way he\u0027d known they\u0027d come this way was because they had disturbed some limbs that David had twisted together across one of the paths toward the cabin. The intruder had seen the security measure too late and tried to put the vines back the way they\u0027d been before, but David could see the subtle differences. One of the leaves had been torn and lay on the ground, bruised where the heavy tread of a combat boot had crushed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid forced the rising fear down and put his senses on full alert. He had to get back to the cabin and get Noelle out of here. Fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Noelle opened the door to go out and use the drafty outhouse, she saw movement in the trees in two places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong with this picture and her instincts were screaming at her to hurry up and figure it out. She froze in place, her work-fogged brain struggling to make sense of what she\u0027d seen. Her breathing sped and her heart started fluttering in fear. Movements in two places. Only one David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic flooded her system, making her feel heavy and sluggish, as time slowed, and her overworked mind started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003espinning in place, trying to figure out what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just deer,\" Noelle whispered to herself, but her. instincts were going off, screaming at her to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough a thin patch in the woods, Noelle caught a glimpse of a shape moving through the trees. A human shape. It slid slowly over the rough ground with cautious, stealthy steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. The Swarm had found her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking with terror, Noelle backed up into the cabin and grabbed the gun that was always sitting on the table for her to use in case of emergency. As much as she loathed the cold, lethal weight of the weapon, this certainly qualified as an emergency and she was relieved to feel the chill of it pressing into her palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not going to let the Swarm take her without a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe uncomfortable bite of the bulletproof vest that David insisted she wear when she left the cabin was a welcome friend right now. She silently thanked David fori his constant nagging and overprotective streak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she stepped out of the cabin, her hands trembled so violently that she was sure she\u0027d never hit a target smaller than the moon. But the threat the weapon innately held was better than nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer only chance of getting out of this safely was to get to David. If they cornered her in the cabin, she\u0027d be trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t even a back door to use as an escape route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of being cornered by the Swarm threatened to drive her to her knees, but she pulled in a deep breath and forced herself to focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front porch of the cabin held no cover from bullets, but the pile of chopped wood a few yards to the side of the cabin had potential. A few more yards beyond that was the bulletproof Bronco. If she could make it that far, she was sure she could escape into the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut first she had to make it that far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind started running through calculations to determine just how much wood had to be between her and a bullet to stop it from hitting her, but without knowing the density of the wood or the mass and muzzle velocity of the bullet, she had no clue. A lot, she guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gust of wind whipped through the trees, stirring them all into motion. She heard the pounding of heavy feet getting closer. She didn\u0027t have any more time to wait. She had to get out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith speed she didn\u0027t know she had, Noelle sprinted for the pile of logs and crouched behind it, praying it would protect her. Her lungs burned from the short sprint and she was sure she was going to throw up from fear. She managed to keep holding the gun, but her palm was so sweaty the thing kept sliding around in her grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf running this little bit of distance left her panting and dizzy, there was no way she was going to be able to outrun the men in the woods. She wouldn\u0027t get a hundred feet before they caught up with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to think of something else or she was a goner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tired brain sparked and stuttered, and she clutched the weapon in her hand so tight it made her knuckles ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gun. That was it. It wasn\u0027t just a weapon used to kill, it could also call for help. She pointed it into the air and squeezed the trigger. The backfire stung her hand and jarred her wrist, and the boom was louder than she expected, even though she\u0027d anticipated it. She just hoped it had been loud enough for David to hear, wherever he was. If he heard the shot, he\u0027d come to help her. She was sure of it. All she had to do was survive long enough for him to get here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an effort to buy some time, she peeked through a hole in the pile of logs and yelled, \"Stop moving, or I\u0027ll shoot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe movement in the brush stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle let out a small, shuddering breath. At least they were listening. \"Throw out your weapons,\" she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few tense seconds passed, then she heard the thump of steel hitting frozen ground. She peeked and could see the black outline of two handguns in the dirt few feet beyond the tree line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was too easy. If they\u0027d been members of the Swarm, they wouldn\u0027t have given up so easily—not against one poorly armed, out-of-breath woman. Maybe the men were just hunters out for a few hours of fun stalking deer. Did men shoot deer with pistols? She\u0027d always thought they used rifles or maybe shotguns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle cursed herself for her lack of knowledge on the subject. She really couldn\u0027t be sure of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come out slowly with your hands on your head,\" she ordered, proud her voice wavered only a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne man came out from under the cover of some brush. Just as she\u0027d asked, his hands were on his head, and he moved so slowly that it looked like a slow-motion scene in an action movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore brown camouflage that blended perfectly with the autumn forest surroundings. His face was smeared with paint, obscuring his features. Other than the fact that he was a tall, lean man, she couldn\u0027t see anything specific about him—not even hair color. He moved with that same sort of predatory grace she\u0027d seen in David and beneath his camouflage, she could see the outline of a Kevlar vest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-29.html","bookId":2374,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM"}
