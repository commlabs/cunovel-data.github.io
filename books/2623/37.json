He looks straight through us.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s self-taught.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. Self-taught and talented. An Other with powers that manifest themselves chaotically. Capable of seeing Evil. Incapable of recognising Good. Don\u0027t you find that frightening?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No,\u0027 Svetlana said sullenly. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I can\u0027t see where you\u0027re going with this, Olga. Sorry, I mean Anton. You\u0027ve started talking just like her.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s okay.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The Dark Other\u0027s going somewhere,\u0027 said Svetlana, looking past my shoulder. \u0027To extract other people\u0027s energy, to cast evil spells. And we don\u0027t interfere.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head slightly and saw the Dark One. To the unaided eye he looked about thirty years old at most. Well dressed, charming. A young woman and two children were sitting at the table he\u0027d just left. The boy was about seven, the girl a bit younger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s gone for a leak, Svetlana. And his family, by the way, are perfectly ordinary. No powers. Are you suggesting we eliminate them too?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Like father, like son. . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Try telling that to Garik. His father\u0027s a Dark Magician. Still alive.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There are always exceptions.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Life consists of nothing but exceptions.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know that itch, Sveta. The itch to do Good, to pursue Evil. Right now, to finish it for ever. That\u0027s the way I feel too. But if you can\u0027t understand that\u0027s a dead end, you\u0027ll end up in the Twilight. One of us will have to put an end to your earthly existence.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But at least I\u0027d have done something.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You know what your actions would look like to an outsider? A psychopath killing normal, decent people at random. Chilling reports in the newspapers, with spine-chilling descriptions and grand nicknames for you, like \"the new Lucretia Borgia\". You\u0027d sow more Evil in human hearts than a brigade of Dark Magicians could generate in a year.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How come you lot always have an answer for everything?\u0027 Svetlana asked bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Because we\u0027ve been through the training. And survived. At least most of us have.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called the waiter and asked for the menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How about a cocktail? And then we can move on. You choose.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana nodded as she studied the wine list. The waiter was a tall, dark young man, not Russian. He\u0027d seen just about everything and he wasn\u0027t much bothered by one girl acting like a man with another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Alter Ego,\u0027 said Svetlana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head doubtfully – it was one of the strongest cocktails. But I didn\u0027t argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Two cocktails and the bill.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe waited in oppressive silence while the barman was mixing the cocktails and the waiter was making out the bill. Eventually Svetlana asked:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay, I get the picture with poets. They\u0027re potential Others. But what about the great monsters? Caligula, Hitler, the homicidal maniacs?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just people.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All of them?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mostly. We have our own monsters. Their names don\u0027t mean anything to ordinary people, but you\u0027ll be starting the history programme soon.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Alter Ego\u0027 was an accurate description. Two heavy, immiscible layers, black and white, swaying in the glass. A sweet plum liqueur and a dark, bitter beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paid in cash – I don\u0027t like to leave an electronic trail behind me – and raised my glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Here\u0027s to the Watch.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To the Watch,\u0027 Sveta agreed. \u0027And your escape from this mess.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like asking her to touch wood, but I didn\u0027t. I downed the cocktail in two gulps – first the gentle sweetness, then the mild bitterness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s great,\u0027 said Svetlana. \u0027You know, I like it here. Maybe we could stay a bit longer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There are lots of good places in Moscow. Let\u0027s find one without any Dark Magicians out on a spree.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSveta nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And by the way, he\u0027s not back yet.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my watch. Yes, he\u0027d been gone too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what really bothered me was that the magician\u0027s family were still sitting at their table, and the woman was obviously getting worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sveta, I\u0027ll just be a moment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t forget who you are!\u0027 she whispered as I left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it would look a bit odd for me to follow the Dark Magician into the gents\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked across the restaurant and took a look through the Twilight on the way. I ought to have been able to see the magician\u0027s aura, but there was nothing but a grey void lit by ordinary auras glowing different colours: pleased, concerned, lustful, drunk, happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t have just slipped out through the plumbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only weak glimmer of light from an Other\u0027s aura was outside the building, over beside the Belorussian embassy. But it wasn\u0027t the Dark Magician, it was much weaker and a different colour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had he gone to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe narrow corridor ending in two doors was empty. I hesitated for a moment – who could tell, maybe we just hadn\u0027t noticed the magician leaving via the Twilight, or maybe he was powerful enough to teleport? Then I opened the door of the gents\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside it was very clean and bright and a bit cramped, and the air had a strong smell of floral air freshener.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Magician was lying just inside the door and his outstretched arms prevented me from opening the door all the way. He had a puzzled, confused expression on his face. I spotted the gleam of a slim crystal tube in his hand. He\u0027d reached for his weapon too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no blood. There were no signs at all, and when I took another look through the Twilight I didn\u0027t find any traces of magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like the Dark Magician had died of a perfectly ordinary heart attack or stroke – if he\u0027d actually been capable of dying that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was just one small detail that ruled out that possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small cut on the collar of his shirt. As narrow as if it had been made by a cut-throat razor. As if someone had stuck a knife in his neck and just nicked the edge of his collar. Except that there were no signs of the blow on his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Bastards!\u0027 I whispered, not knowing who I was swearing at. \u0027Bastards!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hardly have ended up in a worse situation than this. I\u0027d swapped bodies and gone out to a crowded restaurant with a \u0027witness\u0027, only to wind up entirely alone, standing over the body of a Dark Magician killed by the Maverick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come on, Pavlik,\u0027 someone said behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I looked round the woman who\u0027d been sitting at the table with the Dark Magician came into the corridor, holding her son by the hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t want to, Mum!\u0027 the kid yelled, acting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You go in and tell your dad we\u0027re getting bored,\u0027 the woman said patiently. The next moment she looked up and saw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Call someone!\u0027 I shouted desperately. \u0027Get help! There\u0027s a man hurt here! Take the child away and call someone!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey obviously heard me in the restaurant – Olga had a strong voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe murmur of voices stopped immediately, leaving the slushy folk music to play on in the sudden silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, she didn\u0027t do as I said. She ran forward, pushed me out of the way, collapsed on her husband\u0027s body and started keening – actually keening – at the top of her voice, already knowing what had happened while her hands were still busy unbuttoning the slit shirt collar and shaking the lifeless body. Then she started slapping the magician on the cheeks, hard, as if she hoped he was only pretending or had just fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mum, why are you hitting Dad like that?\u0027 Pavlik cried shrilly. Not frightened, just surprised, he\u0027d obviously never seen his parents fight. They must have been a happy family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the boy by the shoulder and started gently leading him away. People were already squeezing into the corridor. I saw Sveta staring at me wide-eyed. She\u0027d guessed what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Take the child away,\u0027 I said to our waiter. \u0027I think a man\u0027s dead in there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who found the body?\u0027 the waiter asked calmly. Speaking without an accent, quite differently from when he was serving our table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I did.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter nodded as he smoothly handed on the boy to one of the female restaurant staff. The boy was crying now, he\u0027d realised something had gone wrong in his happy little world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And what were you doing in there?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The door was open and I saw him on the ground,\u0027 I said, lying without even thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter nodded, accepting that it could have happened that way. But at the same time he took a firm grip of my elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027ll have to wait for the militia, lady.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana had already pushed her way through to us. She narrowed her eyes when she heard those last words. That was all I needed now – for her to try erasing the memories of everyone there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Of course.\u0027 I stepped forward, and the waiter was forced to let go of my arm and follow me. \u0027Sveta, it\u0027s awful, there\u0027s a body in there!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Olya.\u0027 Sveta\u0027s reaction was the right one. She put her arm round my shoulders, gave the waiter an indignant look and led me back into the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then the boy passed us, sobbing loudly as he squeezed his way through the greedy, curious crowd back to his mother. They were trying to get her away from the body – she\u0027d taken advantage of the confusion to bend back down over her husband and start shaking him:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Get up! Gena, get up! Get up!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Svetlana shudder at the sight and I whispered:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well? Do we exterminate the Dark Ones with fire and the sword?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why did you do it? I would have understood without that!\u0027 Svetlana whispered furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked into each other\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then it wasn\u0027t you?\u0027 Sveta whispered uncertainly. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I believe you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realised then just what a mess I was in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crime scene investigator didn\u0027t take any particular interest in me. I could see from his eyes that he\u0027d already made up his mind – death from natural causes. A weak heart, drug abuse, whatever. He couldn\u0027t be expected to feel any sympathy for a man who frequented expensive restaurants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Was the body lying in this position?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, just like that,\u0027 I confirmed in a weary voice. \u0027It was awful!\u0027 He shrugged – he couldn\u0027t see anything really awful about a body, especially one that wasn\u0027t drenched in blood. But he was condescending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, a terrible sight. Was there anybody else nearby?\u0027 \u0027Nobody. But then a woman appeared, his wife, their child.\u0027 I was rewarded with a crooked smile for my deliberately disjointed statement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thank you, Olga. Someone may be in touch with you again. Not planning to leave town at all, are you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head rapidly. The militia was the very last thing I was bothered about right then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was bothered by the sight of the boss sitting unobtrusively at a table in the corner. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-37.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
