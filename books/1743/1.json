It stands independently. I just thought I\u0027d warn you of that to avoid misapprehension. Of course, I might someday write another novel tying this one to the others, but, then again, I might not. After all, for how long can I keep flogging my mind to make it work out these complexities of future history?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother point. I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing - to be clear. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics- Well, they can do whatever they wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, my stories write themselves, I\u0027m afraid, and in this one, I was rather appalled to find out that I was writing it in two strands. One set of events was taking place in the story\u0027s present, and another set was taking place in the story\u0027s past, but steadily approaching the present. I am sure you will have no trouble following the pattern, but since we are all friends, I thought I would let you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrologue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there alone, enclosed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside were the stars, and one particular star with its small system of worlds. He could see it in his mind\u0027s eye, more clearly than he would see it in reality if he merely de-opacified the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small star, pinkish-red, the color of blood and destruction, and named appropriately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNemesis!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNemesis, the Goddess of Divine Retribution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought again of the story he had once heard when he was young - a legend, a myth, a tale of a worldwide Deluge that wiped out a sinful degenerate humanity, leaving one family with which to start anew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo flood, this time. Just Nemesis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe degeneration of humanity had returned and the Nemesis that would be visited upon it was an appropriate judgement. It would not be a Deluge. Nothing as simple as a Deluge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven for the remnant who might escape- Where would they go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was it he felt no sorrow? Humanity could not continue as it was. It was dying slowly through its own misdeeds. If it exchanged a slow excruciating death for a much faster one, was that a cause for sorrow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, actually circling Nemesis, a planet. Circling the planet, a satellite. Circling the satellite, Rotor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat ancient Deluge carried a few to safety in an Ark. He had only the vaguest idea of what the Ark was, but Rotor was its equivalent. It carried a sampling of humanity who would remain safe and from which a new and far better world would be built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the old world - there would be only Nemesis!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of it again. A red dwarf star, moving on its inexorable path. Itself and its worlds were safe. Not so Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNemesis was on its way, Earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWreaking its Divine Retribution! \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nemesis/page-1.html","bookId":1743,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:02 AM"}
