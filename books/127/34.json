It was\u0026nbsp; only afterward that\u0026nbsp; I thought\u0026nbsp; I saw apattern\u0026nbsp; in\u0026nbsp; events;\u0026nbsp; but I\u0027ve\u0026nbsp; done\u0026nbsp; my\u0026nbsp; level best\u0026nbsp; not\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; act on\u0026nbsp; thatknowledge. Interference due to foresight would have knocked the Plan out ofkilter.\"Verisof nodded thoughtfully. \"I\u0027ve heard arguments almost as complicated inthe Temples back on Anacreon. How do you expect to spot the fight moment ofaction?\"\"It\u0027s spotted\u0026nbsp; already. You\u0026nbsp; admit that once\u0026nbsp; we repair the\u0026nbsp; battle cruisernothing will\u0026nbsp; stop Wienis\u0026nbsp; from attacking us.\u0026nbsp; There will no\u0026nbsp; longer be anyalternative in that respect.\"\"Yes\"All\u0026nbsp; right.\u0026nbsp; That\u0026nbsp; accounts for\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; external\u0026nbsp; aspect. Meanwhile,\u0026nbsp; you\u0027llfurther admit\u0026nbsp; that the\u0026nbsp; next election will\u0026nbsp; see a new\u0026nbsp; and hostile Councilthat will\u0026nbsp; force action\u0026nbsp; against Anacreon. There is\u0026nbsp; no alternative there.\"\"Yes.\"\"And as\u0026nbsp; soon as all the alternatives disappear,\u0026nbsp; the crisis has come. Justthe same ?I get worried.\"He\u0026nbsp; paused,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; Verisof\u0026nbsp; waited.\u0026nbsp; Slowly,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; almost\u0026nbsp; reluctantly,\u0026nbsp; Hardincontinued,\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ve got\u0026nbsp; the idea\u0026nbsp; ?just\u0026nbsp; a notion\u0026nbsp; ?that the\u0026nbsp; external andinternal pressures were planned to come to a head simultaneously. As it is,there\u0027s a few months difference. Wienis will probably attack before spring,and elections are still a year off.\"\"That doesn\u0027t sound important.\"\"I don\u0027t\u0026nbsp; know. It may be due merely\u0026nbsp; to unavoidable errors of calculation,or it might be\u0026nbsp; due to the fact that I knew too\u0026nbsp; much. I tried never to letmy foresight influence my\u0026nbsp; action, but how can I tell? And what effect willthe\u0026nbsp; discrepancy\u0026nbsp; have? Anyway,\"\u0026nbsp; he\u0026nbsp; looked\u0026nbsp; up, \"there\u0027s\u0026nbsp; one thing\u0026nbsp; I\u0027vedecided.\"\"And what\u0027s that?\"\"When the\u0026nbsp; crisis does begin to break, I\u0027m going to\u0026nbsp; Anacreon. I want to beon the spot ... Oh, that\u0027s enough, Verisof. It\u0027s getting late. Let\u0027s go outand make a night of it. I want some relaxation.\"\"Then get it right\u0026nbsp; here,\u0027 said Verisof. \"I don\u0027t want to be recognized, oryou know\u0026nbsp; what this\u0026nbsp; new party your\u0026nbsp; precious Councilmen are\u0026nbsp; forming wouldsay. Call for the brandy.\"And Hardin did ?but not for too much.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1586/47162.html","bookId":127,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 4:37:44 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 4:37:44 AM"}
