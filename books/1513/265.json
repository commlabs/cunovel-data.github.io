Right after, large cracks began to appear on the surface of the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-Cha!* *Ka-Cha!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise produced from the giant metal gate was akin to that of ice cubes melting, as chunks of the gate began to melt like lava and rolled to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder these circumstances, even the two rank 2 Magi inside the tornado stopped fighting and directed their gaze towards this scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, with the faces of the dark and light Magi showing their disbelief, the gate collapsed and produced a large amount of grime and dust!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The secret plane’s entrance has self-destructed! Damn it! That Leylin must have destroyed the core!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCabourn who was in the tornado charged at the crimson light screen formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Desmund, his eyes gleamed as he remained rooted to the spot, not planning to stop Cabourn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, outside of the crimson light screen formation, Number 2 and Number 3 brandished their metal greatswords, which were even larger than they were. The brands on their body shone resplendently and surrounding them lay the bodies of countless magicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these were magicians who had foolishly rushed forward earlier to stop Leylin from harvesting the spirits from both dark and light faction. However, under the two Branded Swordsmen’s teamwork, they were all slain here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBranded Swordsmen had always been one of the stronger classes in ancient times. This could clearly be seen from the mighty battle prowess stemming from Number 2 and 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegular semi-converted Magi were not their match at all. Even if those Magi were a tad stronger, under the combination of the instantaneous spell casting innate to their bodies and their battle techniques, the Magi were still easily disposed of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFormidable physical qualities with an expert fighting technique, combined with instantaneous spell casting abilities have granted Number 2 and Number 3 the title of meat grinders on the battlefield. It required at least a peak rank 1 Magus to finish both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, how rare was a peak rank 1 Magus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, Leylin had already swept the battlefield clean of the peak rank 1 Magi. Not to mention those dark Magi spies who were now dead, and even Caesar and Giant were severely injured and unconscious. At this moment, Number 2 and Number 3 were unstoppable!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, no matter how powerful a Branded Swordsman was before they advanced, they weren\u0027t a match for rank 2 Magi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the attack from Cabourn, Number 2 and Number 3 looked at each other with undying loyalty written over their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For our Master!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey grunted as the brand and runes on their bodies flashed ten times more powerful than before as they charged to receive Cabourn’s attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re overestimating your abilities!” Cabourn smirked and released two black tornados from his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Sssii!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tornados which contained a corrosive effect hit the Branded Swordsmen bodies, but it only left several white marks. Their skin was even intact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“En? What kind of modification is this?” This time, it was Cabourn who was astonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he no longer had any time. At this moment, Number 2 and Number 3 bodies began to bloat, like two over-inflated balloons, as they came to Cabourn’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Boom!* *Boom!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo huge explosions sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Branded Swordsman, in front of an unbeatable foe, there was always a final move! This was to fully detonate all of the brands on their body to generate a powerful one-time attack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn theory, this attack was to use the life force of the Branded Swordsman, the energy particles attracted by the runes and even the spirit that would be detonated all at once! A rank 1 Branded Swordsman’s self-detonation, which could even be a threat to a rank 2 Magus!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Leylin made modifications to the Branded Swordsman, he also increased the explosive effect of the detonation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs this information of the Branded Swordsman’s trump card was not known to many, even Cabourn as a rank 2 Magus had never heard of it before. Hence, he had received two such explosive attacks without any suspicions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo giant red mushroom clouds formed in the air, whistling through the skies as they engulfed Cabourn completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese flaming mushroom clouds even had scarlet flames at their edges. Anything that the flames touched, be it Magi or concrete, would be instantly dissolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of spell is this? The might is infinitely nearing that of a rank 2 spell!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of the surroundings Magi twitched as they scrambled away as if having seen a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Rumble!* The splendour of the giant red mushroom cloud displayed its terrifying radiation and might. Several minutes later, the two clouds completely dissipated, revealing a black robed figure within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cough Cough…” Cabourn’s appearance now was terribly miserable. His robes were all tattered and torn like a beggar’s. Especially noteworthy was his left hand which was in an unusual angle with evident traces of burns. It seemed like the effects of the self-detonation of Number 2 and Number 3 were substantial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it!” Cabourn was now enraged. After advancing to a rank 2 Magus, when did he ever receive such a large loss like this? All the more so done by two unremarkable looking fellows, how could he be appeased?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, Cabourn was in fits. If not for Number 2 and Number 3’s spirit being destroyed in that explosion, he would have definitely held their souls captive and let them feel the greatest pain and despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!* *Bang!**Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment there were some changes coming from the crimson light screen formation again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe formation continuously shrunk and expanded like that of a heart beating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the surface of the light screen, the Hades’ Sacrificial Rites had black patterns inscribed on it, just like veins which bulged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the continuous beating of this red heart, an energy so immense and overpowering which made Cabourn feel apprehensive began to form and grew increasingly bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis aura even caught the attention of Desmund who was merely spectating, as his expression turned solemn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A rank 2 aura… That Leylin is advancing into a rank 2 Magus!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCabourn’s eyes opened wide, “How is this possible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he was extremely clear that no matter how Leylin reached this stage with the advancement requirements, he could not let him advance, no matter what it took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCabourn retrieved several items from his robes as he chanted an incantation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with the incantation, layers after layers of energy waves emanated from Cabourn’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a rank 2 spell!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral Magi who were looking on at a distance exclaimed in shock. At Cabourn’s level, casting rank 1 spells was almost instantaneous and required no chanting. However, once he was to use ingredients to aid him in spell casting, there was only one possibility! He was going to use a mighty rank 2 spell!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the south coast, a rank 1 spell model was extremely difficult to acquire. Regular level 3 acolytes had to at least amass contributions points for over 5 years before they could have enough to exchange for a spell model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf rank 1 spell models were this difficult to acquire, one can only imagine how much rarer a rank 2 spell model was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven most rank 2 Magus did not own many rank 2 spell models. Each and every one of the spells were enough to obliterate a small village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for now, Cabourn was casting a spell which contained such a might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Cabourn chanted, he continuously fused the magic items which he took out and eventually it held the form of a giant lance used by knights. The lance seemed to be metallic with a green sheen on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, malevolent skulls began to emerge from the void and attached themselves to the lance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wailing Lance?” Cabourn even used this rank 2 spell! It seems like he’s really agitated now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesmund who was watching from the sidelines sniggered. He dispersed the golden blue lightning ball on his hands, “It seems like I don’t need to strike anymore!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Cabourn was his enemy, Leylin, who had destroyed the secret plane’s core, was not a good person either. Right now, Leylin was about to be killed by Cabourn, so naturally, Desmund would not stop this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, if Cabourn were to fail, Desmund could then strike after and kill Leylin!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skulls on the giant green lance wailed loudly, emitting a loud whistling sound as they struck the crimson light screen formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Sssii!*!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crimson light screen shuddered as the red and green merged and spread through the skies. The air in the surroundings contorted wildly as energy waves were violently released.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Rumble!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green and red light began to shrink after stretching to their limits and a mighty explosion erupted as the flames lapped everything in the surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surround buildings had previously gone through a large scaled battle and were already damaged. This time, the explosion shattered them to pieces and turned them into a rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rebuilding efforts that Leylin and Caesar had put in were now completely destroyed by this explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Pu!* *Pu!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Hades’ Sacrificial Rites that was harvesting spirits finally succumbed to the pressure and completely shattered. What was left now was Leylin’s final line of defense, the crimson light screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crimson light shuddered and then black cracks began to appear on the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-Cha!* *Ka-Cha!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light screen shuddered and finally shattered!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green lance that contained a monstrous might pierced the centre of the light formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the dazzling light, a barely visible human figure was seen. This figure was wrapped in a silvery flame which very soon was extinguished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crimson Palm!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human figure in the centre spoke softly. Immediately, his hands turned into a fresh blood-red colour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo burning holographic claws appeared and grabbed the green lance, which created a whistling noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the red flames touched the green light, the green light was extinguished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-264\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-266\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-265","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
