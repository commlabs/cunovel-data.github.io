He stood in the doorway of one of the offices, wearing a crisp blue button-down that looked like it had come straight from his father’s closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, good to see you!” Sean said. “Why don’t you step in here so we can talk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna fiddled with a tissue box on the front desk. “I’m waiting to see your dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean rapped on the doorjamb. “Nope. Your interview is with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna bit down hard on the inside of her mouth. She hadn’t really spoken to Sean since things crashed and burned last year. These days, he was going out with Kate. Total weirdness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, she followed Sean into the room and sat down on a couch. Sean sat at a desk that was populated with stacks of papers, a flat-screen computer, and empty coffee mugs. An Elmo stuffed animal sat on a shelf behind him. There was a picture of Sean shaking the hand of the governor of Pennsylvania. “Do you work here now?” Hanna asked in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the weekends, just to help my dad.” Sean straightened some papers. “We’re so overcrowded right now—a couple of local hospitals closed their burn clinics because of budget cuts.” He exhaled heavily, then looked at Hanna. “So how’s Mike?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna blinked, startled. “Uh, fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mention of Mike made her feel squirmy. It wasn’t like he knew she was here; he’d never, ever understand why she was back to beg for her old job. Every story she’d told him about the place was more disgusting than the last. She’d told him she had a hair appointment today to practice for her prom updo, but all he had to do was call up Fermata, the salon, and catch her in the lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Sean smiled. “So you actually want to come back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna shifted. “I feel bad about cutting my volunteer time short,” she lied. “After everything that has happened to me, I thought I should give back a little, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean arched an eyebrow. “Didn’t you hate it here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna clasped her hands together, trying to look earnest. “I’ve changed. Volunteering means a lot to me. I have a friend in here right now, actually, someone I met on the cruise. Graham Pratt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean sat back in his chair. “Yeah, Graham came in a few days ago.” He shook his head solemnly. “That cruise sounded like a nightmare. I heard about what happened to you guys, too—about that life raft. Some people were saying it was a suicide pact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna didn’t dignify that with a response. “It was scary to have to evacuate . . . and then get stranded at sea. I sort of had an epiphany when I almost drowned—life’s too short, I’d better make it count. So . . . please, can I help out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean bounced a pencil, eraser down, on the desk. “Well, my dad said you could volunteer again as long as you work hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can do that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” Sean said. He extended his hand to Hanna, and she shook it. Then, his expression suddenly became almost mournful. “You know, I never got to tell you how awful I felt about all that Ali stuff.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, uh, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t even imagine what that must have been like,” Sean went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s eyes filled with tears. It was one thing for a friend, a parent, a complete stranger to offer sympathy, but there was something both touching and weird about Sean saying it. “Thanks,” she mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean stepped forward, wrapped his arms around her, and gave her a quick hug. He smelled familiar, like cinnamon and deodorant and the potpourri his mom used generously around the house. It was a nice smell, a comfortable smell. Suddenly, Hanna didn’t hate him as much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left his office for the women’s staff room, where she changed out of her Rachel Zoe print dress and snakeskin flats into hideous, oversized scrubs that smelled like puke. Then she went back to Sean’s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ms. Marin?” A woman in pink scrubs appeared from around the corner. “I’m Kelly, one of the head nurses. I’m here to show you the ropes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelly’s one of our best,” Sean said proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What would you like me to do?” Hanna asked pertly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you feel about bedpans?” Kelly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna winced, but it wasn’t like she could complain with Sean still standing right there. “I love bedpans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, great!” Kelly pumped her fist in the air. “Let me show you what to do!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly helped her with the first bedpan, giving Hanna the opportunity to carry the pee-filled thing down the hall. A male nurse passed her going the opposite direction. Hanna couldn’t help but stare—he was tall, built, and extremely handsome, with a shaved head and gleaming blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” the nurse said to Hanna, widening his eyes at Hanna’s boobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“H-hey,” Hanna stammered back, then followed the nurse’s gaze. He wasn’t staring at her boobs. He was looking at the bedpan. Pee sloshed over the sides, splashing dangerously close to Hanna’s scrubs. She squealed and almost dropped the thing on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly giggled. “Jeff always has that effect on people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey continued into the next room. Sean was right about the place being overcrowded: There were burn victims everywhere she looked. In the halls. Crammed three to a room. There was even a bed in one of the waiting areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this legal?” Hanna asked, nearly tripping over someone’s monitor stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly shrugged. “Until the new wing is finished, we don’t have anywhere to put everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Kelly pantomimed inhaling and exhaling an invisible cigarette and said she’d be back. Hanna turned back for the supply room to grab a clean bedpan. Something behind her caught her eye. The nurse’s station was empty. Every single chair was unoccupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tiptoed around the desk and peered at the computer console. A program showed a list of patients in the clinic and their corresponding room numbers. Score. She dragged the pointer down the page. GRAHAM PRATT. According to the files, he was in room 142, which was just down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped away from the desk just as Kelly swept around the corner, smelling like a Newport. “Okay, honey, time for mopping!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna added soap to the bucket and started down a hall. She gazed at the room numbers as she passed: 132 . . . 134 . . . 138 . . . and there it was, room 142. It wasn’t a room, per se—more like a small partition in a corner separated by a curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her breath and peeked in. There, on a bed, lay a boy with a big bandage on his head and neck. His eyes were shut tight, and tubes snaked into his hands and mouth. Several machines beeped. A frisson went through Hanna’s body. This was what A was capable of. Hanna must have made a strange noise, because Kelly placed her hand on her shoulder. “That’s your friend? I heard you talking about him to Sean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna stared at the blinking lights on Graham’s monitors. “Y-yeah,” she said, feeling a little bad for lying. “How is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly’s mouth made an upside-down U. “He’s in and out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has he said anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly shrugged. “No. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a split second, she was looking at Hanna kind of suspiciously. “Can you do me a favor?” she asked in an innocent voice. “If he starts to wake up and I’m not here, can you call my house? I want to tell him something important. Something I should have told him before all this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly’s eyes softened. “He really meant something to you, huh?” She gave Hanna’s hand a squeeze. “You got it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Kelly disappeared back into the hall. Hanna remained where she was, staring at the figure on the bed. Graham’s monitors beeped steadily. His chest rose up and down. Then, his eyelids fluttered and his lips parted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna leaned over his bed. “Graham?” she whispered. “Are you there?” Did you see A? she asked silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA puff of air escaped between Graham’s lips. His eyelashes fluttered once more, and then he went motionless on the pillow. Hanna pulled away from the bed, her heart still pounding hard. Graham was going to wake up soon. She could feel it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA high-pitched giggle came from the vents. Hanna stiffened and looked down the hall. Patients lay motionless. Mop water gleamed on the floor. Everything was so still and quiet that for a second Hanna felt like she was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuddered. If she and the others didn’t find Ali and her helper soon, she might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFamily Bonding Time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Emily stepped into Saks Fifth Avenue at the King James Mall, a pin-thin girl appeared with a flower-shaped glass atomizer. “Want to try the new Flowerbomb?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely,” Iris insisted, pushing Emily out of the way and holding out her impossibly skinny, blue-veined wrist. “Now you, Emily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shrugged and complied. After the perfume girl sprayed the fruity liquid on her wrist, Iris glanced at someone behind them. “You should try it, too, Mrs. Fields!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily whirled around. Her mom stood in the entrance, peeling her plastic, see-through rain hat from her head. “M-mom?” Emily stammered. “What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Fields stuffed the hat into her quilted purse. “Iris invited me. And since it was on my way home from CVS, I figured, why not?” Then she stuck out her wrist for some Flowerbomb and gave Iris a warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis whole Iris thing was freaking Emily out more every second. For one thing, Emily kept waiting for The Preserve to call up and say, Um, have you stolen our patient? For another, she hated, hated, hated that Iris had to stay at her house—sometimes without Emily supervising. After Emily had returned from the panic room yesterday, she hadn’t known what to expect. What if Iris had decided to tell her parents everything? What if Iris had flipped out and gone after them with a kitchen knife?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead, she’d found Iris and her parents sitting on the living room couch watching Jeopardy! and drinking tea. Somehow, that was even more terrifying. Iris was acting like she was just a member of the family. “I’m sure Iris is tired, Mom,” Emily had blurted out in horror. “She’s had a long day, and she probably wants to go to bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about? I’m wide awake!” Iris had said eagerly, moving a little closer to Mrs. Fields on the couch. She had been eating, Emily had noticed, one of her mom’s Rice Krispies treats. No one ate those things—they always came out hard as rocks and way over-buttered. Mrs. Fields, of course, had looked thrilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Emily poked Iris’s side. “Why did you invite my mom?” she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris shrugged innocently. “She’s cool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, right, Emily thought, waiting for Iris to roll her eyes and say something nasty. But she didn’t. Instead, Iris turned, checked to see that the perfume girl’s back was turned and Mrs. Fields’s attention was occupied by a free makeup sample offer, and scooped up a Flowerbomb perfume box from a display table and slid it up the sleeve of the baggy sweatshirt Emily had lent her. Emily reached forward to stop her, but Iris just gave her an I-know-what-I’m-doing look. This was the reason they were at the mall, after all. Steal lots of shit from Saks was number sixteen on her list of Things I Want to Do During My Time Off from The Preserve. Maybe there were bonus points for doing it in front of Emily’s mom. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crushed-pretty-little-liars-13/page-14.html","bookId":2389,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM"}
