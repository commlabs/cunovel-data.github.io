Behind them, they left curious civilians and the scent of overheated bearings. Miller leaned forward in his seat, willing the cart to go faster. They were three levels and maybe four kilometers from the station house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Havelock said. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027m missing something here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Miller said. He meant What are you yammering about? Havelock took it as What are you missing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A water hauler millions of klicks from here got vaporized. Why are we going to full alert? Our cisterns will last months without even going on rationing. There are a lot of other haulers out there. Why is this a crisis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller turned and looked at his partner straight on. The small, stocky build. The thick bones from a childhood in full g. Just like the asshole in the transmission. They didn\u0027t understand. If Havelock had been in this James Holden\u0027s place, he might have done the same stupid, irresponsible, idiotic bullshit. For the space of a breath, they weren\u0027t security anymore. They weren\u0027t partners. They were a Belter and an Earther. Miller looked away before Havelock could see the change in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That prick Holden? The one in the broadcast?\" Miller said. \"He just declared war on Mars for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cart swerved and bobbed, its internal computer adjusting for some virtual hiccup in the traffic flow half a kilometer ahead. Havelock shifted, grabbing for the support strut. They hit a ramp up to the next level, civilians on foot making a path for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You grew up where the water\u0027s maybe dirty, but it falls out of the sky for you,\" Miller said. \"The air\u0027s filthy, but it\u0027s not going away if your door seals fail. It\u0027s not like that out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027re not on the hauler. We don\u0027t need the ice. We aren\u0027t under threat,\" Havelock said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller sighed, rubbing his eyes with thumb and knuckle until ghosts of false color bloomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was homicide,\" Miller said, \"there was this guy. Property management specialist working a contract out of Luna. Someone burned half his skin off and dropped him out an airlock. Turned out he was responsible for maintenance on sixty holes up on level thirty. Lousy neighborhood. He\u0027d been cutting corners. Hadn\u0027t replaced the air filters in three months. There was mold growing in three of the units. And you know what we found after that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Havelock asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a goddamn thing, because we stopped looking. Some people need to die, and he was one. And the next guy that took the job cleaned the ducting and swapped the filters on schedule. That\u0027s what it\u0027s like in the Belt. Anyone who came out here and didn\u0027t put environmental systems above everything else died young. All us still out here are the ones that cared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Selective effect?\" Havelock said. \"You\u0027re seriously arguing in favor of selective effect? I never thought I\u0027d hear that shit coming out of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Racist propaganda bullshit,\" Havelock said. \"It\u0027s the one that says the difference in environment has changed the Belters so much that instead of just being a bunch of skinny obsessive-compulsives, they aren\u0027t really human anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not saying that,\" Miller said, suspecting that it was exactly what he was saying. \"It\u0027s just that Belters don\u0027t take the long view when you screw with basic resources. That water was future air, propellant mass, and potables for us. We have no sense of humor about that shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cart hit a ramp of metalwork grate. The lower level fell away below them. Havelock was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This Holden guy didn\u0027t say it was Mars. Just that they found a Martian battery. You think people are going to... declare war?\" Havelock said. \"Just on the basis of this one guy\u0027s pictures of a battery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ones that wait to get the whole story aren\u0027t our problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least not tonight, he thought. Once the whole story gets out, we\u0027ll see where we stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe station house was somewhere between one-half and three-quarters full. Security men stood in clumps, nodding to each other, eyes narrow and jaws tight. One of the vice cops laughed at something, his amusement loud, forced, smelling of fear. Miller saw the change in Havelock as they walked across the common area to their desks. Havelock had been able to put Miller\u0027s reaction down to one man\u0027s being oversensitive. A whole room, though. A whole station house. By the time they reached their chairs, Havelock\u0027s eyes were wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Shaddid came in. The bleary look was gone. Her hair was pulled back, her uniform crisp and professional, her voice as calm as a surgeon in a battlefield hospital. She stepped up on the first desk she came to, improvising a pulpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve seen the transmission. Any questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who let that fucking Earther near a radio?\" someone shouted. Miller saw Havelock laugh along with the crowd, but it didn\u0027t reach his eyes. Shaddid scowled and the crowd quieted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s the situation,\" she said. \"No way we can control this information. It was broadcast everywhere. We have five sites on the internal network that have been mirroring it, and we have to assume it\u0027s public knowledge starting ten minutes ago. Our job now is to keep the rioting to a minimum and ensure station integrity around the port. Station houses fifty and two thirteen are helping on it too. The port authority has released all the ships with inner planet registry. That doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re all gone. They still have to round up their crews. But it does mean they\u0027re going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The government offices?\" Miller said, loud enough to carry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not our problem, thank God,\" Shaddid said. \"They have infrastructure in place. Blast doors are already down and sealed. They\u0027ve broken off from the main environmental systems, so we aren\u0027t even breathing their air right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s a relief,\" Yevgeny said from the cluster of homicide detectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now the bad news,\" Shaddid said. Miller heard the silence of a hundred and fifty cops holding their breath. \"We\u0027ve got eighty known OPA agents on the station. They\u0027re all employed and legal, and you know this is the kind of thing they\u0027ve been waiting for. We have an order from the governor that we\u0027re not going to do any proactive detention. No one gets arrested until they do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngry voices rose in chorus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who does he think he is?\" someone called from the back. Shaddid snapped at the comment like a shark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The governor is the one who contracted with us to keep this station in working order,\" Shaddid said. \"We\u0027ll follow his directives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his peripheral vision, Miller saw Havelock nod. He wondered what the governor thought of the question of Belter independence. Maybe the OPA weren\u0027t the only ones who\u0027d been waiting for something like this to happen. Shaddid went on, outlining the security response they were permitted. Miller listened with half an ear, so lost in speculating on the politics behind the situation he almost missed it when Shaddid called his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miller will take the second team to the port level and cover sectors thirteen through twenty-four. Kasagawa, team three, twenty-five through thirty-six, and so on. That\u0027s twenty men apiece, except for Miller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can make it with nineteen,\" Miller said, then quietly to Havelock, \"You\u0027re sitting this one out, partner. Having an Earther with a gun out there isn\u0027t going to make things better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Havelock said. \"Saw that coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Shaddid said. \"You all know the drill. Let\u0027s move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller rounded up his riot squad. All the faces were familiar, all men and women he\u0027d worked with over his years in security. He organized them in his mind with a nearly automatic efficiency. Brown and Gelbfish both had SWAT experience, so they would lead the wings if it came to crowd control. Aberforth had three write-ups for excessive violence since her kid had been busted for drug running on Ganymede, so she was second string. She could work out her anger-management issues another time. Around the station house, he heard the other squad commanders making similar decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Miller said. \"Let\u0027s suit up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved away in a group, heading for the equipment bay. Miller paused. Havelock remained leaning against his desk, arms folded, eyes locked on the middle distance. Miller was torn between sympathy for the man and impatience. It was hard being on the team but not on the team. On the other hand, what the hell had he expected, taking a contract in the Belt? Havelock looked up, meeting Miller\u0027s gaze. They nodded to each other. Miller was the first to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe equipment bay was part warehouse, part bank vault, designed by someone more concerned with conserving space than getting things out efficiently. The lights - recessed white LEDs - gave the gray walls a sterile cast. Bare stone echoed every voice and footfall. Banks of ammunition and firearms, evidence bags and test panels, spare servers and replacement uniforms lined the walls and filled most of the interior space. The riot gear was in a side room, in gray steel lockers with high-security electronic locks. The standard outfit consisted of high-impact plastic shields, electric batons, shin guards, bullet-resistant chest and thigh armor, and helmets with reinforced face guards - all of it designed to make a handful of station security into an intimidating, inhuman force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller keyed in his access code. The seals released; the lockers opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Miller said conversationally. \"Fuck me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lockers were empty, gray coffins with the corpses all gone. Across the room, he heard one of the other squads shouting in outrage. Miller systematically opened every riot control locker he could get to. All of them were the same. Shaddid appeared at his side, her face pale with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s plan B?\" Miller asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaddid spat on the floor, then closed her eyes. They shifted under her lids like she was dreaming. Two long breaths later, they opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check the SWAT lockers. There should be enough in there to outfit two people in each squad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Snipers?\" Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a better idea, Detective?\" Shaddid said, leaning on the last word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller raised his hands in surrender. Riot gear was meant to intimidate and control. SWAT gear was made to kill with the greatest efficiency possible. Seemed their mandate had just changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn any given day, a thousand ships might be docked on Ceres Station, and activity there rarely slowed and never stopped. Each sector could accommodate twenty ships, the traffic of humanity and cargo, transport vans, mesocranes, and industrial forklifts, and his squad was responsible for twenty sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air stank of refrigerant and oil. The gravity was slightly above 0.3 g, station spin alone lending the place a sense of oppression and danger. Miller didn\u0027t like the port. Having vacuum so close under his feet made him nervous. Passing the dockworkers and transport crews, he didn\u0027t know whether to scowl or smile. He was here to scare people into behaving and also to reassure them that everything was under control. After the first three sectors, he settled on the smile. It was the kind of lie he was better at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had just reached the junction of sectors nineteen and twenty when they heard screaming. Miller pulled his hand terminal out of his pocket, connected to the central surveillance network, and called up the security camera array. It took a few seconds to find it: a mob of fifty or sixty civilians stretching almost all the way across the tunnel, traffic blocked on both sides. There were weapons being waved over heads. Knives, clubs. At least two pistols. Fists pumped in the air. And at the center of the crowd, a huge shirtless man was beating someone to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Showtime,\" Miller said, waving his squad forward at a run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still a hundred meters from the turn that would take them to the clot of human violence when he saw the shirtless man knock his victim to the ground, then stomp on her neck. The head twisted sideways at an angle that didn\u0027t leave any question. Miller slowed his team to a brisk walk. Arresting the murderer while surrounded by a crowd of his friends would be tough enough without being winded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was blood in the water now. Miller could sense it. The mob was going to turn out. To the station, to the ships. If the people started joining the chaos... what path would it be likely to take? There was a brothel one level up from there and half a kilometer anti-spinward that catered to inner planet types. The tariff inspector for sector twenty-one was married to a girl from Luna and had bragged about it maybe once too often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were too many targets, Miller thought even as he motioned his snipers to spread out. He was trying to reason with a fire. Stop it here, and no one else got killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his imagination, Candace crossed her arms and said, What\u0027s plan B?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outer edge of the mob raised the alarm well before Miller reached it. The surge of bodies and threats shifted. Miller tipped back his hat. Men, women. Dark skin, pale, golden brown, and all with the long, thin build of Belters, all with the square-mouthed angry gape of chimpanzees at war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me take a couple of them down, sir,\" Gelbfish said from his terminal. \"Put the fear of God into them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get there,\" Miller said, smiling at the angry mob. \"We\u0027ll get there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face he expected floated to the front. Shirtless. The big man, blood covering his hands and splattered on his cheek. The seed crystal of the riot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That one?\" Gelbfish asked, and Miller knew that a tiny infrared dot was painting Shirtless\u0027 forehead even as he glowered at Miller and the uniforms behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Miller said. \"That\u0027ll only set the rest of them off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do we do?\" Brown said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a hell of a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" Gelbfish said. \"The big fucker\u0027s got an OPA tattoo on his left shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Miller said, \"if you do have to shoot him, start there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped forward, tying his terminal into the local system, overriding the alert. When he spoke, his voice boomed from the overhead speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Detective Miller. Unless you all want to be locked up as accessories to murder, I suggest you disperse now.\" Muting the microphone in his terminal, he said to Shirtless, \"Not you, big fella. Move a muscle and we shoot you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone in the crowd threw a wrench, the silver metal arcing low through the air toward Miller\u0027s head. He almost stepped out of the way, but the handle caught him across the ear. His head filled with the deep sound of bells, and the wet of blood tracked down his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold fire,\" Miller shouted. \"Hold your fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd laughed, as if he\u0027d been talking to them. Idiots. Shirtless, emboldened, strode forward. The steroids had distended his thighs so badly that he waddled. Miller turned the mic on his terminal back on. If the crowd was watching them face each other down, they weren\u0027t breaking things. It wasn\u0027t spreading. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So. Friend. You only kick helpless people to death, or can anybody join in?\" Miller asked, his voice conversational but echoing out of the dock speakers like a pronouncement from God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fuck you barking, Earth dog?\" Shirtless said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earth?\" Miller said, chuckling. \"I look like I grew up in a gravity well to you? I was born on this rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inners kibble you, bitch,\" Shirtless said. \"You they dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuckin\u0027 dui,\" Shirtless said. Fucking true. He flexed his pectorals. Miller suppressed the urge to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So killing that poor bastard was for the good of the station?\" Miller said. \"The good of the Belt? Don\u0027t be a chump, kid. They\u0027re playing you. They want you to act like a bunch of stupid riotboys so they have a reason to shut this place down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Schrauben sie sie weibchen,\" Shirtless said in Belter-inflected gutter German, leaning forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, second time I\u0027ve been called a bitch, Miller thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kneecap him,\" Miller said. Shirtless\u0027 legs blew out in twin sprays of crimson and he went down howling. Miller walked past his writhing body, stepping toward the mob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re taking your orders from this pendejo?\" he said. \"Listen to me, we all know what\u0027s coming. We know dance starting, now, like pow, right? They fucked tu agua, and we all know the answer. Out an airlock, no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see it in their faces: the sudden fear of the snipers, then the confusion. He pressed on, not giving them time to think. He switched back to the lower-level lingo, the language of education, authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what Mars wants? They want you, doing this. They want this piece of shit here to make sure that everyone looks at Belters and thinks we\u0027re a bunch of psychopaths who tear up their own station. They want to tell themselves we\u0027re just like them. Well, we aren\u0027t. We\u0027re Belters, and we take care of our own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked a man at the edge of the mob. Not as pumped as Shirtless, but big. He had an OPA split circle on his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" Miller said. \"You want to fight for the Belt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dui,\" the man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet you do. He did too,\" Miller said, jerking a thumb back at Shirtless. \"But now he\u0027s a cripple, and he\u0027s going down for murder. So we\u0027ve already lost one. You see? They\u0027re turning us against each other. Can\u0027t let them do that. Every one of you I have to arrest or cripple or kill, that\u0027s one less we have when the day comes. And it\u0027s coming. But it\u0027s not now. You understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe OPA man scowled. The mob drew back from him, making space. Miller could feel it like a current against him. It was shifting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Day\u0027s coming, hombre,\" the OPA man said. \"You know your side?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone was a threat, but there was no power behind it. Miller took a slow breath. It was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always the side of the angels,\" he said. \"Why don\u0027t you all go back to work? Show\u0027s over here, and we\u0027ve all got plenty that needs doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMomentum broken, the mob fell apart. First one and two peeling off from the edges, and then the whole knot untying itself at once. Five minutes after Miller had arrived, the only signs that anything had happened were Shirtless mewling in a pool of his own blood, the wound on Miller\u0027s ear, and the body of the woman fifty good citizens had stood by and watched be beaten to death. She was short and wearing the flight suit of a Martian freight line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one dead. Makes it a good night, Miller thought sourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to the fallen man. The OPA tattoo was smeared red. Miller knelt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friend,\" he said. \"You are under arrest for the murder of that lady over there, whoever the hell she is. You are not required to participate in questioning without the presence of an attorney or union representative, and if you so much as look at me wrong, I\u0027ll space you. Do we understand each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the look in the man\u0027s eyes, Miller knew they did. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leviathan-wakes-expanse-1/page-7.html","bookId":2454,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:39 PM"}
