If you win him, you\u0027ll never work again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week after I received my Oscar, Sam Weisbord stopped by my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations, again. Where are you going to keep it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to be modest about it. What would you think about the roof of my house with half a dozen spotlights on it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Spectacular!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to tell you, Sammy, winning it was a complete shock to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said, dryly. \"I heard your speech.\" He sat down and added casually, \"By the way, I\u0027ve just come from Benny Thau\u0027s office.\" Thau was Metro\u0027s deal-maker. \"You have a seven-year contract here. They gave us everything we asked for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t believe it. \"That\u0027s wonderful.\" The power of the Oscar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the things they caved in on was your request to take three months a year off anytime you want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\" I wanted to be free to do other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had moved into a small carriage house in Westwood. The house consisted of a small bedroom, a small den, a small living room, a small kitchen, and two small bathrooms. There was a garage attached that was bigger than the house. Tony Curtis and the beautiful Janet Leigh, both extremely talented actors, lived in an apartment a few doors away. They had a car, but no place to park it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a dinner party one night, Tony said, \"We\u0027re having a problem parking on the street. I wonder if we could rent your garage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t rent it,\" I said, \"but you can use it,\" and from then on their car was parked in my garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy house was much too small to give parties in, but I didn\u0027t know that, so I gave a lot of parties. I had been lucky enough to find a terrific Filipino cook, who also bartended and cleaned the house. Since I started at MGM, I had met a lot of interesting people. Ira Gershwin came to dinner with his wife, Lee. Kirk Douglas, Sid Caesar, and Steve Allen also came, along with their significant others. It was a long and wonderful guest list. More than once, Jules Stein, head of MCA, the most powerful talent agency in Hollywood, came to dinner with his wife, Doris. We often sat on the floor because there were not enough chairs, but no one seemed to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most interesting men I met was Robert Schiffer, head of makeup at Disney Studios. He was English and had flown with the Royal Air Force during World War II. He owned a yacht and had traveled all over the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1946, Schiffer was working on a Rita Hayworth movie. Rita was about to start another one for Harry Cohn. Instead, she and Schiffer decided to run away to Mexico. The picture was held up while they had a romantic vacation. Harry Cohn was going crazy because he could not find them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery Saturday afternoon, I had a gin game at my house. There were half a dozen regulars. Jerry Davis, a writer-producer, was one of them, along with the director Stanley Donen, Bob Schiffer, and several others. Elizabeth Taylor, then in her early twenties, was going with Stanley, and every Saturday she would come to prepare lunch for us while we played gin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth was petite and sensual, with incredible violet eyes and a hint of the magic that was going to make her a legend. It was hard to believe that this beauty was in my kitchen making sandwiches every Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCyd Charisse was under contract to MGM. She was sexy and talented. She had joined the Ballet Russe when she was thirteen, and was a superb dancer. I had taken her out a few times. We had a date for a Saturday night when she called to cancel it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a problem?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCyd was evasive. \"I\u0027ll tell you more about it Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not have to tell me. It was in all the headlines. Over the weekend she had married the popular singer Tony Martin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCyd called me. \"I guess you heard the news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. I hope you and Tony will be very happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to forget Cyd by burying myself in my work. I was ready for another assignment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenneth McKenna, head of the MGM story department, summoned me to his office. McKenna was in his mid-fifties, a ramrod-straight, gray-haired martinet who ran his department like a fief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo greeting. \"I have an assignment for you. Show Boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a fantastic assignment. Show Boat was one of the great musicals. It had a brilliant score and a wonderful libretto. I loved it. But I had a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kenneth,\" I said, \"I\u0027ve just done two adaptations. I\u0027d like to work on some original material.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up from his chair. \"You\u0027ll work on whatever I tell you to work on. You\u0027re under contract to this studio. You\u0027ll scrub floors if I tell you to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never did write Show Boat. I was much too busy scrubbing floors for the next few weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had planned a trip to Europe during my three months off that year, and I was very excited about it. I had booked passage on the Liberte, a French ship that I heard was fantastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Natalie and Marty, and Richard and Joan, to say goodbye, then flew to New York to board the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the passengers was Charles MacArthur, whom I had met before. He was a brilliant playwright who, with Ben Hecht, had written The Front Page, Jumbo, and Twentieth Century. With him was his wife, America\u0027s preeminent actress, Helen Hayes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Charles had first seen her at a party, he was instantly smitten. He had picked up a bowl of peanuts, offered them to her, and said, \"I wish these were diamonds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were married shortly thereafter. The following year, on Helen\u0027s birthday, Charles handed her a small bowl of diamonds and said, \"I wish these were peanuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther passengers included: Rosalind Russell and her husband, producer Fred Brisson, and Elsa Maxwell, the famous party giver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first day out to sea, Charles came to me and said, \"Elsa Maxwell heard about you winning an Oscar. She wants to invite you to her dinner party tonight. I told her that you did not socialize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie! I\u0027d love to go to her dinner party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"You have to play hard to get. I\u0027ll tell her you\u0027re thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that afternoon, Elsa Maxwell herself came up to me and said, \"Mr. Sheldon, I\u0027m giving a small dinner party tonight. I would love to have you join us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner was delightful and the guests seemed to enjoy themselves. At the end of the meal, as I got up to leave, a steward said, \"Excuse me, Mr. Sheldon. That will be three dollars for the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I\u0027m a guest of Miss Maxwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. That will be three dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie tried to calm me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind the idea of it,\" I said, \"it\u0027s the money I object to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie laughed. \"Sidney, her skill lies in bringing people together. She never pays for anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got to London, I checked into the storied Savoy Hotel. Though the war was over, England was still feeling the effects of it. Rationing was in effect and there was a shortage of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the room service waiter came to see me in the morning, I said, \"I\u0027ll have grapefruit, scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked pained. \"I\u0027m terribly sorry, sir. None of that is available. You have a choice of mushrooms or kippers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I chose the mushrooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, I ordered the kippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I went to a restaurant that night, there was almost nothing edible on the menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning I was surprised by a call from Tony Martin. \"You didn\u0027t tell us you were in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to come to my show tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no intention of meeting the man who had married the lady I was very fond of. \"I can\u0027t - I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m leaving a ticket for you at the box office.\" He added, \"Come backstage after the show,\" and hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no interest in seeing his show. I would go backstage, tell him how brilliant he was, and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to see his performance that evening anyway and he was amazing. The audience loved him. I went backstage to his dressing room to congratulate him and Cyd was there. I got a big hug, and Cyd introduced me to Tony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have supper with us tonight,\" Tony said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Thanks, but I\u0027ll - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony Martin turned out to be one of the nicest men I had ever met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupper was at an exclusive, private club. What I did not know was that the private clubs in London were immune to rationing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter said, \"We have lovely steaks tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all ordered steaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter said to me, \"Would you like an egg on your steak, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the first egg I had since arriving in London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent every night after that with Cyd and Tony, having a marvelous time on their honeymoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, Tony said to me, \"We\u0027re leaving for Paris in the morning. Get packed. You\u0027re coming with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe flew to Paris, and it was fabulous. Tony hired a limousine to take us to the usual tourist spots - the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, Napoleon\u0027s Tomb - and we ate delectable meals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Sunday morning, Tony had arranged for a limousine to take us to Longchamps to see the races. Unfortunately we had all gotten food poisoning the night before and we were in terrible shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTony phoned. \"Cyd and I feel awful. We\u0027re not going to be able to go to the track.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither am I, Tony. I feel - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a limousine downstairs, waiting for you. Take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tony - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it. Put a bet on a horse for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to Longchamps alone, semiconscious. There was a long line at the betting window. When I finally got to the head of it, the man behind the counter said, \"Oui?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spoke no French. I shoved some money across the counter and held up one finger, \"Number une,\" and I touched my nose. He said something unintelligible and shoved the money back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried again. \"Number une.\" I held up my finger and touched my nose. \"On the nose, to win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved the money back again. The people in line behind me were getting impatient. A man stepped out of the line and came up to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the problem?\" he asked in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to bet this money on number one to win.\" The man spoke in French to the cashier, then turned to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Number one has been scratched,\" he said. \"Pick another horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chose number two, got a handful of tickets, and stumbled out to watch the race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber two won, and Tony and Cyd and I split the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat trip was something I never forgot and I resolved to go to Europe every year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat August, Dore Schary resigned as head of RKO after accepting an offer from Louis B. Mayer to become head of production at MGM. My old boss was now my new boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was assigned to write the screenplay for Nancy Goes to Rio, which was to star Ann Sothern, Jane Powell, Barry Sullivan, Carmen Miranda, and Louis Calhern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture was being produced by Joe Pasternak, a middle-aged Hungarian producer with a heavy accent. Before he came to MGM, he produced small pictures at Universal, a studio on the verge of bankruptcy. A young actress named Deanna Durbin was released from her contract at MGM and went to Universal. Joe Pasternak was assigned by Universal to do a picture with Deanna called Three Smart Girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the studio\u0027s amazement, the picture exploded at the box office. Overnight, Deanna Durbin became a major star and Universal was saved. Shortly after that, Joe Pasternak accepted an offer at MGM as a producer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, Dore Schary called a meeting of the producers on the lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were all seated in his office, Dore said, \"We have a problem. I just bought a play called Tea and Sympathy. It\u0027s a big Broadway hit, but the censorship office won\u0027t let us make it because it involves a homosexual. We have to come up with another angle. I want to hear your suggestions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a thoughtful silence. Then one of the producers said, \"Instead of a homosexual, we could make him an alcoholic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother producer said, \"He could be on drugs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could be a cripple.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen different ideas were floated around the room, none of them satisfactory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a silence, Joe Pasternak spoke up. \"It\u0027s very simple,\" he said. \"You keep the play exactly as it is. He is a homosexual.\" And then he added, triumphantly, \"But in the end, it\u0027s all a dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the end of the meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the bonuses of working on Nancy Goes to Rio was meeting Louis Calhern. Calhern had started out in the theater and was a brilliant actor. He had a regal appearance, tall and hawk-nosed, with a stentorian voice. He had been briefly married to three actresses and was on his fourth. He had a wonderful sense of humor and was a delight to be with. He had just starred in The Magnificent Yankee, the story of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Louis would come to my house for dinner, as he walked through the front door, he would bellow, \"Where the hell is the food?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI received a telegram from him one day that read: \"Understand that my wife has been hoodwinked into making an engagement for you with me on Saturday night, the fourth. I will meet you in the theater after the lights are out. Please do not expect to be seen in public with me. Calhern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn agent introduced me to a beautiful young Swedish actress whom I\u0027ll call Ingrid, who had come to the United States to make a test at Universal. She was enchanting and we began a romance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few weeks later on a Sunday morning, while I was asleep, the doorbell began to ring. I looked at the bedside clock. It was four A.M. The ringing became more frantic. I reluctantly got up, put on a robe, went to the door and opened it. A stranger, holding a gun, shoved me aside and came into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart began to pound. \"If this is a holdup,\" I said, \"take whatever - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You son of a bitch! I\u0027m going to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not a holdup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt moments like that a writer is supposed to think: This is great material. But what I thought was: I\u0027m going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but you know my wife,\" he shouted. \"You\u0027ve been sleeping with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew he had made a mistake. I never had affairs with married women. \"Look,\" I said, \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. I don\u0027t know who your wife is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ingrid.\" He raised the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - \" It was no mistake. \"Wait a minute! Ingrid never told me she was married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bitch married me so she could get a visa to come to this country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold it,\" I said. \"This is all news to me. She doesn\u0027t wear a wedding ring, and she never mentioned a husband, so there\u0027s no way I could have known. Sit down and let\u0027s talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated a moment and sank into a chair. We were both sweating profusely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not like this,\" he said, \"but I - I love her, and she used me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t blame you for being upset. I think we can both use a drink.\" I fixed stiff drinks for both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later, he was telling me his life story. He was a writer and he had met Ingrid in Europe. He was now unable to get work in Hollywood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You need a job? Let me take care of it. I\u0027ll talk to Kenneth McKenna, at Metro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face lit up. \"Would you? I\u0027d sure appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later, he and his gun were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned out the lights, went back to bed breathing hard, and had finally fallen asleep when I heard a banging at the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s back, I thought. He\u0027s changed his mind. He\u0027s decided to kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out of bed, went to the door and opened it. Ingrid was standing there. She had been beaten up badly. Her face was bruised, she had two black eyes, and her lip was bleeding. I pulled her inside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hardly talk. \"I have to tell you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to tell me. Your husband was here. Get in bed. I\u0027m going to call a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to wake up my doctor, and an hour later he was at the house, tending to Ingrid. She had a broken rib and deep bruises all over her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the doctor left, Ingrid said, \"I don\u0027t know what to do. I have a screen test at Universal this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Not anymore. You can\u0027t go in looking like that. I\u0027ll call and cancel the test.\" And I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIngrid left that evening and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1948, Cy Feuer and Ernie Martin, a new producing team, came to the studio to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re doing a Broadway play called Where\u0027s Charley? It\u0027s based on the classic, Charley\u0027s Aunt. We want you to write it. We\u0027ve cleared your name with the Brandon Thomas Estate. Frank Loesser is going to write the score. Ray Bolger will star.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Loesser had written several popular songs, but he had never done a Broadway show. I knew the plot of Charley\u0027s Aunt and I liked it. I thought it could be a big hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to meet with Frank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll set it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Loesser was a dynamo. He was in his late thirties, talented and ambitious. He had written the wartime hit \"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition,\" and several other popular movie songs, including \"The Moon of Manakoora,\" \"On a Slow Boat to China,\" \"The Boys in the Back Room,\" and \"Kiss the Boys Goodbye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have some great ideas,\" Frank said. \"We can make this a big hit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll work on the libretto with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will be wonderful, Frank,\" I said, \"and I\u0027ll work on the score with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to see Dore Schary. \"I\u0027m going to take my three months off,\" I said, \"to do a Broadway show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What show?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Charley? It\u0027s a remake of Charley\u0027s Aunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDore shook his head. \"Broadway\u0027s risky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"I know. I\u0027ve been there, Dore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you should do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ve already committed and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make a deal with you. How would you like to write the screenplay of Annie Get Your Gun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you forget about that play, I\u0027ll assign you to write Annie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnie Get Your Gun was the biggest hit on Broadway. It had been playing for three years and had four road companies out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1945, Herbert and Dorothy Fields had gone to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein and suggested they do a show about Annie Oakley. Dorothy Fields would write the lyrics and Jerome Kern agreed to do the score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days after Kern arrived in New York, he suffered a stroke, and a few days later he died. Rodgers and Hammerstein decided Irving Berlin should write the score. The show contained half a dozen hits, including the standard, \"There\u0027s No Business Like Show Business.\" MGM had paid six hundred thousand dollars for the rights to Annie Get Your Gun, the highest price up to then for a musical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you say?\" Dore asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. I was certain that Where\u0027s Charley? was going to be a hit, but I was excited about the chance to work with Irving Berlin again. It was impossible to say no to Dore\u0027s offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat afternoon, I called Feuer and Martin and Frank Loesser, and told them of my decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re going to have a big hit,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was right. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-19.html","bookId":2371,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM"}
