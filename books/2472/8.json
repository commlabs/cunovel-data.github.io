She was going to be helping during registration on Friday and Saturday, and Dr. Wexler told her there would probably be between twenty and twenty-five students in each of her three classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s going to be a snap, Dr. Wexler had said, and good experience as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Wexler had shown her to her office; actually, it was a cubicle in the new brick-and-glass Arts and Sciences Building, with a desk and a chair and a window. On the other side of a partition was a Mr. Pierce, a gaunt-looking man in a dark suit who, Dr. Wexler told her, taught a class in calculus. Mr. Pierce came over to say hello and then returned to the papers he was filing away. Kay had gazed at the beige-colored walls of her office, at the cork bulletin board above her desk. Pictures were needed, she decided. Something to brighten it up. A few potted plants on the windowsill. On the bulletin board were about a dozen of those little red and blue and green and yellow pegs with needle-sharp tips. Some of them impaled small pieces of paper, and Kay wondered what had hung there before. Looking through the desk drawers, she\u0027d found paper clips and pens and a memo pad marked FROM THE DESK OF GERALD MEACHAM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer predecessor. When she\u0027d asked Dr. Wexler about the man. he\u0027d been evasive, and it puzzled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Room 119, the classroom she was going to be using, Kay had stood at the lectern beneath the overhead fluorescent lighting and looked across the empty desks. She even practiced writing her name on the blackboard, in yellow chalk: MRS. REID. It still stunned her that what she\u0027d dreamed about for so long was within reach. The chance for a full-time teaching job if her summer work was acceptable. Jesus, she thought. It\u0027s not real. It can\u0027t be. While Evan had worked on the mill journal in La Grange, she\u0027d been teaching a couple of classes. at Clarke Community College and taking advanced courses herself in the afternoon. Her doctorate was still a long way off, but she\u0027d decided she had plenty of time. She could settle in here, teach her algebra classes and maybe tutor some students in the afternoons, and work gradually toward her degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo rush. After a long time she\u0027d switched on the lights in Room 119\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand walked along the linoleum-floored corridor to the soft-drink machine in the teachers\u0027 lounge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she drank her Coke at a table in the corner, she kept her eye on the door, and watched other teachers who came in for a cigarette or just a conversation break. There was an elderly woman who wore her white hair in a tight bun; she bought a grape drink and introduced herself as Mrs. Edith Marsh. She taught poetry and smiled sweetly at almost everything Kay said. Mr. Pierce came in and lit a cigarette, but he spoke with Kay for only a moment before sitting in a chair across the room and gazing out the window onto the nearly empty parking lot. A man in his thirties, wearing blue jeans and a dark blue sport coat, came in and lost a quarter to the soft-drink machine. Kay gave him change for a dollar, and the man puffed on a battered pipe and told her he was a professor in the classics department when she told him it would be her first semester.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wished her good luck and lost another quarter in the machine, and after that, threw up his hands in mock rage and stalked out of the room, leaving a trail of smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d returned to her office one last time, to try to figure out what sort of pictures to bring - still lifes? abstract posters? pastoral scenes? - and then had left the building. And now, reaching the limits of Bethany\u0027s Sin and winding her way toward the Sunshine School nursery and kindergarten where she\u0027d left Laurie for a few hours, she wondered who Gerald Meacham had been. A mathematics instructor, of course. A very fine, intelligent man, Dr. Wexler had said; Mr. Meacham had lived in Spangler. He\u0027d either been fired or had left of his own accord, but there had been a strange look in Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWexler\u0027s eyes when she\u0027d asked which. He seemed not to want to talk about the man. But why not? A scandal or something? Had Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeacham been grading his tests with an eye glued to his female students\u0027 skirts? Anyway, Kay thought, thank God for what had happened to Gerald Meacham; if she hadn\u0027t gotten this teaching job, the family would be on the rocks by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sunshine School was a yellow-and-white house on Blair Street; there was a fenced-in backyard, and as Kay got out of the car and walked up the pathway to the front door, she saw a few children swinging on jungle bars . She could hear their laughter, like the noise of brook water running across flat stones in cool forests. There had been a brook near her house when she was growing up, and she had called it her secret brook and gone there every day one summer to watch that water run. She had thrown rocks into it and made wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne for a happy life. Two for a handsome prince. Three for a beautiful castle to live in. The next winter the construction men came and began clearing for a new highway, and they swept away the pine and oak trees with machines that got hungry at six o\u0027clock every morning. When she had gone back with the first touch of spring to make more wishes, concrete had been poured over her secret brook, and staring at the smooth concrete, she had the distinct and lasting thought that at that precise moment someone she didn\u0027t know and would never know had laughed. Because that someone had stolen something that had belonged, at least for the fleeting days of a seven year-old\u0027s summer, to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd perhaps, even then, she had become a little bitter. And a little afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rang the doorbell; through the panes of clear glass in the door she could see some of the rooms within: walls covered with children\u0027s drawings of horses, scare crows, stick-people, buildings, and cars; a small table ringed by six small chairs; a bookcase filled with Golden Books and Dr. Seuss Cat in the Hat stories; an aquarium with guppies. Two little girls, one dark-haired and the other with long, beautiful red hair, sat reading at the table, and now they were looking up at Kay. Through the hallway came a slender woman wearing a white, uniformlike pantsuit. She smiled at Kay and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKay had met Mrs. Omarian, who operated the Sunshine School, on their last trip to Bethany\u0027s Sin, before they\u0027d left LaGrange for good. Mrs. Omarian, whose first name was Monica, looked to Kay to be about thirty; the woman had a friendly, attractive face framed by a full mane of dark hair, and she carried herself calmly, as if running a day-care center was indeed child\u0027s play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door came open, Kay felt the cool touch of the air conditioning. It was very quiet inside the Sunshine School, as if all the children were napping somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi there,\" Mrs. Omarian said. \"How was your morning at school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Better than I expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you nervous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKay smiled. \"Very much so, I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess that\u0027s to be expected,\" Mrs. Omarian said. She opened the door wider, and Kay stepped into the house. The two children at the table went back to their reading. \"I taught for a few semesters at George Ross myself,\" she told Kay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? In what department?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Psychology, under Dr. Anderson. It was just an introductory course in child psychology, nothing very challenging. But fun, anyway.\" She gave a quick shrug. \"That was about four years ago, and I miss the academic life sometimes. The teachers\u0027 conferences, luncheons, and all that.\" She gazed at Kay without speaking for a few seconds. \"I really envy you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see why. I\u0027d say you have your hands full right here,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKay said. \"And you seem to be doing a good business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. There are more working mothers in Bethany\u0027s Sin than you\u0027d think. Just a minute and I\u0027ll get Laurie; she\u0027s in the back, p1aying.\" Mrs. Omarian turned away from Kay and moved through a corridor to the back door. After another moment Kay felt a tingling sensation at the back of her neck, and she looked behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl with red hair was staring at her. The other child was reading Black Beauty. The red-haired girl said, \"Are you Laurie Reid\u0027s mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Amy Grantham.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s good to meet you, Amy,\" Kay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child was silent for a few seconds, but her eyes never left Kay\u0027s. \"Is Laurie new here?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. We just moved to the village yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"it\u0027s nice here,\" Amy said. Her eyes were blue, like deep tunnels to the soul. They were unblinking. \"My mommy says it\u0027s the best place in the world.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKay smiled. She heard footsteps in the corridor. Mrs. Omarian was holding Laurie\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, honey,\" Kay said, smoothing her little girl\u0027s hair and giving her a kiss on the forehead. \"Did you have good time today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurie nodded. \"We had fun..We played on the swings, and we played with some dolls and saw cartoons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cartoons?\" Kay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a projector in the back,\" Mrs. Omarian explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did we see today, Laurie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roadrunner. And chipmunks. And...Daffy Duck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Omarian smiled and winked at Kay over Laurie\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well\" - Kay took Laurie\u0027s hand - -\"we\u0027ve got to be going. Tell Mrs. Omarian we\u0027ll see her again on Friday morning, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved toward the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, Laurie,\" Amy Grantham said. The other little girl looked up and said good-bye, too. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye,\" Laurie said. \"See you Friday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the front door Mrs. Omarian said, \"That\u0027s a beautifully behaved little girl you have there. If the others were as good as she is, I could watch shows like \u0026amp;#699;Ryan\u0027s Hope\u0027 and \u0026amp;#699;One Life to Live\u0027 all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey said good-bye to Mrs. Omarian, and in another few minutes Kay was driving again toward McClain Terrace while Laurie talked about the other children she\u0027d met. She seemed to have had a good time, and that pleased Kay because Laurie would be spending most of the summer there. Kay wished Laurie could have stayed at home with Evan, but she knew Evan was going to be putting together an office down in the basement and he\u0027d want as much time as possible to work. So it was best that Laurie stayed at the Sunshine School.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way home they passed a modernistic-looking brick building with a glass front, on a corner lot where the overhanging trees cast black shadow shapes. A simple white-on-black sign outside read MABRY CLINIC. Kay knew it was what served as the hospital in Bethany\u0027s Sin, but she\u0027d never been inside and had never met any of the doctors. She\u0027d been concerned about the quality of health care in the village when they\u0027d first been thinking of moving, but Mrs. Giles has assured both her and Evan that the clinic was fully staffed and well equipped, and that Dr. Mabry, the director of the clinic, was the type of physician who insisted on house calls in emergency cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing through the front door of their house, Kay heard the muffled machine-gun chatter of Evan\u0027s battered black typewriter from the basement. Laurie went up to her room to play, and Kay opened the basement door and descended the staircase. Evan sat at the rolltop desk they\u0027d bought at a garage sale several years before; it was nicked and scarred in places, and Evan had replaced three of the four legs, but he\u0027d hand-sanded some of the worst spots and refinished it until it was a beautiful dark oak color that glowed beneath a couple of coats of varnish. he\u0027d positioned the desk on the far side of the basement, near a screened window that he could pull up so he could both look out across the backyard and enjoy the fresh air. Boxes of books were piled up alongside him, awaiting the shelves he\u0027d planned to build since the first day he\u0027d stepped down into the basement and seen its possibilities. He\u0027d brought down two framed posters - one a replica of a Graf Zeppelin travel poster from the thirties, and the other an authentic Harry Blackstone magic show ad, also a garage sale find - and hung them on either side of the window. A metallic desk lamp cast a pool of light over his right shoulder onto the paper in the typewriter, and beside him there was a pad of clean paper and several sheets of what he\u0027d written that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the floor beside the desk was a wicker trash basket, and near that, a couple of pieces of crumpled paper. Kay stood behind him for a moment, watching him work. He would type a few lines and then stop, staring at the paper without moving. Then type a few more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, with a burst of speed, a dozen or more lines. Followed by silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes Evan suddenly straightened up in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to be listening for something. And then he looked around at her, his eyes wide, and his sudden movement frightened her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Kay asked, taking a step backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvan\u0027s eyes cleared at once. \"Sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to scare you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the truth is, you scared the hell out of me. How long have you been standing there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only a little while. I wanted to watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt something down here with me, but I couldn\u0027t figure out what it was. Did you have a good day? Meet everyone you\u0027re supposed to meet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and came over to him, putting her hands on his shoulders and kissing the top of his head, right on one of his funny cowlicks. She knew those cowlicks drove him nuts when he was trying to comb his hair, and usually he just gave up and let it go wild, which to her looked sexy. \"I checked in with Dr. Wexler,\" she said. \"And I\u0027ve even got my own office, too.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" he said, and motioned toward his desk. \"Is it as plush as mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What yours lacks in comfort it makes up for in charm,\" she said, and kissed him again. \"I had a very good day, Evan. I felt like I really belonged there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you do,\" he told her. \"I\u0027m very glad for you, and I\u0027m proud of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over his shoulder at the paper in the type writer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, really. Just some writer\u0027s doodling. I\u0027ve been getting down on paper my first impressions of the village. You know, colors, sounds, smells, - that sort of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting.\" She looked over the paper, saw it was an impression of the ring of flowers in the Circle. \"That\u0027s very nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing it for?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m playing with an idea,\" Evan said. \"There\u0027s a small magazine in Philadelphia called Pennsylvania Progress, and from time to time it runs stories about the smaller towns in the state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistory, type of people, businesses, outlook for the future. I was wondering if they\u0027d consider something on Bethany\u0027s Sin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKay grunted. \"I think they probably would,\" she said . \"But you\u0027re a newcomer here; how are you going to get your story together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old-fashioned research,\" Evan said. \"And legwork.. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s historical information at the library, and certainly a lot of the older people living here know something of the village\u0027s beginnings.\" He shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know; maybe it won\u0027t go anywhere, maybe Progress wont buy it, but I think it\u0027s worth working on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then do it,\" Kay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused for a moment, looking at the paper in the typewriter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides,he said, looking back at her, \"wouldn\u0027t you be interested in finding out what the sin was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sin? What sin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever Bethany\u0027s sin was. You\u0027ll have to admit it\u0027s an unusual and intriguing name for a village. I\u0027d like to find the meaning behind it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Maybe it has no meaning. Why should it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why shouldn\u0027t it? Most towns and cities are named after something specific. An event, .a person, a season. Whatever. Take the name Bethany. A person\u0027s name? First name or last name? I\u0027d like to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you think the library would have that information?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But I suppose that\u0027s where I\u0027ll start\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKay fingered her husband\u0027s hair. \"What would you like for dinner? I\u0027ve got pork chops in the refrigerator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like pork chops would be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. That\u0027s the menu for tonight, then. And I\u0027d better get started on it, too. I like your idea about the story. Really I do.\" She moved toward the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I\u0027m glad.\" He turned back to his typewriter and sat in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him for another moment, and when he began typing again, she went upstairs and through the den to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner they drove over to Broome\u0027s Furniture in Westbury Mall, but most of that store\u0027s goods were a little too expensive for them. They walked through the Mall for an hour or so, browsing in the shops, and Evan bought Kay and Laurie ice-cream cones at the Baskin Robbins. Then there was a stop at the supermarket to buy groceries for the rest of the week, and they were on their way back to Bethany\u0027s Sin on Highway 219, the head lights of the station wagon cutting yellow holes in the black curtain of night. Laurie said she could see stars, and Kay helped her count them. They passed a few cars and a large truck heading north, but as they neared the turn-off onto Ashaway, and Bethany\u0027s Sin, Evan noticed that the traffic was sparse. It was very dark without the headlights of other cars to help light the way, and the trees and tangle of wild vegetation along the highway reminded Evan of impenetrable walls. The moon was white and full, like a luminous silver disk floating spirit-like above them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurie said it looked like the face of a princess who lived high among the stars and watched everything on earth. Kay smiled and stroked her hair, and Evan watched the road because something within him was drawing back. He tried to shrug it off, as one would shrug off the tightening of a muscle across the shoulder blades. The wind shrilled through the open windows; the headlights picked out the crushed carcass of a large dog on the side of the road. Its teeth glittered briefly, and the eyes were rotting black sockets. Evan instinctively turned the wheel, and it was then that Kay asked him if he were all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, smiling. \"I\u0027m fine.\" But in another few seconds the smile had faded and was gone. He narrowed his eyes slightly, feeling rather than seeing the twisted trees that bordered the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, finally, was a blinking yellow light that marked the turn-off onto Ashaway. Evan slowed the station wagon and swung off to the left, and then they were moving past the cemetery with its tiers of tombstones. On the streets of Bethany\u0027s Sin, lights burned in most of the houses; in a living room here, a bathroom, a bedroom, a kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePorch lights glowed white or pale yellow. Evan felt comforted by the knowledge that the residents of Bethany\u0027s Sin were settling down for the night: reading the newspaper, watching television, talking over what had happened during the day,preparing themselves for the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought for an instant that he could see through those walls and observe the many families of Bethany\u0027s Sin, all secure and comfortable in their attractive brick and wood homes, all going about the daily business of their lives. But something deeper within him nagged, and he couldn\u0027t figure out what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another moment, when they were a couple of streets away from McClain, Kay sighed and said, \"It\u0027s really quiet out tonight, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowed the car gradually. Kay looked at him, first amused, then irritated, then concerned. He pulled the car to the curb in front of a white, two-story house with a chimney. A light burned behind white curtains in a large picture window. The upstairs of the house was dark. Evan cut the engine and listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaddy?\" Laurie said from the backseat. \"Why did you stop here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhhhhhh,\" Evan whispered. Kay started to speak, but he shook his head. She watched his eyes, feeling a pincer of fear grab her guts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she could no longer stand the silence she said, \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listening,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you hear?\" Evan asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. There\u0027s nothing to listen to out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he said, nodding. When he looked at her, he saw she didn\u0027t understand. \"No noise,\" he told her. \"No sound of cars. No radio or television noise. No conversation leaking through open windows and around us. No one humming or talking or arguing or - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evan,\" Kay said, in that voice she used when she thought he was acting childish. \"What are you talking \" about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen!\" he said, trying to keep his voice low. \"Just be quiet and listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did. From the woodland came the quiet drone of crickets. A night bird chirped sharply from perhaps a street over. But that was all. That\u0027s odd, she told her self. Really odd. No. I\u0027m getting like Evan. it\u0027s not odd at all. it\u0027s simply a quiet village, with quiet people, at a quiet time of the night. She waited for a few more minutes without speaking, and then she thought of the frozen steaks they\u0027d bought, now slowly thawing in the back of the car. \"Let\u0027s go, Evan,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan we go home now, Daddy?\" Laurie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvan looked into his wife\u0027s eyes. She was waiting for him to tum the key in the ignition. Beyond her shoulder something moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvan\u0027s eyes focused on it. A shadow had moved slowly across that picture window, silhouetted against murky light, and paused for just an instant to draw the curtain back a fraction. Then it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvan blinked, not knowing what he\u0027d seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Kay was tugging on his sleeve. \"Remember me? Your long-suffering wife? We\u0027ve got frozen meat and ice cream and milk in three bags back there, and we\u0027d better be getting our tails home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused another moment. The shadow did not return. He said, \"Okay. We\u0027re going.\" He turned the key in the ignition and the engine started; they, pulled away from the curb, and Evan threaded his way toward McClain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvan\u0027s right, Kay thought as they got within sight of their house, dark in a row of lights. It is very silent tonight. Strangely silent. But...better silent than noisy as all hell. Isn\u0027t that one of the reasons we moved to Bethany\u0027s Sin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they pulled into their driveway, Evan was trying to conjure that shadow in his mind. Something funny about it. Something unsettling. Something...something not right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we are,\" Kay said, getting out of the car. \"Who\u0027s going to be good and help with the groceries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will!\" Laurie volunteered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, there\u0027s one Good Samaritan,\" Kay said. \"Evan, aren\u0027t you going to get out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat motionless for another second. And then his head turned toward her. \"Yes,\" he said. He went around to the back of the car to get a bag, and suddenly shivered because he realized what had disturbed him about that shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it had turned toward the window, with the light streaming from behind, Evan had seen that the figure was missing its left arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know why, but that made his nerves tingle as if an ice cube had been dropped down his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKay, carrying a bag, walked on to the door. Laurie, with a smaller bag, followed. Kay turned her head to ward him. \"Come on, slowpoke!\" she called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at that instant, if Evan had been listening to the faint sounds carried on the breezes of night, he would have heard a noise from three streets over, where Blair and Cowlington met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of hoofbeats. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bethany-s-sin/page-8.html","bookId":2472,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:58 PM"}
