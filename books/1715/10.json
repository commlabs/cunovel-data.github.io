You know what I think, I think that whoever stocked this lab did it with outdated ingredients.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Barnes said, \"it\u0027s the atmosphere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe explained that their environment contained only 2 percent oxygen, 1 percent carbon dioxide, but no nitrogen at all. \"Chemical reactions are unpredictable,\" he said. \"You ought to take a look at Levy\u0027s recipe book sometime. It\u0027s like nothing you\u0027ve ever seen in your life. The food looks normal when she\u0027s finished, but she sure doesn\u0027t make it the normal way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the lab?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lab was stocked without knowing the working depth we would be at. If we were shallower, we\u0027d be breathing compressed air, and all your chemical reactions would work - they\u0027d just go very fast. But with heliox, reactions are unpredictable. And if they won\u0027t go, well ...\" He shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I supposed to do?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best you can,\" Barnes said. \"Same as the rest of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, all I can really do is gross anatomical analyses. All this bench is worthless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then do the gross anatomy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wish we had more lab capability. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is it,\" Barnes said. \"Accept it and go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed entered the room. \"You better take a look outside, everybody,\" he said, pointing to the portholes. \"We have more visitors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe squid were gone. For a moment norman saw nothing but the water, and the white suspended sediment caught in the lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look down. At the bottom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea floor was alive. Literally alive, crawling and wiggling and tremulous as far as they could see in the lights. \"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeth said, \"It\u0027s shrimps. A hell of a lot of shrimps.\" And she ran to get her net.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, that\u0027s what we ought to be eating,\" Ted said. \"I love shrimp. And those look perfect-size, a little smaller than crayfish. Probably delicious. I remember once in Portugal, my second wife and I had the most fabulous crayfish. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman felt slightly uneasy. \"What\u0027re they doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. What do shrimps do, anyway? Do they migrate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damned if I know,\" Barnes said. \"I always buy \u0027em frozen. My wife hates to peel \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman remained uneasy, though he could not say why. He could clearly see now that the bottom was covered in shrimps; they were everywhere. Why should it bother him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman moved away from the window, hoping his sense of vague uneasiness would go away if he looked at something else. But it didn\u0027t go away, it just stayed there - a small tense knot in the pit of his stomach. He didn\u0027t like the feeling at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHARRY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hi, Norman. I heard the excitement. Lot of shrimps outside, is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry sat on his bunk, with the paper printout of numbers on his knees. He had a pencil and pad, and the page was covered with calculations, scratchouts, symbols, arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry,\" Norman said, \"what\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damned if I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just wondering why we should suddenly be finding life down here - the squid, the shrimps - when before there was nothing. Ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that. I think that\u0027s pretty clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. What\u0027s different between then and now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been inside the sphere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. I mean, what\u0027s different in the outside environment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman frowned. He didn\u0027t grasp what Harry was driving at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, just look outside,\" Harry said. \"What could you see before that you can\u0027t see now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The grid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. The grid and the divers. Lot of activity - and a lot of electricity. I think it scared off the normal fauna of the area. This is the South Pacific, you know; it ought to be teeming with life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now that the divers are gone, the animals are back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all there is to it?\" Norman said, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you asking me?\" Harry said. \"Ask Beth; she\u0027ll give you a definitive answer. But I know animals are sensitive to all kinds of stimuli we don\u0027t notice. You can\u0027t run God knows how many million volts through underwater cables, to light a half-mile grid in an environment that has never seen light before, and not expect to have an effect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething about this argument tickled the back of Norman\u0027s mind. He knew something, something pertinent. But he couldn\u0027t get it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Norman. You look a little worried. You know, this substitution code is really a bitch. I\u0027ll tell you the truth, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll be able to crack it. You see, the problem is, if it is a letter substitution, you will need two digits to describe a single letter, because there are twenty-six letters in the alphabet, assuming no punctuation - which may or may not be included here as well. So when I see a two next to a three, I don\u0027t know if it is letter two followed by letter three, or just letter twenty-three. It\u0027s taking a long time to work through the permutations. You see what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Norman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened inside the sphere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you\u0027re worried about?\" Harry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think I\u0027m worried about anything?\" Norman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your face,\" Harry said. \"That\u0027s what makes me think you\u0027re worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I am,\" Norman said. \"But about this sphere...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about that sphere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s quite amazing. I really don\u0027t remember what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel fine - I feel better all the time, honest to God, my energy\u0027s back, headache\u0027s gone - and earlier I remembered everything about that sphere and what was inside it. But every minute that passes, it seems to fade. You know, the way a dream fades? You remember it when you wake up, but an hour later, it\u0027s gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember that it was wonderful, and beautiful. Something about lights, swirling lights. But that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get the door to open?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that. It was very clear at the time; I remember I had worked it all out, I knew exactly what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it will come back to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t remember how you opened the door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I just remember this sudden insight, this certainty, about how it was done. But I can\u0027t remember the details. Why, does somebody else want to go in? Ted, probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure Ted would like to go in - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a good idea. Frankly, I don\u0027t think Ted should do it. Think how boring he\u0027ll be with his speeches, after he comes out. \u0027I visited an alien sphere\u0027 by Ted Fielding. We\u0027d never hear the end of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed is right, Norman thought. He\u0027s definitely manic. There was a speedy, overly cheerful quality to Harry. His characteristic slow sarcasm was gone, replaced by a sunny, open, very quick manner. And a kind of laughing indifference to everything, an imbalance in his sense of what was important. He had said he couldn\u0027t crack the code. He had said he couldn\u0027t remember what happened inside the sphere, or how he had opened it. And he didn\u0027t seem to think it mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, when you first came out of the sphere, you seemed worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I? Had a brutal headache, I remember that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kept saying we should go to the surface.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Why was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God only knows. I was so confused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You also said it was dangerous for us to stay here.\" Harry smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Norman, you can\u0027t take that too seriously. I didn\u0027t know if I was coming or going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, we need you to remember these things. If things start to come back to you, will you tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh sure, Norman. Absolutely. You can count on me; I\u0027ll tell you right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE LABORATORY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Beth said. \"none of it makes sense. First of all, in areas where fish haven\u0027t encountered human beings before, they tend to ignore humans unless they are hunted. The Navy divers didn\u0027t hunt the fish. Second, if the divers stirred up the bottom, that\u0027d actually release nutrients and attract more animals. Third, many species of animals are attracted to electrical currents. So, if anything, the shrimps and other animals should\u0027ve been drawn here earlier by the electricity. Not now, with the power off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was examining the shrimps under the low-power scanning microscope. \"How does he seem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill looking through the microscope lens, she said, \"Did he tell you anything about what happened inside the sphere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe adjusted the microscope, shook her head. \"I\u0027ll be damned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Extra dorsal plating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s another new species,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman said, \"Shrimpus bethus? You\u0027re making discoveries hand over fist down here, Beth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh ... I checked the sea fans, too, because they seemed to have an unusual radial growth pattern. They\u0027re a new species as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great, Beth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, looked at him. \"No. Not great. Weird.\" She clicked on a high-intensity light, cut open one of the shrimps with a scalpel. \"I thought so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Norman,\" she said, \"we didn\u0027t see any life down here for days - and suddenly in the last few hours we find three new species? It\u0027s not normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know what\u0027s normal at one thousand feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you. It\u0027s not normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Beth, you said yourself that we simply hadn\u0027t noticed the sea fans before. And the squid and the shrimps - can\u0027t they be migrating, passing through this area, something like that? Barnes says they\u0027ve never had trained scientists living this deep at one site on the ocean floor before. Maybe these migrations are normal, and we just don\u0027t know they occur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" Beth said. \"When I went out to get these shrimps, I felt their behavior was atypical. For one thing, they were too close together. Shrimps on the bottom maintain a characteristic distance from one another, about four feet. These were packed close. In addition, they moved as if they were feeding, but there\u0027s nothing to feed on down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing that we know of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, these shrimps can\u0027t have been feeding.\" She pointed to the cut animal on the lab bench. \"They haven\u0027t got a stomach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look for yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman looked, but the dissected shrimp didn\u0027t mean much to him. It was just a mass of pink flesh. It was cut on a ragged diagonal, not cleanly. She\u0027s tired, he thought. She\u0027s not working efficiently. We need sleep. We need to get out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The external appearance is perfect, except for an extra dorsal fan at the tail,\" she said. \"But internally, it\u0027s all screwed up. There\u0027s no way for these animals to be alive. No stomach. No reproductive apparatus. This animal is like a bad imitation of a shrimp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet the shrimps are alive,\" Norman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she said. \"They are.\" She seemed unhappy about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the squid were perfectly normal inside. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, they weren\u0027t. When I dissected one, I found that it lacked several important structures.

Squid possess a long gill structure for gas exchange. This one didn\u0027t have one.

All of a sudden, impossible animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away from the high-intensity lamp, and he saw that she was close to tears. Her hands were shaking; she quickly dropped them into her lap. \"You\u0027re really worried,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you?\" She searched his face. \"Norman,\" she said, \"all this started when Harry came out of the sphere, didn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess it did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry came out of the sphere, and now we have impossible sea life. ...
