He scooped his hands through the lukewarm water, splashing up on his face and over his head until he saturated his close-cropped hair and admitted to himself he\u0027d delayed thinking as long as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he let his mind settle on what she\u0027d told him. She didn\u0027t still love the other guy after all. The bastard had hurt her. How much, Josh couldn\u0027t even let himself think about yet or he would go crazy from inaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy the hell hadn\u0027t he considered it before? The reason for her reticence made perfect sense. He wanted to pound his head against the wall for his own idiocy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her reindeer socks shuffle until he couldn\u0027t wait any longer to do something for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right back there?\" he asked, for now and the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Her voice drifted over the line, husky from so long in the stark elements. Please God, not from crying. \"Just trying to balance everything until I finish up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo easily memories of helping her bathe in the past came to mind. They\u0027d lucked into a joint TDY, staying in a bed-and-breakfast with an incredible spa tub. She\u0027d been so slick and hot and all over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t misread her desire, damn it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line of dripping green survival gear rippled from her movement, her feet padding to the end. His gut knotted. She stepped into view. He forced his eyes to stay locked on her pale face, the dim light of the fire throwing a candlelight glow all around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sheepish smile played with her lips as she pointed to her matching bra and panties that he would not, would not look at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Red-plaid underwear. Flannel,\" she declared. Her toes wiggled in her Rudolph socks, a safer place to keep his gaze. \"Mystery solved. Nothing near as sexy as a thong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe disagreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for keeping his eyes on her face. Holiday plaid stretched across her generous breasts, dog tags dangling. The sports-bra style covered much while leaving nothing to the imagination. He didn\u0027t need to look further. Her every curve, the dip of her waist, slight flare of her h*ps stayed imprinted in his photographic memory. His hands remembered well the contrasting feel of her soft br**sts and toned muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd damn it, but he was starting to become aroused. Starting? Hell, he was already there, and no way to hide it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWay to be sensitive, dumb ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWincing, he turned away to stoke the fire, the one in the woodstove, since the one in his boxers was roaring just fine. \"Damn, hon, I\u0027m sorry. You\u0027re just so—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Josh, please don\u0027t go getting all weirded out on me about this.\" Her feet whispered across the floor, closer, until the heat of her seared his back without their skin even touching. \"I\u0027m the same person I was four weeks ago when you walked through our bedroom na*ed with pretty much the same action going on then as now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger. No getting weirded out.\" He turned, an inch of crackling air between them. \"And I\u0027m not. I just don\u0027t know how you need me to react.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to be honest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to note that honesty from her might have been helpful over the past months, but that didn\u0027t seem wise. He stuffed down residual anger at her, himself, and most of all at the bastard who\u0027d hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to talk about what you told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know we do, and we will. Soon. I promise. It\u0027s just not easy.\" The confident brace of her bare shoulders faltered. \"I\u0027ve never told anyone before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one? In eight years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis momentary flash of victory over being the one she\u0027d told faded as he realized how high walls eight years in the making would be. Unease dripped over him like the water plopping from their clothes onto the cracked wood floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared down, no answers scrolled on the planks. But he did discover a distraction to buy time until he could figure out what to do next. \"Let me see your feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" Confusion puckered her brow even as she grinned. \"You\u0027re one sick puppy, Rose-Bud.\" \"I need to check your feet for frostbite.\" \"Oh, how are yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his bare feet one at a time. \"Doing well. I may have some skin peel off, but I\u0027m not going to lose any toes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of the woodstove, he unfurled the sleeping bags and unzipped them. He draped one for padding and insulation on the floor. He zipped two together to make a double bed—she would just have to live with that because sharing body heat was practical. Then he draped the final open bag over top, musty but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd too inviting. He stepped back. \"Now, sit.\" \"Yes, sir.\" Shooting him a half salute, she dropped onto the dark green beddings and rolled off her socks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched on his haunches in front of her. Sitting with her on their bedroll seemed to be crossing a boundary best left in place until after they talked more. He lifted her left foot, grazing his thumbs along the tender instep to check circulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoose bumps prickled over her very bare skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze jerked up to hers. She was watching him. Intently. Aware. Her br**sts rose faster. Only shrieking wind and groaning metal rivets filled the silence between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned his focus to her feet, safer territory. Sort of. He rifled through his survival vest in search of the salve for blisters. He shuffled aside the magnifying glass, two pressure bandages, an eye patch, fishing hooks, until he found Band-Aids and the tube of disinfectant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter tending one foot, he lowered it and lifted the other, careful to keep his touch firm this time. \"I\u0027m sorry you won\u0027t get to call your family on Christmas Eve morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s pretty much the least of our worries right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, that caught his attention. Until he realized she meant whoever set up that mini-mining operation and not the fact that he could barely keep his hands off her. \"We\u0027re okay for the next few hours at least until the storm lets up again. I added an extra wedge in the door while you were bathing. The flare guns are loaded. That\u0027s the most we can do for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forked her fingers through sweaty locks swirled into loose curls around her face. \"What a way to spend the holidays. Maybe I should start singing again or something. There were these two people in my sister\u0027s squadron who got stuck in the desert for Christmas Eve. They put together a whole survivalist celebration with a scrub-brush tree and cactus-slice cider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer story told him more than perhaps she intended. She wanted easy. Normal. Not weirded out. He could do normal, funny. For her, he would do damned near anything. \"Is that a hint for me to hump my butt back outside and start gathering up pinecones to rig decorations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, we could string them over the stove with snare wire, like a garland.\" He laughed. She didn\u0027t. His humor faded. \"You are joking, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked back at him. Already his skin chilled over just the thought of tramping outside again. Had she gone unhinged from the stress? But shit, if she wanted pinecones then he\u0027d get them. He started to push up from the floor. A wicked smile split her face. \"Gotcha.\" His laugh burst free, tangled with hers. \"Yeah, you sure did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn more ways than one. Laughter faded. He needed distance to make it through the night. He tugged out two packs of dried apples and tossed one to her. \"It\u0027s about the closest I can come to apple cider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s great. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently they tore open the packets and reconstituted them with melted ice. He ate, trying not to watch her fingers scoop out the sweet fruit and suck the syrup off her fingers. Ah, hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it about this woman that grabbed hold of him and wouldn\u0027t let go? A woman who didn\u0027t need a damned thing from him and would only be open about her feelings when pressed to the wall. A woman with pain in her past he didn\u0027t have a clue how to heal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFailure didn\u0027t sit well with him. \"What was it you were having trouble with behind the screen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, um, I wanted to wash my hair.\" She set aside her empty fruit packet. \"Ridiculous vanity, but I still feel gross. Probably silly to risk catching a cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, hell. There was something he could do for her after all. He may not be able to address her deeper wounds, but he could damn well wash her hair. And right now he needed action. He needed to feel like a man taking care of his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sexist thought? Probably. Especially considering his warrior wife could protect herself. But hey, he\u0027d keep the words to himself. \"Why not go for it? There\u0027s enough melted ice. It\u0027s warm in here. Storm\u0027s going to last through the night. You\u0027ll be well dry by morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chewed her bottom lip but didn\u0027t say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo long strides took him to the clothesline. He ducked behind to retrieve the extra metal washtub and place it in front of her. \"You can lean over this. I\u0027ll pour the water from the other one over your head. No big deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, an image of washing her back in that European hot tub splashed across his mind—a mighty damned big deal. But after months of her keeping such a crucial piece of herself away from him, he needed this sign from her. He may not ever have her love again, but he needed her trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was only trusting him to wash her hair. No big deal, right? She wasn\u0027t giving him her heart again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust lean over that tub and let him pour some water over her head. It wasn\u0027t like they had anything else to do while snowbound in a rusted-out Quonset hut. Nope. Nothing else to do—except get na*ed together or talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWashing her hair sounded like a fine idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlicia folded her hands in her lap to conceal the fact that they shook more than before her first solo flight in pilot training. \"You really want to wash my hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him heft the water-filled tub from the stove, muscles rippling across his back, bulging along his legs. How unfair he had such a great butt that even Scooby-Doo boxers looked macho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh crouched beside the two washtubs, beside her. \"Consider it my Christmas present to you since we\u0027re stuck out here. And hey, a little secret between you and me.\" He winked, his best Josh-charm smile in place. \"I really stunk at arts and crafts when I was a kid. I failed Paper Chain Making 101, so it\u0027s a fair bet any pinecone garland I string would suck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ripped a sheet mixed with the bedroll into towel-size strips, his flexing chest broad with dog tags nestled between toned pecs, bare, inviting. \"I think we\u0027re better off if I give you the rustic salon treatment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven through his jokes and keeping things light for her, she could see his need for her trust. He was talking about a lot more than a hair wash right now and they both knew it. As much as she believed she had a right to her secrets, she also should have been honest with him. Or cut him loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d married this man while holding herself away. Their marriage might not be salvageable, but she still owed him something in honor of the love they had once shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shaking in her hands spread to her insides until she feared she rattled as much as the Quonset hut against the roaring winds. But she wasn\u0027t a coward. She would start with the hair first, secrets later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Since I can\u0027t have the pinecone trimmings, I\u0027ll graciously accept the hair wash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifting her legs under her, she sat on her feet and leaned her head over the tub on the floor by the one full of clean water. Her dog tags clanked against the metal. Smoke from the fire drafted surprisingly well up the pipe until only the sweet scent of burning wood remained, almost sweet enough to cover the musty smell of bedding and damp clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gripped the sides of the basin, trying not to feel silly and oh so vulnerable with the back of her neck bare as if for an executioner. Her spine arched right there for him to see, curved in such a submissive pose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, Josh. Talk. Or do something other than tempt her with the warm whisper of his breath across her shoulders. The fire snapped and popped like the nerves inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cupped his hands in the water and trickled it over her head. Lukewarm, but still she shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to heat it more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd wait longer? Or explain why now she suddenly didn\u0027t mind having grungy hair because the mere thought of being so exposed to him left her feeling weak and hungry? \"No. Thanks. Go ahead and finish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands continued to scoop until her hair was saturated. He reached for the bar of soap and lathered it in his hands. Not a salon-quality shampoo, but she would settle for clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe palmed the crown of her head, slowly working over her hair to spread the suds. Strong fingers from an even stronger man massaged gentle circles along her scalp. Lethargy spread through her exhausted body. Against her steely will, her head lolled forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as she was doing the vulnerable gig, she might as well go for broke and finish spilling her story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least this way she didn\u0027t have to look him in the face when she talked. \"When I told him, Ben, that it was over, he seemed so surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh\u0027s fingers slowed, then picked up pace again while he stayed silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just sat there behind the steering wheel, staring stunned out the windshield over the city. I thought all the signs were there that the relationship needed to end, but he seemed clueless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what were her instincts telling her now? That she wanted to climb all over Josh and lose herself in his arms. In him. She yearned to forget everything and roll with him on the sleeping bag, bathed in the warmth and light of a crackling fire and his equally hot touch. But even if she trusted him, she wasn\u0027t so certain she trusted herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay strong. Hold it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if that meant being alone? Losing the incredible feel of Josh\u0027s hands, so conversely comforting and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estimulating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands clinging tighter to the metal rim, she rested her forehead against her knuckles. \"Then he started crying and begging me not to leave him. I actually felt sorry for him—until I realized he was playing me. When the tears didn\u0027t work, he got angry.\" An understatement. Her jaw ached at the memory. \"He hit me. I still don\u0027t understand how he gained control over the situation so quickly. I guess he caught me by surprise. And then I was dazed. My head hit the dash pretty hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers twitched against her skull. Veins stood out along the tops of his feet. His hands fell away and she almost cried out at the loss. Then she heard the swirl of water, caught a flash as he scooped through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWater trickled over her head and into the basin, parting murky suds. If only the past could be that easy to clean away, but she knew otherwise. \"Eventually, he realized what he\u0027d done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter more blows than she could count or even fully remember. She couldn\u0027t begin to explain her mad scramble trying to get the hell out of the car. Every one of her nails breaking as she scraped her hand across the door, her vision clouded from a swollen eye, snarls of her hair, tears born of terror. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/soldier-s-christmas-wingmen-warriors-8/page-8.html","bookId":2640,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:46 PM"}
