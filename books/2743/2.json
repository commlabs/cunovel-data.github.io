He was probably gonna…” He glanced into my eyes and back at Buck, scowling. “Uh… conceal the evidence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t even contemplate that. He shoved the square package into his front jeans pocket. “I’ll throw it away—he’s sure as hell not getting it back.” Brow still furrowed, he swung his gaze to me again as he climbed in and started the truck. “Are you sure you don’t want me to call the police?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughter sounded from the back door of the house and I nodded. Framed exactly within the center window, Kennedy danced with his arms around a girl dressed in a gauzy, low-cut white outfit, wings, and a halo. Perfect. Just perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point during my battle with Buck, I’d lost the devil-horned headband Erin had stuffed onto my head while I sat on the bed whining that I didn’t want to go to a stupid costume party. Without the accessory, I was just a girl in a skimpy red-sequined dress that I’d refuse to be caught dead wearing otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headlights illuminated Buck as we backed out of the parking spot. Throwing a hand in front of his eyes, he attempted to roll to a sitting position. I could see his split lip, misshapen nose and swollen eye, even from that distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just as well I wasn’t the one behind the wheel. I probably would have run him over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave the name of my dorm when asked, and stared out the passenger window, unable to speak another word as we meandered across campus. With a straightjacket hug, I gripped myself, trying to conceal the shudders wracking through me every five seconds. I didn’t want him to see, but I couldn’t make them stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dorm lot was nearly full; spots near the door were all taken. He angled the truck into a back space and hopped out, coming around to meet me as I slid from the passenger side of my own truck. Teetering on the edge of breaking down and losing it, I took the keys after he activated the door locks, and followed him to the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your ID?” he asked when we reached the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands shook as I unsnapped the front flap on my bag and withdrew the card. When he took it from my fingers, I noted the blood on his knuckles and gasped. “Oh, my God. You’re bleeding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at his hand and shook his head, once. “Nah. Mostly his blood.” His lips pressed flat and he turned away to swipe the card through the door access, and I wondered if he meant to follow me inside. I didn’t think I could hold myself together for much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter opening the door, he handed me my ID card. In the light from the entry vestibule, I could see his eyes more clearly—they were a clear gray-blue under his lowered brows. “You sure you’re okay?” he asked for the second time, and I felt my face crumple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChin down, I shoved the card into my bag and nodded uselessly. “Yes. Fine,” I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe huffed a disbelieving sigh, running a hand through his hair. “Can I call someone for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. I had to get to my room so I could fall apart. “Thank you, but no.” I slipped past him, careful not to brush against any part of him, and headed for the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jackie?” he called softly, unmoving from the doorway. I looked back, gripping the handrail, and our eyes met. “It wasn’t your fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip, hard, nodding once before I turned and ran up the stairs, my shoes rapping against the concrete steps. At the second floor landing, I stopped abruptly and turned to look back at the door. He was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know his name, and couldn’t remember ever seeing him before, let alone meeting him. I’d have remembered those unusually clear eyes. I had no idea who he was… and he’d just called me by name. Not the name on my ID—Jacqueline—but Jackie, the nickname I’d gone by ever since Kennedy renamed me, our junior year of high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo weeks ago:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wanna come up? Or stay over? Erin is staying at Chaz’s this weekend…” My voice was playful, sing-songy. “His roommate’s out of town. Which means I’ll be all alone…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy and I were a month from our three-year anniversary. There was no need to be coy. Erin had taken to calling us an old married couple lately. To which I’d reply, “Jealous.” And then she’d flip me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, yeah. I’ll come up for a little while.” He kneaded the back of his neck as he pulled into the dorm parking lot and searched for a parking space, his expression inscrutable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrickles of apprehension arose in my chest, and I swallowed uneasily. “Are you all right?” The neck-rubbing was a known stress signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flicked a glance in my direction. “Yeah. Sure.” He pulled into the first open spot, wedging his BMW between two pickups. He never, ever wedged his prized import into constricted spots. Door dings drove him insane. Something was up. I knew he was worried over upcoming midterms, especially pre-cal. His fraternity was hosting a mixer the next night, too, which was plain stupid the weekend before midterms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swiped us into the building and we entered the back stairwell that always creeped me out when I was alone. With Kennedy behind me, all I noticed was dingy, gum-adorned walls and the stale, almost sour smell. I jogged up the last flight and we emerged into the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing back at him while unlocking my door, I shook my head over the charming portrayal of a penis someone had doodled onto the whiteboard Erin and I used for notes to each other and from our suitemates. Coed dorms were less mature than depicted on college websites. Sometimes it was like living with a bunch of twelve year olds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could call in sick tomorrow night, you know.” I laid a palm on his arm. “Stay here with me—we’ll hide out and spend the weekend studying and ordering take-out… and other stress-reducing activities…” I grinned naughtily. He stared at his shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart sped up and I suddenly felt warm all over. Something was definitely wrong. I wanted him to spit it out, whatever it was, because my mind was conjuring nothing but alarming possibilities. It had been so long since we’d had a problem or a real conflict that I felt blindsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved into my room and sat on my desk chair, not my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked up to him, our knees bumping, wanting him to tell me he was just in a bad mood, or worried about his upcoming exams. My heart thudding heavily, I put a hand on his shoulder. “Kennedy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jackie, we need to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drumming pulse in my ears grew louder, and my hand dropped from his shoulder. I grabbed it up in my other hand and sat on the bed, three feet from him. My mouth was so dry I couldn’t swallow, let alone speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent, avoiding my eyes for a couple of minutes that felt like forever. Finally, he lifted his gaze to me. He looked sad. Oh, God. Ohgodohgodohgod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been having some… trouble… lately. With other girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, glad I was sitting down. My legs would have buckled and sent me to the floor if I’d have been standing. “What do you mean?” I croaked out. “What do you mean, ‘trouble’ and ‘other girls’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed heavily. “Not like that, not really. I mean, I haven’t done anything.” He looked away and sighed again. “But I think I want to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t understand.” My mind worked frantically to make the best possible situation out of this, but every single remotely-possible alternative sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and paced the room twice before planting himself halfway between the door and me. “You know how important it is to me to pursue a career in law and politics.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, still stunned to silence and pedaling hard to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know our sister sorority?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again, acknowledging the very thing I’d worried about when he moved into the frat house. Apparently, I hadn’t worried enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a girl—a couple of girls, actually, that… well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to keep my voice rational and level. “Kennedy, this doesn’t make sense. You aren’t saying you’ve acted on this, or that you want to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared into my eyes, so there’d be no mistake. “I want to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally, he could have just punched me in the stomach, because my brain refused to comprehend the words he was saying. A physical assault, it might have understood. “You want to? What the hell do you mean, you want to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bolted out of the chair, walked to the door and back—a distance of a dozen feet. “What do you think I mean? Jesus. Don’t make me say it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped. “Why not? Why not say it—if you can imagine doing it—then why the fuck not say it? And what does this have to do with your career plans—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was getting to that. Look, everyone knows that one of the worst things a political candidate or elected representative can do is to become embroiled in some sexual scandal.” His eyes locked on mine in what I recognized as his debate-face. “I’m only human, Jackie, and if I have these desires to sow my wild oats or whatever and I repress it, I’ll probably have the same desire later, even worse. But acting on it then would be a career-killer.” He spread his hands helplessly. “I have no choice but to get it out of my system while I can do it without annihilating my future professional standing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told myself, This isn’t happening. My boyfriend of three years was not breaking up with me so he could bang coeds with shameless abandon. I blinked hard and tried to take a deep breath, but I couldn’t. There was no oxygen in the room. I glared at him, silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw clenched. “Okay, so I guess trying to let you down easy was a bad idea—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is your idea of letting me down easy? Breaking up with me so you can screw other girls? Without feeling guilty? Are you serious?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As a heart attack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing I thought before I picked up my econ textbook and hurled it at him: How can he use such a piece-of-shit cliché in a moment like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin’s voice woke me. “Jacqueline Wallace, get your ass out of that bed and go save your GPA. For chrissake, if I’d let a guy throw off my academic mojo like this, I’d never hear the end of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a dismissive sound from under the comforter before peeking out at her. “What academic mojo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands on her hips, she was wrapped in a towel, fresh from a shower. “Ha. Ha. Very funny. Get up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sniffed, but didn’t budge. “I’m doing fine in all of my other classes. Can’t I just fail this one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth dropped open. “Are you even listening to yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was listening to myself. And I was every bit as disgusted with my cowardly sentiments as Erin—if not more so. But the thought of sitting next to Kennedy for an hour-long class three days a week was unbearable. I couldn’t be sure what his newfound single status would mean in terms of open flirtations or hookups, but whatever it meant, I didn’t want to stare it in the face. Imagining the details was bad enough. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/easy-contours-of-the-heart-1/page-2.html","bookId":2743,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM"}
