The guests could see every movement she made clearly, and they clearly remembered them. However, no one showed any reactions, nor did they have the chance to do anything! It was because Madeline and Piccolo’s speed had already far surpassed the limit of their understanding. As a result, no one had the ability to react, but for some reason, they could clearly see and remember all of the movements these two giants of the Trials Division made.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe hearts of the guests seemed to have stopped beating.

She continued to carry a sweet smile, only now, her gray hair no longer fluttered about, and a deep bloody scar appeared on her face. Her sinister armor was incredibly tattered, looking like a pile of scrap metal as it hung from her body. Only a meter was left of Death Prison as well. Her left hand was hanging limply from her body, and the armor covering her hand was missing.
