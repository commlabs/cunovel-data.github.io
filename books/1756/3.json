The career of Lucky Starr would have ended at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, the vegetation that had so thickly met the eye was neither grass nor shrubbery, but seaweed. The flat plain was no surface of soil and rock, but water, the top of an ocean that surrounded and covered all of Venus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Venus Marvel, even so, hit the ocean with a thunderous rattle, tore through the ropy weeds, and boiled its way into the depths. Lucky and Bigman were hurled against the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ordinary vessel might have been smashed, but the Venus Marvel had been designed for entering water at high speed. Its seams were tight; its form, streamlined. Its wings, which Lucky had neither time nor knowledge to retract, were torn loose, and its frame groaned under the shock, but it remained seaworthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown, down it went into the green-black murk of the Venusian ocean. The cloud-diffused light from above was almost totally stopped by the tight weed cover. The ship\u0027s artificial lighting did not go on, its 20 workings apparently put out of order by the shock of contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky\u0027s senses were whirling. \"Bigman,\" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer, and he stretched out his arms, feeling. His hand touched Bigman\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bigman!\" he called again. He felt the little Martian\u0027s chest, and the heart was beating regularly. Relief washed over Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no way of telling what was happening to the ship. He knew he could never find any way of controlling it in the complete darkness that enveloped them. He could only hope that the friction of the water would halt the ship before it struck bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt for the pencil flash in his shirt pocket-a little plastic rod some six inches long that, on activation by thumb pressure, became a solid glow of light that streamed out forward, its beam broadening without seeming to weaken appreciably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky groped for Bigman again and examined him gently. There was a lump on the Martian\u0027s temple, but no broken bones so far as Lucky could tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman\u0027s eyes fluttered. He groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky whispered, \"Take it easy, Bigman. We\u0027ll be all right.\" He was far from sure of that as he stepped out into the corridor. The pilots would have to be alive and cooperative if the ship were ever to see home port again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were sitting up, blinking at Lucky\u0027s flash as he came through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" groaned Johnson. \"One minute I was at the controls, and then...\" There was no hostility, only pain and confusion, in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Venus Marvel was back to partial normality. It was limping badly, but its searchlights, fore and aft, had been restored to operation and the emergency batteries had been rigged up to supply them with all the power they would need for vital operations. The churning of the propeller could be dimly heard, and the planetary coaster was displaying, adequately enough, its third function. It was a vessel that could navigate, not only in space and in air, but under water as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Reval stepped into the control room. He was downcast and obviously embarrassed. He had a gash on his cheek, which Lucky had washed, disinfected, and neatly sprayed with koagulum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReval said, \"There are a few minor seepages, but I plugged them. The wings are gone, and the main batteries are all junked up. We\u0027ll need all sorts of repairs, but I guess we\u0027re lucky at that. You did a good job,.Mr. Williams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky nodded briefly. \"Suppose you tell me what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReval flushed. \"I don\u0027t know. I hate to say it, but I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about you?\" asked Lucky, addressing the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTor Johnson, his large hands nursing the radio back to life, shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReval said, \"The last clear thoughts I can remember were while we were still inside the cloud layer. I remember nothing after that till I found myself staring at your flash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Do you or Johnson use drugs of any kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson looked up angrily. He rumbled, \"No. Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what made you blank out, and both at the same time, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReval said, \"I wish I knew. Look, Mr. Williams, neither one of us is an amateur. Our records as coaster pilots are first class.\" He groaned. \"Or at least we were first-class pilots. We\u0027ll probably be grounded after this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see,\" said Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say, look,\" said Bigman, testily, \"what\u0027s the use of talking about what\u0027s over and gone? Where are we now? That\u0027s what I want to know. Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTor Johnson said, \"We\u0027re \u0027way off our course. I can tell you that much. It will be five or six hours before we get out to Aphrodite.\" \"Fat Jupiter and little satellites!\" said Bigman, staring at the blackness outside the port in disgust. \"Five or six hours in this black mess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAphrodite is the largest city on Venus, with a population of over a quarter of a million.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the Venus Marvel still a mile away, the sea about it was lit into green translucence by Aphrodite\u0027s lights. In the eerie luminosity the. dark, sleek shapes of the rescue vessels, which had been sent out to meet them after radio contact had been established, could be plainly made out. They slipped along, silent companions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Lucky and Bigman, it was their first sight of one of Venus\u0027s underwater domed cities. They almost forgot the unpleasantness they had just passed through, in their amazement at the wonderful object before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance it seemed an emerald-green, fairyland bubble, shimmering and quivering because of the water between them. Dimly they could make out buildings and the structural webbing of the beams that held up the city dome against the weight of water overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt grew larger and glowed more brightly as they approached. The green grew lighter as the distance of water between them grew less. Aphrodite became less unreal, less fairylandish, but even more magnificent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally they slid into a huge air lock, capable of holding a small fleet of freighters or a large battle cruiser, and waited while the water was pumped out. And when that was done, the Venus Marvel was floated out of the lock and into the city on a lift field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky and Bigman watched as their luggage was removed, shook hands gravely with Reval and Johnson, and took a skimmer to the Hotel Bellevue-Aphrodite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman looked out of the curved window as their skimmer, its gyro-wings revolving with stately dignity, moved lightly among the city\u0027s beams and over its rooftops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"So this is Venus. Don\u0027t know if it\u0027s worth going through so much for it, though. I\u0027ll never forget that ocean coming up at us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"I\u0027m afraid that was just the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman looked uneasily at his big friend. \"You really think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky shrugged. \"It depends. Let\u0027s see what Evans has to tell us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Green Room of the Hotel Bellevue-Aphrodite was just that. The quality of the lighting and the shimmer of it gave the tables and guests the appearance of being suspended beneath the sea. The ceiling was an inverted bowl, below which there turned slowly a large aquarium globe, supported by cunningly placed lift beams. The water in it was laced with strands of Venusian seaweed and in among it writhed colorful \"sea ribbons,\" one of the most beautiful forms of animal life on the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman had come in first, intent on dinner. He was annoyed at the absence of a punch menu, disturbed by the presence of actual human waiters, and resentful over the fact that he was told that diners in the Green Room ate a meal supplied by the management and only that. He was mollified, slightly, when the appetizer turned out to be tasty and the soup, very good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the music started, the domed ceiling gradually came to glowing life, and the aquarium globe began its gentle spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman\u0027s mouth fell open; his dinner was forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at that,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky was looking. The sea ribbons were of different lengths, varying from tiny threads two inches long to broad and sinuous belts that stretched a yard or more from end to end. They were all thin, thin as a sheet of paper. They moved by wriggling their bodies into a series of waves that rippled down their full length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd each one fluoresced; each one sparkled with colored light. It was a tremendous display. Down the sides of each sea ribbon were little glowing spirals of light: crimson, pink, and orange; a few blues and violets scattered through; and one or two striking whites among the larger specimens. All were overcast with the light-green wash of the external light. As they swam, the lines of color snapped and interlaced. To the dazzled eye they seemed to be leaving rainbow trails that washed and sparkled in the water, fading out only to be renewed in still brighter tints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman turned his attention reluctantly to his dessert. The waiter had called it \"jelly seeds,\" and at first the little fellow had regarded the dish suspiciously. The jelly seeds were soft orange ovals, which clung together just a bit but came up readily enough in the spoon. For a moment they felt dry and tasteless to the tongue, but then, suddenly, they melted into a thick, sirupy liquid that was sheer delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Space!\" said the astonished Bigman. \"Have you tried the dessert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" asked Lucky absently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taste the dessert, will you? It\u0027s like thick pineapple juice, only a million times better... What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"We have company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, go on.\" Bigman made a move to turn in his seat as though to inspect the other diners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said quietly, \"Take it easy,\" and that froze Bigman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman heard the soft steps of someone approaching their table. He tried to twist his eyes. His own blaster was in his room, but he had a force knife in his belt pocket. It looked like a watch fob, but it could slice a man in two, if necessary. He fingered it intensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice behind Bigman said, \"May I join you, folks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman turned in his seat, force knife palmed and ready for a quick, upward thrust. But the man looked anything but sinister. He was fat, but his clothes fit well. His face was round and his graying hair was carefully combed over the top of his head, though his baldness showed anyway. His eyes were little, blue, and full of what seemed like friendliness. Of course, he had a large, grizzled mustache of the true Venusian fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said calmly, \"Sit down, by all means.\" His attention seemed entirely centered on the cup of hot coffee that he held cradled in Ms right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat man sat down. His hands rested upon the table. One wrist was exposed, slightly shaded by the palm of the other. For an instant, an oval spot on it darkened and turned black. Within it little yellow grains of light danced and flickered in the familiar patterns of the Big Dipper and of Orion. Then it disappeared, and there was only an innocent plump wrist and the smiling, round face of the fat man above it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat identifying mark of the Council of Science could be neither forged nor imitated. The method of its controlled appearance by the exertion of will was just about the most closely guarded secret of the Council.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat man said, \"My name is Mel Morriss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"I rather thought you were. You\u0027ve been described to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBigman sat back and returned his force knife to its place. Mel Morriss was head of the Venusian section of the Council. Bigman had heard of him. In a way he was relieved, and in another way he was just a little disappointed. He had expected a fight-perhaps a quick dash of coffee into the fat man\u0027s face, the table overturned, and from then on, anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"Venus seems an unusual and beautiful place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have observed our fluorescent aquarium?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is very spectacular,\" said Lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Venusian councilman smiled and raised a finger. The waiter brought him a hot cup of coffee. Morriss let it cool for a moment, then said softly, \"I believe you are disappointed to see me here. You expected other company, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said coolly, \"I had looked forward to an informal conversation with a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact,\" said Morriss, \"you had sent a message to Councilman Evans to meet you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite. Evans has been under close observation for quite a while. Communications to him are intercepted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir voices were low. Even Bigman had trouble hearing them as they faced one, another, sipping coffee and allowing no trace of expression in their words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky said, \"You are wrong to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak as his friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I suppose that, as your friend, he warned you to stay away from Venus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know about that, too, I see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite. And you had a near-fatal accident in landing on Venus. Am I right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are. You\u0027re implying that Evans feared some such event?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feared it? Great space, Starr, your friend Evans engineered that accident.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-oceans-of-venus-lucky-starr-3/page-3.html","bookId":1756,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:48 AM"}
