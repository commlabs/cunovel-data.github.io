When this was added with the fact that Imperial Concubine Moon wasn’t a true imperial concubine anyway and she also had Lord Snow’s token, she was well within her rights to bring Lin Ming into Full Moon Hall without violating any rules. But now, the Empress had grabbed this point. Since she was cleaning up the harem, she would first start with Imperial Concubine Moon. This was what they meant by condemning someone without a care for the pretext!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith an order from the Empress, the several Holy Lord eunuchs beside her moved forwards to capture Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Ming remained expressionless, as if he hadn’t heard anything at all.

She glared at Naye, coldly saying, “Naye, the reason for everything you’ve done is to bring me here and find an excuse to punish me, so why must you attack a bystander! Naye, I heard that 100,000 years ago when you were at the Divine Sea realm, you were a champion of the Marvel Blue Nation’s martial meeting of outstanding young elites. That is the reason why the eyes of the Marvel Blue Emperor landed on you and the reason he brought you into the palace.

At some time, he had placed a pair of divine iron gloves on his hands. The gloves were fierce and sharp, the 10 fingers ending in daggers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEunuch Sun’s weapons were a pair of iron gloves.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs Eunuch Sun moved, Eunuch Liang also stepped forwards in front of Blood Moon.

Good! Very good! I’ve long suspected that there was some issue with you. After entering the palace you have always kept your appearance covered and isolated from all probing senses. I’ve long wanted to remove a dangerous character like you. I will tear down your veil and see just who you are!
