The star-shaped island was two miles wide, but they only had to delve a quarter of that distance under its bulk. Still, that journey was nerve-wracking enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sonar says we’re here.” Jack pointed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone searched in that direction. Far overhead, a tiny star shone in the darkness. Jack aimed for it, spiraling around one of the columns as he headed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they rose, the star grew larger and brighter, revealing itself at last to be a crack in the foundation platform. A handful of such breaks had been engineered into the project, serving as pressure-relieving points. In turn, the city planners had taken advantage of those construction necessities and turned them into various urban design features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m turning off the IR emitters,” Jack said. “You can take off your goggles. You should have plenty of ambient light to see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pulled his night-vision headgear off. The black-and-white world brightened into shades of aquamarine. The pool of light overhead bathed them in its glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack set the sub to hovering in one spot. He dumped ballast to adjust their buoyancy, and the Ghost floated smoothly upward, rising through the crack in the foundation platform, a six-meter-thick wafer of concrete and steel. Once through, those industrial walls tilted back, sloping into sandy beaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sub slowed its ascent and glided forward until sand once again swirled a few feet under Gray’s boots. Jack studied a small monitor on his control console. Spying over his shoulder, Gray caught a glimpse of the world topside as Jack employed a digital periscope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks clear,” the pilot concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burble of the engines faded to nothing—then a few seconds later, the sub’s nose gently ground into the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s as far as I go,” Jack said, twisting around. “The top hatch is poking a couple of inches out of the water. You should be able to reach the shore without getting more than your boots wet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat proved not to be the case. By the time Gray reached solid ground, he was soaked from the knees down. Seichan fared no better. Tucker disembarked last, assisted by Kowalski. The pair worked together to get Kane out of the sub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had his team assemble beneath a grove of palms planted at the edge of the dark pond. It was hard to believe what lay hidden beneath that placid surface: an industrial hell of pylons, boulders, and ballast. It stood in stark contrast to the world above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski joined them. His gaze swept the landscape surrounding the pond, his face shining with awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently rolling hills spread outward, covered in manicured lawns and dotted by other stands of palm trees. Beyond the parklands, towers and spires rose, forming a palisade of glass and steel. Some of the buildings were dark, girdled by cranes, under various phases of construction. Others thrust brilliantly into the sky, windows aglow, their exteriors flooded by lamps, amply demonstrating signs of life and occupation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloser at hand, the rolling park was broken by patches of close-cropped greens, feathered with numbered flags. Elsewhere, silvery patches marked moonlit sand traps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We beached in a friggin’ golf course,” Kowalski said with a shake of his head. “You gotta hand it to the Arabs for working with what they got.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray returned to the pond, which served the island in multiple ways: as a landscape element, as a water hazard, and as a structural-design feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack remained aboard the Ghost, leaning half out of the hatch. He pointed a thumb toward the middle of the pond. “I’ll be hovering just under the surface, but I’ll keep a watch for you with my scope. If you can’t make it back here, you’ve got my signaling device. Set it off and I’ll find you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.” Gray patted his shirt pocket, indicating he had it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack hesitated before ducking away. His expression turned a touch embarrassed, like he wanted to ask something but held back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Gray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack sighed. “Maybe it’s not my place … but how’s Lisa doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had already spoken with Painter back in Dubai, so he knew the dire situation with Lisa and Kat. Worry for his friends remained a knot in his gut. But that wasn’t what Jack was inquiring about. Gray read the real question in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs she happy with her life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray answered that question as honestly as he could, but in regards to what Jack had asked directly—how’s Lisa doing?—he thought it best to lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s doing great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 2, 5:46 P.M. EST\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharleston, South Carolina\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet somewhere safe … off the street, but stay in public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instructions rang in Lisa’s head. Agony lanced up her leg with every step down East Bay Street. She tried her best to hide her limp, baking under the late-afternoon sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Painter had shouted his warning over the phone to get out of her hotel room, she’d not hesitated. She ran four miles every morning, did yoga most nights, and her brother, who climbed mountains for a living, had taught her a few mad skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanicked, and needing her hands free, she had dropped her cell phone, twisted away from the door, and dashed to the balcony. She heard the splintering crash as the door burst open behind her—but she was already moving through the French doors and vaulting over the wrought iron. She caught one hand on the railing and swung around. With her legs dangling free, she lowered herself hand-over-hand down the second-story balcony ironwork. Once at the bottom, she let go and dropped the rest of the way to the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven wearing sensible shoes, she landed hard enough to jam her left ankle. A glance up showed a masked assailant staring down at her. He raised a pistol, but she dashed forward under the balcony, out of the line of fire. Shouting erupted above—then gun blasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no plan, except to put distance between her and the hotel. She had a choice of fleeing out into the neighboring waterfront park or into the narrow maze of historic homes with their quaint porches, filigree woodwork, and colorful gardens. She chose the latter, not trusting the open spaces of the park. Plus, tourists and locals crowded the streets, shops, and coffeehouses of the area. She instinctively knew to keep to public spaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took her another twenty minutes to calm her heart, to let the adrenaline seep from her brain enough for her to think. Still, she kept peering behind her—not that she knew whose faces to be watching for or how many were searching for her. Anyone could be a threat. With no money, no phone, she didn’t know anyone in the strange city to trust. So she reached out to the one person who could help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe borrowed a phone from a patron seated in a patio coffeehouse and called Painter. She couldn’t say who was more relieved to hear the other’s voice, but Painter stayed stern, authoritative. He ordered her to get off the street, out of direct sight, fearing her attackers might be closing a net around the district and looking for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut stay in public …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant she needed an indoor space: a bar, a restaurant, a hotel lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA commotion drew her attention down a cobbled-brick alleyway off the main thoroughfare. A clutch of women in handsome gowns and men in tuxedos gathered a short distance away, laughing and hugging their hellos. It appeared a wedding reception or engagement party was under way at a restaurant back there, and from the richness of the attire, from the haughty edge to their genteel Carolina accents, the event had the air of old money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hid her limp, touched her hair to assure herself she was presentable for a restaurant of this caliber. She hoped the affair was in a private room and that she could still get a seat in the main dining room or bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small gas lantern flickered above the sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMCCRADY’S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching the restaurant, she excused herself as she slipped through the partygoers—as she hoped, they were all filing upstairs to a private room. She stepped up to the host’s station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me. I’m afraid I don’t have a reservation. But I was hoping I could still get a table.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe host, a slender man with a soft manner, smiled. “That shouldn’t be a problem this early in the evening. If you’ll give me a moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stepped away, but she remained standing. She was afraid if she sat down, she’d never get back up again. Her leg throbbed all the way to her knee. To distract herself, she read a small sign about the restaurant, how the building dated back to 1788. Over the centuries, it had served as a warehouse, a tavern, and even a brothel. It stated that George Washington had once attended a grand dinner party here—hopefully not when it was a brothel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, with such a pedigree, it was no wonder the upper crust of Charleston chose this place for special events. Laughter and music echoed down from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother few stragglers of the party pushed into the lobby. From the amount of lace and piles of coiffed white hair, they were clearly a few of the grandes dames of Charleston high society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’ll follow me,” the host said to Lisa, drawing her attention away, “your table is ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the older women glanced in her direction, eyeing her from the lofty height of her class position—then leaned to another and whispered. Other eyes stared toward her, judging her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly self-conscious, Lisa smoothed a hand down her St. John dress and stepped away from them, joining the host.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned conspiratorially toward her. “It’s cotillion season. They’re having a small debutante ball upstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa glanced up, picturing a party of chiffon and diamonds, the official debut of a young woman to her high-society peers. Balls like this functioned in the past as an antiquated dating service, to present an eligible daughter to available bachelors within a select upper circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, a high-society livestock show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a very exclusive affair,” the host said as he led her to the table. He raised one eyebrow toward her. “Some grandniece or second cousin of the president.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa felt better. Surely, no one would dare intrude here. Crossing into the main dining room, she did her best not to hobble. Still, something must have shone in her face, maybe the sheen of her skin, something in her eye. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-37.html","bookId":1527,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM"}
