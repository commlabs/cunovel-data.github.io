They wanted to get inside, and I wondered how long it would be until they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The noise is probably drawing them here,” I said, running my fingers through my hair. Aubrey was always making snide comments about my shaggy hair and how bad I needed a haircut. I wondered if the world would ever calm down long enough for me to miss her bitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t really have a choice. They’ll have that glass broke before long.” Skeeter walked over to two frail-looking women sitting next to each other on a wooden pew. “You ladies still doin’ okay?” Skeeter said, putting a hand on the one woman’s shoulder. She reached up and patted his hand, but did not stop her quiet prayer. Their mouths were moving, but I couldn’t hear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think you could send one up for Jill?” Skeeter asked, his voice threatening to break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne woman continued to pray as if she didn’t hear, the other looked up. “Is she okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s hurt. She’s in the kitchen . . . all right for now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus will take care of her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. Jesus wasn’t taking care of much of anything at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter started to return to the kitchen, but I motioned for him to join me in the corner of the room, away from listening ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what you’re going to say,” he said. His eyebrows pulled together. “But don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, and then watched Skeeter return to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my chin to peek from a slit in the boards Gary had left for Skeeter. The sun was a little lower in the sky. Before too long, it would be dark. That thought scared me. We would need to sleep some time, but they wouldn’t. Those things would be walking around, just on the other side of these walls, waiting to pull our flesh from our bones with their teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter grabbed my shoulder; the sudden movement made me jump two inches off my chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa! It’s just me, Nate. Calm down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI settled back into my seat, trying to play off my fear. Watching a movie about zombies is one thing. Watching zombies outside your window was another. The movies didn’t talk about that. Well . . . maybe they did, but they didn’t drive home how terrifying each moment truly was. I tried not to think about tomorrow, or that we would still be fighting for our lives every day from now on. I glanced back at Zoe, and choked back the sadness welling up in my throat. I didn’t want her to grow up in a world like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA combination of fear, anger, and utter depression fully engulfed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter squeezed my shoulder. I sat still, letting his fingers sink into my tense muscle. “It’s going to be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it?” I asked, looking back out the window. “Is Jill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter sighed. “I don’t know. I’m hoping the movies got it all wrong, and a bite is just a bite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if it’s not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I don’t really wanna think about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, catching a glimpse of an elderly man shuffling by the window. His neck was half eaten away, and his dress shirt was saturated in blood. “We can’t stay here. We’re going to have to keep moving. Get into the country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn, brother, I thought I was in the country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean away from any town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter took a moment to respond. “I know, but I can’t move Jill. And we can’t risk putting her in a car with Zoe until we know if she’s going to get better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes tight, trying to squint away the visual. Another one of those things ambled by. She was wearing a nametag and a long skirt. I couldn’t read the nametag even if it was closer. It was covered in blood and what might be torn muscle lying over the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus Christ, that’s Birdie,” Skeeter said, disgusted. “She works at the bank.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dog was barking at her, keeping just enough distance that it wasn’t grabbed and eaten. Looking out at what could be seen through the boards, I watched whoever lumbered by, studying them, trying to notice whatever I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were slow. Not as slow as I thought they might be, but they were slow enough that if we had to head out on foot, as long as we didn’t let one get too close, or get surrounded, we could make it. Some of them that had more extensive injuries moved slower than others. One guy’s foot was completely gone, but he continued walking on a bloody stub. They weren’t distracted by pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder if you can really only kill them by obliterating the brain,” I thought aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter raised his hunting rifle, situated it between the boards, and aimed. “I don’t know. Let’s find out.” He picked out a target, and then breathed. “Sorry, Mr. Madison.” Skeeter squeezed the trigger, and the fabric of Mr. Madison’s shirt, in the spot where his heart would be, popped and sprayed open. Dark blood oozed from the wound, but Mr. Madison didn’t seem to notice. “Okay. So that doesn’t work.” Skeeter squeezed the trigger again. This time a red dot immediately formed in the middle of Mr. Madison’s temple and simultaneously seemed to burst, leaving a perfectly imperfect round wound. The man stopped midstep as his head jerked to the side, and then he fell onto his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for a moment, watching for any signs of movement. Nothing. “You think we have to burn them, too?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter frowned, his eyes darted over at me from over the sights of his rifle. “Now that’s just silly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Skeeter, honey, I think Jill’s not feeling well,” Doris said. She was wringing her hands, clearly unnerved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter hopped up and rushed into the kitchen. I followed behind, seeing Zoe sitting in the corner, watching her aunt Jill as she sat in her chair, crumpled over and heaving into a bucket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zoe? Zoe, come here. Come sit in here for a bit.” I motioned for Zoe to join me in the sanctuary. Zoe slid off her chair and walked toward me, and when she gripped my fingers, the strength in her tiny hand surprised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat together on a pew beside Gary, hoping the hammering would drown out some of the noise coming from the kitchen. Between the moaning noises Jill made while she vomited, she whimpered and cried for Skeeter to help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s sweating, Daddy,” Zoe said, “a whole lot.” Her eyes were heavy with worry. “Then her face went all wonky and she threw up on the floor. She said her whole body hurt like she had the flu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “Did that scare you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It all scares me,” she said. The skin around her eyes tightened, and I could see she was trying not to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one knew what would happen to Jill, but I had an idea of what might be happening, and I didn’t want Zoe to witness it. Short of Skeeter moving Jill somewhere else, the only way to keep Zoe from witnessing her aunt’s death was to take her away from the church. That meant taking her outside where it wasn’t safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so sorry, honey. I wish I could make this all go away.” I hugged Zoe to my chest, trying to buy some time before a solution came to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill was sobbing now. She probably knew what was happening, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cupped Zoe’s little cherubic face in my hands, scanning the splash of freckles across her nose and light-brown hair. She’d kept the same simple shoulder-length hair cut since she was four. Her natural waves made it bouncy, but it seemed like her worry had weighed that down, too. “I’m going to try to help Uncle Skeeter. I want you to stay in here, okay? You’re safe in here. I won’t be gone long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoe nodded quickly, glancing back to Gary and Eric as they pounded the last nails into the last board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good girl,” I said, kissing her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter was on one knee, both arms wrapped around his wife. She leaned against his chest, her face blotchy and glistening with sweat. Skeeter stared at the floor, whispering something to her, with the same hopelessness in his eyes as the woman we passed on the bridge. His young and healthy wife was dying in his arms, and they both knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoris filled a glass with water, and leaned down to hold it to Jill’s lips. She took a few sips and then spit it out, leaning down to the bucket, emptying her stomach once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need the doctor,” Doris said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The doctor’s dead,” Gary said, dropping the hammer on the table next to Jill. “So is his wife, and kids. They’re all walking around out there with milky eyes and bite marks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill sniffed once, and looked up at her husband. “Skeeter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said, shaking his head, still staring at the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Skeeter, what if I hurt the people in here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if I hurt you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if I kill Zoe?” she pleaded, tears streaming down her reddened cheeks. Her breath skipped, and she pulled Skeeter’s face down so his eyes met hers. “Don’t let me hurt that baby, Skeeter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter’s bottom lip quivered. “But what about our baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up straight, away from the doorjamb I was leaning on. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that?” Doris said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jill’s pregnant,” Skeeter said, his voice desperate. “Seven weeks. Dr. Brown just called her this morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned down and grabbed my knees. I couldn’t imagine the agony he was feeling. They didn’t deserve this. They’d been trying to conceive since their wedding night, and now Skeeter would lose them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill touched her forehead to Skeeter’s chin, and then looked up at him with a weak smile. “We’ll be together, and we’ll wait for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeeter broke down, burying his face into Jill’s neck. “I can’t do it, Jillybean,” he sobbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first window in the sanctuary crashed, and everyone but Skeeter froze. Sounds of searching hands on the wooden boards made my skin crawl. I leaned back to see Zoe, Barb, and Ms. Kay turned around in their seats, staring at the broken glass on the floor. The boards were holding, but I could still feel my heart pounding against my rib cage. Eric stood next to the broken glass, inspecting the board, and then he nodded, assuring us that they would hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait. What are we talking about here?” Reverend Mathis said, bringing my attention back to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoris was still wringing her hands. “I can’t say I . . . we shouldn’t be talking about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay,” Jill said, cupping her hand over Skeeter’s head until she had to bend over again and vomit into the bucket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother window broke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked to Gary. “What is that hallway there?” I said, gesturing to the open doorway on the other side of the kitchen. There were two his and hers bathrooms, and then an open doorway leading down a dark hall. “We may need another exit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just to the stairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy attention was piqued. “What stairs? You boarded up windows but didn’t secure the upper level?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary shrugged. “I don’t think they can climb.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re in the house of the Lord!” Doris said. “I’m not going to let this happen! We don’t know what this is. Skeeter, Jill could get better!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob spoke for the first time. His voice was deep and raspy. “We know exactly what this is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone turned in the direction of Bob’s voice. He was sitting on a metal folding chair in the corner, where he’d been for the last hour. He’d perched his cane between his legs, resting his hands on the handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gray mustache twitched when he spoke. “This is nothing less than a goddamn tragedy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bob!” Doris said, pretending to be offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truth is, she’s just going to end up like one of those things outside, only she’ll be in here with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlass crashed to the floor again, and this time a bone-chilling moan floated from the sanctuary into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob’s eyes drifted to me, and then settled beside me about waist high. That was when I noticed Zoe standing just behind me. She stared at her aunt Jill, her beautiful hazel-green eyes filling with tears for the umpteenth time that day. I wondered if she would ever know happiness after today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kneeled beside my daughter, trying to think of something cathartic to say, but words wouldn’t save Jill, and Jill being okay was the only thing that was going to make this hell somewhat tolerable for Zoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heavy thud sounded above us, and we all looked to the ceiling. Skeeter kissed Jill’s forehead, and then motioned for Doris to sit next to her as he grabbed his shotgun. Gary picked up his hammer. I gently pushed Zoe toward Reverend Mathis, and then followed my brother-in-law, Gary, and Eric through the doorway, and down the hall. Skeeter stopped at the bottom of the stairs, pointing his shotgun to the closed door at the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary flipped on the light. “Maybe someone crawled onto the roof to get away from them and made their way inside?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe heard slow, clumsy footsteps, and then something was knocked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric took in a sharp breath. “They can’t climb, can they? I’ve never heard of a zombie climbing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? They used to be human. Humans can climb,” Gary said, resituating the toothpick in his mouth and tightening his grip on the hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nervously ran my fingers through my hair. “We don’t really know anything about them. Assuming is going to get us all killed. I say we get some boards, take them upstairs, try to communicate with whoever is in there, and if they don’t answer, we board up the door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simple enough,” Skeeter said. His voice was low and smooth, and reminded me of the few times he’d invited me along on a deer hunt. That was his in the woods voice, like the guys in those hunting shows always used while they were narrating their victorious kill. He didn’t pull his eyes away from the door, as if he were hunting whatever was on the other side. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/red-hill/page-10.html","bookId":2563,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 1:00:38 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 1:00:38 AM"}
