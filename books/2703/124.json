I thought everyone got chicken pox before they reached middle school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, well...I didn’t go to middle school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neither did I,” Quinn added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe glanced at each other again, and so much passed between us in that one stare: longing, guilt, excitement, dread, joy, suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, Lowe did, so why the hell hadn’t he ever contracted it before? Working all these extra hours for him sucks ass, because I wanted to take Ham out and get him some pussy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn wrenched in his seat. “You what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen shook his head sadly and made a tsking sound. “Damn, is lack of sex making you lose your hearing, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMouth opening slightly as if he wanted to talk, Quinn darted a quick glance to me before he closed his lips and refused to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said...” Ten leaned across Caroline’s desk to talk more loudly toward his roommate. “First night we’re both off...we’re going out...and you’re getting laid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He can’t,” Caroline spoke up suddenly. “Quinn’s helping me with my...homework that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZipping his attention to her, Ten scowled. “Since when do you and Ham do homework together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline narrowed her eyes and scowled right back. “Since...since...” It was so obvious she was lying, Ten rolled his eyes. But she growled and finished with, “Since now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pft.” Ten waved her off. “Homework can wait. His poor, neglected dick cannot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn cleared his throat and shifted lower in his seat. He ducked his face, clearly not a willing participant in the conversation. “I really don’t want to go out any time soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because some cheating whore”—pausing to hold up a hand in my direction, he added, “tons of offense to your friend,” and then he returned his gaze to Quinn—“ripped your self-confidence off by the balls. But don’t you worry, buddy ol’ pal. We’re going to get them back. I don’t care if we have to strap on a fuzzy, leopard-printed pair. I can’t handle watching you go around without your nuts. Ergo, we’re going to find you the easiest, nastiest, hottest whore, and you’re going to get right back on that horse and fuck the shit out of her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like, oh my God,” Caroline squealed in the perfect Valley-girl imitation. “An easy, nasty whore? Can you find me one too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen leered her way. “Only if I watch while you make out with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline fluttered her lashes before lowering her voice. “Oh, you wouldn’t be invited.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled. “That’s not even right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharing a triumphant smile with me, Caroline beamed as if she’d accomplished her main goal of the day: getting under Ten’s skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway,” Ten went on, shaking his head as if he had to clear it. He slapped the top of Caroline’s desk to get Quinn’s attention. “Pack your pockets with rubbers, ’cause it’s going to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA painful sizzling heat spread through my abdomen just thinking about Quinn with anyone else, letting her watch him roll a thin layer of latex over his glorious length. The recipient of that view didn’t even exist yet, and I already wanted to scratch her eyes out. I wanted to pull the hair of every girl to ever look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I was more than relieved when he growled, “No. It’s not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what’d be really awesome,” Ten went on, completely ignoring Quinn’s refusal. “If you found one of Whora’s really close friends to fuck. That would be the ultimate revenge. Stick it to the ex while you’re sticking it to her bestie. Oh, yeah. What about that redhead? What’s her name… Tamsen or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI darted my gaze away so I couldn’t see Quinn’s expression. I didn’t think my heart, which was plunging into my stomach, could take the devastation if I saw any kind of guilt in his eyes…for already sticking it to one of Cora’s friends. I sat stiff and frozen in my chair, not daring to move a single muscle. Then I wondered what Ten would say if he knew Quinn had already followed his suggestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. I might be sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to me, Caroline huffed out a breath. “Will you stop already? You are so disgusting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Ten lifted his hands into the air. “Excuse me for trying to help out a buddy who just had his pride stomped on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would think he might be a little more concerned about the blow to his heart right now.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-124.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
