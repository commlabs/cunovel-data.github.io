These are the ones we thought we\u0027d wiped out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That old story,\" the soft-featured captive said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacurutu is more than a story,\" Muriz said. Once more he gestured to his son. \"I have presented Assan Tariq. I am arifa in this place, your only judge. My son, too, will be trained to detect demons. The old ways are best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why we came into the deep desert,\" the soft-featured man protested. \"We chose the old way, wandering in -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With paid guides,\" Muriz said, gesturing to the darker captives. \"You would buy your way into heaven?\" Muriz glanced up at his son. \"Assan, are you prepared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have reflected long upon that night when men came and murdered our people,\" Assan said. His voice projected an uneasy straining. \"They owe us water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father gives you six of them,\" Muriz said. \"Their water is ours. Their shades are yours, your guardians forevermore. Their shades will warn you of demons. They will be your slaves when you cross over into the alam al-mythal. What do you say, my son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thank my father,\" Assan said. He took a short step forward. \"I accept manhood among the Cast Out. This water is our water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he finished speaking, the youth crossed to the captives. Starting on the left, he gripped the man\u0027s hair and drove the crysknife up under the chin into the brain. It was skillfully done to spill the minimum blood. Only the one soft-featured city Fremen protested, squalling as the youth grabbed his hair. The others spat at Assan Tariq in the old way, saying by this: \"See how little I value my water when it is taken by animals!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was done, Muriz clapped his hands once. Attendants came and began removing the bodies, taking them to the deathstill where they could be rendered for their water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuriz arose, looked at his son who stood breathing deeply, watching the attendants remove the bodies. \"Now you are a man,\" Muriz said. \"The water of our enemies will feed slaves. And, my son...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssan Tariq turned an alert and pouncing look upon his father. The youth\u0027s lips were drawn back in a tight smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Preacher must not know of this,\" Muriz said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand, father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did it well,\" Muriz said. \"Those who stumble upon Shuloch must not survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you say, father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are trusted with important duties,\" Muriz said. \"I am proud of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sophisticated human can become primitive. What this really means is that the human\u0027s way of life changes. Old values change, become linked to the landscape with its plants and animals. This new existence requires a working knowledge of those multiplex and cross-linked events usually referred to as nature. It requires a measure of respect for the inertial power within such natural systems. When a human gains this working knowledge and respect, that is called \"being primitive.\" The converse, of course, is equally true: the primitive can become sophisticated, but not without accepting dreadful psychological damage. -The Leto Commentary, After Harq al-Ada\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can we be sure?\" Ghanima asked. \"This is very dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve tested it before,\" Leto argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may not be the same this time. What if -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way open to us,\" Leto said. \"You agree we can\u0027t go the way of the spice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima sighed. She did not like this thrust and parry of words, but knew the necessity which pressed her brother. She also knew the fearful source of her own reluctance. They had but to look at Alia and know the perils of that inner world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Leto asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain she sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat cross-legged in one of their private places, a narrow opening from the cave to the cliff where often their mother and father had watched the sun set over the bled. It was two hours past the evening meal, a time when the twins were expected to exercise their bodies and their minds. They had chosen to flex their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will try it alone if you refuse to help,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima looked away from him toward the black hangings of the moisture seals which guarded this opening in the rock. Leto continued to stare out over the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been speaking for some time in a language so ancient that even its name remained unknown in these times. The language gave their thoughts a privacy which no other human could penetrate. Even Alia, who avoided the intricacies of her inner world, lacked the mental linkages which would allow her to grasp any more than an occasional word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto inhaled deeply, taking in the distinctive furry odor of a Fremen cavern-sietch which persisted in this windless alcove. The murmurous hubbub of the sietch and its damp heat were absent here, and both felt this as a relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree we need guidance,\" Ghanima said. \"But if we -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ghani! We need more than guidance. We need protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps there is no protection.\" She looked directly at her brother, met that gaze in his eyes like the waiting watchfulness of a predator. His eyes belied the placidity of his features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must escape possession,\" Leto said. He used the special infinitive of the ancient language, a form strictly neutral in voice and tense but profoundly active in its implications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima correctly interpreted his argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mohw\u0027pwium d\u0027mi hish pash moh\u0027m ka,\" she intoned. The capture of my soul is the capture of a thousand souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much more than that,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing the dangers, you persist.\" She made it a statement, not a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wabun \u0027k wabunat!\" he said. Rising, thou risest!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt his choice as an obvious necessity. Doing this thing, it were best done actively. They must wind the past into the present and allow it to unreel into their future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muriyat,\" she conceded, her voice low. It must be done lovingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" He waved a hand to encompass total acceptance. \"Then we will consult as our parents did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima remained silent, tried to swallow past a lump in her throat. Instinctively she glanced south toward the great open erg which was showing a dim grey pattern of dunes in the last of the day\u0027s light. In that direction her father had gone on his last walk into the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto stared downward over the cliff edge at the green of the sietch oasis. All was dusk down there, but he knew its shapes and colors: blossoms of copper, gold, red, yellow, rust, and russet spread right out to the rock markers which outlined the extent of the qanat-watered plantings. Beyond the rock markers stretched a stinking band of dead Arrakeen life, killed by foreign plants and too much water, now forming a barrier against the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently Ghanima said: \"I am ready. Let us begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, damn all!\" He reached out, touched her arm to soften the exclamation, said, \"Please, Ghani... Sing that song. It makes this easier for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima hitched herself closer to him, circled his waist with her left arm. She drew in two deep breaths, cleared her throat, and began singing in a clear piping voice the words her mother had so often sung for their father:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here I redeem the pledge thou gavest;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pour sweet water upon thee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife shall prevail in this windless place:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy love, thou shalt live in a palace,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThy enemies shall fall to emptiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe travel this path together\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich love has traced for thee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely well do I show the way\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor my love is thy palace...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice fell into the desert silence which even a whisper might despoil, and Leto felt himself sinking, sinking - becoming the father whose memories spread like an overlayer in the genes of his immediate past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this brief space, I must be Paul, he told himself. This is not Ghani beside me; it is my beloved Chani, whose wise counsel has saved us both many a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor her part, Ghanima had slipped into the persona-memory of her mother with frightening ease, as she had known she would. How much easier this was for the female - and how much more dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a voice turned suddenly husky, Ghanima said: \"Look there, beloved!\" First Moon had risen and, against its cold light, they saw an arc of orange fire falling upward into space. The transport which had brought the Lady Jessica, laden now with spice, was returning to its mother-cluster in orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe keenest of remembrances ran through Leto then, bringing memories like bright bell-sounds. For a flickering instant he was another Leto - Jessica\u0027s Duke. Necessity pushed those memories aside, but not before he felt the piercing of the love and the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must be Paul, he reminded himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe transformation came over him with a frightening duality, as though Leto were a dark screen against which his father was projected. He felt both his own flesh and his father\u0027s, and the flickering differences threatened to overcome him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me, father,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flickering disturbance passed and now there was another imprint upon his awareness, while his own identity as Leto stood at one side as an observer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My last vision has not yet come to pass,\" he said, and the voice was Paul\u0027s. He turned to Ghanima. \"You know what I saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched his cheek with her right hand. \"Did you walk into the desert to die, beloved? Is that what you did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It may be that I did, but that vision... Would that not be reason enough to stay alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But blind?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where could you go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep, shuddering breath. \"Jacurutu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beloved!\" Tears began flowing down her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muad\u0027Dib, the hero, must be destroyed utterly,\" he said. \"Otherwise this child cannot bring us back from chaos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Golden Path,\" she said. \"It is not a good vision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only possible vision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alia has failed, then...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Utterly. You see the record of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother has returned too late.\" She nodded, and it was Chani\u0027s wise expression on the childish face of Ghanima. \"Could there not be another vision? Perhaps if -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, beloved. Not yet. This child cannot peer into the future yet and return safely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain a shuddering breath disturbed his body, and Leto-observer felt the deep longing of his father to live once more in vital flesh, to make living decisions and... How desperate the need to unmake past mistakes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father!\" Leto called, and it was as though he shouted echoingly within his own skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a profound act of will which Leto felt then: the slow, clinging withdrawal of his father\u0027s internal presence, the release of senses and muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beloved,\" Chani\u0027s voice whispered beside him, and the withdrawal slowed. \"What is happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go yet,\" Leto said, and it was his own voice, rasping and uncertain, still his own. Then: \"Chani, you must tell us: How do we avoid... what has happened to Alia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Paul-within who answered him, though, with words which fell upon his inner ear, halting and with long pauses: \"There is no certainty. You... saw... what almost... happened... with... me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Alia...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The damned Baron has her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto felt his throat burning with dryness. \"Is he... have I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in you... but... I... we cannot... sometime we sense... each other, but you...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you not read my thoughts?\" Leto asked. \"Would you know then if... he...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I can feel your thoughts... but I... we live only through... the... reflection of... your awareness. Your memory creates us. The danger... it is a precise memory. And... those of us... those of us who loved power... and gathered it at... any price... those can be... more precise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stronger?\" Leto whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stronger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know your vision,\" Leto said. \"Rather than let him have me, I\u0027ll become you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto nodded to himself, sensing the enormous will-force his father had required to withdraw, recognizing the consequences of failure. Any possession reduced the possessed to Abomination. The recognition gave him a renewed sense of strength, and he felt his own body with abnormal acuteness and a deeply drawn awareness of past mistakes: his own and those of his ancestors. It was the uncertainties which weakened - he saw this now. For an instant, temptation warred with fear within him. This flesh possessed the ability to transform melange into a vision of the future. With the spice, he could breathe the future, shatter Time\u0027s veils. He found the temptation difficult to shed, clasped his hands and sank into the prana-bindu awareness. His flesh negated the temptation. His flesh wore the deep knowledge learned in blood by Paul. Those who sought the future hoped to gain the winning gamble on tomorrow\u0027s race. Instead they found themselves trapped into a lifetime whose every heartbeat and anguished wail was known. Paul\u0027s final vision had shown the precarious way out of that trap, and Leto knew now that he had no other choice but to follow that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The joy of living, its beauty is all bound up in the fact that life can surprise you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft voice whispered in his ear: \"I\u0027ve always known that beauty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto turned his head, stared into Ghanima\u0027s eyes which glistened in the bright moonlight. He saw Chani looking back at him. \"Mother,\" he said, \"you must withdraw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhh, the temptation!\" she said, and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed her away. \"Would you take your daughter\u0027s life?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s so easy... so foolishly easy,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto, feeling panic begin to grip him, remembered what an effort of will his father\u0027s persona-within had required to abandon the flesh. Was Ghanima lost in that observer-world where he had watched and listened, learning what he had required from his father?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will despise you, mother,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Others won\u0027t despise me,\" she said. \"Be my beloved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I do... you know what you both will become,\" he said. \"My father will despise you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound was jerked out of his throat without his volition and it carried all the old overtones of Voice which Paul had learned from his witch mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say it,\" she moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will despise you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please... please don\u0027t say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto rubbed his throat, feeling the muscles become once more his own. \"He will despise you. He will turn his back on you. He will go into the desert again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No... no...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head from side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must leave, mother,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No... no...\" But the voice lacked its original force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto watched his sister\u0027s face. How the muscles twitched! Emotions fled across the flesh at the turmoil within her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave,\" he whispered \"Leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No-o-o-o...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped her arm, felt the tremors which pulsed through her muscles, the nerves twitching. She writhed, tried to pull away, but he held tightly to her arm, whispering: \"Leave... leave...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all the time, Leto berated himself for talking Ghani into this parent game which once they\u0027d played often, but she had lately resisted. It was true that the female had more weakness in that inner assault, he realized. There lay the origin of the Bene Gesserit fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours passed and still Ghanima\u0027s body trembled and twitched with the inner battle, but now his sister\u0027s voice joined the argument. He heard her talking to that image within, the pleading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother... please -\" And once: \"You\u0027ve seen Alia! Will you become another Alia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last Ghanima leaned against him, whispered: \"She has accepted it. She\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked her head. \"Ghani, I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ll never ask you to do that again. I was selfish. Forgive me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to forgive,\" she said, and her voice came panting as though after great physical exertion. \"We\u0027ve learned much that we needed to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She spoke to you of many things,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll share it later when -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! We\u0027ll do it now. You were right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Golden Path?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your damned Golden Path!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Logic\u0027s useless unless it\u0027s armed with essential data,\" he said. \"But I -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandmother came back to guide our education and to see if we\u0027d been... contaminated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Duncan says.
