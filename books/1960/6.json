The question is, what the hell are we going to do about it now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don’t worry. It isn’t necessary for you to marry me. I don’t know what ever made Dad suggest that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed so damn smug about it, and that riled him all the more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently your father feels differently. He seems to think my marrying you would salvage your honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. Her hair was tied at her nape, giving Riley a clear view of the delicate lines of her face. As pale as she was, she resembled a porcelain doll, fragile and easily breakable. She looked dangerously close to that point right then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father is an old-fashioned man with traditional values. Marriage is what he would expect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you expect?\" His tone was less harsh, his concern for her outweighing his irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah placed her hand on her smooth stomach as though she longed to protect the child. Riley’s gaze dropped there, and he waited a moment, trying to analyze his own feelings. A child grew there. His child. Try as he might, he felt nothing except regret mingled with a healthy dose of concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I… I’m not sure what I want from you,\" Hannah answered. \"As I tried to tell you before, I feel terrible about dragging you into this mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It takes two. You didn’t create that child on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was shy. \"Yes, I know. It’s just that I never meant to involve you… afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn’t set any better with Riley than the implied threat from his commanding officer. \"So you intended to run off and have my child without telling me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I… didn’t have a clue as to how to find you,\" she argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father didn’t seem to have much of a problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away as though she wanted to avoid an argument. \"I didn’t know if you wanted me to contact you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sure the hell had a low opinion of him. It rankled Riley that Miss High-and-Mighty would make those kinds of assumptions about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time don’t assume anything,\" he barked. \"Ask!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize – \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s another thing. Quit apologizing.\" He held both hands to his head, hoping the applied pressure to his scalp would help him think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you always this difficult to talk to?\" she asked. He was pleased to hear a little mettle in her voice. It told him he hadn’t been wrong about her. This woman had plenty of spirit. It also assured him her health wasn’t as bad as he suspected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am when I’ve been backed into a corner,\" Riley stormed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood and reached for her coat. \"Then let me assure you I’m not the one forcing you into a marriage you obviously don’t want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’re right. It isn’t you. It’s the United States Navy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Navy? I… don’t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t expect you to,\" Riley barked. \"It’s either do right by you or kiss a promotion I’ve been working toward for the last several years goodbye.\" Lieutenant Commander Kyle had implied as much in a few short words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, dear. I had no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously not.\" He rammed all ten fingers through his hair, then dropped his hands to his sides. \"My career could be on the line with this one, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was an exaggeration, but in some ways Riley felt it could be true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah grimaced at the derogatory way in which he’d used the term of affection. \"But surely if I spoke to them… if I were to explain…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley laughed shortly. \"Not a chance. Your father made sure of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn’t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way I see it,\" he said with thick agitation, \"I don’t have a hell of a lot of choice but to go ahead and marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah’s head snapped up at that. \"You…can’t seriously be considering going through with a wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ve never been more serious in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a matter of hours, Hannah was scheduled to become Mrs. Riley Murdock. She sat on the end of her bed, wrestling imaginary crocodiles of doubt and indecision. They might as well be real, she mused, clenching and unclenching her hands. She felt as though there were powerful jaws snapping at her, jagged teeth tearing at her confidence and determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Jerry she loved, not Riley. Nothing would ever make the hard-edged sailor into another seminary student. Hannah wasn’t foolish enough to believe the Torpedoman Chief was likely to change. One look at his cold, dark features the afternoon of the meeting at Bangor reminded her what a rugged life he led. There was nothing soft in this man. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day of the meeting, he’d been both angry and restless, stalking the room, thundering at her every time she attempted to apologize. In some ways she was convinced he hated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it was his child growing Within her womb. Hannah flattened her hand across her abdomen and briefly closed her eyes. Despite the complications this pregnancy had brought into her life, Hannah loved and wanted this baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah knew that Riley wasn’t marrying because of the pregnancy. By his own admission, he was doing so for political reasons. Both her father and Chaplain Stewart had seemed relieved when Riley had announced they had agreed to go through with the wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah had agreed to no such thing. She’d been trapped into it, the same way Riley had. She wasn’t sure even now, sitting in her room, dressed for her wedding ceremony, that she was making the right decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were so different. She didn’t love him. He didn’t love her. They’d barely spoken to each other – and it was because they had nothing in common except the child she carried. How a marriage such as theirs could ever survive more than a few weeks, Hannah didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah,\" her father called after politely knocking on her bedroom door, \"it’s time we left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m ready,\" she said, standing. She reached for the two suitcases and dragged them across the top of her bed. This was all she would bring into their marriage. The pot-and-pan set, the dishes, silverware and other household items she’d collected over the years were gone. She’d donated them to the Mission House the evening she’d met Riley. The irony hadn’t been lost on her. Nor had she forgotten how Reverend Parker had announced that God works in mysterious ways. Her entire life felt like an unsolved mystery, and she’d long since given up on deciphering the meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the bedroom door and found her father standing on the other side, waiting for her. He smiled softly and nodded his approval. \"You look beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed and thanked him. She didn’t feel beautiful in her plain, floor-length antique-white dress, but having her father smile and tell her so lent her some badly needed confidence. The fact he seemed so sure that marrying Riley was the right thing helped a great deal. She’d always trusted her father and had never doubted his wisdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge Raymond took the suitcases from her hands and led the way down the stairs. As he loaded the luggage into the back of the station wagon, Hannah stood on the porch and glanced around her one last time. Bright orange, gold and brown leaves blanketed the sloping lawn, and the skeletal limbs of the two chestnut trees that ruled the front yard rose toward the deep blue sky. She would miss all this, Hannah realized, wondering how long it would be before she returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ride to Bangor took almost two hours. Her father did most of the talking. He seemed to sense how nervous Hannah was and sought to reassure her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChaplain Stewart, Riley, and a man and woman Hannah didn’t recognize were waiting for them in the vestibule of the base chapel. The chaplain and her father broke into immediate conversation. From the other side of the room, Riley’s eyes found hers. His facial expression didn’t alter, and he nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked tall and distinguished in his white dress uniform, and although it was little comfort, Hannah realized, that she was marrying a handsome man. In the days since their last meeting, she’d had repeated nightmares about him. In her dream he came at her like a huge monster, eager to devour her. Seeing him now produced a shiver of apprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you’ll excuse us,\" Hannah said, her voice barely audible, \"I’d like a few minutes alone with Riley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation came to an abrupt halt as Chaplain Stewart cast an accusing glare in Riley’s direction. If the other man’s censure disturbed him, he gave no indication. Silently he led the way to the opposite end of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’ve changed your mind?\" His tight features told her nothing of his thoughts. Perhaps that was what he was hoping she’d do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corner of his mouth lifted slightly. \"I asked first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m… willing to go through with the wedding, if you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m here, aren’t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t look any too pleased about it, and she decided against saying so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to talk to me?\" he demanded gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I thought we should reach an understanding regarding…the sleeping arrangements before we…you know… before we…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don’t know,\" he returned impatiently. His gaze narrowed sufficiently. \"Listen, if you’re saying what I think you’re saying, then the deal’s off. If I’m going through the hassle of marrying you, then I want a wife, not a sister. Do I make myself understood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah lowered her gaze, clenching her hands tightly together in front of her. \"Do I have to be your… wife right away?\" Her voice was soft and low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for so long that she wasn’t sure he’d heard her. \"I don’t suppose it would hurt any if we took some time to get to know one another better first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s what I thought.\" She raised her head and looked up at him, relieved that he was willing to give her the time she needed to adjust to their marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked at the sharpness of the question. \"Ah… I’m not sure. A few weeks at any rate. Possibly a couple of months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple of months!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah was convinced the entire chapel heard him roar and would immediately guess the gist of their conversation. Her face filled with boiling color. \"Couldn’t we just… well, let it happen naturally?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face had tightened into a brooding frown. He wasn’t pleased and didn’t bother to pretend otherwise. \"I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, we’ll be sleeping in separate bedrooms until such time that we’re both comfortable with that aspect of… our marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he returned caustically before turning away from her. \"Separate bedrooms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeparate bedrooms! The words repeated themselves in Riley’s mind throughout the brief wedding ceremony Hannah’s father officiated. The fact that he didn’t give Riley the chance to kiss the bride wasn’t lost on him. What he hadn’t figured out was why the old man had demanded Riley marry his daughter in the first place. His father-in-law was as straitlaced as they come. It remained a mystery why George Raymond had insisted Riley marry Hannah. Hell, if it came down to it, Riley wasn’t entirely sure what had prompted him to go through with the wedding himself. What his CO claimed had carried some weight, that was true enough, but Riley knew himself well. No one could have forced him into marrying Hannah if he’d been completely opposed to the idea. Which obviously meant, he reasoned, he wanted her as his wife. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-baby-navy-5/page-6.html","bookId":1960,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:55 AM"}
