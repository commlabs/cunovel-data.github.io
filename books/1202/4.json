A DISCUSSION ABOUT RED CATS AND WHITE SNOW.","content":"In a fit of terror the constable dropped the lantern, and the cat, unseen by the occupants of the kitchen, scuttled away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you don\u0027t light the candle,\" gasped Mrs. Middlemore, \"I shall go off.\" And she forthwith proceeded to demonstrate by screaming, \"Oh, oh, oh!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s done it, Wigg,\" said Constable Nightingale. \"Strike a light, there\u0027s a good fellow, and pick up the lantern. I can\u0027t do it myself; I\u0027ve got my arms full.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Constable Wigg had now recovered his courage, and inspired by jealousy, quickly struck a match and lit the candle. Mrs. Middlemore lay comfortably in the arms of Constable Nightingale, who did not seem anxious to rid himself of his burden. Stirred to emulative sympathy, Constable Wigg took possession of one of Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s hands, and pressed and patted it with a soothing, \"There, there, there! What has made you come over like this? There\u0027s nothing to be frightened of, is there, Nightingale?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing at all,\" replied Constable Nightingale, irascibly, for he by no means relished his comrade\u0027s insidious attempt to slide into Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s affections. \"You\u0027re better now, ain\u0027t you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A little,\" murmured Mrs. Middlemore, \"a very little.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Take a sip of this,\" said Constable Wigg, holding a glass to her lips, \"it\u0027ll bring you round.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ignoring her previous declaration that she did not \"drink sperrits,\" Mrs. Middlemore sipped the glass of whiskey, and continued to sip, with intermittent shudders, till she had drained the last drop. Then she summoned sufficient strength to raise herself languidly from Constable Nightingale\u0027s arms, and look toward the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where\u0027s it gone to?\" she asked, in a trembling voice. \"What\u0027s become of the \u0027orrid creature?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What horrid creature, my dear?\" inquired Constable Nightingale, winking at his comrade.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The cat! The red cat!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A red cat!\" exclaimed Constable Nightingale, in a jocular voice; \"who ever heard of such a thing? Who ever saw such a thing?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, I did--and you did, too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not me,\" said Constable Nightingale, with another wink at Constable Wigg.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nor me,\" said that officer, following the lead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you mean to tell me you didn\u0027t see a cat, and that the cat you sor wasn\u0027t red?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I saw a cat, yes,\" said Constable Nightingale, \"but not a red \u0027un--no, not a red un\u0027. What do you say, Wigg?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I say as you says, Nightingale.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s lobsters, now,\" said Constable Nightingale; \"we know what color they are when they\u0027re boiled, but we don\u0027t boil cats, that I know of, and if we did they wouldn\u0027t turn red. You learned natural history when you was at school, Wigg. What did they say about red cats?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s against nature,\" said Constable Wigg, adding, with an unconscious imitation of Macbeth, \"there\u0027s no such thing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I must take your word for it,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, only half convinced, \"but if ever my eyes deceived me they deceived me jest now. If you two gentlemen wasn\u0027t here, I\u0027d be ready to take my oath the cat was red. And now I come to think of it, what made the pair of you cry out as you did?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What made us cry out?\" repeated Constable Nightingale, who, in this discussion, proved himself much superior to his brother officer in the matter of invention. \"It was natural, that\u0027s what it was, natural. I\u0027m free to confess I was a bit startled. First, there\u0027s the night--listen to it; it\u0027s going on worse than ever--ain\u0027t that enough to startle one? I\u0027ve been out in bad nights, but I never remember such a one-er as this. Did you, Wigg?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never. If it goes on much longer, it\u0027ll beat that American blizzard they talked so much of.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s enough to startle a chap,\" continued Constable Nightingale, \"letting alone anything else. But then, there was that talk about a spectre cat. I ain\u0027t frightened of much that I know of. Put a man before me, or a dog, or a horse, and I\u0027m ready to tackle \u0027em, one down and the other come up, or altogether if they like; but when you come to spectres, I ain\u0027t ashamed to say I\u0027m not up to \u0027em. Its constitootional, Mrs. Middlemore; I was that way when I was little. There was a cupboard at home, and my mother used to say, \u0027Don\u0027t you ever open it, Jimmy; there\u0027s a ghost hiding behind the door.\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t have put my hand on the knob for untold gold. It\u0027s the same now. Anything that\u0027s alive I don\u0027t give way to; but when it comes to ghosts and spectres I take a back seat, and I don\u0027t care who knows it. Then there was that cry for \u0027Help,\u0027 that Wigg was speaking of. Then there was the candle going out\"--he gave Mrs. Middlemore a nudge as he referred to this incident--\"and the sudden opening of the door there. It was all them things together that made me cry out; and if brother Wigg\u0027s got any other explanation to give I shall be glad to hear it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Nightingale,\" said the prudent and unimaginative Wigg, \"I couldn\u0027t improve on you. You\u0027ve spoke like a man, and I hope our good-looking, good-natured landlady is satisfied.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This complimentary allusion served to dispel Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s fears, and in a more contented frame of mind she resumed her seat at the table, the constables following her example.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"May the present moment,\" said Constable Nightingale, lifting his glass and looking affectionately at Mrs. Middlemore, \"be the worst of our lives; and here\u0027s my regards to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And mine, my good creature,\" said Constable Wigg.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Gents both,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, now thoroughly restored, \"I looks toward yer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whereupon they all drank, and settled themselves comfortably in their chairs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What was in that cupboard,\" asked Mrs. Middlemore, \"that your mother told you there was a ghost in?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What was in it? Now, that shows how a body may be frightened at nothing. I didn\u0027t find it out till I was a man, and it was as much a ghost as I am. But there\u0027s a lady present, and I\u0027d better not go on.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, you must,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, positively. \"You\u0027ve made me that curious that I\u0027ll never speak another word to you if you don\u0027t tell me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rather than that should happen, I must let you into the secret, I suppose. But you won\u0027t mind me mentioning it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not a bit, Mr. Nightingale. Speak free.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, if you must know, it was where she kept a spare bustle, and a bit or two of hair, and some other little vanities that she didn\u0027t want us young \u0027uns to pull about. There, the murder\u0027s out, and I wouldn\u0027t have mentioned the things if you hadn\u0027t been so curious; but it\u0027s a privilege of your sex, Mrs. Middlemore, one of your amiable weaknesses that we\u0027re bound to respect.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Middlemore laughed, and asked Constable Wigg what he was thinking of. That worthy had, indeed, put on his considering cap, as the saying is; he felt that Constable Nightingale was making the running too fast, and that he should be left hopelessly in the rear unless he made an attempt to assert himself, and to show that he knew a thing or two.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was thinking of the red cat,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wigg,\" said Constable Nightingale, in a tone of reproof, \"I\u0027m astonished at you. When everything\u0027s been made smooth!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"For the moment, Nightingale, for the moment,\" said Constable Wigg, complacently. \"But there\u0027s by and by to reckon with. It ain\u0027t to be expected that Mrs. Middlemore can have us always with her, though I\u0027m sure I should ask for nothing better. What could a man want better than this? Outside snow and blow, inside wine and shine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re quite a poet, Mr. Wigg,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, admiringly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t see it,\" grumbled Constable Nightingale; \"where\u0027s the wine?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If this,\" said Constable Wigg, raising his glass and looking at its contents with the eye of a connoisseur, \"ain\u0027t as good as the best of wine, I stand corrected. Did you never hear of a poet\u0027s license, Nightingale?\" He asked this question banteringly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I didn\u0027t, and I don\u0027t believe you know where to get one, and what the Government charges for it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m afraid, Nightingale,\" said Constable Wigg, beginning to feel the effects of the drink, \"that you\u0027ve no soul for poetry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Never you mind whether I have or haven\u0027t,\" retorted Constable Nightingale.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Gents both,\" interposed Mrs. Middlemore, \"whatever you do, don\u0027t fall out. You\u0027re as welcome as welcome can be, but don\u0027t fall out.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I bear no malice,\" said Constable Nightingale, who was really a simple-minded, good-hearted fellow; \"shake hands, Wigg, and let bygones be bygones. All I want you to do is to let the red cat alone, or to stick to the point, and have done with it once and for all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very good, Nightingale,\" said Constable Wigg, assuming the lofty air of a man who had established his claim to pre-eminence. \"I\u0027ll stick to the point, and if I don\u0027t make Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s mind easy, I\u0027ll give up. Not easy as long as we\u0027re here, but easy when we\u0027re gone, as gone we must be some time or other, because it don\u0027t stand to reason that this storm\u0027s going to last forever. I\u0027m only thinking of you, I give you my word, ma\u0027am.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re very kind, I\u0027m sure,\" murmured Mrs. Middlemore, inclining, with the proverbial fickleness of her sex, now to Constable, Nightingale and now to Constable Wigg.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s the least I can do,\" proceeded Constable Wigg, addressing himself solely to his hostess, \"after the way I\u0027ve been treated here. Not for the last time, I hope.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not by a many,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, smirking at the flatterer, \"if it remains with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re monarch of all you survey, ma\u0027am,\" observed the wily Wigg, smirking back at her, \"and remain with you it must, as long as you remain single.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Mr. Wigg!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s nobody\u0027s fault but your own if you do; there\u0027s not many as can pick and choose, but you\u0027re one as can. Perhaps you\u0027re hard to please, ma\u0027am----\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I ain\u0027t,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, so energetically that Constable Nightingale began to think it time to interfere.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re forgetting the red cat, Wigg,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not at all,\" said Constable Wigg, blandly; \"I\u0027m coming to it, but I don\u0027t forget that Mrs. Middlemore has nerves. It amounts to this, ma\u0027am. I\u0027ve read a bit in my time, and I\u0027m going to give you--and Nightingale, if he ain\u0027t too proud--the benefit of it. You did see a red cat, ma\u0027am.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did I?\" said Mrs. Middlemore, looking around with a shiver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You did, ma\u0027am, and yet the cat wasn\u0027t red. I thought it was red, and so did Nightingale, if he\u0027ll speak the truth. I\u0027ll wait for him to say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I won\u0027t keep you waiting long,\" said Constable Nightingale, in a surly tone. \"As you and Mrs. Middlemore seem to be of one mind, I\u0027ll make a clean breast of it. I thought it was red, and when I made light of it I did it for her sake.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said this so tenderly that Mrs. Middlemore rewarded him with a look of gratitude; but she kept her eyes averted from the kitchen door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now we can get on like a house on fire,\" said Constable Wigg. \"When you winked at me, Nightingale, I didn\u0027t contradict you, but I fell a-thinking, and then what I read come to my mind. You\u0027ve been out in the snow, Mrs. Middlemore, and you saw nothing but white. We\u0027ve been out in the snow, ma\u0027am, and we saw nothing but white. Not for a minute, not for five, not for ten but for hours I may say. I remember reading somewhere that when you\u0027ve looked for a longish time upon nothing but white, that it\u0027s as likely as not the next thing you see will be red, never mind what the color really is. That\u0027s the way with us. The cat\u0027s been haunting me, in a manner of speaking, the whole livelong night, and what with that and the snow, and being all of a sudden shoved into darkness, the minute a light shines on the wretched thing it comes to me as red as a ball of fire; and it comes to you the same, because the snow\u0027s got into your eyes and affected your sight.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bosh!\" exclaimed Constable Nightingale.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s that you say, Nightingale?\" asked Constable Wigg.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bosh! I didn\u0027t want to frighten Mrs. Middlemore, and that\u0027s the reason I wouldn\u0027t harp on it, but now you\u0027ve raked it up again I\u0027ll have the matter settled.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So saying, Constable Nightingale rose from his chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are you going?\" cried Mrs. Middlemore. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m going to find that cat,\" replied Constable Nightingale, \"if it\u0027s in the house. If it isn\u0027t red, I give in and apologize. If it is, I shall take the liberty of saying for the third time, Bosh!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He walked toward the door, but started back before he reached it, and pointing to the floor, asked,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you call that, Wigg? Is that a deloosion!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Constable Wigg advanced, looked down, rubbed his eyes, looked down again, and answered,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m bound to say there\u0027s no mistaking the color. Have you got any red ochre in the house, ma\u0027am?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not a bit,\" gasped Mrs. Middlemore, \"as I knows on.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"These,\" said Constable Nightingale, kneeling, and examining the floor, \"are marks of the cat\u0027s paws, and they\u0027re red. Look for yourself, Wigg.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s no denying it,\" said the baffled Wigg.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re on duty here, Wigg.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you advise, Nightingale? You\u0027ve been longer in the force than me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s got to be looked into by somebody. It ain\u0027t for me to do it, because I\u0027m out of my beat, and I don\u0027t want to be made an example of. Would you oblige me by going to the door and giving the alarm?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"For me, being at a distance, to hear it. For me hearing it, to run to your assistance. Do you twig? My being on your beat must be accounted for. That will account for it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This ingenious suggestion relieved Constable Wigg\u0027s mind as well as his comrade\u0027s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s a good idea,\" he said; \"and it\u0027ll account, too, for our being in the house, supposing anything should be said about it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Exactly. Being here with Mrs. Middlemore\u0027s permission. You\u0027ve got a lot to learn, Wigg, and one of the lessons I\u0027d advise you to take to heart\"--here he looked significantly at Mrs. Middlemore--\"is not to poach on a pal\u0027s preserves.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Constable Wigg may have felt the reproach, but he took no notice of it. \"You may as well come to the door with me, Nightingale.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve no objections.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll come too,\" said Mrs. Middlemore, nervously. \"I wouldn\u0027t be left alone here for anythink you could orfer me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The three walked upstairs to the passage, Mrs. Middlemore needing the support of Constable Nightingale\u0027s arm round her waist; but the moment the fastenings of the street-door were unloosed, it flew open as though a battering ram had been applied to it, and the wind and snow swept in upon them with undiminished fury.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hanged if it ain\u0027t getting worse and worse!\" muttered Constable Nightingale, helping the others to shut the door, which was accomplished with great difficulty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t make a noise in the passage,\" whispered Mrs. Middlemore to Constable Wigg. \"Mr. Felix \u0027ll \u0027ear it, and he\u0027d never forgive me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll take it for granted, then, that the alarm is given,\" said Constable Nightingale, \"and we\u0027ll go downstairs, and consider what ought to be done.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1658/48879.html","bookId":1202,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:01:22 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:01:22 AM"}
