Some members of its alumni association blamed the decision to admit girls. Others cited newfangled liberal ideals and a general decline in the respect for elders worldwide. But no matter the theory, no one could deny that, recently, life at the Colgan School was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, its grounds were still perfectly manicured. Three quarters of the senior class were already well on their way to being early-accepted into the Ivy League. Photos of presidents and senators and CEOs still lined the dark-paneled hallway outside the headmaster’s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in the old days, no one would ever have declined admission to Colgan on the day before classes started, forcing the administration to scramble to fill the slot. Historically, any vacancy would have been met with a waiting list a mile long, but this year, for some reason, there was only one applicant eager to enroll at that late date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of all, there had been a time when honor meant something at the Colgan School, when school property was respected, when the faculty was revered—when the headmaster’s mint-condition 1958 Porsche Speedster would never have been placed on top of the fountain in the quad with water shooting out of its headlights on an unusually warm evening in November.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been a time when the girl responsible—the very one who had lucked into that last-minute vacancy only a few months before—would have had the decency to admit what she’d done and quietly taken her leave of the school. But unfortunately, that era, much like the headmaster’s car, was finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days after Porsche-gate, as the students had taken to calling it, the girl in question had the nerve to sit in the hallway of the administration building beneath the black-and-white stare of three senators, two presidents, and a Supreme Court justice, with her head held high, as if she’d done nothing wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore students than usual filed down the corridor that day, going out of their way to steal a glance and whisper behind cupped hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s the one I was telling you about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you think she did it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny other student might have flinched in that bright spotlight, but from the moment Katarina Bishop set foot on the Colgan campus, she’d been something of an enigma. Some said she’d gained her last-minute slot because she was the daughter of an incredibly wealthy European businessman who had made a very generous donation. Some looked at her perfect posture and cool demeanor, rolled her first name across their tongues, and assumed that she was Russian royalty—one of the last of the Romanovs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome called her a hero; others called her a freak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone had heard a different story, but no one knew the truth—that Kat really had grown up all over Europe, but she wasn’t an heiress. That she did, in fact, have a Fabergé egg, but she wasn’t a Romanov. Kat herself could have added a thousand rumors to the mill, but she stayed quiet, knowing that the only thing no one would believe was the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katarina?” the headmaster’s secretary called. “The board will see you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat rose calmly, but as she stepped toward the open door twenty feet from the headmaster’s office, she heard her shoes squeak; she felt her hands tingle. Every nerve in her body seemed to stand on end as she realized that somehow, in the last three months, she had become someone who wore squeaky shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, whether she liked it or not, they were going to hear her coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat was used to looking at a room and seeing all the angles, but she’d never seen a room quite like this before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the hallway outside was long and straight, this room was round. Dark wood surrounded her; dim lights hung from a low ceiling. It felt to Kat almost like a cave, except for a tall, slim window where a narrow beam of sunlight came pouring in. Suddenly, Kat found herself reaching out, wanting to run her hands through the rays. But then someone cleared his throat, a pencil rolled across a desk, and Kat’s shoes squeaked again, bringing her back to the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may sit down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came from the back of the room, and at first Kat didn’t know who’d spoken. Like the voice, the faces before her were unfamiliar: the twelve on her right were wrinkle-free and fresh—students just like her (or as much like her as a Colgan student could possibly be). The twelve people on her left had hair that was a little thinner, or makeup that was a little heavier. But regardless of age, all the members of the Colgan School Honor Board were wearing identical black robes and impassive expressions as they watched Kat walk to the center of the circular room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit, Ms. Bishop,” Headmaster Franklin said from his place in the front row. He looked especially pale in his dark robe. His cheeks were too puffy, his hair too styled. He was the sort of man, Kat realized, who probably wished he were as fast and sporty as his car. And then, despite everything, Kat grinned a little, imagining the headmaster himself propped up in the middle of the quad, squirting water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Kat took her seat, the senior boy beside the headmaster rose and announced, “The Colgan School Honor Board shall come to order.” His voice echoed around the room. “All who wish to speak shall be heard. All who wish to follow the light shall see. All who wish to seek justice shall find the truth. Honor for one,” the boy finished, and before Kat could really process what she’d heard, twenty-four voices chorused, “Honor for all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy sat and ruffled through the pages of an old leather-bound book until the headmaster prodded, “Jason . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Yeah.” Jason picked up the heavy book. “The Colgan School Honor Board will hear the case of Katarina Bishop, sophomore. The committee will hear testimony that on the tenth of November, Ms. Bishop did willfully . . . um . . . steal personal property.” Jason chose his words carefully, while a girl in the second row stifled a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That by committing this act at two a.m., she was also in violation of the school curfew. And that Ms. Bishop willfully destroyed school artifacts.” Jason lowered the book and paused—a little more dramatically than necessary, Kat thought—before he added, “According to the Colgan Code of Honor, these charges are punishable by expulsion. Do you understand the charges as they have been read to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat took a moment to make sure the board really did want her to respond before she said, “I didn’t do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The charges.” Headmaster Franklin leaned forward. “The question, Ms. Bishop, was whether you understood the charges.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do.” Kat felt her heartbeat change rhythm. “I just don’t agree with them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—” the headmaster started again, but a woman to his right touched his arm lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at Kat as she said, “Headmaster, I seem to remember that in matters such as this, it’s customary to take the student’s full academic history into account. Perhaps we should begin with a review of Ms. Bishop’s record?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” The headmaster seemed to deflate a bit. “Well, that’s quite right, Ms. Connors, but since Ms. Bishop has only been with us a few months, she has no record to speak of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But surely this is not the first school the young woman has attended?” Ms. Connors asked, and Kat bit back a nervous laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yes,” the headmaster admitted grudgingly. “Of course. And we tried to contact those schools, but there was a fire at Trinity that destroyed the entire admissions office and most of their records. And the Bern Institute experienced a terrible computer crash last summer, so we’ve had a very difficult time finding . . . things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headmaster looked at Kat as if disasters must follow wherever she went. Ms. Connors, on the other hand, looked impressed. “Those are two of the finest schools in Europe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am. My father, he . . . does a lot of work there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do your parents do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Kat searched the second row for the girl who’d posed the question, she started to ask exactly why her parents’ occupations mattered. But then she remembered that Colgan was the kind of place where who your parents were and what they did always seemed to matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother died when I was six.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few people gave a slight sigh at this, but Headmaster Franklin pressed on. “And your father?” he asked, unwilling to let a conveniently deceased mother swing any sympathy votes Kat’s way. “What does he do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Art,” Kat said simply, carefully. “He does a lot of things, but he specializes in art.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this, the head of the fine arts department perked up. “Collecting?” the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Kat had to fight back a smile. “More like . . . distribution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Interesting though this may be,” Headmaster Franklin interrupted, “it does not pertain to . . . the matter at hand.” Kat could have sworn he’d stopped himself from saying to my convertible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one responded. The only motion in the room was the dust that still danced in the narrow beam of falling light. Finally, Headmaster Franklin leaned forward and narrowed his eyes. Kat had seen lasers with less focus as the headmaster snapped: “Ms. Bishop, where were you on the night of November tenth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In my room. Studying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On a Friday night? You were studying?” The headmaster glanced at his colleagues as if that were the most outrageous lie any Colgan student had ever dared to utter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, Colgan is an exceptionally difficult institution. I have to study.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you didn’t see anyone?” Jason asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, but someone saw you, didn’t they, Ms. Bishop?” Headmaster Franklin’s voice was cold and sharp. “We have cameras monitoring the grounds. Or didn’t you know?” he asked with a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut of course Kat knew about the cameras. She suspected she knew more about every aspect of Colgan security than the headmaster did, but she didn’t think this was the appropriate time to say so. There were too many witnesses. Too much was at stake. And, besides, the headmaster was already smiling triumphantly and dimming the lights with a remote control. Kat had to twist in her chair to see a section of the round wall sliding aside, revealing a large TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This young woman bears a striking resemblance to you, does she not, Ms. Bishop?” As Kat watched the grainy black-and-white video, she recognized the quad, of course, but she had never seen the person who was running across it wearing a black hooded sweatshirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the dormitory doors were only opened once that night—at 2:27 a.m.—using a student identification card. This card.” Kat’s stomach flipped as the single-worst picture she had ever taken appeared on the screen. “This is your Colgan student I.D., is it not, Ms. Bishop?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And this”—Headmaster Franklin reached beneath his seat—“was found during a search of your belongings.” The personalized license plate—COLGAN-1—seemed to glow as he held it above his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt to Kat as though all the air had left the dim room as a strange feeling swept over her. After all, accused she could handle; wrongly accused was entirely new territory. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heist-society-heist-society-1/page-1.html","bookId":2403,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:03 AM"}
