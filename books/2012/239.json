For my loss, as friends will do .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city was his genius – Mappo could see that truth in every line – but as he drew closer, squinting at the strangely flowing light and shadows in the facets of crystal, he saw evidence of occupation. His steps slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroken husks of fruit, fragments of clothing, the musty smell of dried faeces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was beginning to rise – had it been that far? He approached the nearest, broadest avenue. As he passed between two angular buildings, he froze at a flicker of movement – there, reflected from a facet projecting from the wall to his right. And as he stared, he saw it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChildren. Walking past .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet no one was here – no one but me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were wending their way out of the city – hundreds upon hundreds of children. Stick-thin limbs and bellies swollen with starvation. As he watched the procession, he saw not a single adult among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMappo walked on, catching glimpses in the crystals of their brief occupation, their squatting presence amidst palatial – if cold – splendour. Icarium, I begin to understand. And yet, cruellest joke of all, this was the one place you could never find again .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time you said you felt close … this city was the place you sought. These crystal machines of memory. And the trail you hunted – it did not matter if we were on another continent, it did not matter if we were half a world away – that trail was one of remembering. Remembering this city .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on, piecing together the more recent history, the army of children, and many times he caught sight of one girl, her mouth crusted with sores, her hair bleached of all colour. And huge eyes that seemed to somehow find his own – but that was impossible. She was long gone, with all the other children. She could not be—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh! This is the one! Voicing songs of incantation – the banisher of the d’ivers. Opals gems shards – this is the child .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had come to a central square. She was there, looking out at him from a tilted spire of quartz. He walked until he stood in front of her, and her eyes tracked him all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are just a memory,’ Mappo said. ‘It is a function of the machine, to trap the life passing through it. You cannot be looking at me – no, someone has walked my path, someone has come to stand before you here.’ He swung round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen paces away, before the sealed door of a narrow structure, Mappo saw a boy, tall, clutching a bundled shape. Their eyes met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am between them. That is all. They do not see me. They see each other .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the boy’s eyes pinned him like knife points. And he spoke. ‘Do not turn away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMappo staggered as if struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, the girl said, ‘Icarias cannot hold us. The city is troubled.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faced her again. A boy had come up beside her, in his scrawny arms a heap of rubbish. He studied the girl’s profile with open adoration. She blew flies from her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Badalle.’ The tall boy’s voice drifted past him. ‘What did you dream?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl smiled. ‘No one wants us, Rutt. Not one – in their lives they won’t change a thing to help us. In their lives they make ever more of us, but when they say they care about our future, they’re lying. The words are empty. Powerless. But I have seen words of real power, Rutt, and each one is a weapon. A weapon . That is why adults spend a lifetime blunting them.’ She shrugged. ‘No one likes getting cut.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the boy spoke again, it was as if he stood in Mappo’s place. ‘What did you dream, Badalle?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In the end we take our language with us. In the end, we leave them all behind.’ She turned to the boy beside her and frowned. ‘Throw them away. I don’t like them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What did you dream, Badalle?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl’s gaze returned, centring on Mappo’s face. ‘I saw a tiger. I saw an ogre. I saw men and women. Then a witch came and took their children away. And not one of them tried to stop her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It wasn’t like that,’ Mappo whispered. But it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then one rode after them – he wasn’t much older than you, Rutt. I think. He was hard to see. A ghost got in the way. He was young enough to still listen to his conscience.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ It wasn’t like that! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is that all?’ asked the boy named Rutt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ she replied, ‘but he’s heard enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMappo cried out, staggered back, away. He shot a look back and saw her eyes tracking him. And in his skull, she said, ‘ Ogre, I can’t save you, and you can’t save him. Not from himself. He is your Held, but every child wakes up. In this world, every child wakes up – and it is what all of you fear the most. Look at Rutt. He has Held in his arms. And you, you go to find your Held, to fill your arms once more. Look at Rutt. He is terrified of Held waking up. He’s just like you. Now hear my poem. It is for you . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-239.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
