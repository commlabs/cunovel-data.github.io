She suddenly turned around gracefully before rushing towards Madeline. Her speed was so fast that it was impossible for the naked eye to grasp. She instantly appeared behind Madeline, and then her left arm moved, already wrapping around Madeline’s body!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBoth of Madeline’s arms were locked within Pandora’s arm, momentarily preventing her from budging an inch!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Let her go!” Su released another roar, and then he rushed towards Pandora with large steps!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe was extremely clear on the fact that with Pandora’s terrifying strength, as long as her arm slightly displayed strength, she could easily crush all the bones in Madeline’s body! Moreover, she still had a completely free right hand.

Her body wriggled about miraculously, twisting about, and after a few movements, there was already a small amount of space created.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Pandora blew gently into Madeline’s ears, and with a voice so soft only the two of them could hear, she said, “The greater your struggle, the more Su will go all out.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMadeline’s eyes suddenly widened. Her long gray hair immediately fluttered about, and then it gradually fell. Endless stellar splendor danced around herself and the black haired young lady, adding a mysterious brilliance to this scene.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eUpon seeing this scene, Su was immediately shocked. He stopped all movements, no longer pressing forward adamantly. It was because any offensive action now would result in Pandora’s doubt, and as a result cause her to take forceful action against Madeline.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOnly now did Pandora give off the feeling of a young lady that had real flesh and blood instead of just a powerful human shaped weapon. Meanwhile, her expressions seemed much richer and more natural.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe looked at Madeline whose head was slightly drooping, and then she looked at Su. Suddenly, a faint smile that was almost undetectable appeared. She raised her right hand, pointed it at Su, and then said indifferently, “I need your blood under the state where your abilities are all active.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu was silent. Then, his bruised body straightened again. The dozen or so energy crystals that were already shattered emerged again. Then, his mouth opened, and a drop of perfectly round blood was spat out, drifting towards Pandora.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe young black haired girl opened her mouth, and with an inhale, the bead of blood entered those glowing moist lips. Su stood there calmly, nor did he try to stir up the power stored within his blood. In addition, when Pandora’s lips closed, the connection between that drop of blood and himself was lost.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePandora’s eyes narrowed slightly, appearing to be sampling the taste of that drop of blood. Several seconds later, she looked towards Su again, and with a slight smile, her tongue extended a bit. Then, a cut appeared on the tip of her tongue, and a drop of blood similarly flew towards Su.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\"For you. This is the black flame seal blood, while what you saw last time was just a fragment of the black flames.” Pandora spoke with her unique voice.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu was quite surprised. However, even if this was a trap, he had no other choice. That was why, just like Pandora, he similarly swallowed that drop of blood.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePandora finally smiled. She loosened her left arm, and then with a light push, sent Madeline towards Su. Pandora wrapped Madeline within a powerful force field, seemingly intending to deliver her right into Su’s embrace.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Madeline released a light snort, and then her shoulders smashed about a few times, deemphasizing the power of this forcefield as she freed herself from these restrictions. Then, she rushed to the side before walking to Su’s side in an unhurried manner.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePandora already learned not to feel annoyed over these small losses. She instead looked towards Su and said with a serious voice, “In Frozen Throne, there is something the apostle is searching for. Su, my personal advice for you is to think of a way to obtain it before the apostle does, or at least destroy it.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu was inwardly shaken up. Even though Pandora didn’t tell him the reason, since this mysterious young lady already spoke about it, then there was definitely some extraordinary secret hiding within Frozen Throne, a secret that could draw the interest of even an apostle. However, why did she have to tell him?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt didn’t seem like Pandora planned on giving Su an answer. She gathered her scattered black hair, stared at Su’s green eye, and then said, “This time, you didn’t disappoint me. I hope that when we meet next time, you similarly won’t leave me disappointed. You should know that if I am disappointed, then that will signify your end as well.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter speaking, Pandora turned around to leave, instantly disappearing into the boundless darkness.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Next time, huh?” While Su was thinking about this matter, Madeline gazed into the direction where Pandora disappeared into, the corners of her lips slightly moving upwards.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-4-chapter-13-6\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-4-chapter-14-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-4-chapter-13-7","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM"}
