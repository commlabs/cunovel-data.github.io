A miserably crowded city, this Letheras-she had no intention of tarrying over-long here, lest her presence be discovered, her schemes knocked awry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping her mouth and chin with the back of one sleeved forearm, she straightened from her feast, then set off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRautos Hivanar, head of the Liberty Consign, squatted on the muddy bank of the river, the work crews finishing the day’s excavation directly behind him, the pump crews already washing down, the sounds from the estate’s back kitchen rising with the approaching demands of supper. He was making a point of feeding his diggers well, as much to ease their bemusement as to keep them working. They were now excavating way below the river level, after all, and if not for the constantly manned pumps, they would be working chest-deep in muddy water. As it was, the shoring on the walls needed continual attention, prone as they were to sag inward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes tracking a half-dozen vinik nests rafting down the river, Rautos Hivanar was lost in thought. There had been more mysterious objects, buried deep and disconnected, but he had begun to suspect that they all belonged together; that in an as yet inconceivable way they could be assembled into a kind of mechanism. Some central piece remained undiscovered, he believed. Perhaps tomorrow…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard slippered feet on the plank walkway leading down to the river, and a moment later came Venitt Sathad’s voice. ‘Master.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Venitt, you have allotted yourself two house guards for the journey. Take two more. And, accordingly, two more packhorses. You will travel without a supply wagon, as agreed, but that need not be a reason to reduce your level of comfort.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very well, Master.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd remember, Venitt. Letur Anict is in every way the de facto ruler of Drene, regardless of the Edur governor’s official status. I am informed that you will find Orbyn Truthfinder, the Invigilator’s agent, a reliable ally. As to Letur Anict… the evidence points to the Factor’s having lost… perspective. His ambition seems without restraint, no longer harnessed to reason or, for that matter, common sense.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I shall be diligent in my investigation, Master.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRautos Hivanar rose and faced his servant. ‘If needs must, Venitt, err on the side of caution. I would not lose you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flicker of something like surprise in the Indebted’s lined face, then the man bowed. ‘I will remain circumspect, Master.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘One last thing,’ Rautos said as he moved past Venitt on his way up to the estate. ‘Do not embarrass me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Indebted’s eyes tracked his master for a moment, his expression once more closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnseen behind them on the river, a huge shape lifted beneath one vinik nest, and breaking the water as the nest overturned was the prow ridge of an enormous shell, and below that a sinewy neck and a vast, gaping beak. Swallowing the nest entire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe currents then carried the disturbance away, until no sign of it remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You know, witnessing something is one thing. Understanding it another.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg turned away from his study of the distant river, where the setting sun’s light turned the water into a rippled sheet of beaten gold, and frowned at Tehol Beddict. ‘Very pondering of you, Master.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It was, wasn’t it? I have decided that it is my normal eye that witnesses, while it is my blue eye that understands. Does that make sense to you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good, I’m glad.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The night promises to be both heavy and hot, Master. And I suggest the mosquito netting.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgreed. Can you get to it? I can’t reach.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You could if you stretched an arm.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s your point?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nothing. I admit to some… distraction.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you over it yet?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost. Alas, certain individuals are stirring in the city this evening.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, are you going to do something about it or do I have to do everything around here?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg walked across the roof to stand beside the bed. He studied the reposed form of Tehol Beddict for a moment, then he collected the netting and draped it over his master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes, one brown, the other blue, blinked up at him. ‘Shouldn’t there be a frame or something? I feel I am being readied for my own funeral here.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We used the frame for this morning’s fire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah. Well, is this going to keep me from being bitten?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Probably not, but it looks rather fetching.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-58.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
