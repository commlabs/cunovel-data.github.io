I am adjusting projection overlays where I will mark the desert\u0027s daily growth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brief nod. That had been in the original order: an acolyte to keep the map current. Odrade wanted to awaken each morning, her imagination ignited by that changing view, the first thing impressed on awareness at arising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I put a report in your workroom this morning, Mother Superior. \u0027Orchard Management.\u0027 Perhaps you did not see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade had seen only the label. She had been late coming from exercises, anxious to visit Murbella. So much depended on Murbella!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The plantations around Central must either be abandoned or action taken to sustain them,\" the acolyte said. \"That\u0027s the gist of the report.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Repeat the report verbatim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight fell and the room lights brightened as Odrade listened. Concise. Terse even. The report carried a note of admonishment Odrade recognized as originating with Bellonda. No Archival signature but Weather\u0027s warnings went through Archives and this acolyte had lifted some of the original words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe acolyte fell silent, report concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I respond? Orchards, pastures and vineyards were not merely a buffer against alien intrusions, pleasant decorations on the landscape. They supported Chapterhouse morale and tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey support my morale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow quietly this acolyte waited. Curly blond hair and round face. Pleasing countenance, though the mouth was wide. Food remained on her plate but she was not eating. Hands folded in her lap. I am here to serve you, Mother Superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Odrade composed her response, memory intruded - an old incident simulflowing over immediate observations. She remembered her ornithopter training course. Two acolyte students with instructor at midday high over the wetlands of Lampadas. She had been paired with as inept an acolyte as could have been accepted by the Sisterhood. Obviously a gene-choice. The Breeding Mistresses wanted her for a characteristic to be passed along to offspring. It certainly wasn\u0027t emotional balance or intelligence! Odrade remembered the name: Linchine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinchine had shouted at their instructor: \"I am going to fly this damned \u0027thopter!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all the while a whirling sky and landscape of trees and marshy lakeshore dizzied them. That was how it seemed: us stationary and the world moving. Linchine doing the wrong thing every time. Each movement created worse gyrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instructor cut her out of the system by pulling the disconnect only he could reach. He did not speak until they were flying straight and level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way are you ever going to fly this, lady. Not ever! You don\u0027t have the right reactions. You have to begin training those into someone like you before puberty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am! I am! I\u0027ll fly this damned thing.\" Hands jerking at the useless controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re washed out, lady. Grounded!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade breathed easier, realizing she had known all along that Linchine might kill them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhirling toward Odrade in the rear, Linchine screamed: \"Tell him! Tell him he must obey a Bene Gesserit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAddressing the fact that Odrade, several years ahead of Linchine, already displayed a commanding presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade sat in silence, features immobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence is often the best thing to say, some Bene Gesserit humorist had scrawled on a washroom mirror. Odrade found that good advice then and later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecalling herself to the needs of the acolyte in the dining hall, Odrade wondered why that old memory had come of itself. Such things seldom happened without purpose. Not silence now, certainly. Humor? Yes! That was the message. Odrade\u0027s humor (applied later) had taught Linchine something about herself. Humor under stress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade smiled at the acolyte beside her in the dining hall. \"How would you like to be a horse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" The word was startled out of her but she responded to Mother Superior\u0027s smile. Nothing alarming in that. Warm even. Everyone said Mother Superior permitted affections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand, of course,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mother Superior.\" Still smiling and patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade allowed her gaze to quest over the young face. Clear blue eyes not yet touched by the engulfing blue of Spice Agony. A mouth almost like Bell\u0027s but without the viciousness. Dependable muscles and dependable intelligence. She would be good at anticipating Mother Superior\u0027s needs. Witness her map assignment and that report. Sensitive. Went with her superior intelligence. Not likely to rise to the very top but always in key positions where you needed her qualities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I sit beside this one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade frequently selected a particular companion at mealtime visits. Acolytes mostly. They could be so revealing. Reports often found their way to Mother Superior\u0027s workroom: personal observations from Proctors about one acolyte or another. But sometimes, Odrade chose a seat for no reason she could explain. As I did tonight. Why this one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversation rarely occurred unless Mother Superior initiated it. Gentle initiation usually, easing into more intimate matters. Others around them listened avidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt such moments, Odrade often produced a manner of almost religious serenity. It soothed nervous ones. Acolytes were... well, acolytes, but Mother Superior was the supreme witch of them all. Nervousness was natural.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone behind Odrade whispered: \"She has Streggi on the coals tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the coals. Odrade knew the expression. It had been used in her acolyte days. So this one was named Streggi. Let it be unspoken for now. Names carry magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you enjoy tonight\u0027s dinner?\" Odrade asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s acceptable, Mother Superior.\" One tried not to give false opinions, but Streggi was confused by the shift in conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve overcooked it,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Serving so many, how can they please everyone, Mother Superior?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe speaks her mind and speaks it well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your left hand is trembling,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m nervous with you, Mother Superior. And I\u0027ve just come from the practice floor. Very tiring today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade analyzed the tremors. \"They have you doing the long-arm lift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it painful in your day, Mother Superior?\" (In those ancient times?) \"Just as painful as today. Pain teaches, they told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat softened things. Shared experiences, the patter of the Proctors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand about horses, Mother Superior.\" Streggi looked at her plate. \"This cannot be horse meat. I\u0027m sure I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade laughed loudly, attracting startled looks. She put a hand on Streggi\u0027s arm and subsided to a gentle smile. \"Thank you, my dear. No one has made me laugh that much in years. I hope this is the beginning of a long and joyous association.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mother Superior, but I -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will explain about the horse, my own little joke and no intent to demean you. I want you to carry a young child on your shoulders, to move him more rapidly than his short legs will carry him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish, Mother Superior.\" No objections, no more questions. Questions were there, but the answers would come in their own time and Streggi knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagic time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithdrawing her hand, Odrade said: \"Your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Streggi, Mother Superior. Aloana Streggi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rest easy, Streggi. I will see to the orchards. We need them for morale as much as for food. You report to Reassignment tonight. Tell them I want you in my workroom at six tomorrow morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be there, Mother Superior. Will I continue to mark your map?\" As Odrade was rising to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now, Streggi. But ask Reassignment for a new acolyte and begin training her. Soon, you will be much too busy for the map.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mother Superior. The desert is growing very fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreggi\u0027s words gave Odrade a certain satisfaction, dispelling gloom that had hampered her most of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cycle was getting another chance, turning once more as it was impelled to do by those subterranean forces called \"life\" and \"love\" and other unnecessary labels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus it turns. Thus it renews. Magic. What witchery could take your attention from this miracle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her workroom, she issued an order to Weather, then silenced the tools of her office and went to the bow window. Chapterhouse glowed pale red in the night from reflections of groundlights against low clouds. It gave a romantic appearance to rooftops and walls that Odrade quickly rejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomance? There was nothing romantic about what she had done in the Acolyte Dining Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have finally done it. I have committed myself. Now, Duncan must restore our Bashar\u0027s memories. A delicate assignment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to stare into the night, suppressing knots in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI not only commit myself but I commit what remains of my Sisterhood. So this is how it feels, Tar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how it feels and your plan is tricky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to rain. Odrade sensed it in the air coming through the ventilators around the window. No need to read a Weather Dispatch. She seldom did that these days, anyway. Why bother? But Streggi\u0027s report carried a potent warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRains were becoming rarer here and rather to be welcomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSisters would emerge to walk in it despite the cold. There was a touch of sadness in the thought. Each rain she saw brought the same question: Is this the last one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe people of Weather did heroic things to keep an expanding desert dry and the growing areas irrigated. Odrade did not know how they had managed this rain to comply with her order. Before long, they would not be able to obey such commands, even from Mother Superior. The desert will triumph because that is what we have set in motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the central panes of her window. The wind at this level had stopped. Just the clouds moving overhead. Wind at higher elevations harrying things along. A sense of urgency in the weather. The air was chilly. So they had made temperature adjustments to bring this bit of rain. She closed the window, feeling no desire to go outside. Mother Superior had no time to play the game of last rain. One rain at a time. And always out there the desert moving inexorably toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat, we can map and watch. But what of the hunter behind me - the nightmare figure with the axe? What map tells me where she is tonight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReligion (emulation of adults by the child) encysts past mythologies: guesses, hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, pronouncements made in search of personal power, all mingled with shreds of enlightenment. And always an unspoken commandment: Thou shalt not question! We break that commandment daily in the harnessing of human imagination to our deepest creativity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Bene Gesserit Credo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella sat cross-legged on the practice floor, alone, shivering after her exertions. Mother Superior had been here less than an hour this afternoon. And, as often happened, Murbella felt she had been abandoned in a fever dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade\u0027s parting words reverberated in the dream: \"The hardest lesson for an acolyte to learn is that she must always go the limit. Your abilities will take you farther than you imagine. Don\u0027t imagine, then. Extend yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is my response? That I was taught to cheat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade had done something to call up the patterns of childhood and Honored Matre education. I learned cheating as an infant. How to simulate a need and gain attention. Many \"how-to\u0027s\" in the cheating pattern. The older she got, the easier the cheating. She had learned what the big people around her were demanding. I regurgitated on demand. That was called \"education.\" Why were the Bene Gesserit so remarkably different in their teaching?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t ask you to be honest with me,\" Odrade had said. \"Be honest with yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella despaired of ever rooting out all of the cheating in her past. Why should I? More cheating!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn you, Odrade!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly after the words were out did she realize she had spoken them aloud. She started to put a hand to her mouth and aborted the movement. Fever said: \"What\u0027s the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Educational bureaucracies dull a child\u0027s questing sensitivity.\" Odrade explaining. \"The young must be damped down. Never let them know how good they can be. That brings change. Spend lots of committee time talking about how to deal with exceptional students. Don\u0027t spend any time dealing with how the conventional teacher feels threatened by emerging talents and squelches them because of a deep-seated desire to feel superior and safe in a safe environment. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was talking about Honored Matres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConventional teachers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was: Behind that facade of wisdom, the Bene Gesserit were unconventional. They often did not think about teaching; they just did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods! I want to be like them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought shocked her and she leaped to her feet, launching herself into a training routine for wrists and arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealization bit deeper than ever. She did not want to disappoint these teachers. Candor and honesty. Every acolyte heard that. \"Basic tools of learning,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDistracted by her thoughts, Murbella tumbled hard and stood up, rubbing a bruised shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had thought at first that the Bene Gesserit protestation must be a lie. I am being so candid with you that I must tell you about my unswerving honesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut actions confirmed their claim. Odrade\u0027s voice persisted in the fever dream: \"That is how you judge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had something in the mind, in memory and a balance of intellect no Honored Matre had ever possessed. This thought made her feel small. Enter corruption. It was like liver spots in her feverish thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I have talent! It required talent to become an Honored Matre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I still think of myself as an Honored Matre?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bene Gesserit knew she had not fully committed herself to them. What skills do I have that they could possibly want? Not the skills of deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do actions agree with words? There\u0027s your measure of reliability. Never confine yourself to the words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella put her hands over her ears. Shut up, Odrade!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does a Truthsayer separate sincerity from a more fundamental judgment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella dropped her hands to her sides. Maybe I\u0027m really sick. She swept her gaze around the long room. No one there to utter these words. Anyway, it was Odrade\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you convince yourself, sincerely, you can speak utter balderdash (marvelous old word; look it up), absolute poppylarky in every word and you will be believed. But not by one of our Truthsayers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella\u0027s shoulders sagged. She began to wander aimlessly around the practice floor. Was there no place to escape?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look for the consequences, Murbella. That\u0027s how you ferret out things that work. That\u0027s what our much-vaunted truths are all about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePragmatism?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho found her then and responded to the wild look in her eyes. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I think I\u0027m sick. Really sick. I thought it was something Odrade did to me but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her as she fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once, he was glad of the comeyes. A Suk was with them in less than a minute. She bent over Murbella where Idaho cradled her on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe examination was brief. The Suk, a graying older Reverend Mother with the traditional diamond brand on her forehead, straightened and said: \"Overstressed. She\u0027s not trying to find her limits, she\u0027s going beyond them. We\u0027ll put her back into the sensitizing class before we let her continue. I\u0027ll send the Proctors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade found Murbella in the Proctor\u0027s Ward that evening, propped up in a bed, two Proctors taking turns testing her muscle responses. A small gesture and they left Odrade alone with Murbella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to avoid complicating things,\" Murbella said. Candor and honesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to avoid complications often creates them.\" Odrade sank into a chair beside the bed and put a hand on Murbella\u0027s arm. Muscles quivered under the hand. \"We say \u0027words are slow, feeling\u0027s faster.\u0027 \" Odrade withdrew. \"What decisions have you been making?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let me make decisions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t sneer.\" She lifted a hand to prevent interruption. \"I didn\u0027t take your previous conditioning into sufficient account. The Honored Matres left you practically incapable of making decisions. Typical of power-hungry societies. Teach their people to diddle around forever. \u0027Decisions bring bad results!\u0027 You teach avoidance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that have to do with me collapsing?\" Resentful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murbella! The worst products of what I\u0027m describing are almost basket cases - can\u0027t make decisions about anything, or leave them until the last possible second and then leap at them like desperate animals. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me to go the limit!\" Almost wailing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your limits, Murbella. Not mine. Not Bell\u0027s or those of anyone else. Yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve decided I want to be like you.\" Very faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marvelous! I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve ever tried to kill myself. Especially when I was pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of herself, Murbella grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade stood. \"Sleep. You\u0027re going into a special class tomorrow where we\u0027ll work on your ability to mesh your decisions with sensitivity to your limits. Remember what I told you. We take care of our own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I yours?\" Almost whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since you repeated the oath before the Proctors.\" Odrade turned out the lights as she left. Murbella heard her speak to someone before the door closed. \"Stop fussing with her. She needs rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella closed her eyes. The fever dream was gone but in its place was her own memory. \"I am a Bene Gesserit. I exist only to serve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard herself saying those words to the Proctors but memory gave them an emphasis not in the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey knew I was being cynical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could you hide from such women?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the remembered hand of the Proctor on her forehead and heard the words that had possessed no meaning until this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stand in the sacred human presence. As I do now, so should you stand some day. I pray to your presence that this be so. Let the future remain uncertain for that is the canvas to receive our desires. Thus the human condition faces its perpetual tabula rasa. We possess no more than this moment where we dedicate ourselves continuously to the sacred presence we share and create.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConventional but unconventional. She realized that she had not been physically or emotionally prepared for this moment. Tears flowed down her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaws to suppress tend to strengthen what they would prohibit. This is the fine point on which all the legal professions of history have based their job security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Bene Gesserit Coda\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn her restless prowlings through Central (infrequent these days but more intense because of that), Odrade looked for signs of slackness and especially for areas of responsibility that were running too smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Senior Watchdog had her own watchwords: \"Show me a completely smooth operation and I\u0027ll show you someone who\u0027s covering mistakes. Real boats rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said this often and it became an identifying phrase the Sisters (and even some acolytes) employed to comment on Mother Superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real boats rock.\" Soft chuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda accompanied Odrade on today\u0027s early morning inspection, not mentioning that \"once a month\" had been stretched to \"once every two months\" - if that. This inspection was a week past the mark. Bell wanted to use this time for warnings about Idaho. And she had dragged Tamalane along although Tam was supposed to be reviewing Proctor performance at this hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo against one? Odrade wondered. She did not think Bell or Tam suspected what Mother Superior intended. Well, it would come out, as had Taraza\u0027s plan. In its own time, eh, Tar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the corridors they stalked, black robes swishing with urgency, eyes missing little. It was all familiar and yet they looked for things that were new. Odrade carried her Ear-C over her left shoulder like a misplaced diving weight. Never be out of communication range these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the scenes in any Bene Gesserit center were the support facilities: clinic-hospital, kitchen, morgue, garbage control, reclamation systems (attached to sewage and garbage), transport and communications, kitchen provisioning, training and physical maintenance halls, schools for acolytes and postulants, quarters for all of the denominations, meeting centers, testing facilities and much more. Personnel often changed because of the Scattering and movement of people into new responsibilities, all according to subtle Bene Gesserit awareness. But tasks and places for them remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they strode swiftly from one area to another, Odrade spoke of the Sisterhood Scattering, not trying to hide her dismay at \"the atomic family\" they had become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find it difficult to contemplate humankind spreading into an unlimited universe,\" Tam said. \"The possibilities...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Infinite numbers game.\" Odrade stepped across a broken curb. \"That should be repaired. We\u0027ve been playing the infinity game since we learned to jump Foldspace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no joy in Bellonda. \"It\u0027s not a game!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade could appreciate Bellonda\u0027s feelings. We have never seen empty space. Always more galaxies. Tam\u0027s right. It\u0027s daunting when you focus on that Golden Path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories of explorations gave the Sisterhood a statistical handle on it but little else. So many habitable planets in a given assemblage and, among those, an expected additional number that could be terraformed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s evolving out there?\" Tamalane demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA question they could not answer. Ask what Infinity might produce and the only answer possible was, \"Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny good, any evil; any god, any devil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if Honored Matres are fleeing something?\" Odrade asked. \"Interesting possibility?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These speculations are useless,\" Bellonda muttered. \"We don\u0027t even know if Foldspace introduces us to one universe or many... or even an infinite number of expanding and collapsing bubbles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did the Tyrant understand this any better than we do?\" Tamalane asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey paused while Odrade looked into a room where five Advanced acolytes and a Proctor studied a projection of regional melange stores. The crystal holding the information performed an intricate dance in the projector, bouncing on its beam like a ball on a fountain. Odrade saw the summation and turned away before scowling. Tam and Bell did not see Odrade\u0027s expression. We will have to start limiting access to melange data. Too depressing to morale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdministration! It all came back to Mother Superior. Delegate heavily to only the same people and you fell into bureaucracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade knew she depended too much on her inner sense of administration. A system frequently tested and revised, using automation only where essential. \"The machinery\" they called it. By the time they became Reverend Mothers, all of them had some sensitivity to \"the machinery\" and tended to use it without question thereafter. There lay the danger. Odrade pressed for constant improvements (even tiny ones) to introduce change into their activities. Randomness! No absolute patterns that others could find and use against them. One person might not see such shifts in a lifetime but differences over longer periods were sure to be measurable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade\u0027s party came down to ground level and onto the major thoroughfare of Central. \"The Way,\" Sisters called it. An in-joke, referring to the training regimen popularly known as \"The Bene Gesserit Way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Way reached from the square beside Odrade\u0027s tower to the southern outskirts of the urban area - straight as a lasgun beam, almost twelve klicks of tall buildings and low ones. The low ones all had something in common: they had been built strong enough to expand upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade flagged an open transporter with empty seats and the three of them crowded into a space where they could continue to talk. Frontage on The Way carried an old-fashioned appeal, Odrade thought. Buildings such as these with their tall rectangular windows of insulating plaz had framed Bene Gesserit \"Ways\" through much of the Sisterhood\u0027s history. Down the center ran a line of elms genetically tailored for height and narrow profile. Birds nested in them and the morning was bright with flitting spots of red and orange - orioles, tanagers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it dangerously patterned for us to prefer this familiar setting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade led them off the transporter at Tipsy Trail, thinking how Bene Gesserit humor came out in curious names. Waggish in the streets. Tipsy Trail because the foundation of one building had subsided slightly, giving that structure a curiously drunken appearance. The one member of the group stepping out of line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Mother Superior. Only they don\u0027t know it yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer Ear-C buzzed as they came to Tower Lane. \"Mother Superior?\" It was Streggi. Without stopping, Odrade signaled that she was on-line. \"You asked for a report on Murbella. Suk Central says she is fit for assigned classes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then assign her.\" They continued down Tower Lane: all one-story buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade spared a brief glance for the low buildings on both sides of the street. A two-story addition was being made to one of them. Might be a real Tower Lane here someday and the joke (such as it was) abandoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was argued that naming was just a convenience anyway and they might as well enjoy this venture into what was a delicate subject for the Sisterhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade stopped abruptly on a busy walkway and turned to her companions. \"What would you say if I suggested we name streets and places after departed Sisters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re full of nonsense today!\" Bellonda accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are not departed,\" Tamalane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade resumed her prowling walk. She had expected that. Bell\u0027s thoughts could almost be heard. We carry the \"departed\" around in Other Memory!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade wanted no argument here in the open but she thought her idea had merit. Some Sisters died without Sharing. Major Memory Lines were duplicated but you lost a thread and its terminated carrier. Schwangyu of the Gammu Keep had gone that way, killed by attacking Honored Matres. Plenty of memories remained to carry her good qualities... and complexities. One hesitated to say her mistakes taught more than her successes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda increased her pace to walk beside Odrade in a relatively empty stretch. \"I must speak of Idaho. A Mentat, yes, but those multiple memories. Supremely dangerous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were passing a morgue, the strong smell of antiseptics even in the street. The arched doorway stood open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who died?\" Odrade asked, ignoring Bellonda\u0027s anxiety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Proctor from Section Four and an orchard maintenance man,\" Tamalane said. Tam always knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda was furious at being ignored and made no attempt to hide it. \"Will you two stick to the point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is the point?\" Odrade asked. Very mild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey emerged on the south terrace and stopped at the stone rail to look over the plantations - vineyards and orchards. The morning light had a dusty haze in it not at all like the mists created of moisture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know the point!\" Bell would not be deflected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade stared at the vista, pressing herself against the stones. The railing was frigid. That mist out there was a different color, she thought. Sunlight came through dust with a different reflective spectrum. More bounce and sharpness to the light. Absorbed in a different way. The nimbus was tighter. The blowing dust and sand crept into every crevice the way water did but the grating and rasping betrayed its source. The same with Bell\u0027s persistence. No lubrication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s desert light,\" Odrade said, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop avoiding me,\" Bellonda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade chose not to answer. The dusty light was a classical thing, but not reassuring in the way of the elder painters and their misty mornings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane came up beside Odrade. \"Beautiful in its own way.\" The remote tone said she made Other Memory comparisons similar to Odrade\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that\u0027s how you were conditioned to look for beauty. But something deep within Odrade said this was not the beauty for which she longed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the shallow swales below them, where once there had been greenery, now there was dryness and a sense of the earth being gutted the way ancient Egyptians had prepared their dead - dried to essential matter, preserved for their Eternity. Desert as deathmaster, swaddling the dirt in nitron, embalming our beautiful planet with all of its jewels concealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda stood behind them, muttering and shaking her head, refusing to look at what their planet would become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade almost shuddered in a sudden thrust of simulflow. Memory flooded her: She felt herself searching Sietch Tabr\u0027s ruins, finding desert-embalmed bodies of spice pirates left where killers had dropped them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is Sieteh Tabr now? A molten flow solidified and without anything to mark its proud history. Honored Matres: killers of history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you won\u0027t eliminate Idaho, then I must protest your using him as a Mentat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBell was such a fussy woman! Odrade noted that she was showing her age more than ever. Reading lenses on her nose even now. They magnified her eyes until she had the look of a great-orbed fish. Use of lenses and not one of the more subtle prostheses said something about her. She flaunted a reverse vanity that announced: \"I am greater than the devices my failing senses require. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda was definitely irritated by Mother Superior. \"Why are you staring at me that way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade, caught by abrupt awareness of a weakness in her Council, shifted her attention to Tamalane. Cartilage never stopped growing and this had enlarged Tam\u0027s ears, nose and chin. Some Reverend Mothers adjusted this by metabolism control or sought regular surgical correction. Tam would not bow to such vanity. \"Here\u0027s what I am. Take it or leave it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy advisors are too old. And I... I should be younger and stronger to have these problems on my shoulders. Oh, damn this for a lapse into self-pity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one supreme danger: action against survival of the Sisterhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan is a superb Mentat!\" Odrade spoke with all the force of her position. \"But I use none of you beyond your capabilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda remained silent. She knew a Mentat\u0027s weaknesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMentats! Odrade thought. They were like walking Archives but when you most needed answers they relapsed into questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need another Mentat,\" Odrade said. \"I need an inventor!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bellonda still did not speak, Odrade said: \"I am freeing his mind, not his body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I insist on an analysis before you open all data sources to him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering Bellonda\u0027s usual stance, that was mild. But Odrade did not trust it. She detested those sessions - endless rehashing of Archival reports. Bellonda doted on them. Bellonda of Archival minutiae and boring excursions into irrelevant details! Who cared if Reverend Mother X preferred skimmed milk on her porridge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade turned her back on Bellonda and looked at the southern sky. Dust! We would sift more dust! Bellonda would be flanked by assistants. Odrade felt boredom just imagining it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more analysis.\" Odrade spoke more sharply than she had intended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do have a point of view.\" Bellonda sounded hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoint of view? Are we no more than sensory windows on our universe, each with only a point of view?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstincts and memories of all types... even Archives - none of these things spoke for themselves except by compelling intrusions. None carried weight until formulated in a living consciousness. But whoever produced the formulation tipped the scales. All order is arbitrary! Why this datum rather than some other? Any Reverend Mother knew events occurred in their own flux, their own relative environment. Why couldn\u0027t a Mentat Reverend Mother act from that knowledge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you refuse counsel?\" That was Tamalane. Was she siding with Bell? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-8.html","bookId":2158,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM"}
