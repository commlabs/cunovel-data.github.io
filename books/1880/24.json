This is going to be the problematic area and I\u0027m afraid of her reaction. She may think it\u0027ll be fine but change her mind the moment I touch her. It might make her think of what he tried to do to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m slow and cautious as I inch my hand lower. I hear her breathing increase. I\u0027m apprehensive, unsure if she\u0027s beginning to panic. I decide to not take any chances and my hand retreats. I can\u0027t risk the harm I could cause by continuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches for my wrist as I\u0027m pulling my hand away. \"Please don\u0027t stop. I want you to keep going,\" she says as she pushes it lower. \"I\u0027m not afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she isn\u0027t but I am. I fear she\u0027s pushing herself too hard and too fast because she thinks she needs to prove something. \"You don\u0027t have to do this right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know but I want you to touch me. This is what you and I do, and I need to know that he didn\u0027t ruin the way you feel about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck! This is about me. She\u0027s afraid I won\u0027t want her because of what he did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn her around so I can see her eyes. \"Baby, I love you and there\u0027s nothing anyone could do to change that—especially him or what he did to you. Trust me when I tell you that I could never stop loving you because of something like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rises on tiptoes and kisses me, biting my lower lip and tugging on it with her teeth. \"I need you to show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to trust her word. If she says this is what she needs, then I have to have faith in her. \"Here or your bedroom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bedroom. This shower is too small for everything I want you to do to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns off the water and pulls the curtain. She steps out and stands dripping on the rug as she waits for me. I\u0027m not sure my second foot is on the bath mat before she puts her arms around my shoulders and jumps up to wrap her legs around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, my reflexes are quick and I catch her under her thighs before she lands on her bum on the floor. \"Damn, baby. You could\u0027ve warned me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. I\u0027m just anxious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carry her to the bedroom and the cold air chills both of us. I toss her playfully onto the bed. I slide in beside her and the sheets absorb the water beads on our bodies. \"We\u0027ve just fucked this bed up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet, we haven\u0027t,\" she says as she pulls me on top of her. Our wet bodies slip effortlessly against each other and it\u0027s exhilarating to have her slide against me, skin on skin. She brings her legs up around my waist and squeezes me closer. \"I want you to fuck me like you mean it. Don\u0027t you dare hold back because you think I\u0027m fragile; I\u0027m not and I won\u0027t break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAggressive isn\u0027t a good choice for us right now, even if she thinks it is. \"I know how strong you are.\" I kiss the side of her face where there\u0027s an unpleasant reminder of what that bastard did. \"I don\u0027t need to see you tolerate rough sex to be convinced of that.\" I kiss her forehead just below the laceration. \"Don\u0027t make this about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts her hands on my face and strokes her thumbs over my still-wet cheekbones. \"I love you so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you too.\" And now I want to show her how much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move my lips over hers and she follows my lead for the slow, seductive kiss I want to give her. She slides her fingers up the back of my wet hair and I feel drops of water roll down my neck. Her hands leave my hair and glide over my shoulders and down my back through the moisture unclaimed by the bed linens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelaxed legs replace the tense ones squeezing my waist. She lets them fall apart beneath my weight and I recognize it for what it is—her giving me domain over her body. I take great pleasure knowing she trusts me enough to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move my hand down her body until it\u0027s between her legs and that\u0027s where I cup my hand around her and begin rotating in a circular motion with only the slightest pressure. My mouth is still pressed against hers but neither of us is concentrating on the kiss. I know the task she chooses for me to focus on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gradually apply more pressure and I feel the increase in her breathing against my mouth. She begins to lift her hips in rhythm with my hand\u0027s motion and I close in on her most sensitive area. I know how to top it off quickly for her, but I wait because I want her to enjoy this for a while longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rides my hand harder and I sense her immediate urgency. \"Do you want me to make you come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God, yes,\" she says with panting breath against my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slide two fingers inside her and place my thumb over her erogenous nub. I apply light pressure with a gradual increase as my thumb slides back and forth. \"I\u0027ll always take care of you, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her entire body tense, followed by the internal rhythmic spasms against my fingers. Her legs tense as she arches her back. It never gets old seeing her this way. I\u0027m still amazed by how hard she can come and how beautiful she is when she does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the rush of her orgasm is over, she relaxes and looks up at me hovering above her. \"You\u0027re so good at that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m relieved that she\u0027s handled my intimate touch so well. I\u0027m confident that she is going to be fine with me being inside her, but I still choose to proceed with caution. I press my cock against her slick slit and watch her face for any outward sign of stress. \"You\u0027re okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Please stop being weird about this. That bothers me worse than what actually happened. I don\u0027t want awkwardness between us, so now it\u0027s me telling you to leave him out of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right. I\u0027m the one being weird and it stops here and now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kneel between her legs and grasp her behind her knees to pull her down the bed. I tap her on her hip as I tell her to lift her bum and I push both of the pillows under her hips before I drive deep inside her. She gasps and then smiles up at me. \"That\u0027s more like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I slide in and out of her in this different position, she never once takes her eyes from mine and I covet the deep connection I feel with her. It\u0027s erotic—yet incredibly loving—and is something I\u0027ve never felt with any other woman. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I thrust into her over and over, I lose myself in her caramel-brown eyes, because it\u0027s so easy to do, and I\u0027m able to forget the night\u0027s events. I feel it building and then my favorite part happens when I get to thrust as deep as I can inside of Laurelyn as I call out her name. When I\u0027m finished, I remain inside her because these are the moments I love. I\u0027m able to envision it all when we\u0027re like this—our future as husband and wife with our children. And I always see it happening in Australia. Never here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m afraid that could be a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fall asleep in Jack Henry\u0027s arms. I must\u0027ve been content because I don\u0027t wake once during the night. There\u0027s no way I could\u0027ve done that before we were separated, but something about being apart has caused a change in me. It makes it possible for me to allow him in my space while I\u0027m sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I open my eyes, he\u0027s already awake. No shocker there. \"Hey, you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses the top of my head. \"Good mornin\u0027, love. Sleep well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, yes. \"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls me in for a hug. \"See? It\u0027s not so bad having me close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never thought it was bad,\" I explain. \"I just wasn\u0027t used to it. I endured last night just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoots away from me. \"Endured? Hell, don\u0027t do me any favors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I\u0027m wearing off on him because that\u0027s one of my lines. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I laugh. \"Endure is a poor word choice. That\u0027s not what I meant at all.\" He lies back down beside me. \"I just meant that I didn\u0027t wake up once, so I was obviously content with having you in my space. Our space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our space sounds much better than your space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach growls and I remember there are no groceries in the apartment since I\u0027ve been away for weeks. \"There\u0027s nothing here to eat. I doubt I even have enough to scrounge up something for breakfast, so I\u0027ll have to make a grocery run this morning. And you\u0027re going with me.\" I point to my nightstand. \"Open that top drawer and pass me a pad and pen so I can start a grocery list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretches over to open the drawer and the sheet pulls back just enough for me to catch a view of his sculpted ass. I pull the sheet back a little more for a better view and run my hand over it. I can\u0027t resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs as he digs around in the drawer. \"Hmm…what do we have here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t care what\u0027s caught his attention because I\u0027m enjoying the view way too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he rolls back, he\u0027s holding the purple vibrator in one hand and the Bullet in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, shit. I totally forgot about those being in that drawer. I cover my blushing face with both hands. \"A gentleman would have pretended he didn\u0027t see those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we\u0027ve established that I\u0027m only a gentleman in public—not in the bedroom. But I must tell you that it makes me feel pretty damn spectacular to know that you needed two of these battery-operated boys to replace what I did for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if that\u0027s even possible. \"You\u0027d be mistaken if you think any number of those things could ever replace what you do for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t have to replace. They can…enhance,\" he suggests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need enhancing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s twirling the Bullet around in his hand. \"Well, maybe we should try them out and see. You might like the kind of enhancing I do with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no doubt I\u0027d like anything he does to me while using them. \"Now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless the grocery store is going somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart-ass.\" Of course, he means now. I don\u0027t know why I\u0027d think otherwise. He\u0027s a morning man. And a night man. And an everything-in-between man. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves down in the bed. \"Close your eyes and don\u0027t open them. I want you to lie still and completely concentrate on the sensations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach for my pillow and put it over my face because I know me. \"I\u0027ll be too tempted to look.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-24.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
