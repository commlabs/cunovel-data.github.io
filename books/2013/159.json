What I’m supposed to be like.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You once told me you did not compel, you did not bind. You bargained.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, that. Well, yes, given the choice. Seems that being in your company crushes under heel the privilege of choice, Toblakai.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You blame me for your greed?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not greed. More like an overwhelming need for power.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e,’To oppose me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You? No, I don’t think so. To stay alive, I think. You are dangerous, Karsa Orlong. Your will, your strength, your… disregard. You present the quaint and appalling argument that through wilful ignorance of the laws and rules of the universe you cannot suffer their influence. As you might imagine, your very success poses evidence of that tenet, and it is one I cannot reconcile, since it runs contrary to a lifetime of observation.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Too many words again, Samar Dev. State it plain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fine,’ she snapped. ‘Everything about you terrifies me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. ‘And fascinates as well.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Arrogant bastard. Believe what you like!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to the doorway. Collecting his sword, he said over one shoulder, ‘The Seguleh has unsheathed her swords for me, witch.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamar Dev remained on her cot for another dozen heartbeats, then, ‘Damn him!’ And she rose, hurrying to arrive before the bout began. Damn him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun had crawled far enough to one side of the sky to leave the compound in shadow. As she emerged from the covered colonnade Samar Dev saw the Seguleh standing in the middle of the exercise area, a thin-bladed longsword in each gloved hand. Her dark hair hung in greasy strands down her shoulders, and through the eye-holes of the mask her midnight gaze tracked Karsa Orlong as he strode to join her in the sand-floored clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA full score of champions looked on, indicating that word had travelled, and Samar Dev saw-with shock-the Gral, Taralack Veed, and, behind him, Icarium. Gods below, the name, the Jhag… all that I know, all that 1 have heard. Icarium is here. A champion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe will leave this city a heap of rubble. He will leave its citizens a mountain of shattered bones. Gods, look at him! Standing calm, so deep in shadow as to be almost invisible-Karsa does not see him, no. The Toblakai’s focus rests on the Seguleh, as he circles her at a distance. And she moves like a cat to ever face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, she is a fighter all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Karsa will throw her over the damned wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she dares close. As she must. Get inside that huge flint sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the wall. Or through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart pounded, the beat rapid, disturbingly erratic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sensed someone at her side and saw, with a jolt of alarm, a Tiste Edur-and she then recognized him. Preda… Tomad. Tomad Sengar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor’s father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKarsa, you don’t want this audience-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn explosion of motion as the two contestants closed-afterwards, none could agree on who moved first, as if some instinctive agreement was reached between the Seguleh and Karsa, and acted upon faster than thought itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, as iron rang on stone-or stone on iron-Karsa Orlong did something unexpected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePounded down with one foot. Hard onto the packed sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of the Seguleh’s lithe dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePounded down, hard enough to stagger onlookers as the entire compound floor thundered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seguleh’s perfect balance… vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt it was but a fraction, the dislodging so minor few would even register it, and no doubt her recovery was as instantaneous-but she was already reeling back to a savage blow with the flat of Karsa’s blade, both wrists broken by the impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, as she toppled, she twisted, one foot lashing upward towards the Toblakai’s crotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her kick with one hand, blocking the blow, then boldly lifted her into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung the other foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Toblakai, laughing, released his sword and snagged that leg as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd held her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDangling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Taralack Veed, there was a soft sigh, and the Gral, blinking, turned round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium smiled. Then said in a low voice, ‘We have met, I think. He and I. Perhaps long ago. A duel that was interrupted.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Mappo. Has to be. Mappo, who saw a storm coming between these two. Oh, Trell…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack licked dry lips. ‘Would you resume that duel, Icarium?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jhag’s brows lifted fractionally. Then he shook his head, leaving that as his answer. Thank the spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Preda Tomad Sengar, a grunt. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-159.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
