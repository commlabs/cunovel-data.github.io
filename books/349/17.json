JIM SMITH’S REVENGE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;It would be natural to suppose that Jim Smith, relying upon his influence with his uncle, would have reported this last “outrage,” as he chose to consider it, to the principal, thus securing the punishment of Hector. But he was crafty, and considered that no punishment Hector was likely to receive would satisfy him. Corporal punishment for taking the part of an ill-used boy, Hector was probably too spirited to submit to, and, under these circumstances, it would hardly have been inflicted. Besides, Jim was aware that the offense for which Hector had attacked him was not likely, if made known, to secure sympathy. Even his uncle would be against him, for he was fond of money, and had no wish to lose the new pupil, whose friends were well able to pay for him. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No! He decided that what he wanted was to bring Hector into disgrace. The method did not immediately occur to him, but after a while he saw his way clear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His uncle’s bedchamber was on the second floor, and Jim’s directly over it on the third story. Some of the other boys, including Hector, had rooms also on the third floor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jim was going upstairs one day when, through the door of his uncle’s chamber, which chanced to be open, he saw a wallet lying on the bureau. On the impulse of the moment, he walked in on tiptoes, secured the wallet, and slipped it hurriedly into his pocket. Then he made all haste upstairs, and bolted himself into his own room. Two other boys slept there, but both were downstairs in the playground.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jim took the wallet from his pocket and eagerly scanned the contents. There were eight five-dollar bills and ten dollars in small bills, besides a few papers, which may be accurately described as of no value to anyone but the owner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The boy’s face assumed a covetous look. He, as well as his uncle, was fond of money—a taste which, unfortunately, as he regarded it, he was unable to gratify. His family was poor, and he was received at half price by Socrates Smith on the score of relationship, but his allowance of pocket money was less than that of many of the small boys. He made up the deficiency, in part, by compelling them to contribute to his pleasures. If any boy purchased candy, or any other delicacy, Jim, if he learned the fact, required him to give him a portion, just as the feudal lords exacted tribute from their serfs and dependents. Still, this was not wholly satisfactory, and Jim longed, instead, for a supply of money to spend as he chose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the thought came to him, as he scanned the contents of the wallet: “Why shouldn’t I take out one or two of these bills before disposing of it? No one will lay it to me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The temptation proved too strong for Jim’s power of resistance. He selected a five-dollar bill and five dollars in small bills, and reluctantly replaced the rest of the money in the wallet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So far, so good!” he thought. “That’s a good idea.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then, unlocking the door, he passed along the entry till he came to the room occupied by Hector. As he or one of the two boys who roomed with him might be in the room, he looked first through the keyhole.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The coast is clear!” he said to himself, in a tone of satisfaction.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Still, he opened the door cautiously, and stepped with catlike tread into the room. Then he looked about the room. Hanging on nails were several garments belonging to the inmates of the room. Jim selected a pair of pants which he knew belonged to Hector, and hurrying forward, thrust the wallet into one of the side pockets. Then, with a look of satisfaction, he left the room, shutting the door carefully behind him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There,” he said to himself, with exultation. “That’ll fix him! Perhaps he’ll wish he hadn’t put on quite so many airs.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was rather annoyed, as he walked along the corridor, back to his own room, to encounter Wilkins. He had artfully chosen a time when he thought all the boys would be out, and he heartily wished that some untoward chance had not brought Wilkins in.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where are you going, Jim?” asked Wilkins.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I went to Bates’ room, thinking he might be in, but he wasn’t.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you want him? I left him out on the playground.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, it’s no matter! It’ll keep!” said Jim, indifferently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I got out of that pretty well!” he reflected complacently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Perhaps Jim Smith would not have felt quite so complacent, if he had known that at the time he entered Hector’s room it was occupied, though he could not see the occupant. It so chanced that Ben Platt, one of Hector’s roommates, was in the closet, concealed from the view of anyone entering the room, yet so placed that he could see through the partially open door what wras passing in the room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he saw Jim Smith enter he was surprised, for he knew that that young man was not on visiting terms with the boy who had discomfited and humiliated him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What on earth can Jim want?” he asked himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He did not have long to wait for an answer though not a real one; but actions, as men have often heard, speak louder than words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he saw Jim steal up to Hector’s pants, and producing a wallet, hastily thrust it into one of the pockets, he could hardly believe the testimony of his eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well!” he ejaculated, inwardly, “I would not have believed it if I hadn’t seen it. I knew Jim was a bully and a tyrant, but I didn’t think he was as contemptible as all that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The wallet he recognized at once, for he had more than once seen Socrates take it out of his pocket.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It’s old Sock’s wallet!” he said to himself. “It’s clear that Jim has taken it, and means to have it found in Roscoe’s possession. That’s as mean a trick as I ever heard of.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then Wilkins entered the room. Wilkins and Ben Platt were Hector’s two roommates.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hello, Wilkins! I’m glad you’ve come just as you have.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What for, Platt? Do you want to borrow some money?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; there is more money in this room now than there has been for a long time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What do you mean? The governor hasn’t sent you a remittance, has he?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Expound your meaning, then, most learned and mysterious chum.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will. Within five minutes Jim Smith has been here and left a wallet of money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Jim been here? I met him in the corridor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I warrant he didn’t say he had been here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; he said he had been to Bates’ room, but didn’t find him there.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That’s all gammon! Wilkins, what will you say when I tell you that old Sock’s wallet is in this very room!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I won’t believe it!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Look here, then!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he spoke, Ben went to Hector’s pants and drew out the wallet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wilkins started in surprise and dismay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How did Roscoe come by that?” he asked; “surely he didn’t take it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course he didn’t. You might know Roscoe better. Didn’t you hear me say just now that Jim brought it here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And put it in Roscoe’s pocket?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In your presence?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; only he didn’t know that I was present,” said Platt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where were you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In the closet. The door was partly open, and I saw everything.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What does it all mean?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can’t you see? It’s Jim’s way of coming up with Roscoe. You know he threatened that he’d fix him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All I can say is, that it’s a very mean way,” said Wilkins in disgust.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was not a model boy—far from it, indeed!—but he had a sentiment of honor that made him dislike and denounce a conspiracy like this.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It’s a dirty trick,” he said, warmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I agree with you on that point.” “What shall we do about it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Lay low, and wait till the whole thing comes out. When Sock discovers his loss, Jim will be on hand to tell him where his wallet is. Then we can up and tell all we know.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good! There’s a jolly row coming!” said Wilkins, smacking his lips.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2974/81933.html","bookId":349,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:20:33 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:20:33 AM"}
