(i see a few more boys shifting in their seats, so i’m probably not the only ex in the audience.) we make it through the first seventeen exes, and then there’s a blackout and the swing set is moved to the center of the stage. suddenly, tiny’s in the spotlight, on the swing, and it’s like my life has rewound and is playing back to me, only in musical form. it’s exactly as i remember it . . . until it’s not, and tiny’s inventing this new dialogue for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme-on-stage: i’m really sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etiny: don’t be. i fell for you. i know what happens at the end of falling - landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme-on-stage: i just get so pissed off at myself. i’m the worst thing in the world for you. i’m your pinless hand grenade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etiny: i like my pinless hand grenade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s funny - i wonder if i’d said that, and if he’d said that, then maybe things would have played out differently. because i would have known that he understood, at least a little. but i guess he needed to be writing it as a musical to see it. or say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme-on-stage: well, i don’t like being your pinless hand grenade. or anybody’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut the weird thing is, for once i feel the pin is in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etiny’s looking out into the audience right now. there’s no way for him to know i’m here. but maybe he’s looking for me anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etiny: i just want you to be happy. if that’s with me or with someone else or with nobody. i just want you to be happy. i just want you to be okay with life. with life as it is. and me, too. it is so hard to accept that life is falling. falling and landing and falling and landing. i agree it’s not ideal. i agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe’s talking to me. he’s talking to himself. maybe there’s no difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get it. i understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then he loses me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etiny: but there is the word, this word phil wrayson taught me once: weltschmerz. it’s the depression you feel when the world as it is does not line up with the world as you think it should be. i live in a big goddamned weltzschermz ocean, you know? and so do you. and so does everyone. because everyone thinks it should be possible just to keep falling and falling forever, to feel the rush of the air on your face as you fall, that air pulling your face into a brilliant goddamned smile. and that should be possible. you should be able to fall forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand i think: no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseriously. no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause i have spent my life falling. not the kind that tiny’s talking about. he’s talking about love. i’m talking about life. in my kind of falling, there’s no landing. there’s only hitting the ground. hard. dead, or wanting to be dead. so the whole time you’re falling, it’s the worst feeling in the world. because you feel you have no control over it. because you know how it ends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to fall. all i want to do is stand on solid ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand the weird thing is, i feel like i’m doing that now. because i am trying to do something good. in the same way that tiny is trying to do something good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etiny: you’re still a pinless grenade over the world not being perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eno, i am a pinless grenade over the world being cruel. but every time i’m proven wrong, that pin goes in a little more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etiny: and i’m still - every time this happens to me, everytime i land, it still hurts like it has never happened before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe’s swinging higher now, kicking his legs hard, the swing set groaning. it looks like he’s going to bring the whole contraption down, but he just keeps pumping his legs and pulling against the chain with his arms and talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etiny: because we can’t stop the weltschmerz. we can’t stop imagining the world as it might be. which is awesome!
