I’d thought I…dreamed that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee cringed. “No, that was real. He got me when he brought you back. I was the one to place you in dry clothes, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “I was hoping that was you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although he did volunteer for the job,” she said, her eyes rolling. “Daemon is so helpful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That he is. Where…where is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “No clue.” Her eyes narrowed. “Why do you keep itching your arm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” I stopped, not even realizing I was doing that. “Oh, they took my blood in the hospital to make sure I didn’t have rabies or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, she tugged up my sleeve. “I have some stuff that you can put—holy crap, Katy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I glanced down at my arm and sucked in a breath. “Yuck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy entire inner elbow looked like a fleshy strawberry. All that was missing was a leafy green cap. The raised splotches of red skin were speckled with darker dots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee ran a finger over it. “Does it hurt?” I shook my head. It just itched like crazy. She dropped my hand. “All you did was get your blood taken?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said, staring at my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s really weird, Katy. It’s like you had some kind of reaction to something. Let me get some aloe. That might help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” I frowned at my arm. What could’ve done this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee returned with a jar of the cool gunk. It helped with the itching, and after I tugged my sleeve back down, she seemed to forget about it. I hung out with her for the next couple of hours, watching her destroy one pot after another. I laughed so hard my stomach hurt when Dee leaned too close to a bowl she was heating and accidentally set her shirt on fire. She’d raised one brow at my larger chest as if to say she’d like to have seen me avoid the same mistake, sending me into another fit of giggles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she ran out of chocolate and plastic spatulas, Dee finally admitted defeat. It was after ten, and I said good-bye as I headed home to get some rest. It had been a long first day back at school, but I was glad I’d headed over and ended it hanging with Dee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon was crossing the road just as I shut the front door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn less than a second, he was on the top step. “Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” I avoided his extraordinary eyes and face, because, well, I was having a real hard time not recalling what his mouth had felt like on mine earlier. “Where, um, so what have you been doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patrolling.” He stepped onto the porch, and even though I was busy staring at the crack in the wood floor, I could feel his gaze on my face and the heat from his body. He stood close, too close. “Everything is all quiet on the western front.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cracked a smile. “Nice reference.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he spoke, his breath teased the loose hair around my temple. “It’s my favorite book, actually.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head jerked toward his, narrowly missing a collision. I hid my surprise. “I didn’t know you knew how to read the classics.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lazy smirk appeared, and I’d swear he managed to get closer. Our legs touched. His shoulder brushed my arm. “Well, I usually prefer books with pictures and small sentences, but sometimes I step out of the box.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to help it, I laughed. “Let me guess, your favorite kind of picture book is the one you can color in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never stay in the lines.” Daemon winked. Only he could pull that off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not.” I looked away, swallowing. Sometimes it was too easy to fall into the easy banter with him, too damn easy to imagine doing this with him every night. Teasing. Laughing. Getting in way over my head. “I’ve got…to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung around. “I’ll walk you home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, I live right there.” Not like he didn’t know that. Duh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat lazy smirk spread. “Hey, I’m being a gentleman.” He offered his arm. “May I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing under my breath, I shook my head. But I gave him my arm. The next thing I knew, he scooped me up into his arms. My heart leaped into my throat. “Daemon—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I tell you I carried you all the way back to the house the night you were sick? Thought that was a dream, eh? Nope. Real.” He went down one step as I stared wide-eyed at him. “Twice in one week. We’re making this a habit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he shot off the porch, the roar of the wind drowning out my surprised squeal. The next second, he was standing in front of my door, grinning down at me. “I was faster the last time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really,” I said slowly, dumbfounded. My cheeks felt numb. “You…going to put me down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm.” Our eyes met. There was a tender look in his that warmed and frightened me. “Been thinking about our bet? Wanna give in now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he totally ruined that tender moment. “Put me down, Daemon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed me on my feet, but his arms were still around me, and I had no idea what to say. “I’ve been thinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, God…” I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips twitched. “This bet really isn’t fair to you. New Year’s Day? Hell, I’ll have you admitting your undying devotion to me by Thanksgiving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “I’m sure I’ll hold out until Halloween.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s already passed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly,” I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing under his breath, he reached forward, tucking a strand of hair behind my ear. The back of his knuckles brushed my cheek and I pressed my lips together to stop a sigh. Warmth blossomed in my chest, having nothing to do with the simple touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had everything to do with the ache in his gaze. Then he pivoted around, tipping his head back. Moments passed in silence. “The stars… They’re beautiful tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed his gaze, a little thrown off by his sudden change in topic. The sky was dark, but there were a hundred or so bright dots glimmering against the inky night. “Yeah, they are.” I bit my lip. “Do they remind you of your home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. “I wish they did. Memories, even bittersweet ones, are better than nothing, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knot formed in my throat. Why had I asked him that? I knew he didn’t remember anything about his planet. I tucked my hair back again and stood beside him, squinting at the sky. “The Elders—do they remember anything about Lux?” He nodded. “Have you ever asked them to tell you about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to respond, then laughed. “It is that simple, right? But I try to avoid the colony as much as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstandable, but I wasn’t entirely sure why. Daemon and Dee rarely talked about the Luxen that remained in the colony hidden deep within the forest surrounding Seneca Rocks. “What about Mr. Garrison?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Matthew?” He shook his head. “He won’t talk about it. I think it’s too hard on him—the war and losing his family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTearing my gaze away from the stars, I looked up at Daemon. His profile was harsh and haunted. Christ, they’d had a tough life. All of the Luxen. War had turned them into refugees. Earth was practically a hostile planet to them, considering how they had to live. Daemon and Dee couldn’t remember their parents and had lost their brother. Mr. Garrison had lost everything and God only knew how many of them shared the same tragedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knot was growing bigger in my throat. “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s head swung toward me sharply. “Why would you apologize?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I’m just sorry for everything…you guys have had to go through.” And I meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held my gaze for a beat and then looked away, laughing under his breath. There was no humor in the sound, and I wondered if I’d said something wrong. Probably. “Keep talking like that, Kitten, and I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon backed off my porch, his smile secretive. “I’ve decided to go easy on you. I’ll keep New Year’s Day as the deadline.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to respond, but he was gone before I could, moving too fast for my eyes to track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlacing my hand against my chest, I stood there and tried to make heads of what just happened. For a moment, a crazy moment, there had been something infinitely more than mad animal lust between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it scared me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went inside and eventually was able to push Daemon to the back of my mind. Grabbing my cell, I went from room to room until I got a signal and called Mom, leaving her a message. When she called back, I told her about my arm. She said I probably bumped it on something, even though it didn’t hurt and it wasn’t bruised, either. She promised to bring me home a salve, and I felt better just hearing her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on my bed, trying to forget about all the weird stuff and focus on my history homework. There was an exam on Monday. Studying on a Friday was the height of lameness, but it was either that or I fail. And I refused to fail. History was one of my favorite subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours later, I felt the weird warmth that was becoming increasingly familiar creep across my neck. Closing the textbook, I hopped off the bed and crept toward the window. The full moon lit everything in a pale, silvery glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged up the sleeve of my shirt. The skin was still patchy and red. Did being sick have anything to do with the locker, the glass of tea and the connection to Daemon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze moved back to the window, drifting over the ground below. I didn’t see anyone. A yearning sparked in my chest. I pulled the curtain back farther and pressed my forehead against the cool glass. I couldn’t understand or explain how I knew, but I did. Somewhere, hidden in the shadows, was Daemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd every part of my being wanted—needed—to go to him. The ache that had been in his eyes… It was so much, going beyond him and me. More than what I undoubtedly could wrap my head around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenying that desire was one of the hardest things I’d ever done, but I let the curtain slip free and went back to my bed. As I opened my history text again, I focused on my chapter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Year’s Day? Wasn’t going to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was having one of those days where I wanted to start throwing things because only breaking crap would make me feel better. My limit for acceptable weirdness in my daily life had been maxed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday, the shower turned on before I even got in it. Sunday night, my bedroom door opened as I walked toward it, smacking me right in the face. And this morning, to top it all off, I’d overslept and missed my first two classes, plus my entire closet emptied itself onto my floor as I debated what to wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither I was turning into an alien, about to have one crawl its way out of my stomach, or I was crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only good thing about today was that I’d woken up without that itchy rash on my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole way to school, I debated what to do. These things couldn’t be brushed aside as a coincidence any longer, and I needed to get over myself and confront them. My new outlook on not being a bystander in life meant I had to face the fact that I’d really changed. And I needed to do something about it before I exposed everyone. Just thinking about that possibility left a bitter taste in my mouth. There was no way I could go to Dee, because I’d promised Daemon not to tell anyone that he’d healed me. I had no other option but to saddle him with another one of my problems. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-6.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
