He takes no rest that night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving all possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, and Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call a council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies\u0027 camp, to learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed undertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for his companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had sent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are informed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and particularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were lately arrived. They pass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of his officers, and seize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in triumph to the camp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.\n\u003cbr\u003e All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,\n\u003cbr\u003e And lost in sleep the labours of the day:\n\u003cbr\u003e All but the king: with various thoughts oppress\u0027d,215\n\u003cbr\u003e His country\u0027s cares lay rolling in his breast.\n\u003cbr\u003e As when by lightnings Jove\u0027s ethereal power\n\u003cbr\u003e Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,\n\u003cbr\u003e Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,\n\u003cbr\u003e Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;\n\u003cbr\u003e By fits one flash succeeds as one expires,\n\u003cbr\u003e And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:\n\u003cbr\u003e So bursting frequent from Atrides\u0027 breast,\n\u003cbr\u003e Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess\u0027d.\n\u003cbr\u003e Now o\u0027er the fields, dejected, he surveys\n\u003cbr\u003e From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;\n\u003cbr\u003e Hears in the passing wind their music blow,\n\u003cbr\u003e And marks distinct the voices of the foe.\n\u003cbr\u003e [pg 181]\n\u003cbr\u003e Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,\n\u003cbr\u003e Anxious he sorrows for the

Divide his heart, and wage a double war.\n\u003cbr\u003e A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;\n\u003cbr\u003e To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,\n\u003cbr\u003e With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate\n\u003cbr\u003e What yet remains to save the afflicted state.\n\u003cbr\u003e He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,\n\u003cbr\u003e Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;\n\u003cbr\u003e A lion\u0027s yellow spoils his back conceal\u0027d;\n\u003cbr\u003e His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.\n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile his brother, press\u0027d with equal woes,\n\u003cbr\u003e Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,\n\u003cbr\u003e Laments for Greece, that in his cause before\n\u003cbr\u003e So much had suffer\u0027d and must suffer more.\n\u003cbr\u003e A leopard\u0027s spotted hide his shoulders spread:\n\u003cbr\u003e A brazen helmet glitter\u0027d on his head:\n\u003cbr\u003e Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went\n\u003cbr\u003e To wake Atrides in the royal tent.\n\u003cbr\u003e Already waked, Atrides he descried,\n\u003cbr\u003e His armour buckling at his vessel\u0027s side.\n\u003cbr\u003e Joyful they
