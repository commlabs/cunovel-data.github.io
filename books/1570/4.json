Mr. Dalton wasn\u0027t going to give it to him but then changed his mind. He cut off the address at the bottom before handing it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, the four of us me, Steve, Alan Morris, and Tommy Jones met outside and studied the glossy flyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s got to be a fake,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Alan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t allow freak shows anymore,\" I told him. \"Wolf-men and snake-boys were outlawed years ago. Mr. Dalton said so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a fake,\" Alan insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get it?\" Tommy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I stole it,\" Alan said softly. \"It belongs to my big brother.\" Alan\u0027s big brother was Tony Morris, who used to be the school\u0027s biggest bully until he got thrown out. He\u0027s huge and mean and ugly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stole from Tony?!?\" I gasped. \"Have you got a death wish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t know it was me,\" Alan said. \"He had it in a pair of pants that my mother threw in the washing machine. I stuck a blank piece of paper in when I took this out. He\u0027ll think the ink got washed off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart,\" Steve said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did Tony get it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a guy passing them out in an alley,\" Alan said. \"One of the circus performers, a Mr. Crepsley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one with the spider?\" Tommy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Alan answered, \"only he didn\u0027t have the spider with him. It was night and Tony was on his way back from a bar.\" Tony\u0027s not old enough to get served in bars, but hangs around with older guys who buy drinks for him. \"Mr. Crepsley handed the paper to Tony and told him they\u0027re a traveling freak show who put on secret performances in towns and cities across the world. He said you had to have a flyer to buy tickets and they only give them to people they trust. You\u0027re not supposed to tell anyone else about the show. I only found out because Tony was in high spirits the way he gets when he drinks and couldn\u0027t keep his mouth shut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much are the tickets?\" Steve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-three dollars each,\" Alan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-three dollars!\" we all shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s going to pay twenty-three bucks to see a bunch of freaks!\" Steve snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too,\" Tommy agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And me,\" Alan added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Steve said, \"but we don\u0027t have twenty-three bucks to throw away. So it\u0027s academic, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does academic mean?\" Alan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means we can\u0027t afford the tickets, so it doesn\u0027t matter if we would buy them or not,\" Steve explained. \"It\u0027s easy to say you would buy something if you know you can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to go,\" Tommy said sadly. \"It sounds great.\" He studied the picture again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Dalton didn\u0027t think too much of it,\" Alan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I mean,\" Tommy said. \"If Dalton doesn\u0027t like it, it must be super. Anything that adults hate is normally awesome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we sure we don\u0027t have enough?\" I asked. \"Maybe they have discounts for children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think children are allowed in,\" Alan said, but he told me how much he had anyway. \"Eight-fifty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got eighteen dollars exactly,\" Steve said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have ten dollars and forty cents,\" Tommy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I have twelve dollars and thirty cents,\" I told them. \"That\u0027s more than forty-nine dollars in all,\" I said, adding it up in my head. \"We get our allowance tomorrow. If we pool our...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the tickets are nearly sold out,\" Alan interrupted. \"The first show was yesterday. It finishes Tuesday. If we go, it\u0027ll have to be tomorrow night or Saturday, because our parents won\u0027t let us out any other night. The guy who gave Tony the flyer said the tickets for both those nights were almost gone. We\u0027d have to buy them tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, so much for that,\" I said, putting on a brave face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not,\" Steve said. \"My mom keeps a wad of money in a jar at home. I could borrow some and put it back when we get our allowance...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean steal?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean borrow,\" he snapped. \"It\u0027s only stealing if you don\u0027t put it back. What do you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would we get the tickets?\" Tommy asked. \"It\u0027s a school night. We wouldn\u0027t be let out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can sneak out,\" Steve said. \"I\u0027ll buy them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Mr. Dalton snipped off the address,\" I reminded him. \"How will you know where to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I memorized it.\" He grinned. \"Now, are we gonna stand here all night making up excuses, or are we gonna go for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at each other, then one by one nodded silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Steve said. \"We hurry home, grab our money, and meet back here. Tell your parents you forgot a book or something. We\u0027ll lump the money together and I\u0027ll add the rest from the pot at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if you can\u0027t steal I mean, \u0027borrow, the money?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Then the deal\u0027s off. But we won\u0027t know unless we try. Now hurry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, he sprinted away. Moments later, making up our minds, Tommy, Alan, and I ran, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-4.html","bookId":1570,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:54 PM"}
