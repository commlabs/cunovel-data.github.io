Things like these were hardly noticeably at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue slowly raised his head. Mingyue Xin saw that he was smiling, smiling in an odd way but yet very sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the blue, he seemed to be lashed by an invisible whip and he instantly turned around and stepped back into the compartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin that moment, Mingyue Xin had seen not only the dread and pain on his face but could also felt the unbearable sorrow buried deep in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories that had flowed away like running water and persons that had been blown away by the wind. Why had they resurfaced in his eyes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t stop herself and lightly touched her own face. That clay Buddha mask was jerked down when she shot out of the compartment, she let him see her face again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly despised herself a little, hated herself for resembling that woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, she hated that woman even more for causing others such deep pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy must humans hurt each other? The deeper the love, the greater the hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingertip lightly caressed her eye, only then she realised that her eyes were already moist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is she crying for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it for ignorance of Man? Or for this lonely stranger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe quietly dried her eyes and stepped back into the compartment, her face was once again covered by the always smiling Buddha mask. In her heart she only wished that she could be the same as this stout and carefree Bodhisattva and forget all the pain and sufferings in the world. Even if it was just for a single moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, men are not gods. Even the Bodhisattvas no doubt have their own moments of pain. Their smile is perhaps only to deliberately hide that pain for the benefit of Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe comforted her heart with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue\u0027s pale face was still twitching in convulsion. She barely suppressed the sharp pain in heart, \"You certainly recognise the person just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe certainly recognised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin added, \"But you never take any notice of him because he is genuinely too ordinary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs ordinary as a bubble in the ocean, a seed in the grain bin. Nobody would give him a second look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when you were drowning with seawater in your mouth, would you discover that the bubble had turned a black finger stabbing in through the mouth into your heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin exhaled, \"That is why I always considered this kind of people as the most fearsome of all. If he had not shown himself, you might never notice him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue acknowledged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why did he deliberately blow his own cover just now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin explained. \"He did so to check us out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThumb must have noticed someone spying from the carriage across the street so he purposely spat on his trouser leg. While pretending to clean up, he must had secretly informed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then deliberately threw himself in front of the horse. For he knew, only by doing so, he could lure out the persons from inside the compartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin lamented, \"We had not yet checked them out but they had already known all about us. Within two hours, they would know where Yan Nanfei is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue immediately asked, \"Blackhand had a grudge with Yan Nanfei?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingxue Xin replied, \"No, they never kill for reasons such as personal grudges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue, \"Then they kill for what sort of reasons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingxue Xin said, \"Only orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn orders, they would kill, no matter whom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, \"Where do they take orders from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, \"They only take orders from one man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue, \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin, \"Gongzi Yu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue tightened his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin, \"By themselves, the five Fingers of Blackhand certainly would not have the power to establish such an organisation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir organisation had gained control of almost all the top killers and assassins. Double Killers of Five Elements and Ghostly Granny were no doubt also members of this organisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFigures such as them would demand a high price for any single operation, to totally control them was thus not a simple task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin continued, \"In the whole wide world, only one person alone have that sort of power\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue guessed, \"Gongzi Yu?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin stated, \"Only him alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at the hand on his sabre, the orbs of his eyes contracting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin was also silent for a long while before softly, \"Stop killing with killing, you should have killed that man just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue laughed coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, \"I know that you never draw your sabre easily, but he is already worthy of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue mused, \"You suppose he is the Nameless Finger himself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin slowly nodded, \"I even suspect him to be the Peacock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue, \"Peacock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin, \"Peacock is a kind of bird, a beautiful bird especially its plume...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue quipped, \"But the Peacock you are referring is not a bird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingxue Xin admitted, \"I was referring not to a bird but a person. A very fearsome person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orbs of her eyes also contracted and slowly she continued, \"I even feel that he is the most fearsome person under the heavens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, \"Why is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he has the Peacock Plume!\" Mingyue Xin exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeacock Plume!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she said these words, her eyes momentarily shone with awe and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Fu Hongxue\u0027s face changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plume of a peacock is just like the antlers of the antelope, not only precious but beautiful as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the peacock plume they were referring to was not the tail feathers of a peacock but a hidden projectile!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mystical, yet beautiful hidden projectile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fearsome hidden projectile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody could describe its beauty, nobody could also evade it, withstand it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment of its release, the mystical splendid and beauty was not only completely dizzying but also capable of momentarily banishing the fear of death! It was said that all the victims of this hidden projectile died with a mysterious and peculiar smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, there were many people who were happy to die under this hidden projectile in same way as those who knew perfectly well that the wild rose has thorns, and yet still reached out to pluck it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause this kind of splendid beauty wasn\u0027t something that mere mortals could refuse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, of course know about the Peacock Plume!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what you certainly don\u0027t know is: Peacock Plume is no longer in the Peacock Manor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue had always been a man who wasn\u0027t easily flustered, but on hearing this, he was totally flabbergasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe not only knew about Peacock Plume, but had also visited Peacock Manor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time, he felt like a pilgrim upon reaching the holy land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then early autumn, autumn night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never before seen such an extraordinary beautiful and stately place. The night scenery of Peacock Manor was near that of the mystical Imperial Palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were altogether nine large estates. The majority were built 330 years ago and experienced generations of change before achieving their present grandeur and scale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis host was the younger brother of the Master of Peacock Manor, Qiu Shuiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Shuiqing was a man that was very conservative in speech.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was this place was more than plain grandeur, it was simply miraculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was indeed miraculous. After being invaded countless times by war and plunder, the place still retained its tranquil peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the rear court, just in front of the gate, on the decorative wall facing the hall, thirteen coloured lanterns stood hanging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir magnificent light illuminated the huge painting on that wall. -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were around a dozen of ferociously savage ruffians, each armed with a different kind of weapon. But their eyes were all cowering with awe and fear. All in fear of a golden sphere, in the hands of a pale scholar. A golden sphere radiating with rainbow-like rays. The radiance more gloriously beautiful than any rainbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was an event long passed. At that time, the 36 Death Stars of the underworld allied together and jointly attacked in order to destroy this place. With the combined strength of all 36, it was said that they were all but invincible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not one of the 36 returned with their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From that day on, nobody in the martial world would dare to lightly violate the peace of Peacock Manor and the name, Peacock Plume spread all across the world!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven till this moment, Qiu Shuiqing\u0027s words at that time were still ringing in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever in his dreams, would he believe that Peacock Plume was now no longer in Peacock Manor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The secret ...\" Mingyue Xin declared. \"The secret was something that no one in the martial world had known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head of the 13th generation of Qiu family had lost the Peacock Plume at the summit of Mount Tai!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This secret was now only starting to be known because the Peacock Plume had suddenly reappeared in the martial world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly appeared twice, only claimed two victims!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth victims were certainly well known and highly skilled, the killer was however not from Peacock Manor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as the Peacock Plume existed, nobody in the martial world dared to violate Peacock Manor.

Although he just stood there quietly, he was by far sharper than a sabre out of its sheath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat callous icy stare made his heart skip. His heart was still beating crazily when he reached his own house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fast beating of his heart was however not entirely out of fear and dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was excited!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he really wanted to test it out, wanted to test if the Peacock Plume could kill this person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sadly he lacked exactly that kind of courage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA very simple house, only with a bed, a chest and a table, a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe collapsed the moment he made in past the door, collapsed onto the bed, the cold and hard bed board did nothing to calm him down.
