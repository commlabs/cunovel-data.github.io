{"id":15011,"no":54,"title":"February 23","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"And there came a lion.\" (1 Sam. 17:34)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is a source of inspiration and strength to come in touch with the youthful David, trusting God. Through faith in God he conquered a lion and a bear, and afterwards overthrew the mighty Goliath. When that lion came to despoil that flock, it came as a wondrous opportunity to David. If he had failed or faltered he would have missed God\u0027s opportunity for him and probably would never have come to be God\u0027s chosen king of Israel. \"And there came a lion.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne would not think that a lion was a special blessing from God; one would think that only an occasion of alarm. The lion was God\u0027s opportunity in disguise. Every difficulty that presents itself to us, if we receive it in the right way, is God\u0027s opportunity. Every temptation that comes is God\u0027s opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen the \"lion\" comes, recognize it as God\u0027s opportunity no matter how rough the exterior. The very tabernacle of God was covered with badgers\u0027 skins and goats\u0027 hair; one would not think there would be any glory there. The Shekinah of God was manifest under that kind of covering. May God open our eyes to see Him, whether in temptations, trials, dangers, or misfortunes. ━C. H.
