But whereas the others have bare walls, with stone or wood floorboards, the study is carpeted and the walls are covered with leather panels. There are two large desks, bookcases galore, a PC, laptop, typewriter, paper and pens. There used to be five chess sets, but not any more. The swords and axes which hung from the walls are gone too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae Athim doesn\u0027t want me here. That\u0027s obvious from her disapproving look. Dervish doesn\u0027t care. He\u0027s seated behind the computer on his largest desk, one hand on the mouse, moving it around in small circles, waiting for his unwelcome guest to speak. Prae Athim is seated opposite. I\u0027m standing close to the door, ready to leave if Dervish tells me to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae finally speaks. \"Billy Spleen still lives with his grandparents?\" Dervish nods slowly. \"I thought you might have moved him in with you. To observe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the master observer, not me,\" Dervish says quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it dangerous, leaving him there?\" she presses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy\u0027s time of turning has passed. There\u0027s nothing to fear from him now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s debatable,\" Prae smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae looks at her hands crossed over her lap. Thinks a moment. Then nods at me. \"I\u0027d rather not speak in front of the boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this about him?\" Dervish responds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Partially.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t think-\" she begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grubbs faced the demons with me,\" Dervish interrupts. \"He fought by my side. I\u0027m not going to keep secrets from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Prae sniffs. \"You tell him everything about your business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I don\u0027t hide things from him. When he asks, I answer. And since I\u0027m certain he\u0027s going to be asking about this, he might as well stay and hear it first-hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae sighs. \"You never make life easy for us. You\u0027ve always treated the Lambs like enemies. We\u0027re on the same side, Dervish. You should afford us respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do respect you,\" Dervish says. \"I just don\u0027t trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d forgotten about the Lambs. They loomed large in my thoughts while Dervish was zombified, especially around the time of a full moon. If I\u0027d found myself turning into a werewolf, I was going to phone them and ask them to put me out of my misery. But since Dervish returned, I haven\u0027t had time to brood about my potentially fatal genes or the family bogey men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gradys and their kin have been cursed for a long time. We\u0027re talking a lot of generations. Over the centuries, family members have tried to figure out the cause of the curse, find a cure for it, and develop ways of dealing with the infected children quietly and efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lambs are the result. A group of scientists, soldiers and I don\u0027t know what else, all focused on the problems and logistics of lycanthropy. They spend a lot of time, money and effort trying to unlock the secrets of the rogue Grady-genes. But they also play the part of executioners when necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of parents decide to kill their children if they turn into werewolves. But most can\u0027t perform the dirty deed themselves. So they call in the Lambs, who take the transformed child away and do what must be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find out about Billy?\" Dervish asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We keep tabs on all the family children,\" Prae says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Billy didn\u0027t leave a trail. There was no evidence that he was turning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae smiles. \"You covered up admirably. Gathered the bodies of the animals he slaughtered, disposed of them quietly. But you couldn\u0027t be expected to find every corpse. And you couldn\u0027t do anything about the operative who saw him sneaking out of his house during a full moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had him under direct surveillance?\" Dervish snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish\u0027s hand goes rigid on the mouse. \"You had no right to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had every right,\" Prae disagrees. \"If a guardian chooses to deal personally with an infected child, it\u0027s not our business. But you didn\u0027t. You gave him free reign.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in control,\" Dervish growls. \"He wasn\u0027t a danger to anyone. I was waiting for the right moment to act.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Prae says. \"But we couldn\u0027t take any chances. We guessed you would handle the matter this way if he turned, so for some years we\u0027d been keeping an eye on the boy. On your brother\u0027s children too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish starts to retort. Stops and scowls. \"Tell me why you\u0027ve come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few reasons,\" Prae says. \"One-to make sure Billy is normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is,\" Dervish says. \"We cured him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how certain is your cure?\" Prae asks. \"We know about the demon you deal with, but there\u0027s much about the process that\u0027s a mystery. You and the others who have faced him keep it a secret. You don\u0027t let the rest of us benefit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t include you,\" Dervish says stiffly. \"He deals with one case at a time, and only with those who have some experience of magic. That\u0027s how it works. It\u0027s not our choice-it\u0027s his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The demon,\" Prae nods. \"Lord-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say his name here,\" Dervish stops her. \"It\u0027s dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae looks around nervously. I feel the hairs rise on the back of my neck. Then Dervish catches my eye and tilts his head ever so slightly. It\u0027s a gesture I know well-he does that sometimes instead of winking. I realise he\u0027s winding Prae up, giving her a scare. I hide a smile behind my hand and wait for her to settle down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not fair,\" Prae resumes, less composed than before. \"We\u0027ve never had any contact with the demon. Maybe we could strike our own deal if you put us in touch with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you should let us try. We-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve had this conversation before,\" Dervish interrupts. \"We\u0027re not having it again. The Lambs follow the path of science. Demons are creatures of magic. The two don\u0027t mix. End of story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Prae says, showing open anger for a second, her pale face flushing. \"You choose to lock us out-there\u0027s nothing we can do about that. But it means we don\u0027t know all that we should about the cure. We have no proof that it works in the long term, or why. So it\u0027s natural for us to be suspicious, to run our own checks, to be safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Totally natural,\" Dervish says sarcastically. \"But I don\u0027t think you\u0027d have waited until now to make sure Billy wasn\u0027t killing. If you were checking on him prior to his change, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve monitored him in the year-plus since. So your first reason for being here is a crock-you know Billy\u0027s fine. Let\u0027s move on to reason two and try to make it a bit more believable this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae glares at Dervish, then glances at me. \"Two,\" she growls. \"We wanted to check on Grubbs. He\u0027s at a dangerous age. Both his brother-\" My stomach tightens another notch. She knows the truth about Bill-E! \"-and sister turned. We thought it advisable to have a look at him. We kept out of the way while you were... indisposed, but now that you\u0027re back on your feet, we felt it was a good time to have a chat.\" She faces me and smiles. \"How have you been sleeping lately? Any bad dreams? Woken up with dirt under your fingernails or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what she\u0027s doing, don\u0027t you, Grubbs?\" Dervish asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to freak me out,\" I mutter edgily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct. If they wanted to check up on you, they\u0027d do it secretly. You\u0027d never know they were there. She\u0027s saying this to upset you, because I\u0027ve upset her. So ignore it. And you,\" he says to Prae, \"tell me the real reason you\u0027re here or get the hell out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well.\" Prae stares at Dervish challengingly. \"We want to run some tests on Billy under laboratory conditions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to turn my nephew into a guinea pig?\" Dervish laughs harshly. \"You want me to sign him over, so you can prod and poke him and have him urinate into a bottle at your command?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like that. We-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out!\" Dervish shouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re being unreasonable,\" Prae objects. \"Let me finish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you\u0027re finished,\" Dervish laughs. \"I\u0027ve heard enough. Now march back out to your car and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen a child who\u0027s turned?\" Prae asks me, raising her voice. \"You must have seen your brother, but only in the early stages of his transformation. It takes a few months for the disease to properly set in. They grow hair. Their features distort. Their spines twist. I have some photographs which-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I shout. \"I don\u0027t want to see any photos. I\u0027ve seen them before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Children your own age,\" Prae says quickly as Dervish stands and strides towards her. \"Some even younger. We have an eight-year-old girl. Her parents didn\u0027t know about the curse. She killed her mother. Chewed her throat open and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so out of here,\" Dervish snarls, reaching to grab Prae\u0027s collar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I stop him, holding up a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grubbs, don\u0027t listen to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just wait a minute. Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish breathes out heavily, then takes a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re trying to help,\" Prae says, speaking to me but looking at Dervish. \"Your uncle is a man of old science-he calls it magic, but to us it\u0027s science by a different name. We\u0027re of the new school. Dervish fights one battle at a time. Your mother and father made that choice too. But we\u0027re trying to attack the root of the disease. We want everyone to benefit, not just a few. To do that, we have to examine and explore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother is one of the very few victims to beat the curse. If we can study him, unlock the secrets behind his remarkable cure, perhaps we can replicate it and save others-without the need for demons or so-called magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t,\" Dervish says wearily. \"I\u0027ve told you before, it\u0027s not science. It\u0027s not of this universe. You can\u0027t understand it and you can\u0027t mimic it. Do you think I\u0027d stand in your way if I thought there was the slightest chance that you could?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be sure,\" Prae says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae mutters something beneath her breath, then tries me again. \"We wouldn\u0027t hurt Billy. You and your uncle could come and observe. We just want to know more, to understand... to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel sorry for Prae Athim. Despite her scary appearance and manner, she only wants to do good. But the thought of her taking Bill-E away, locking him up, experimenting on him... I shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should leave now,\" Dervish says quietly. \"We can\u0027t help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re condemning others to change, to die,\" Prae says angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish shrugs. \"We\u0027ve been condemned a long time. We\u0027re used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lays a hand on Prae\u0027s shoulder. She jerks away from him and stands. \"My daughter changed,\" she hisses. \"I tried to cure her, but I couldn\u0027t. She\u0027s still alive. Because I hope and believe. By denying us, you deny her and all the others like her. How will you sleep with that on your conscience?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lousily,\" Dervish says. \"But Billy will sleep sweetly. And to me, that\u0027s what matters most, just as your daughter matters most to you.\" He leans towards her. \"If the positions were reversed, would you allow your loved one to be taken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Prae answers immediately. \"Without question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s where we differ. Because I always question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are other ways,\" Prae says, a dangerous tremble to her tone. \"We didn\u0027t have to ask. We could just take him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish\u0027s expression goes dead. \"Try it,\" he whispers. \"See what happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t stop us,\" Prae insists, a red flush of anger rising up her throat. \"You\u0027re powerful, but so are the Lambs. We could-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mess with me and you mess with us all,\" Dervish interrupts. \"Do you really want to do that? Do the Lambs now think themselves the equals of the Disciples?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We aren\u0027t afraid of your kind,\" Prae says, but her words ring hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish smiles lazily. \"If you lay a hand on Billy or Grubbs, I\u0027ll teach you to be afraid. That\u0027s a promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want us as enemies,\" Prae warns him. \"Nobody stands alone in this world, not even the Disciples. You may need us one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Dervish agrees. \"But not today.\" He points at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae opens her mouth to try again. Realises she\u0027d be wasting her breath. Shakes her head with disgust. Shoots a look at me. \"Pray you never turn. Because if you do, thanks to people like your uncle, we won\u0027t be able to help. All we\u0027ll be able to do is kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strides to the door, throws it opens and marches out. The front doors slam several seconds later. Then the faint sound of her engine starting, rising, fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish stares at me. I stare back. Neither of us says anything. I don\u0027t know what my uncle\u0027s thinking, but there\u0027s only one glaring thought in my head-who the hell are the Disciples? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slawter-the-demonata-3/page-3.html","bookId":2177,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:44:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:44:34 PM"}
