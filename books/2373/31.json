They were just going through the motions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crime-scene guys got here yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the medics shook his head. \"You\u0027re the first. Detective Falke is on his way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any note?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Through there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe medic gestured toward the living room. The window was open. On the tasteful oak coffee table, between the two tasteful beige suede armchairs, a piece of paper fluttered in the breeze, pinned down by a heavy glass ashtray. Without bothering to put on gloves, Mitch moved the ashtray and picked it up. In neat, cursive handwriting, Andrew Preston had written seven words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was my fault. Forgive me, Maria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the FUCK are you DOING?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch jumped, dropping the note. Detective Lieutenant Dubray\u0027s voice boomed off the walls like an angry giant\u0027s. \"Are you out of your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch opened his mouth to explain himself, then closed it again. What could he say? He knew he shouldn\u0027t be here. Still less should he be messing with another detective\u0027s crime scene. Dubray was incandescent with rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s evidence tampering! Do you understand how serious that is? I could have you thrown off the force. I should have you thrown off the force.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I needed to talk to Andrew Preston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a little late for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. So I see. Look, sir, I would have waited for Falke, but I knew he\u0027d be obstructive. He probably wouldn\u0027t even have let me see the note.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he wouldn\u0027t! And why the fuck should he? This is not your case, Mitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, sir, he\u0027s not even asking the obvious questions. Like what was Maria Preston doing in Sag Harbor anyway. And who knew she was gonna be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don called me half an hour ago. He told me you were poking your nose in, rambling about Lenny goddamn Brookstein. He thinks you\u0027ve lost it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on, sir. You know Don Falke\u0027s always had it in for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ve lost it, too. I\u0027m sorry, Mitch. But you\u0027ve gone too far this time. You\u0027re on suspension until further notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Consider yourself on indefinite leave until you hear from me otherwise. And don\u0027t look so goddamn hard done by. You\u0027re lucky you aren\u0027t fired. If I didn\u0027t know how much Helen and Celeste count on that paycheck, I wouldn\u0027t think twice. Now get out of here, before I change my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eON HIS WAY HOME, MITCH PASSED the bar where he\u0027d first met with Davey Buccola. He went inside and ordered a scotch. \"Keep \u0027em coming,\" he told the barman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch shrugged. Bad year. Bad life. Part of him wished he had never laid eyes on Davey Buccola. If it hadn\u0027t been for Davey\u0027s ferretlike digging into Lenny Brookstein\u0027s death, none of this would have happened. Mitch would have arrested Grace and been done with it. Moved on to the next case, like everyone wanted him to. Maybe even made captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, here he was, alone, suspended from duty, all because of Buccola\u0027s file and the promise he\u0027d made Grace. Grace. Mitch wondered again where she was. No one would tell him anything. He imagined her being interrogated, locked in solitary confinement, sleep-deprived. He thought about her sad eyes, her courage, her surprising sense of humor, even in the direst of situations, and hoped her spirit hadn\u0027t already been broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the whiskey haze, Grace\u0027s words floated back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForget about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was much too late for that. Mitch realized that in the last two months, he\u0027d barely thought about Helen. Grace had taken her place in his subconscious, his dreams. Now it was Grace he was letting down, Grace he was failing. Just as he\u0027d failed Helen and Celeste. Just as he\u0027d failed his father. I\u0027ve disappointed everyone I ever loved. I let them all down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck suspension. Fuck toeing the line. And fuck giving up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow Mitch would take a flight to Nantucket Island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth couldn\u0027t wait. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-31.html","bookId":2373,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM"}
