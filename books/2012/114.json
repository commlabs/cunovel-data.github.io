The other gods simply watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And then,’ Silchas Ruin whispered, ‘he stole my grief. And now, what is there, I wonder … what is there left to feel?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ If I suggested “gratitude”, would that be insensitive? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin shot the god a sharp look, and then said, ‘I accept the gift, Shadowthrone, and in return I offer you this.’ He waved at the other gods. ‘This mob ill suits you. Leave them to their devices, Shadowthrone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe god cackled. ‘ If I was blood kin to this family, I’d be the uncle slumped drunk and senseless in the corner. Luckily – dare I risk that word? – I am not kin to any of them. Rest assured I will humbly heed your advice, Prince .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin picked up the weapon. He looked at the gods, his crimson eyes slowly moving from one ghastly face to the next. And then he vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDessembrae wheeled on Shadowthrone. ‘What was all that? What scheme are you playing at?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowthrone’s cane snapped out, caught the Lord of Tragedy flush across the bridge of his nose. He stumbled back, fell on to his backside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowthrone hissed, and then said, ‘The best part of you wanders the mortal world, old friend. Long ago, he surrendered that emptiness called pride. At last, I see where it fetched up. Well, it seems one more lesson in humility shall find you.’ He glared at the others. ‘All of you, in fact.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeru growled. ‘You snivelling little upstart …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then his voice fell away, for the Lord of Shadows was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Busy busy busy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCotillion paused on the road. ‘It’s done?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course it’s done!’ Shadowthrone snapped, and then grunted. ‘Here? What are we doing here?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Recognize the place, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pah! Not more regrets from you. I’m sick of them!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am marking this site one more time—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What, like a Hound pissing against a fence post?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCotillion nodded. ‘Crude, but apt.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What of you?’ Shadowthrone demanded. ‘Did you return to Shadowkeep? Did you send her off? Did she need a few slaps? A punch in the nose, a quick roger behind the keep?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She needed only my invitation, Ammanas.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Truly?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of all the wolves on one’s own trail,’ Cotillion said, ‘there is always one, the pack’s leader. Cruel and relentless. Show me a god or a mortal with no wolves on their heels—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Enough talk of wolves. This is me, after all. Fanged, eyes of fire, foul fur and endless hunger, a hundred beasts, each one named Regret.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just so.’ Cotillion nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So you put her on a horse and gave her a blade, and sent her back down her own trail.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To kill the biggest, meanest one, aye.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowthrone grunted again. ‘Bet she was smiling.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Find me a fool who’ll take that bet,’ Cotillion replied, smiling himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lord of Shadows looked round. ‘See none hereabouts.

A star is born in the dark, and the heavens are revealed to all . Withal ran his hand along the pitted plaster, fragments of damp moss falling away where his fingers scraped it loose. The painted scene was in a primitive, awkward style, yet he suspected it was more recent than those glorious works in the city’s palace. Light like blood, corpses on the strand, faces shining beneath helms. A sky igniting …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few survived the chaos, the civil wars. They cowered here in this forest. In coloured plaster and paint, they sought to make eternal their memories . He wondered why people did such things. He wondered at their need to leave behind a record of the great events witnessed, and lived through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, a discovery like this – here in the forest above the Shore, at the base of a vast sinkhole his errant step had inadvertently discovered – well, it led to questions, and mystery, and, like the missing patches and the thick clumps of moss, he found a need to fill in the gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor we are all bound in stories, and as the years pile up they turn to stone, layer upon layer, building our lives. You can stand on them and stare out at future’s horizon, or you can be crushed beneath their weight. You can take a pick in hand and break them all apart, until you’re left with nothing but rubble. You can crush that down into dust and watch the wind blow it away. Or you can worship those wretched stories, carving idols and fascinating lies to lift your gaze ever higher, and all those falsehoods make hollow and thin the ground you stand on . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-114.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
