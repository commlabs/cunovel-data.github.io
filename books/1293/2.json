{"id":30806,"no":2,"title":"Chapter II. At the Hall","content":"\u0026nbsp;It was dark long before Tony and I were marched up the drive to the Hall. \u0026nbsp;The great house stood out a grey mass against the starry sky; the windows fronting us were golden with light; and light flowed from the open door and down the steps. \u0026nbsp;I heard loud laughter; the Squire had company, as he might any night of the week. \u0026nbsp;He favoured fox-hunting gentlemen of a like pattern to himself, seasoned to drink under the table any gentleman of fashion and Tory out of session who should quit the Town for the hospitality of Chelton. \u0026nbsp;Hearing the voices and the laughter, and seeing the blaze of light from the dining-room, I had little fear of the temper of Mr. Chelton, before whom Tony and I were presently to be haled. \u0026nbsp;None the less, for the thought that the Squire might think fit to parade us before his company to provide sport for them, I would have begged Tim Kerrick to deal with us summarily; I would have endured the ash-plant about me for all my seventeen years of age but that the sudden interest of Mr. Bradbury p. 16had excited my natural curiosity. \u0026nbsp;I pictured Mr. Bradbury standing by us, chuckling to himself, and his piercing look, while the lantern light was playing across my face; and I recalled his queer, sharp tone when he ordered me to be brought on to the Hall. \u0026nbsp;What should the gentleman want with me? \u0026nbsp;Squire’s family lawyer, Tim told me, gruffly, in answer to my eager question. \u0026nbsp;How we should fare with Mr. Chelton was of less concern. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I knew Mr. Chelton for a good-humoured gentleman. \u0026nbsp;I did not fear that, though Tony and I had been found poaching on his preserves, the Squire would do worse than bid Tim Kerrick dress us down with his ash-plant. \u0026nbsp;I did not dread committal, the Assizes and the terror of their Lordships, the Judges. \u0026nbsp;Indeed, I believed that unseen I had dropped the hare out of sight in the furze; and I took it that Tony had long since rid himself of the rabbit from his pocket. \u0026nbsp;Only when we were before the house did I find the chance of a word with Tony. \u0026nbsp;Tim, loosing his grip then, and staring up doubtfully at the door, as if not knowing whether or not to conduct us before the Squire and Mr. Bradbury immediately, I poked my head forward and whispered to Tony, “Did you get rid of that rabbit?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He whispered back, “No! \u0026nbsp;It’s stuck in my p. 17pocket;” but he could add nothing, for Tim gripped me instantly, and shook me, with the observation: “No talkin’! \u0026nbsp;If it’s the rabbit you’re thinkin’ of, it’s in his pocket yet, for I’ve felt it there. \u0026nbsp;And I saw you drop the bag with, belike, another inside. \u0026nbsp;So don’t go thinkin’ yourself clever, John Howe! \u0026nbsp;It’s gaol, or transportation, or at the very least a basting you’ve never felt the like of, and’ll never want to feel again. \u0026nbsp;Squire’s at dinner. \u0026nbsp;You’ll wait till Squire’s dined and wined, you will.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With this cheerful augury Tim Kerrick propelled me before him, and the keeper following with Tony, we were marched about the house to the stables and into the harness-room. \u0026nbsp;“You’ll be safe and snug here,” Tim said, ere he turned the key upon us, “Squire’ll deal with you, but not for a good two hours or more. \u0026nbsp;So you can just think it all over in the dark.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Slamming the door Tim locked us in, and stumped away. \u0026nbsp;His assertion that Mr. Chelton would not deal with us, till he had dined, gave me instant concern for my mother’s anxiety at my failure to return for supper. \u0026nbsp;I pictured her dolefully—with my meal set all ready for me; sitting listening for my steps, peering up at the clock, and running out to the gate and waiting there, but seeing still no sign of me. \u0026nbsp;And p. 18dreading, I guessed well, lest I should have disappeared as from the face of the earth—vanished with never a word to her, even as my father—of whom I shall tell presently. \u0026nbsp;I cursed Tim Kerrick, Squire Chelton, and Mr. Bradbury.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What’s going to happen to us now, John?” Tony muttered through the dark. \u0026nbsp;“What’ll the Squire do with us, do you think?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, he’ll laugh, for he’s sure to be half drunk when he sees us. \u0026nbsp;Tell us we’ll be hanged, if we’re not shot for poachers first. \u0026nbsp;And if Tim Kerrick makes the case black enough, Squire’ll give him leave to baste us.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, but Tim would have basted us properly, and let us go,” said Tony. \u0026nbsp;“Why should that old black crow want to spoil Tim’s sport and bid him bring us here, unless he’s a notion of having us clapped in gaol?

Mr. Vining allowed me to share the studies and the discipline of his son Tony I did not know. \u0026nbsp;Yet, though I, lazy and graceless young dog as I was, urged her to let me seek employment in Chelton or in London itself, she would not hear of this. \u0026nbsp;She declared, dear soul, that she would have me first a scholar; even though I had turned seventeen, there was time and to spare for me to choose a calling. \u0026nbsp;So with Tony I had become an equally indifferent scholar, in spite of Mr. Vining’s cane, and as abandoned a rogue and poacher. \u0026nbsp;So I sat now with the parson’s son awaiting Squire Chelton’s summary justice, and most like Tim Kerrick’s execution of it. \u0026nbsp;But Mr. Bradbury—?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Bradbury sat in a cushioned chair by the fire; Mr. Chelton supported his huge body more or less steadily against the chimney-piece, when at last Tim Kerrick paraded us before them in the library. \u0026nbsp;It was a vast room,—its shelves lined with books, none of which, I fear, Mr. Chelton p. 22had ever opened from the day when his father’s death put him into possession of the Hall and its acres. \u0026nbsp;Old Mr. Gilbert Chelton’s portrait looked coldly down from its gilded frame above the chimney-piece on his stout son, flushed from his drink—his red coat, buckskins and high boots all mud-splashed from the cross-country ride of the day. \u0026nbsp;Squire Chelton had not changed his rig to do honour to his guests, who, I took it from the roars of laughter yet sounding in the dining-room, were gentlemen of tastes similar to his own. \u0026nbsp;His iron-grey hair was wind-blown; his blood-shot eyes were as unsteady as his legs. \u0026nbsp;He exuded good humour—natural to him, but stimulated by as liberal an indulgence in the contents of his cellar as he expected from any gentleman of his company. \u0026nbsp;While Mr. Gilbert’s portrait looked its disapproval, the paintings of four other dead and gone Cheltons of a marked resemblance to the Squire seemed to regard him enviously from their old frames.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Bradbury, if he had not been permitted to spare the bottle at dinner, made no show of it in his complexion. \u0026nbsp;He sat by the fire, his legs crossed; he had a silver snuff-box set with some glittering gem in his left hand; his face was almost as white as his linen. \u0026nbsp;Observing him, I had a sense that the mind at the back of his broad p. 23brow was as keen and as sparkling as the jewels on his fingers. \u0026nbsp;With his leanness, his bloodlessness, his coldly impassive face, his cunning eyes peering through his spectacles, he was as odd a contrast to his stout, drink-flushed patron in his riding-rig as were his air of precision and the trimness of his dress to the frank disorder of the rich furniture in the room. \u0026nbsp;Squire Chelton’s desk was littered with papers and parchments; an inkhorn was overset among them; goose quills had blown to the carpet; hats, cloaks, riding-whips, and gloves were tossed pell-mell on chairs and table. \u0026nbsp;On this dark oaken table a half-emptied flagon of crystal and silver was set, and a circle of glasses stained with the red dregs of wine. \u0026nbsp;The library was lit by many tall candles in silver sticks, and by the leaping flames from the hearth before which Mr. Bradbury warmed himself, with the reflections flashing from his jewelled hands, his snuff-box and the silver buckles of his shoes. \u0026nbsp;I noted the keenness of Mr. Bradbury’s gaze immediately Tim thrust us forward; all the while I remained in the room, I fancied that his eyes never left me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Here’s the young varmints, sir and Mr. Bradbury,” Tim announced, touching his forelock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Young Vining and young Howe,—hey?” p. 24cried Mr. Chelton, essaying to frown majestically. \u0026nbsp;“Caught poaching! \u0026nbsp;Ye’re a credit to the parson who has the schooling of the pair of ye. \u0026nbsp;What have ye to say for yourselves?
