She had already put on jeans and loafers and was pulling a T-shirt down over her midriff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d packed too. He couldn’t believe it. The empty overnight bag she’d left on the floor by the closet door was now on her bed and stuffed full. The bathroom door was wide open, and he could see that the counter had been swept clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go.” He had to shout to be heard over Brenner’s screams. “Leave it,” he ordered when he saw her reach for the bag. “We’ve got to get out of here. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring his order, she grabbed the bag and slung the strap over her left shoulder. Then she noticed he was barefoot. She grabbed his loafers and shoved them in the bag on top of the photo album.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick flipped the safety on his gun and slipped it into his holster. That gave her two more seconds to grab his wallet, the car keys, and her purse from the top of the dresser. She was shoving them into the side pocket of the bag when Nick grabbed her. He pulled her tight into his side and half carried her along the hallway and down the stairs. She had a death grip on the strap, and she could hear the bag banging on the steps behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack smoke rolled up the stairs to meet them. Nick shoved her head down against his chest and continued on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard an unearthly sound behind her, like a dragon wheezing, and then a crackling roar followed. The air conditioner in the dining room window crashed to the floor and exploded. The force was so great the walls shook, and the hardwood shivered beneath her feet. The living room window shattered then, and shards of glass the size of butcher knives shot out onto the porch. The fire hissed and then roared again as it fed on the gust of wind that rushed inside the open doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made it outside just in the nick of time. Another few seconds and they would have had to climb out one of the bedroom windows. The fire chased them outside, the flames licking at their heels. They stumbled down the steps and onto the front walk, coughing from the inhaled smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed her eyes shut to try to get rid of the stinging. Nick recovered much quicker than she did. He spotted Wesson leaping out of his car and running toward Joe and Brenner. The agent and his prisoner were standing in the empty lot beside Laurant’s house. Feinberg was still in the car, the motor running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had the agents gotten here so soon, Nick wondered. First things first, he thought. He squeezed Laurant. “Are you okay?” he asked, his voice hoarse from coughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned into him, thankful for his strength. “Yes,” she answered. “Are you all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to go,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around her in a daze. The entire neighborhood was waking up. Families up and down the street began to spill out of their houses onto their front porches and lawns to watch the fire. She could hear the sirens wailing in the distance. She saw Bessie Jean and Viola standing by the big old oak in their front yard where they had kept Daddy chained. Both ladies were dressed in heavy, fuzzy robes, one pink, the other white, that made them look like giant bunny rabbits. Bessie Jean, her hair in pin curls, was wearing an old-fashioned hairnet, the knot she’d tied in the netting hanging down on her forehead. Viola was dabbing at her eyes with her lacy handkerchief and shaking her head as she watched the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant turned back and saw the flames shooting through the roof over her living room. It had been a near miss, she realized then. But Nick was all right, and so was she, without a blister between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the fire and thanked God no one had been hurt. Suddenly, the fog lifted and the truth settled. She began to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laurant, what’s the matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got him. It’s over Nick. The nightmare’s over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped her bag and threw her arms around him. He held her close. Then he heard her whisper, “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We aren’t going to celebrate just yet. Let’s take this a step at a time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him. “I still can’t believe it. When I heard him shouting at you in the hallway, I recognized his voice and I knew it was Steve, but I just couldn’t put it together in my mind. I was so shocked.” She took a deep breath and tried to be more coherent. “You told me he was a suspect, and you were right all along.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t stop trembling. Impatiently wiping the tears away with the back of her hands, she remembered the man on the roof. “There were two of them,” she said. “Yes, two,” she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The other man was Lonnie. He started the fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lonnie?” She didn’t know why she was stunned to know the sheriff ’s son had been involved. Brenner had obviously been the brains. He had been the one to plan the nightmare from start to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick was looking around for Lonnie. Where the hell was he? He should have been cuffed by now with at least one agent on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillie and Justin came running across the street to help. Justin immediately went to Bessie Jean’s yard to turn on her garden hose to try to contain the fire. It was pitifully inadequate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick pulled Laurant toward Wesson. The agent was talking on his phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got him, sir. I certainly did, and as soon as I get the warrant, I’m positive I’m going to find more evidence to nail him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got him?” She repeated Wesson’s boast to Nick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I heard what he said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe had obviously also heard. He was glaring at Wesson, letting him see his hostility. The agent in charge ignored him and continued to speak into his slick, palm-size phone. Wesson could barely contain his enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By the book, sir. That’s how I got him. And for the record, instinct didn’t have anything to do with the apprehension. It was careful planning and following through. No, sir, that wasn’t a criticism of your methods. I’m simply telling you that it was hard work and not anything else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire truck barreled down the street, the siren blaring. Feinberg moved his car out of the way of the fire hydrant and parked it in front of Bessie Jean’s house, then got out and ran over to Joe. Like everyone else, he watched the blaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolunteer firemen wearing yellow slickers and hats jumped from the truck and raced to hook up the hoses. The driver turned off the siren and then shouted, “Is everyone out of the house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone’s out,” Joe shouted back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick was seething inside. He swore that if Wesson didn’t get off the damn phone in the next five seconds, he was going to rip it out of his hand and beat the hell out of him if that was what it would take to get some answers. Where was Lonnie? And where were the agents who were supposed to be watching the house?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laurant, I want you to get in the car and stay there. I’ll move it onto the street,” he said as he grabbed her hand and pulled her along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear the anger radiating in his voice. He was still acting as though he was supposed to protect her and she couldn’t understand why. They had caught Brenner, and they knew who his accomplice was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nick, it’s over.” Maybe it hadn’t sunk in yet. Yes, that was it, she thought. “You did it. You and Joe got him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll talk about it later,” he said curtly as he reached down and picked up the bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the car, he muttered, “Ah, hell, the keys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the bag while she dug until she found them. Her hands were shaking so much she couldn’t get the key in the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick took the keys from her, unlocked the car door, and tossed the bag into the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Laurant, how come that guy’s handcuffed?” Willie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustin jogged over from the Vandermans’ yard. He too was curious to hear the details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t that Steve Brenner?” Justin asked. “He’s a big shot in town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But how come he’s cuffed? What’d he do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He broke into my house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get inside the car, Laurant,” Nick said. He took hold of her elbow to get her moving, but she turned back when Brenner started screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take these handcuffs off me. You can’t hold me. I haven’t done anything illegal. I own that house, and if I want to put a camera inside, you can’t stop me. I signed the papers two weeks ago. It’s my house, and I’ve got the right to know what goes on in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe had used up all his patience. “What you’ve got is the right to remain silent. Now shut the hell up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustin’s mouth dropped open. “He put a camera in your house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’d he put it?” Willie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t answer. She sagged against Nick’s side. Her eyes were fixed on Brenner. He turned, saw her watching him, and sneered. There was dried blood caked on his perfectly capped teeth and more smeared on his lips. He was a reptile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenner couldn’t control his fury. He blamed everyone but himself for getting caught. If the bitch hadn’t brought the FBI boyfriend home, he wouldn’t be in this predicament. Most of all he blamed Laurant. Joe grabbed him when he lunged toward her. Brenner tried to shove himself free while he shouted profanities at her. All his plans were ruined. Damn her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bitch,” he shouted. “This is my house now. I paid that old lady a lot of money and you know what? There isn’t a damned thing you can do about it. When I’m finished suing everybody, I’m going to own the FBI. I have rights,” he added in a roar. And then, hoping to humiliate her, he added, “I’ve been watching you undress almost every night. I’ve seen everything you’ve got to offer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the evil radiating like hot coals in his eyes, and she didn’t have any doubt at all that he had killed those women. Brenner was clearly demented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joe, put a gag in his mouth,” Nick shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get her away from here,” Wesson ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe profanities Brenner hurled at her didn’t shake her as Nick led her back to the car. Some of the women in the crowd weren’t so indifferent, however. One mother cupped her hands over her son’s ears. Her neighbors might be shocked by Brenner’s conduct now, but when they learned the truth about the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde living in their midst, they were going to be sickened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick got her inside the car, then backed into the street and parked it behind Feinberg’s vehicle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to me. I want you to stay in the car with the windows up and the doors locked.” He flipped on the air conditioner so she wouldn’t swelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to get out of here. Could we please leave now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded close to tears. “In just a minute,” he promised.“Okay? I’ve got to talk to Wesson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woodenly nodded. “Yes, all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him sprint across the yard, then she turned to look at the house. The fire seemed to have been contained, and she thought it was odd that she didn’t feel much emotion at all while she surveyed the destruction. It had been her home, but now that Brenner owned it, she never wanted to go inside again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flashing lights, the noise of the crowd, Brenner’s screams—it was all too much. She put her hand to her forehead and slumped down in her seat. And then she began to cry for the two women Brenner had murdered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could rest in peace now. The monster couldn’t hurt anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheriff was the last to arrive at the scene. His Ford Explorer rounded the corner on two wheels. Swerving to avoid hitting Little Lorna, the car skidded to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLloyd left his SUV in the middle of the street. Grunting as he eased his bulk out from under the steering wheel, he got out of the car and stood there with his hands on his hips, surveying the crowd. He tried to look important. Frowning so that anyone who might be watching him would know he considered this situation a serious matter, he hiked his pants up with his belt, straightened his shoulders, and strutted into Laurant’s front yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on here?” he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think is going on?” Joe asked. “The house is on fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLloyd scowled at Joe to let him know he didn’t appreciate his sarcasm. Then he noticed Brenner’s hands were behind his back and there was blood all over his face. Leaning to the side, he saw the handcuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, now, what’s Steve wearing those cuffs for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Breaking the law,” Joe replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bullshit,” Brenner ranted. “Lloyd, I didn’t do anything illegal. Make them take these damn cuffs off me. They’re chafing my wrists.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In due course,” Lloyd assured him. Then his eagle-eyed gaze homed in on Joe, and he took a threatening step toward him. “Aren’t you that fella who was fixing Lauren’s sink? What are you doing here? Did you strike this citizen? His nose looks to be broken. Now I’m asking you straight out, boy, and I want a straight answer. Did you hit him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hit him,” Nick said. “I should have shot him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you be a smart mouth, boy. This here is a serious matter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it is,” Nick agreed. “And if you call me boy one more time, I’m going to handcuff you. Got that, Lloyd?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLloyd nervously took a step back to put some distance between him and Nick, and acted like he was contemplating the situation. In reality, the sheriff was getting the feeling that he was in over his head, but he knew that Brenner would kill him if he didn’t get him out of this mess. He warily looked up at Nick. The FBI agent reminded him of a mountain lion, relaxed one second, and sinking his teeth into his prey the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lloyd, do something,” Brenner demanded. “He broke my nose. I want him arrested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLloyd nodded and forced himself to look Nick in the eyes. The frost there gave him a chill. He was proud of himself for resisting the urge to look away. “That’s battery, hitting a citizen,” he said. “You don’t think I can arrest an FBI agent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick’s answer was immediate. “No, I don’t think you can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” Brenner muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll just see about that,” Lloyd blustered. “Steve’s got to get to the hospital and get that nose fixed, and I’m going to take him there. I’m in charge, ’cause this here is my jurisdiction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe looked at Nick before answering. “This here is my prisoner, and you aren’t touching him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick moved to stand beside Joe, a show of unity against the sheriff, but also he wanted to be able to keep his eye on Laurant. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heartbreaker-buchanan-renard-1/page-38.html","bookId":1835,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:23 PM"}
