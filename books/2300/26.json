They were vampires, both of them, yet DeLongpre glared at him like a character out of a gothic novel, asking the hero about his intentions-except that Vince was no hero, and he had no right to court DeLongpre\u0027s daughter. Other than the sizzling physical attraction between them, they had nothing in common and no hope for a future together. He knew it, and so did DeLongpre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince blew out a deep breath. \"I love her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she know what you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only what you told her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except that she didn\u0027t believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince shrugged. \"Is that my fault?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your whole relationship is built on a lie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. Don\u0027t you think I know that? I want to tell her, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re afraid you\u0027ll lose her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you can\u0027t exist without her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince nodded. \"Why do I get the feeling you\u0027ve been down this road yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I loved Brenna the moment I saw her, but I never pretended to be anything other than what I am. If you love Cara, you owe her the truth before things go any further.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince swore softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeLongpre\u0027s eyes burned into him. \"You know I\u0027m right, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll tell her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the time is right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger rolled off the other vampire. \"And just when will that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell should I know? I don\u0027t like...\" Vince cut his words off in midsentence as Cara and her mother reentered the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What don\u0027t you like?\" Cara asked, sitting beside her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way the playoffs are going,\" Vince lied smoothly. \"My team\u0027s losing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna looked at Vince sharply as she sat down, her expression telling him she had heard the entire conversation between Vince and her husband, and that she agreed with Roshan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara glanced at her father and then at Vince. \"All right, what\u0027s going on? What aren\u0027t you telling me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince shook his head. \"Nothing, darlin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should go,\" DeLongpre said, rising. \"We didn\u0027t mean to intrude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not intruding,\" Cara said. \"You\u0027re my parents. You\u0027re welcome here anytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, sweetie,\" Brenna said, also rising, \"but I think your father\u0027s right. We just wanted to come by and make sure you were okay, and you are, so we\u0027ll see you Monday night, all right?\" She took her husband by the hand. \"Come on, Roshan, I think we\u0027ve interrupted their date long enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara walked her parents to the door and kissed them good night. She watched them walk down the path and disappear into the darkness, then closed the door behind them. \"All right,\" she said, returning to the living room where Vince waited, \"what\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, darlin\u0027. Your father just wanted to know what my intentions are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your intentions toward what... oh!\" Embarrassment flooded her cheeks. \"You don\u0027t mean he was asking about your intentions toward me?\" She pressed her hands to her cheeks. \"How could he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just worried about you,\" Vince said, drawing her down onto his lap. \"Nothing for you to be upset about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at him. \"You can\u0027t be serious! He\u0027s always trying to... to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run my life!\" She wriggled off Vince\u0027s lap, too upset to sit still. \"Honestly, I\u0027m twenty-two years old and they treat me like I\u0027m two! Do you realize this is the first time in my life that I haven\u0027t had a bodyguard parked outside my door? Of course, all that will change on Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re forgetting something here,\" Vince said mildly. \"That bodyguard saved your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saved my life. And his!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on now. He was in action before I got there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re taking their side? I don\u0027t believe it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, Vince pulled Cara into his arms. \"Calm down, darlin\u0027. They just worry about you, that\u0027s all. You can\u0027t blame them, you know. They can\u0027t be there for you during the day. It\u0027s only natural that they\u0027d take steps to protect you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him curiously. \"You accepted the fact that my parents are vampires mighty quick, didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou?\" she asked, frowning. \"I remember when I told you, you didn\u0027t even seem surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Why weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince cleared his throat. \"You seemed so convinced, I thought it would just make it worse if I doubted you, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe regarded him for several moments. \"Why did my dad think you were a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Maybe he saw me at The Nocturne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara shook her head. \"No, I don\u0027t think so. I mean, if that was true, wouldn\u0027t he think all the people at The Nocturne were vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, darlin\u0027.\" He caressed the last word, hoping to divert her thoughts to something else, something more intimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wear a lot of black, just like my dad,\" she remarked, her brow furrowed. \"And I\u0027ve never seen you eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince swore silently. She was getting close to the truth. Too close. He tightened his arm around her waist, drawing her body up against his. \"Speaking of eating,\" he murmured, \"you\u0027re looking mighty tasty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now, Vince.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\" Lowering his head, he kissed her, long and slow and deep, until she sagged against him, breathless. Her hands slid under his shirt, her nails lightly raking his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t protest when he swung her into his arms and carried her into the bedroom. Knowing it might be for the last time, he made love to her tenderly, drawing out each touch, each caress, pleasuring her until he ached inside, until, with a low growl, he buried himself deep within her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, on his way home, Vince cursed himself for his cowardice. He should have told her the truth. Hell, if he had just let her keep talking, she would have figured it out for herself. Instead, he\u0027d kissed her until she was hungry for his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a despicable thing to do, and he had no excuse except that he loved her and couldn\u0027t bear the idea of existing without her. He knew he would have to let her go sooner or later, but, dammit, he didn\u0027t have to like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time he saw her, he told himself it would be the last time, even though he knew it was a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, how much longer could he go on deceiving her now that she was asking questions? And what was he going to do about going to Sarah Beth\u0027s house? He couldn\u0027t very well go to the woman\u0027s house for dinner and then not eat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! He hadn\u0027t eaten solid food in a year. He supposed he could plant the suggestion in their minds that he had eaten dinner with them, but he hated to deceive Cara and her friends that way. He swore a vile oath. Letting her believe he was human was a far bigger deception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgusted with himself and his own company, he drove on past his place and headed for The Nocturne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate as it was, the club was in full swing. Vince took a seat at the end of the bar, his gaze sweeping the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouples on the dance floor. As usual, most everyone in the place, including himself, was wearing black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought made him frown. He hadn\u0027t started wearing black until he\u0027d been made, and then it seemed like the most natural thing in the world. He supposed he gravitated toward it unconsciously. He was a creature of the night now. How better to blend into the darkness that was so much a part of him than to dress in black? He wondered if it would throw Cara off the scent if he started wearing brighter colors again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the woman beside him. She was eating a chili cheeseburger and fries. Curious to see what would happen if he ate solid food, Vince ordered a hamburger, even though the smell of cooked meat made his stomach churn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his order arrived, he stared at it for several moments before taking a bite. It seemed odd to be chewing solid food. He swallowed quickly and knew he\u0027d made a huge mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolting out the club\u0027s back door, he ducked into the bushes. The burger tasted far worse coming back up than it had going down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wiping his mouth when he heard the sound of merry laughter behind him. Turning slowly, he came face to face with Mara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head in astonishment. \"What: are you doing? Have you learned nothing since I brought you across?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince shrugged sheepishly. \"I had to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever for? I know you don\u0027t have any desire for food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been invited to dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. I take it you still haven\u0027t told your little mortal what you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No, but she\u0027s starting to get suspicious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t hide the truth forever,\" Mara said, slipping her arm through his. \"Come, I know just the thing to take that awful taste out of your mouth.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-26.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
