He was showering in a beam of light. His body felt painful and itchy, such a horrible sensation. However, accompanying this sensation was the healing of his wounds. The wounds were being repaired in visible speed. The right side of his body nearly disappeared in whole. He looked like two-thirds of a person. The remaining third of him was forming up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng raised his eyes. Everyone else was also inside the light beams. The beam on Lan was purple instead, different from the others, who all had the same color.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, being in Godâ€™s dimension meant that she was alive. Honglu, Heng, and ChengXiao were having a conversation on the floor, Ran was standing behind Honglu, so no one in the other group died, which was fortunate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng closed his eyes and immersed himself in the sensation of the light. Although it was still painful and itchy, he felt as though he was in heaven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before long, the beams dimmed down. Zheng was the last one to get down. Lori immediately jumped to his arms while crying. This experience gave her too much of a scare, scared of separating with Zheng, scared of dying, and scared of Zheng dying with her. So many things weighted on her up to this moment. She could finally release her feelings with tears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng stroke her hair then looked at Lan. She smiled back at him without any hint of sadness. In fact, she looked delighted and relieved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ok, ok. Go back to your room if you want to get intimate. Or do you want to teach a lesson of sexual education?\" Honglu laughed. Then Ran knocked his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng let go of Lori, who was blushing, and let out a sigh of relief. \"I was afraid that you would all die. We are so lucky everyone\u0027s alive.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Honglu said. \"We are indeed lucky this time. Didn\u0027t you hear the information at completion? We completed the last movie of the series, the highest difficulty. There won\u0027t be anymore Alien and we each obtained 5000 points and a rank B reward. Don\u0027t you feel this is extremely lucky? Haha.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng recalled what he heard before he fainted. This was such a pleasant surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Honglu twirled his hair. \"You didn\u0027t inform us about this. Don\u0027t you think we are lucky for surviving the highest difficulty of the series? Didn\u0027t you know that completing a series gives points and ranked rewards?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng shook his head with a bitter smile. \"I really didn\u0027t know. I can learn about many things from God but it won\u0027t tell me anything concerning the missions. Think about it, if we know about these side missions and how to complete them, we will be able to grow so much. We can keep completing side missions in every movie and it will be like farming in an mmo.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng walked under the sphere. He closed his eyes and connected with the system. He had 6300 points and a rank B reward. The points exceeded what he expected. The rewards for each of them were enough to offset the horror they experienced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The group took a good night of rest as usual. All enhancements and exchanges would be discussed the next day. To everyone\u0027s surprise, ChengXiao, who had been talking all kinds of women, created a girl with some freckles and a braid. Her beauty was a step below the other girls in the platform, but ChengXiao\u0027s eyes had a sense of tenderness when he looked at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of all the people, Heng, Lan, and Yinkong still hadn\u0027t created any humans. Yinkong\u0027s reason was pretty straightforward. When an assassin needed someone to comfort her, then this assassin would be disqualified.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Heng and Lan didn\u0027t say their reasons and the others didn\u0027t continue asking. Everyone had their secrets. They will reveal them when they feel the need to. It was unreasonable to force the answers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The group gathered for a meal in Honglu\u0027s room because Ran\u0027s cooking was much better than that of Lori\u0027s. Although the boy didn\u0027t seem willing, everyone ignored him. Ran was very welcoming in contrast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So you encountered two Queens on the way? That was lucky of you.\" Zheng took a bite then said loudly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The others looked at him in confusion. Honglu seemed to get it as his hand went for his hair again, but Ran slapped his hand with her chopsticks. \"I was curious as to the wound on your right body. Even if you get hit with a wrecking ball, the wound wouldn\u0027t be so terrible. You are aware of it, right? As your physical stats increase, your body\u0027s toughness also increases. Your muscles won\u0027t get crushed like this even if you are hit by a truck at high speed. The force this wound took was horrifying. Is this from the Newborn?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng nodded. \"I can still feel a chill up my spine as I recall it. It was too horrifying. You can\u0027t even imagine the power of a Newborn. I need to use Qi or Red Flame to break open that metal alloy of the spaceship, but the Newborn could just smash it and tear it apart. If a normal person has a strength of 1, my regular strength is 3-4, my strength with Qi is 5-7, and 10 when I am in the second stage. The Newborn was at least 100.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The others shivered as they heard this. Honglu nodded in confirmation. \"Right, that\u0027s more on point for the 5000 points and a rank B reward everyone received. I was confused as to why the Queen only worth 1000 points and a rank D reward while the Newborn was so much. The difference in points was too big, but comparing their powers, this difference actually wasn\u0027t big enough. Haha, that\u0027s why I kept saying we were lucky.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"From the beginning when we were confined, we would have become hosts if not for the defensive field. Any team was almost certain to get wiped at that point without a mean to defend themselves. This was our first luck. The second one was our splitting up. Although it seemed like we spread out our powers but the Aliens could only choose one group to attack. That group was you. There were only two Queens on our way and we easily completed the movie. Third, you were almost certain to die. I don\u0027t know how you survived the first wave of the Newborns.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Zheng looked at Lan. She had been quiet since she came back, and she looked calmer than before. She laughed when Zheng looked at her. \"The Newborns were strong physically but mentally weak. I took control over their minds and have them kill each other. Even though I also took some damage but I still killed both in the end.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Honglu snapped his finger. \"So that explains it. Think about it, God\u0027s goal isn\u0027t to kill us but rather force us to evolve. Why do we encounter so many dangers in the movies? I think there\u0027s a solution to every movie. The solution shouldn\u0027t be too difficult, but we didn\u0027t find them in the past. Like, if Lan\u0027s mind control is stronger, she could use these two Aliens as our fighters and clear the way to the shuttle. We could have killed everything we saw. Haha. If we had a computer expert, he could stop the self-destruction. If we had someone that can operate the ship, he could isolate the areas, drive the ship to Earth and get the government to kill the Aliens.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So, any mission can become simple. We can earn more points and rewards. The key is to find the solution instead of following God\u0027s orders! This is the real evolution!\" \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both;\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-9-chapter-6-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-9-chapter-7-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-9-chapter-7-01","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
