But never mind. Take better care of them hereafter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ben stooped to pick up the bags. He had got hold of them when the tramp aimed a kick at him which completely upset him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Even though he fell, however, he did not lose his grip of the bags, but clung to them while crying with pain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Take that, you old fool!” muttered the tramp. “It’s the first installment of the debt I owe you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Take him away, take him away! He will murder me!” exclaimed old Ben, in terror.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Come along. You’ve done mischief enough,” said his captors, sternly, forcing the tramp along.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I’ll do more yet,” muttered Rudolph.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned to Tony, who stood at a little distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I’ve got a score to settle with you, young traitor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m sorry for you, Rudolph,” said Tony; “but you’ve brought it on yourself.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Bah! you hypocrite!” retorted the tramp. “I don’t want any of your sorrow. It won’t save you when the day of reckoning comes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was not allowed to say more, but was hurried away to the village lockup for detention.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Compton was among the party who had been summoned by Tony. He lingered behind, and took Ben apart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Hayden,” he said, “I want to give you a piece of advice.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What is it?” asked the old man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Don’t keep this gold in your house. It isn’t safe.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who do you think will take it?” asked Ben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e None of those here this morning, unless this tramp should escape from custody.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If he don’t, what danger is there?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It will get about that you have money secreted here, and I venture to say it will be stolen before three months are over.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It will kill me,” said Ben piteously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then put it out of reach of danger.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am going over to the county town, where there is a bank. Deposit it there, and whenever you want any go and get it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But banks break sometimes,” said Ben, in alarm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is an old established institution. You need not be afraid of it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But I can’t see the money—I can’t count it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You can see the deposit record in a book. Even if that doesn’t suit you as well, you can sleep comfortably, knowing that you are not liable to be attacked and murdered by burglars.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old man vacillated, but finally yielded to the force of the doctor’s reasoning. A day or two later he rode over to the neighboring town, and saw his precious gold deposited in the vaults of the bank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We are anticipating, however.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the confusion incident to the arrest was over, Tony came forward.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mr. Hayden,” he said, “you are so much better that I think you can spare me now.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But suppose Rudolph comes back.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t think he can. He will be put in prison.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I suppose he will. What a bold, bad man.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, he is a bad man, but I’m sorry for him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How did you come to be with him?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know, I have been with him as long as I can remember. You used to know him, didn’t you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A little,” said the old man hastily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where was it?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “In England—long ago.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “In England. Was he born in England?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do you think I am English, too?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I think so; yes, I think so,” answered Ben cautiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Have you any idea who I am—who were my parents?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t trouble me now,” said Ben peevishly. “I am not well. My head is confused. Some day I will think it over and tell you what I know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But if I am not here?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will write it down, and give it to the doctor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That will do,” said Tony. “I know he will keep it for me. Now, good-by.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Are you going?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, I have my own way to make in the world. I can’t live on you any longer.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To be sure not,” said Ben. “I am too poor to feed two persons, and you have a very large appetite.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” said Tony, laughing, “I believe I have a healthy appetite. I’m growing, you know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It must be that. What is your name?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is more than I know. I have always been called Tony, or Tony the Tramp. Rudolph’s last name is Rugg, and he pretends that I am his son.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You are not his son. He never had any son.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am glad to hear that. I shan’t have to say now that my father is in jail. Good-by, Mr. Hayden.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good-by,” said Ben, following the boy thoughtfully with his eyes, till he had disappeared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With a light heart, and a pocket still lighter, Tony walked on for several miles. Then he stopped at a country grocery store, and bought five cents’ worth of crackers. These he ate with a good appetite, slaking his thirst at a wayside spring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was lying carelessly on the greensward when a tin peddler’s cart drove slowly along the road.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hello, there!” said the peddler.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hello!” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you want a lift?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” said Tony, with alacrity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then get up here. There’s room enough for both of us. You can hold the reins when I stop anywhere.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It’s a bargain,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Are you travelin’ for pleasure?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “On business,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What is your business?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I want to find work,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You’re a good, stout youngster. You’d ought to get something to do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So I think,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Got any folks?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If you mean wife and children, I haven’t,” answered our hero, with a smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ho, ho!” laughed the peddler. “I guess not. I mean father or mother, uncles or aunts, and such like.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I am alone in the world.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sho! you don’t say so. Well, that’s a pity. Why, I’ve got forty-’leven cousins and a mother-in-law to boot. I’ll sell her cheap.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Never mind!” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll tell you what,” said the peddler, “I feel interested in you. I’ll take you round with me for a day or two, and maybe I can get you a place. What do you say?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, and thank you,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then it’s settled. Gee up, Dobbin!”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2019/57597.html","bookId":622,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:05 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:05 AM"}
