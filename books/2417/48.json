They\u0027re just trying to rattle you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re succeeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him about my afternoon—about the autopsy files from Frank, then about the warehouse address I\u0027d visited on PerrinBeitel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that place,\" Milo said. \"This is good, isn\u0027t it? The RIAA guy, Barrera—he\u0027ll need to move on it now, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ask Barrera, he\u0027ll tell you nothing\u0027s changed. There\u0027s still no evidence, no probable cause for a search. Just the fact I saw somebody there who I didn\u0027t like isn\u0027t enough. Barrera\u0027s willing to hold out another few years if it means strengthening his legal case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got until Friday,\" Milo muttered. \"And you\u0027re talking about years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barrera\u0027s technically correct,\" I said. \"There\u0027s nothing they can move on in what I\u0027ve found. At least not right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically correct,\" Milo grumbled. \"That\u0027s just great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll figure out something,\" I promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Les?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat one was harder to sound confident on. \"Consider him gone. For good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo was silent, probably trying to formulate some kind of B plan. When he spoke again his voice was strange, tightly controlled. \"I\u0027ll need to talk to Miranda. If we\u0027re going to have to come clean with Century when we bring them the tape, I need to talk to my client about strategy. She needs to know the risks. Maybe—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bring her by later tonight,\" I promised. \"It\u0027ll take a couple of hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My office at nine,\" he suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. And Barrera is good, Milo. The people he is working with are good. They will eventually put Sheckly\u0027s ass in a sling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other end of the line was deadly calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let it go, Milo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your office at nine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilo said sure. As he hung up he was still speaking, muttering unhappy and angry thoughts. I had the feeling I was no longer part of the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e53\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendoza Street ran along the eastern edge of the San Fernando Cemetery. On the lefthand side of the road the graveyard\u0027s chainlink fence tilted and bowed at irregular intervals, like a football team had been using it for blocking practice. Evening ground fog had thickened on the cemetery lawn, diluting the tombstones and the air and the trees into one grayish smear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the right side of the street was a line of box houses with brightly painted wood slat siding and burglar barred windows and worn tar shingle roofs. The yards were squares of crabgrass, some gravel, some display areas for broken furniture and tires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no kids in sight, nothing of value on the porches, no windows open, few cars parked on the street except those that had been stolen from other parts of town, then stripped and abandoned here. There were plenty of those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber 344 was a turquoise onebedroom in slightly better repair than the houses around it. Ralph\u0027s maroon Cadillac and a babyblue Camaro were in the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front yard was white gravel, decorated with bottle caps. The burglar bars on the screen door and windows were painted white and shaped like ivy, though they were so ornate and thick they reminded me more of a fused curtain of bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rang the bell and stood on the porch for about twenty seconds before Ralph answered the door, midlaugh. Somewhere behind him I could hear Miranda laughing too. The smell of mota smoke wafted out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh, vato.\" Ralph\u0027s glasses shimmered yellow in the porch light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood aside to let me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe living room was bare except for one brown couch opposite the window. The interior walls were stark white and the floors hardwood and several bullet holes in the ceiling had been imperfectly spackled over. Driveby souvenirs from the house\u0027s previous owner. Ralph had gotten the place cheap because of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough an archway I could see Miranda sitting at a dining table across from another woman. They were both laughing so hard they were wiping away tears. Miranda was still dressed as she had been this morning— in jeans, boots, and my Tshirt. Her face had more colour, though? her posture was a little less weigheddown. The other woman was a young Latina with long coppery hair and a bright yellow dress that showed lots of leg. She wore black pumps and silver earrings and makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the women saw me they both smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda said my name like it was a pleasant memory from twenty years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other woman got up and came to give me a hug. \"Hey, vaquero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed both my ears, then stepped back to appraise me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cally,\" I said. \"How you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asi asi.\" Then, still in Spanish, \"You\u0027ve got a nice lady here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Miranda, who was still smiling and wiping her eyes. There was only one lit joint in the room—in Ralph\u0027s hand—but there were assorted munchies on the table—bags of tortilla chips, a steaming canister of Ralph\u0027s homemade venison tamales, a plate of Ralph\u0027s special pan dulce—the kind with the green flecks in the icing. Uhoh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph saw my expression and spread his hands. \"Everything\u0027s cool, vato. Just relaxing, doing the grief process, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph shrugged, turned to Cally. \"Eh, mamasita, let\u0027s go out back, get Chico to take you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCally said goodbye to Miranda, gave her a hug, then kissed me one last time. Ralph gave us an amused grin, then led his lady friend out the screen door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the floodlit backyard, Chico of the yellow pirate bandanna and the easily kicked balls was working on a halfassembled Shelby. Ralph kept the car out there just for his grunts—sort of like the block table for kids at the doctor\u0027s office. Chico stopped messing with the fuel pump and quickly wiped his hands when Cally and Ralph came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat across the table from Miranda and turned the plate of laced pan dulce around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda blinked very slowly. \"Two? I don\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face was apparently good enough to warrant another laugh. She held her hand over her mouth, quivered silently for five beats, and then did a little snort on beat six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I shouldn\u0027t ask how you\u0027re feeling,\" I ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I just—it feels good to laugh, Tres. Cally\u0027s so nice. Ralph is really lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have they been together long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. \"Actually they\u0027re more like business partners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda frowned. She reached for another pan dulce before I moved the plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better not,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh—right.\" She went for the bag of Doritos instead, examined the plastic edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ralph and Cally told me not to be mad at you. They talk about you pretty highly— said you usually knew what you were talking about, even if it wasn\u0027t fun to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Ralph had finished giving Chico his orders. Ralph tossed him a set of car keys, then swatted Cally\u0027s behind by way of farewell. She grinned, then followed her yellow bandannaed chauffeur around the side of the house, out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I spoke to Allison today,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda smiled ruefully. \"My best friend in the whole world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her about Allison moving out, about the addresses we had tracked, about how I had some new information on Brent\u0027s murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda tried to pull her expression together, to anchor herself on my words. Her attention disintegrated quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small hole in the upper corner of the Dorito bag, much too little to get a chip through. The problem was too much for Miranda\u0027s stoned sensibilities. Finally she started breaking up chips inside the bag with one finger, getting them small enough to fit through the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy story faltered to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looked up, probably wondering why the sound of my voice had gone away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milo wanted to see you tonight, to talk strategy. Maybe I should call him, tell him tomorrow would be better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe processed those words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milo wants—\" Her voice trailed off, like she was just remembering that name. \"My brother is dead and Allison\u0027s leaving town and Milo wants to talk about Century Records.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car engine started in the driveway. Seconds later the headlights of the babyblue Camaro slipped through the livingroom window, over the couch and across the livingroom table, then disappeared down Mendoza Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda moved a small piece of tortilla chip across the table with her finger, like it was a checker. \"We should talk, Tres. Before we see Milo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The things you said last night, the way you made me out. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen door screaked open and Ralph came in alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned back toward Miranda. \"Like I said, tomorrow would be better. I\u0027ll call Milo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pinche Chavez,\" Ralph put in. \"This lady need help it ain\u0027t going to come from his sorry ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Miranda. She rewarded him with a faint smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked to the phone. Ralph sat where I had been sitting and helped himself to the tamales. As he pried off the canister lid a cloud of steam and cumin and spiced meat smells mushroomed up. He pulled out three of the tamales and began unshucking them. He told Miranda not to worry about a thing. We\u0027d be taking care of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladys answered the phone at the agency office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milo in?\" I asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladys sounded like she was shuffling furniture, or maybe moving quickly into another part of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tone was low and urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s out,\" she whispered. \"You mean you don\u0027t know—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur questions crossfired and tangled. We both backtracked and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"Tell me what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGladys told me how Milo had cancelled his dinner meeting with an important client, then stormed out of the office. He\u0027d thrown his pager on Gladys\u0027 desk on the way out, telling her \"Don\u0027t bother.\" He\u0027d said he had some business to take care of. Gladys had been worried enough to check Milo\u0027s desk, which she\u0027d been forbidden to do but which she apparently knew well enough to notice what was missing—the handgun Milo kept in the middle drawer. She had just assumed, me being the most disreputable person Milo knew, no offense of course, that he\u0027d gone somewhere with me. Gladys was about to tell me something else, something to justify her prying, but I cut her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten minutes?\" she said, plaintive, apologetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up and looked at Ralph, then at Miranda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Miranda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milo just left the office with a gun,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words took a while to impact, and even when they did the effect was dull. Miranda\u0027s brown eyes slid down to my chin, then my chest, then to her own hands. She pushed the Doritos away. \"You know where he\u0027s going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s trying something dangerous. For me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph ate, looking back and forth between us. His expression had all the depth of someone watching a barroom TV program. When he finished his tamale he wiped his hands and then spread them, a hereIam gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe so,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph slowly broke into a grin, like I\u0027d given him an answer he\u0027d been expecting for days. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-48.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
