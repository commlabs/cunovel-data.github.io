I don’t care anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get upstairs, I sit on the dirty bed, in the dirty room and stare at the text she sent him. When the phone goes black from lack of use, I press the button and make it come back to haunt me further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the phone back to my room and lie on my bed and stare at the words, \u0027girl I want to be\u0027 and try not to think of ways to make the white noise stop. Ways I promised Emalyn I wouldn’t do once I found her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eli, son. Hans from the architectural firm we own in Boston needs someone to meet him at Northeastern. Can you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost laugh but my dad wouldn’t get the joke. I nod, \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounds distant, \"Excellent. I\u0027m at the investors meeting for the bank so I\u0027ll be tied up all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"Did you fly here from France?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"No, we haven’t made it back there yet. Work and your mother\u0027s eye doctor appointments have made getting back impossible. Dinner tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Sure, can Stuart come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"Why do you ask every time. Of course he can. He\u0027s family. Franklin is making his favorite anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"Okay, I\u0027ll tell him when I see him at the gym later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good. I\u0027ll tell your mother. Love you, son.\" He hangs up and I don’t know what brought that on, but it makes me smile. He never says it. She doesn’t either. They\u0027ve been so odd lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get to the meeting early, not to be professional, but because I can see her window. It\u0027s ten hours until 8pm and I don’t know what I can possibly do to make her change her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dial Stuart and sit on the swept-off bench in the garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have dinner tomorrow night at Mom\u0027s. Franklin is making coq au vin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can almost hear Stuart\u0027s stomach start to growl, \"Mmmm, just what I need, some comfort food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear the tension in his voice, \"Want to hang out later?\" I don’t tell him why. I don’t tell him I\u0027m going to need to be drunk off my ass to stop myself from going and killing Sebastian. Not to mention, I keep forgetting to make his broken heart more important than my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the guy I\u0027m meeting and get up from the bench, \"Yeah. I need to get drunk. Just say if that’s what you want to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"It\u0027s exactly what I want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peace, bro.\" He hangs up and I can\u0027t help but feel a little better. He forces me to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man I recognize from the last time we met as a group, smiles, \"Mr. Adams, how nice to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"You as well, Hans. How is your wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, probably surprised at my recalling that. It\u0027s something my father taught me, in business remember everything. It makes people believe you\u0027re their friend and builds trust faster. For him trust means it\u0027s easier to pull the rug out from under people and get more, because they saw you coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake Hans\u0027 hand and know whatever my father has in store for the university, it can\u0027t be all good. Our architectural firm is renowned for tearing down old things and making them new, even when people like the old and the history that comes with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts talking but I see Sarah sneaking out of the building. Hans points in the direction she is walking. I nod and follow along, but I don’t listen to what he\u0027s saying. I just watch her avoiding me for all it\u0027s worth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"I think I trust you, and if you see something profitable for the company, or another way for us to make our mark and show people what a prestigious company we are, then you should go ahead with it.\" I grin, \"Hans, my major was business but my passion has never been architecture.\" I slap his arm, \"You know what you\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles back, \"I\u0027ll have the office forward over the design specs if you want to sign off on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod again, \"Good man, I\u0027ll have the accountants release the initial funds as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts his hand out. I shake it and try not to throw up. She hates me. I point at the dorm, \"I will chat with you later, I am just going to go inside and take a look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirks, \"Okay. Thanks for that, Eli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Enjoy this one a little, for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods, \"Alright.\" He waves and I walk inside, pulling one of my credit cards from my clip and heading for her room. I am stunned when I get in and it\u0027s sort of messy. Not filthy, just messy. It’s not the way her room was at the orphanage. There is a picture of her and Michelle on the wall. I smile when I see the smile on her face; it\u0027s the old broken one. I can\u0027t miss that sad, dead-eyed face if I try to force it. Even if she doesn’t pick me and love me, she is better off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on her bed and bounce to check the comfort. It\u0027s horrid. My back would be broken for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie back frowning; it\u0027s worse than I thought. It’s like lying on concrete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and see her face tilted up into the showerhead as I washed her hair. She was so beautiful, just as she was. I pull my phone out again and dial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince, \"I\u0027m not biting, you did that on purpose to provoke me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart laughs into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, \"She\u0027s going on a date with Sebastian tonight. What can I do to be a normal guy and take her out and do something that makes her like me more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"You did bang her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Never having this conversation with you. What can I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pauses for a second and then I can hear the smile on his face, \"Take her to Lance. She can see you being a normal guy doing a normal-guy thing. Go for a workout. Chicks dig hot, sweaty guys in boxing rings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"You saying I\u0027m hot, Stu?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffs, \"No. I\u0027ve seen you in the shower, bro. You\u0027re a hot mess, that\u0027s how you\u0027re hot. Trust me, man, take her to see Lance. He treats us like sons, she\u0027ll dig that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Okay. See you later.\" I hang up and think about her in a boxing ring. I can\u0027t see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear someone fumbling with the key and sit up. God knows what will walk in. Fortunately, it\u0027s her and she\u0027s alone. She looks confused. I pull her phone out of my pocket, \"You forgot something last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you pay for all my tuition for the next four years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh sweet Jesus, \"Stop being a pain in the ass. Do you know how hard it is to track you without the cell phone? Stuart and I literally have to follow you everywhere you go. It\u0027s annoying. Luckily, I had a meeting here today so I could return it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrinkles her nose, I love it. \"I don’t want any more help from you. I don’t want money or stuff or Stuart driving my ass around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore her, stand up and kiss her cheek, \"Are you angry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"Good.\" I take her hand and pull her to the door, \"I have something I want to show you and I sort of need you angry for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks behind me but gives my shoes an evil look, \"I want those damned shoes burned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea what she\u0027s talking about, \"Deal.\" I\u0027d agree to anything to make her happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still can\u0027t believe you kicked me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach drops, the shoes are the ones I was wearing then. I shake my head, \"I didn’t want to. I needed you to believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep telling yourself that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirk, \"Keep telling yourself the paddle doesn’t turn you on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs and blushes, and I hope we don’t have to talk about this anymore. The gym isn’t going to be very normal if we do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold her hand on the ride over and avoid Stuart\u0027s eyes in the rearview.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a breath like I am about to start the conversation about being good enough for her several times, but I just can\u0027t get it out. Instead, I sound like it\u0027s my first day breathing and I haven’t quite mastered it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart pulls up to the curb and I climb out, dragging her with me. I almost tell Stuart I\u0027ll see him later but I don’t. I don’t know how much she has figured out about us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelo walks up grinning widely as we get to the front door of the gym. He throws a hand out, \"Adams, yo. You\u0027re back.\" I slap hands with him, like we always do. It\u0027s urban but it\u0027s his greeting. I see his eyes noticing Sarah and his lips lifting at what he sees. I cock an eyebrow and point, \"This is Sarah Mastermen. Sarah, this is Angelo. He\u0027s a lightweight champ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngelo grins, \"I can strip weight off like a mutha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head subtly at him. He nods and gets the door, catching my silent signals of impending death if he even looks at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could just grunt and piss on her leg, making all other men aware of her being mine, I would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lead her to the change room, not thinking about it being a co-ed gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI change, sensing Angelo\u0027s awareness of the awkwardness. He changes much faster than normal and grins at Sarah on his way out, \"See you out there, Tinkerbell. Unless you chicken out. I understand if you’re too scared to do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort but she gives me a hateful look, \"Tinkerbell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, \"You do kind of look like her. Big blue eyes and light-yellow, blonde hair. I can see it.\" I pass her the bag of stuff I got Stuart to grab and nod at the changing closet, \"Go put this on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seems pissy and stalks off. I shake my head and try to loosen up, all the while chanting, \"be normal\" in my head. She is in there long enough for two guys to come and change. I glance at the clock and sigh. I want to say it isn’t a fashion show, but I settle for the thing I think will be worse, \"Let\u0027s go, Tink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckles, \"Fuck you, Eli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no response for that. Does she hate me completely? Why did she hold my hand and smile at me if she hates me? Does she tell Sebastian to fuck off? I bet not. The more I think about it, the madder I get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens the door and I snap, \"Do I ever speak to you that way?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-25.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
