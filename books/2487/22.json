It’s because there’s a shitload of us in here. Now here’s what’s gonna happen—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe left side of Justin’s scalp disappeared in a spray of pink brain matter. He was thrown backward, my finger squeezing the trigger as fast as it could twitch, the sound shattering the air. Little sprays of blood flicked out from Justin’s chest and thighs and gut, shots landing and backing him across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, Dave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had drawn the gun in a mindless reflex, like slapping at a mosquito bite. I tasted blood where I had bit through my lip. I felt electricity inside, the buzz of the violence, sparks raining down inside my skull as if from a blown fuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShitload stumbled backward one last time and fell against a wall, but kept his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the trigger again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed the trigger about twenty more times just to be sure there wasn’t another shot hiding in there somewhere. Shitload righted himself, looked down at his wounds, sighed like a man who has dropped his pie in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, you’ve got to be shitting me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw now that the white rods were binding up each of his wounds, forming a stitching like the back side of fiberglass. I finally realized I wasn’t fighting this kid, I was fighting those things. The fear was like lead weights in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “Man, your little nine is useless against—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words were cut off when the empty gun I hurled at him smacked off his cheek, knocking him backward once more. He brought a hand to his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop that shit! Don’t you know we got the same plan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step toward me. I looked across the room. The door. The window. I couldn’t make it to either without going through Shitload.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “We both goin’ to Vegas, right? You all packed up and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand at my side, I made a fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, I don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized once more that I was about to enter a fight and, again, had learned no fighting skills since the last one. Only this time there was a good chance the fight would end with me feeling the opponent’s teeth ripping out my eyeballs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure you is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lunged. I threw a flailing punch that missed by a foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Justin monster fired out a low punch, the impact exploding in my groin. I doubled over, struggled to keep my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The only difference is . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe advanced and in a blur threw three more punches that each landed solidly on my balls. A heavy sickness bloomed in my gut and I fell back against a chair. I awkwardly kicked at his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught the leg and delivered an expert crotch kick that finished me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . . I’m doin’ the drivin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJustin clasped both of his hands into one fist, raised it high above his head as if in victory and then with all his might brought it down on my groin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blacked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDARKNESS, BARKING AND footsteps. I felt Molly’s wet nose on my forehead, then felt her walking over me. All four paws managed to hit my aching crotch on the way over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the floor moving against me and realized I was being dragged. I was hefted over a shoulder like a sack of dog food and dropped onto a metal floor. A door clanged shut, a latch clicked into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the haze I felt the presence of others around me, could sense terrified thoughts darting around their minds like flies. I could sense the sauce in them, the soy sauce, I could smell it on their thoughts like alcohol on a wino’s breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVegas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a hallucination, or a vision. It was the road atlas, spread before me, the red highways tangled like arteries across the country. Undisclosed on the right, Las Vegas a red dot on the left, the line of an ink pen scratched along the highways joining the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were going there because he wanted us there. Not this Justin monster, either. Who?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soy sauce? Again I felt the presence of it in this space. Pulsing. A will of its own. The soy sauce was alive, I knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut beyond it, too, there was someone else. Something else. And every dark thing I had run into was working on its behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my vision, the map rustled. The red spot marking Las Vegas pulsed, as if something was pushing it from behind. Scratching. Like an animal trying to gnaw its way through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes snapped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was expecting to find myself inside Justin’s stolen ambulance. Instead I saw cardboard boxes stacked around me, each bearing liquor logos. There was a sweet, spoiled smell of ancient spilt beer around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on one stack was Big Jim Sullivan, copper hair capping 275 pounds of bulk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou should call home, Jim. Cucumber is worried about you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to Jim was a very pale and shaky Jennifer Lopez, scratched and dirty, wearing the same outfit from the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying across a row of green Heineken cases was a little, wiry man with shoulder-length hair and a goatee, whom I had never seen before and who, by process of elimination, had to be Fred Chu. He had his tattooed arms folded under his head and looked unharmed. Molly went and sat down in the middle of them, bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn sight of me, Fred Chu said, “Shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer buried her head in her hands and began weeping softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim said, “Hey, you found Molly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine started and we jolted into motion. I raised my head and looked around the dim cargo area. Among the crude beer-case furniture the passengers had stacked for themselves was a low, unoccupied seat of boxes in the corner, as if they had known I was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason this annoyed me so much I almost failed to notice that sitting in the corner, cross-legged and wearing hospital pajamas, was John. He stared intently at the wall, not blinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBig Jim said, “We’re moving again.” He reached down and stroked Molly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up. Big Jim turned his eyes on me, said, “We heard the shots. Are you the one who hurt him? I saw his head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was aiming for his heart but, yeah, I did get him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer sobbed the word, “Good.” An empty, flat, bitter sound. Jim turned toward the others and said, “Okay, we got one more hostage. We can still make it, guys. Just gotta believe, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pretended not to hear this, concentrated on not puking from my ball trauma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked Jen, “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJen nodded. “Where’s he taking us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Las Vegas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat drew stares from around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, seriously.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred Chu said, “The rest of us are fine, by the way. But you gotta understand what’s happenin’ here. The guy who attacked you, he ain’t no fuckin’ man, okay? He’s been invaded by fuckin’ body snatchers or whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—I mean if you saw what happened with Shelby. The Jamaican guy spat acid on her hand. The muscle and bone fell apart, just, like, dripped off like fuckin’ wax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of the ache in my groin, realized I had gotten off easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim said, “Justin is—or those things inside Justin—are evil. And I mean that as a noun, not an adjective. They’re the kind of physical manifestation that could only have been spawned by the Devil himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t . . . completely disagree with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, we’ve been praying,” continued Jim. “All of us, in a circle. Fred, Jen and me, even John, as best we could involve him. I had to threaten to beat them first but they joined in eventually. We prayed for someone to come along, to save us from whatever dark thing is up there behind the wheel. And then you showed up, like an answer. Now, you faced that thing. You stood up to it. You’ve been delivered to us, to be the voice to answer a question I have put to God over and over since this whole thing started: How do we kill it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Jim, that’s not the question. The question is, can it be killed at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pictured the map, and the rabid thing trying to claw through. I realized the scale was all wrong. To this thing, whatever it was, the real Las Vegas, the whole Earth, all of mankind, was as insignificant as the red dot on the map. I pictured a blue, knowing eye, in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that’s still the wrong question, isn’t it? Maybe Justin can be killed. Maybe not. And maybe it doesn’t mean a fucking thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked toward John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should be the one doing the talking. He’s been waiting his whole life for something like this, just to prove the universe is as retarded as he’s always pictured it in his head. I needed John to be here, alive and unafraid. I needed him to be John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned toward him and said, “Wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing. I looked back at Molly, then nudged John with my foot. “Wake up. Wake up, asshole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore nothing. I felt eyes on me, resisted the urge to punch John right in his stupid catatonic face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, we fucking need you. Now wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” A soft voice, from behind me. I turned and Jennifer Lopez’s wet eyes met mine. There was sympathy there, and I felt a tug from inside. Though that could have been one of my testicles detaching from the trauma. “Calm down, okay? You’re not helping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly stirred, looked around lazily and then trotted over to John’s frozen body. I stepped back as she nuzzled him, then flinched when I saw his hand reach over to pet her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a jolt through John’s body, like an electrical shock, so fast that we could barely process the change in posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he was on his feet, confused, looking at his hands like he was surprised to have them. Looking up, he seemed to see us for the first time and said to no one in particular, “I had a really vivid dream that I was a dog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT TOOK JOHN a while to come around. He knew we were in a beer truck piloted by some kind of infested evil, but seemed to have trouble adjusting to actually existing inside his body, in one physical location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got such a headache.” He searched his pockets, said, “Anybody have any smokes I could borrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one did. John took the empty seat, then turned his eyes on me and said, “Let’s, uh, start over. How many people do you see in here?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/john-dies-at-the-end-john-dies-at-the-end-1/page-22.html","bookId":2487,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:24 PM"}
