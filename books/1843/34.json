Since she couldn\u0027t get him to let go of the reins, she slipped off her horse and was walking at a fast pace away from him before he could summon a good argument to persuade her to take the shortcut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught up with her again. \"What do you think you\u0027re doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it look like I\u0027m doing? I\u0027m walking.

You won\u0027t force me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I won\u0027t force you. We\u0027ll take the long way around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a shrill whistle and raised his hand. Dylan immediately turned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she must be embarrassing Brodick because she couldn\u0027t go down a stupid hill. All of the soldiers were watching her, but fortunately they stayed where they were and therefore couldn\u0027t hear what she was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t wish to disgrace you in front of your good friend and your soldiers, but I swear that if you make me go down that cliff, I\u0027ll do just that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As terrified as you are, your concern is in the possibility of disgracing me? Ah, Gillian, you could never disgrace me. We\u0027ll take the long way around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxiety blended with relief. \"How much longer will it take us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It depends on how fast we ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long?\" she persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A full day,\" he admitted as he once again put his hand down to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That long? Even if we hurry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That long,\" he replied. \"Give me your hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can ride my horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would rather you ride with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backed away. \"Brodick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, lass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go down that cliff, don\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to do anything you don\u0027t want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and then clasped hold of his hand. Instead of swinging her up behind him, he changed his mind and lifted her onto his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel her shaking and sought only to comfort her. Wrapping his arms around her, he hugged her tight. \"This worry of yours…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s most unreasonable, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what has caused this fear? Did something happen that has made you so cautious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you mean cowardly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClasping her chin in his hand, he forced her to look up at him. \"Don\u0027t ever let me hear you say that about yourself again. You are not a coward. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say it,\" he commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a coward. You can stop squeezing me now,\" she suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited until he had relaxed his hold, then said, \"I\u0027ve made up my mind. We\u0027ll go down the cliff. We should go last, though,\" she hastened to add, hoping she\u0027d find a little courage while they waited their turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she insisted, though her voice was so weak she wasn\u0027t sure he heard her. \"And I\u0027ll ride my own horse,\" she added in a much stronger voice. \"I\u0027ll not have your men think I\u0027m a weakling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They could never think such a thing,\" he said as he prodded his horse back up the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t stop at the crest, nor did he slow his stallion\u0027s pace as he started down the narrow, winding path that led to Ramsey\u0027s holding. She buried her face in his plaid, wrapped her arms around his waist and demanded that he wait until everyone else had gone first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told her no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was still time to stop before they reached the steepest drop in the path, and she was going to make certain he did just that. She needed time to gather her courage. Why couldn\u0027t the mule-headed man understand that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to be last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to be first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to wait,\" she demanded shrilly. Panic was making her throat close, and all she could think about was falling down into an endless dark hole and never, ever stopping. The need to scream was overtaking her control, and, God help her, she was either going to throw up or faint at any second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brodick… I can\u0027t…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about all those impure thoughts you\u0027ve been having about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patiently repeated the question. His stallion stumbled, rocks trickled down the sheer rock into the mouth of the ravine below, making quite a clatter, but Brodick merely shifted his position in the saddle to help the horse regain his footing, and continued on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian, hearing the noise, was turning to look down when Brodick asked, \"In these impure thoughts, did we have our clothes on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer blush warmed her face. \"Our clothes?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In your fantasies about me…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t fantasies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure they were,\" he countered cheerfully. \"You told Laggan you were having impure daydreams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impure thoughts,\" she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you also said these… thoughts… were about me. Is that not so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, do be quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"So did we?\" he asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulders sagged. \"Did we what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have our clothes on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThoroughly rattled, she shouted, \"Of course we had our clothes on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then they couldn\u0027t have been very interesting impure thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you stop talking about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t proper, that\u0027s why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I have a right to know. You did say your impure thoughts were about me, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then? I want to know what I was doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes. \"You were kissing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it? Nothing else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you expect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A whole lot more,\" he said. \"Where was I kissing you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On my lips,\" she answered. \"Now will you stop this—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nowhere else?\" he asked, sounding disappointed again. \"Shall I tell you about some of my fantasies about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened. \"You\u0027ve had… thoughts… about me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I have, but my daydreams are far more interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to tell you about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and ignored her protest. \"You weren\u0027t wearing anything in my fantasies. No, that\u0027s not exactly true. You were wearing something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she shouldn\u0027t ask, but she couldn\u0027t stop herself. \"What was I wearing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent down and whispered into her ear, \"Me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jerked back and pushed against his chest with both hands. \"Oh, Good Lord,\" she cried out. \"We\u0027re both going to land in purgatory if we continue this sinful conversation. How could you know what I look like without my clothes on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A calculated guess,\" he answered. \"You\u0027re perfect, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your skin\u0027s silky and smooth, and in my fantasies, when I lie between your soft—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clasped her hand over his mouth to get him to stop. His eyes sparkled with pure devilment. He was outrageous, and perhaps it was that very trait that drew her to him. Brodick had somehow managed to free himself of all restrictions. He didn\u0027t seem to care what anyone else thought about him, and he didn\u0027t particularly want to impress anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished she could be that free. \"Being with you is a… liberating… experience,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t so bad, was it, milady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian jumped at the sound of Dylan\u0027s voice. \"I beg your pardon?\" she asked as she slowly removed her hand from Brodick\u0027s mouth. He grabbed it and kissed the palm. Shy all of a sudden, she pulled her hand back before Dylan caught up with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ride down wasn\u0027t so bad, was it?\" Dylan repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up at the rocks, shook her head, and burst into laughter. \"No, it wasn\u0027t bad at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, she was once again riding her own horse. Deciding to take the lead, she nudged the mare into a trot, and as she passed Brodick and Ramsey, she called out, \"You used trickery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did,\" he admitted. \"Are you angry with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed again. \"I don\u0027t get angry. I get even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbeknownst to her, she had just recited the Buchanan creed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey Sinclair\u0027s home was majestic. It sat atop a plateau rising up in the middle of a magnificent valley that was bordered by steep cliffs on one side and lofty, rolling hills on the other. A glistening carpet of grass, sprinkled with the new sprigs of heather the wind had planted, covered the land for as far as the eye could see, and the scent of heather and pine drifted on the afternoon breeze and blended with the pungent aroma of smoke pouring from the thatched cottages. The laird\u0027s massive stone castle towered protectively over the houses that dotted the landscape beneath it, and a wall of timber and stone circled the perimeter of the entire community, offering safety to the clan within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy, iron-hinged gates opened, and Ramsey and his guests entered his estate. A resounding cheer echoed around them as soldiers came running to greet their laird. A fair number of young ladies also came running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately Gillian was surrounded by Brodick\u0027s overly protective guard. Aaron moved in front or her, Dylan and Robert positioned themselves beside her, and Liam rode behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs impossible as it was for her to see much of anything with the guards\u0027 wide shoulders blocking her view, she still tried to look at every face in the crowd. Though it would be wonderful, as well as miraculous, if she could find Christen immediately, Gillian knew it wasn\u0027t going to be that easy. Yet each time she spotted a yellow-haired woman, her heart leapt with that impossible hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick and Ramsey had dismounted and were now surrounded by soldiers. Gillian patiently waited for Brodick to remember her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you see him, milady?\" Dylan asked in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The traitor,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m sorry. I wasn\u0027t looking for…\" she said as she once again tried to search through the crowd. \"Not yet,\" she whispered back. \"There are so many here…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of Ramsey\u0027s men aren\u0027t here,\" Dylan explained. \"They are most likely still training in the field behind the castle. Aye, I\u0027m certain they are, or Gideon would be here to greet his laird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Gillian continued to look over the crowd, a few curious and bold MacPherson soldiers, wearing their clan\u0027s plaid, moved closer to get a better look at her. One young, foolish man dared to step a little too close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack Robert nudged his mount forward, forcing the man to step to the side or be run over. In a voice dripping with venom, he ordered, \"You will stop staring at the lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burly soldier glanced at his friends, then turned back to Robert with an insolent sneer on his face. \"Or what?\" he challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert wasn\u0027t impressed with the man\u0027s bluster. Before the soldier realized his intent, Robert leaned down, grabbed him by the throat and lifted him up to eye level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or I\u0027ll break every bone in your body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MacPherson soldier was a big man, but Robert had lifted him as though he weighed no more than a twig. The remarkable feat of strength astounded her. And so did his poor manners. \"Robert, please put that boy down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish, milady,\" Robert grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick happened to turn just as Robert sent the soldier flying. The man landed in the center of his friends. Shaking his head, Brodick threaded his way through the crowd, but stopped in front of the prone and dazed MacPherson. \"Robert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t like the way he was staring at milady, Laird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier tried to get up, but Brodick put his booted foot on his chest to hold him down. \"How was he staring at her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With insolence,\" Robert answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s very beautiful,\" the soldier said somewhat defiantly. \"If I want to look upon her, I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick glanced down at the man and began to apply pressure on his chest with his foot. \"Yes, she is very beautiful,\" he agreed pleasantly. \"But I don\u0027t like it when any other man stares at her.\" Increasing the pressure until the soldier\u0027s face was bright red and he was gasping for breath, Brodick added, in a decidedly menacing voice, \"I don\u0027t like it at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey appeared at his side. \"Let him up,\" he ordered. Brodick stepped back and watched as the soldier regained his feet. Then Ramsey stepped forward and shoved the man so forcefully he landed on his backside again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will apologize to Laird Buchanan now,\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buchanan?\" he gasped. \"He\u0027s Laird Buchanan? I didn\u0027t know…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey took another threatening step toward him. The soldier scrambled to his feet and blurted, \"I apologize, Laird Buchanan. I will not ever look upon your woman again. I swear it on my father\u0027s head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey wasn\u0027t satisfied. He\u0027d noticed that the soldier and his friends were still wearing the MacPherson plaid. \"You will wear my colors or you will get the hell off my land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian watched Ramsey in amazement. Until that moment she had thought he was a mild-mannered gentleman. Judith Maitland had told her that whenever Iain wanted an alliance, he always sent Ramsey as his spokesman to work out the details because he was so diplomatic. He certainly wasn\u0027t being diplomatic now. In fact his temper rivaled Brodick\u0027s. Knowing that she was the cause of his anger embarrassed her, and she glared at Robert to let him know what she thought about his behavior in inciting the incident, but the soldier defended his actions by whispering, \"He was being insolent, milady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not think he was,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I did, milady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe set of his jaw indicated he thought he was right, and Gillian decided not to argue further with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s Gideon,\" Aaron said. \"You should speak to him, Dylan. Word has it he believes he\u0027s your equal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large group of soldiers came swarming over the hills on both sides of the castle, and Gillian, squinting against the sunlight, couldn\u0027t see their faces. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-34.html","bookId":1843,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM"}
