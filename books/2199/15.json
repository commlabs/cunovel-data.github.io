He grinned when he saw me, and I was glad to give him a hug. Most people wouldn\u0027t have been pleased to see a mentally defective vampire with a penchant for cat blood, but I\u0027d become fond of Bubba.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you get back in town?\" I asked. Bubba had gotten caught in New Orleans during Katrina, and he\u0027d required a long recovery. The vampires were willing to accommodate him, because he had been one of the most famous people in the world until he\u0027d been brought over in a morgue in Memphis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Bout a week ago. Good to see you, Miss Sookie.\" Bubba\u0027s fangs slid out to show me how glad. Just as quickly, they snicked back into concealment. Bubba still had talent. \"I\u0027ve been traveling. I\u0027ve been staying with friends. But I was in Fangtasia tonight visiting Mr. Eric, and he asked if I\u0027d like the job of keeping watch over you. I told him, \u0027Miss Sookie and me, we\u0027re real good friends, and that would suit me just fine.\u0027 Have you gotten another cat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Bubba, I haven\u0027t.\" Thank God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I got me some blood in a cooler in the back of my car.\" He nodded toward a huge old white Cadillac that had been restored with time and trouble and lots of cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, the car\u0027s beautiful,\" I said. I almost added, \"Did you own it while you were alive?\" But Bubba didn\u0027t like references to his former state of existence; they made him upset and confused. (If you put it very carefully, from time to time he\u0027d sing for you. I\u0027d heard him do \"Blue Christmas.\" Unforgettable.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Russell give that to me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Russell Edgington? The King of Mississippi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, wasn\u0027t that nice? He said since he was king of my home state, he felt like giving me something special.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s he doing?\" Russell and his new husband, Bart, had both survived the Rhodes hotel bombing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s feeling real good now. He and Mr. Bart are both healed up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad to hear it. So, are you supposed to follow me home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\u0027m, that\u0027s the plan. If you\u0027ll leave your back door unlocked, close to morning I\u0027ll get into that hidey-hole in your guest bedroom; that\u0027s what Mr. Eric said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was doubly good that Octavia had moved out. I didn\u0027t know how she would have reacted if I\u0027d told her that the Man from Memphis needed to sleep in her closet all day long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got home, Bubba pulled in right behind me in his amazing car. I saw that Dawson\u0027s truck was there, too. I wasn\u0027t surprised. Dawson worked as a bodyguard from time to time, and he was in the area. Since Alcide had decided he wanted to help, Tray Dawson was an obvious choice, regardless of his relationship with Amelia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTray himself was sitting at my kitchen table when Bubba and I came in. For the first time since I\u0027d known him, the big man looked seriously startled. But he was smart enough not to blurt anything out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tray, this is my friend Bubba,\" I said. \"Where\u0027s Amelia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s upstairs. I got some business to talk with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured. Bubba\u0027s here for the same reason. Bubba, this is Tray Dawson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Tray!\" Bubba shook hands, laughing because he\u0027d made a rhyme. He hadn\u0027t translated real well. The spark of life had been so faint by the time a morgue attendant of the fanged persuasion had gotten hold of him, and the drugs in his system so pervasive, that Bubba had been lucky to survive the bringing over as well as he had, which wasn\u0027t too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Tray said cautiously. \"How are you doing ... Bubba?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was relieved Tray\u0027d picked up on the name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m real good, thank you. Got me some blood in the cooler out there, and Miss Sookie keeps some TrueBlood in the refrigerator, or at least she used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I have some,\" I said. \"You want to sit down, Bubba?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am. I think I\u0027ll just grab me a bottle and settle down out in the woods. Bill still live across the cemetery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always good to have friends close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure I could call Bill my friend; our history was too complicated for that. But I was absolutely sure that he\u0027d help me if I was in danger. \"Yes,\" I said, \"that\u0027s always good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBubba rummaged around in the refrigerator and came out with a couple of bottles. He raised them to me and Tray, and took his leave smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good God Almighty,\" Tray said. \"That who I think it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and took a seat opposite him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explains all the sightings,\" he said. \"Well, listen, you got him out there and me in here. That okay with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I guess you\u0027ve talked to Alcide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I\u0027m not trying to get in your business, but it would have been better to hear all this from you directly. Especially since you talked to Amelia about this guy Drake, and Amelia\u0027s all upset because apparently she\u0027s been blabbing to the enemy. If we\u0027d known about your troubles, she would have kept her mouth shut. I would have killed him when he first introduced himself. Saved all of us a lot of trouble. You think about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBluntness was the way to go with Tray. \"I think you are kind of getting in my business, Tray. When you\u0027re here as my friend and Amelia\u0027s boyfriend, I tell you what I think I can without endangering you or Amelia. It never occurred to me that Niall\u0027s enemies would think of getting information through my roommate. And it was news to me that you couldn\u0027t tell a fairy from a human.\" Tray winced. \"You may not want to be responsible for guarding me, with the personal complication of having your girlfriend under the same roof as the woman you\u0027re supposed to protect. Is this too big a conflict of interest for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTray regarded me steadily. \"No, I want the job,\" he said, and even though he was a Were, I could tell that his real goal was keeping Amelia safe. Since she lived with me, he could kill two birds with one stone by getting paid for protecting me. \"For one thing, I owe that Drake payback. I never knew he was a fairy, and I don\u0027t know how he managed that. I got a good nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTray\u0027s pride had been bruised. I could understand that. \"Drake\u0027s dad can mask his smell, even from vampires. Maybe Drake can, too. Also, he\u0027s not completely fae. He\u0027s half-human, and his real name is Dermot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTray absorbed this, nodded. I could tell he felt a little better. I was trying to figure out if I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had misgivings about the arrangement. I thought of calling Alcide and explaining why Tray might be a less than perfect bodyguard, but I decided against it. Tray Dawson was a great fighter and would do his best for me ... up to the point where he had to make a choice between Amelia and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" he said, and I realized I\u0027d been quiet for too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The vampire can take the nights and you can take the days,\" I said. \"I should be okay while I\u0027m at the bar.\" I pushed back my chair and left the kitchen without saying anything else. I had to admit that instead of feeling relieved, I was even more worried. I\u0027d thought I\u0027d been so clever asking for an extra layer of protection; instead, now I was going to worry about the safety of the men providing that layer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got ready for bed slowly, finally admitting to myself that I was hoping Eric would put in an appearance. I\u0027d love to have his brand of relaxation therapy to help me sleep. I expected to lie awake anticipating the next attack. As it turned out, I was so tired from the night before that I drifted off to sleep very quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of my usual boring dreams (customers calling me constantly while I hurried to catch up, mold growing in my bathroom), that night I dreamed of Eric. In my dream, he was human and we walked together under the sun. Oddly enough, he sold real estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I looked at the clock the next morning, it was very early, at least for me: not quite eight o\u0027clock. I woke up with a feeling of alarm. I wondered if I\u0027d had another dream, one I didn\u0027t remember. I wondered if my telepathic sense had caught something even while I slept, something wrong, something askew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a moment to scan my own house, not my favorite way to start the day. Amelia was gone, but Tray was here and in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put on a bathrobe and slippers and stepped out into the hall. The moment I opened my door, I could hear him being sick in the hall bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some moments that should be completely private, and the moments when you\u0027re throwing up are at the top of that list. But werewolves are normally completely healthy, and this was the guy who\u0027d been sent to guard me, and he was obviously (excuse me) sick as a dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited until a lull in the sound. I called, \"Tray, is there anything I can do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been poisoned,\" he said, choking and gagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I call the doctor? A human one? Or Dr. Ludwig?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" That sounded definite enough. \"I\u0027m trying to get rid of it,\" he gasped, after another bout of retching. \"But it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know who gave it to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. That new girlfriend ...\" He faded out for a few seconds. \"Out in the woods. Vampire Bill\u0027s new fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had an instinctive reaction. \"He wasn\u0027t with her, right?\" I called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she - \" More awful noises. \"She came from the direction of his house, said she was his ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew, without a doubt, that Bill didn\u0027t have a new girlfriend. Though it embarrassed me to admit it to myself, I was so sure because I knew he wanted me back. I knew he wouldn\u0027t jeopardize that by taking someone else to his bed or by permitting such a woman to roam in the woods where I might encounter her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was she?\" I said, resting my forehead against the cool wood of the door. I was getting tired of yelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was some fangbanger.\" I felt Tray\u0027s brain shift around through the fog of sickness. \"At least, she felt like a human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same way Dermot felt human. And you drank something she handed you.\" It was kind of mean of me to sound incredulous, but honestly!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t help it,\" he said very slowly. \"I was so thirsty. I had to drink it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been under some kind of compulsion spell. \"And what was it? The stuff you drank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It tasted like wine.\" He groaned. \"Goddammit, it must have been vampire blood! I can taste it in my mouth now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVampire blood was still the hot drug on the underground marketplace, and human reactions to it varied so widely that drinking the blood was very much like playing Russian roulette, in more ways than one. Vampires hated the Drainers who collected the blood because the Drainers often left the vampire exposed to the day. So vampires also loathed the users of the blood, since they created the market. Some users became addicted to the ecstatic sensation that the blood could offer, and those users sometimes tried to take the blood right from the source in a kind of suicide attack. But every now and then, the user went berserk and killed other humans. Either way, it was all bad press for the vamps who were trying to mainstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you do that?\" I asked, unable to keep the anger out of my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t help it,\" he said, and the bathroom door finally opened. I took a couple of steps back. Tray looked bad and smelled worse. He was wearing pajama pants and nothing else, and a vast expanse of chest hair was right at my eye level. It was covered in goose pimples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t ... not drink it.\" He shook his head. \"And then I came back here and got in bed with Amelia, and I tossed and turned all night. I was up when the K - when Bubba came in and went to bed in your closet. He said something about a woman talking to him, but I was feeling really bad by then, and I don\u0027t remember what he said. Did Bill send her over here? Does he hate you that bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up then and met his eyes. \"Bill Compton loves me,\" I said. \"He would never hurt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even now that you\u0027re screwing the big blond?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia couldn\u0027t keep her mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even now that I\u0027m screwing the big blond,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t read vampire minds, Amelia says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I can\u0027t. But some things you just know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Though Tray didn\u0027t have enough energy to look skeptical, he gave it a good shot. \"I have to go to bed, Sookie. I can\u0027t take care of you today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see that. \"Why don\u0027t you go back to your own house and try to get some rest in your own bed?\" I said. \"I\u0027m going to work today, and I\u0027ll be around someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you gotta be covered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call my brother,\" I said, surprising even myself. \"He\u0027s not going to work now, and he\u0027s a panther. He should be able to watch my back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" It was a measure of Tray\u0027s wretchedness that he didn\u0027t argue, though he wasn\u0027t a Jason fan by any means. \"Amelia knows I\u0027m not feeling good. If you talk to her before I do, tell her I\u0027ll call her tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe werewolf staggered out to his truck. I hoped he was good to drive home, and I called after him to make sure, but he just waved a hand at me and drove down the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling oddly numb, I watched him go. I\u0027d done the prudent thing for once; I\u0027d called in my markers and gotten protection. And it hadn\u0027t done me a bit of good. Someone who couldn\u0027t attack me in my home - because of Amelia\u0027s good magic, I had to assume - had arranged to attack me in other ways. Murry had turned up outside, and now some fairy had met up with Tray in the woods, compelling him to drink vampire blood. It might have sent him mad; he might have killed all of us. I guess, for the fairies, it was a win-win situation. Though he hadn\u0027t gone crazy and killed me or Amelia, he\u0027d gotten so sick that he was effectively out of the bodyguard business for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked down the hall to go into my room and pull on some clothes. Today was going to be a hard day, and I always felt better when I was dressed while handling a crisis. Something about putting on my underwear makes me feel more capable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got my second shock of the day when I was about to turn into my room. There was a movement in the living room. I stopped dead and took a huge, ragged breath. My great-grandfather was sitting on the couch, but it took me an awful moment to recognize Niall. He got up, regarding me with some astonishment while I stood gasping, my hand over my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look rough today,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, not expecting visitors,\" I said breathlessly. He wasn\u0027t looking so great himself, which was a first. His clothes were stained and torn, and unless I was much mistaken, he was sweating. My fairy prince great-grandfather was actually less than gorgeous for the very first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved into the living room and looked at him more closely. Though it was early, I had my second stab of anxiety for the day. \"What\u0027s up?\" I asked. \"You look like you\u0027ve been fighting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated for a long moment, as if he was trying to pick among several items of news. \"Breandan has retaliated for the death of Murry,\" Niall said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What has he done?\" I scrubbed my dry hands across my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He caught Enda last night, and now she is dead,\" he said. I could tell from his voice that her death had not been a quick one. \"You didn\u0027t meet her; she was very shy of humans.\" He pushed back a long strand of his pale hair so blond it looked white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breanden killed a fairy woman? There aren\u0027t that many fairy women, right? So doing that ... isn\u0027t that extra awful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was intended to be,\" Niall said. His voice was bleak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, I noticed that my great-grandfather\u0027s slacks were soaked with blood around the knees, which was probably why he hadn\u0027t come closer to hug me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to get out of those clothes,\" I said. \"Please, Niall, go climb in the shower, and I\u0027ll put your stuff in the washing machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go,\" he said, and I could tell my words hadn\u0027t registered. \"I came here to warn you in person, so you would take the situation very seriously. Powerful magic surrounds this house. I could appear here only because I\u0027d been in here before. Is it true that the vampires and the Weres are looking out for you? You have extra protection; I can feel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a bodyguard night and day,\" I lied, because he didn\u0027t need to be worrying about me. He was hip-deep in alligators himself. \"And you know that Amelia is a strong witch. Don\u0027t worry about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me, but I didn\u0027t think he was seeing me at all. \"I have to go,\" he said abruptly. \"I wanted to be sure of your well-being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay ... thanks a lot.\" I was trying to think of an improvement on this limp response when Niall poofed right out of my living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d told Tray I was going to call Jason. I wasn\u0027t sure how sincere I\u0027d been about that, but now I knew I had to. The way I saw it, Alcide\u0027s favor to me had expired; he\u0027d asked Tray to help, and now Tray was out of commission in the course of duty. I sure wasn\u0027t going to request that Alcide himself come guard me, and I wasn\u0027t close to any of his pack members. I took a deep breath and called my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jason,\" I said when he answered the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sis. What\u0027s up?\" He sounded oddly jazzed, as if he\u0027d just experienced something exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tray had to leave, and I think I need some protection today,\" I said. There was a long silence. He didn\u0027t rush into questioning me, which was strange. \"I was hoping you could go around with me? What I plan on doing today,\" I began, and then tried to figure out what that was. It was hard to have a good crisis when real life kept asking to be lived. \"Well, I need to go to the library. I need to pick up a pair of pants at the dry cleaners.\" I hadn\u0027t checked the label before that particular purchase. \"I have to work the day shift at Merlotte\u0027s. I guess that\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Jason said. \"Though those errands don\u0027t sound exactly urgent.\" There was a long pause. Suddenly he said, \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said cautiously. \"Should I not be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The weirdest thing happened this morning. Mel slept at my place last night, since he was the worse for wear after he met me at the Bayou. So early this morning, there was a knock at the door. I answered it, and this guy was there, and he was, I don\u0027t know, nuts or something. The strangest part was, this guy looked a lot like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no.\" I sat on the stool abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wasn\u0027t right, sis,\" Jason said. \"I don\u0027t know what was wrong with him, but he wasn\u0027t right. He just started talking when Mel answered the door, like we knew who he was. He was saying crazy stuff. Mel tried to get between him and me, and he threw Mel clear across the room and called him a killer. Mel might\u0027ve broken his neck if he hadn\u0027t landed on the couch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mel\u0027s okay, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, he\u0027s okay. Pretty mad, but you know ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Mel\u0027s feelings were not the most important issue here. \"So what did he do next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said some shit about now that he was face-to-face with me he could see why my great-grandfather didn\u0027t want me around, and crossbreeds should all die, but I was clearly blood of his blood, and he\u0027d decided I should know what\u0027s going on around me. He said I was ignorant. I didn\u0027t understand a lot of it, and I still don\u0027t get what he was. He wasn\u0027t a vamp, and I know he wasn\u0027t a shifter of any kind or I\u0027d\u0027ve smelled him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re okay - that\u0027s the big thing, right?\" Had I been wrong all along about keeping Jason out of the fairy loop?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said, his voice abruptly going all cautious and wary. \"You\u0027re not going to tell me what this is all about, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come over here, and we\u0027ll talk about it. Please, please, don\u0027t open the door unless you know who\u0027s there. This guy is bad, Jason, and he\u0027s not picky about who he hurts. I think you and Mel were real lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got someone there with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not since Tray left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m your brother. I\u0027ll come over if you need me,\" Jason said with unexpected dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really appreciate that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got two for the price of one. Mel came with Jason. This was awkward, because I had some family stuff to tell Jason, and I couldn\u0027t with Mel around. With unexpected tact, Mel told Jason that he had to run home and get an ice pack for his shoulder, which was badly bruised. While Mel was gone, I sat Jason down on the other side of the kitchen table, and I said, \"I got some things to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About Crystal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I haven\u0027t heard anything about that yet. This is about us. This is about Gran. You\u0027re going to have a hard time believing this.\" I\u0027d given him fair warning. I remembered how upset I\u0027d been when my great-grandfather had told me about how my half-fairy grandfather, Fintan, had met my grandmother, and how she\u0027d ended up having two children with him, our dad and our aunt Linda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Fintan was dead - murdered - and our grandmother was dead, and our father and his sister were dead. But we were living, and just a small part fairy, and that made us a target for our great-grandfather\u0027s enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And one of those enemies,\" I said after I\u0027d told him our family history, \"is our half-human great-uncle, Fintan\u0027s brother, Dermot. He told Tray and Amelia that his name was Drake, I guess because it sounded more modern. Dermot looks like you, and he\u0027s the one who showed up at your house. I don\u0027t know what his deal is. He joined up with Breandan, Niall\u0027s big enemy, even though he\u0027s half-human himself and, therefore, exactly what Breandan hates. So when you said he was crazy, I guess there\u0027s your explanation. He seems to want to connect with you, but he hates you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason sat staring at me. His face was completely vacant. His thoughts had gotten caught in a traffic jam. Finally he said, \"You tell me he was trying to get Tray and Amelia to introduce you? And neither of them knew what he was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. There was some more silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why did he want to meet you? Did he want to kill you? Why\u0027d he need to meet you first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Maybe he just wanted to see what I was like. Maybe he doesn\u0027t know what he really wants.\" I couldn\u0027t figure this out, and I wondered if Niall would come back to explain it to me. Probably not. He had a war on his hands, even if it was a war being fought mostly away from human view. \"I don\u0027t get it,\" I said out loud. \"Murry came right here to attack me, and he was all fairy. Why is Dermot, who\u0027s on the same side, being all ... indirect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murry?\" Jason asked, and I closed my eyes. Shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a fairy,\" I said. \"He tried to kill me. He\u0027s not a problem now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason gave me an approving nod. \"You go, Sookie,\" he said. \"Okay, let me see if I\u0027m getting this straight. My great-grandfather didn\u0027t want to meet me because I look a lot like Dermot, who\u0027s my ... great-uncle, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Dermot apparently likes me a little better, because he actually came to my house and tried to talk to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust Jason to interpret the situation in those terms. \"Right,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason hopped to his feet and took a turn around the kitchen. \"This is all the vampires\u0027 fault,\" he said. He glared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think so?\" This was unexpected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they hadn\u0027t come out, none of this would be happening. Look at what\u0027s happened since they went on TV. Look at how the world has changed. Nowwe\u0027re out. Next, the fucking fairies. And the fae are bad news, Sookie; Calvin warned me about \u0027em. You think they\u0027re all pretty and sweetness and light, but they\u0027re not. He\u0027s told me stories about them that would make your hair curl. Calvin\u0027s dad knew a fairy or two. From what he\u0027s said, it would be a good thing if they died out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t decide if I was surprised or angry. \"Why are you being so mean, Jason? I don\u0027t need you arguing with me or saying bad things about Niall. You don\u0027t know him. You don\u0027t ... Hey, you\u0027re part fairy, remember!\" I had an awful feeling that some of what he\u0027d said was absolutely true, but it sure wasn\u0027t the time to have this discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason looked grim, every plane of his face tense. \"I\u0027m not claiming kin to any fairy,\" he said. \"He don\u0027t want me; I don\u0027t want him. And if I see that crazy half-and-half again, I\u0027ll kill the son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what I would have said, but at that moment Mel came in without knocking, and we both turned to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry!\" he said, obviously flustered and disturbed by Jason\u0027s anger. He seemed, for a second, to think Jason had been talking about him. When neither of us gave him a guilty reaction, he relaxed. \"Excuse me, Sookie. I forgot my manners.\" He was carrying an ice bag in his hand, and he was moving a little slowly and painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry you got hurt by Jason\u0027s surprise visitor,\" I said. You\u0027re always supposed to put your company at ease. I hadn\u0027t put a whole lot of thought into Mel, but right at that second I realized I would have been happier if Jason\u0027s former BFF, Hoyt, had been here instead of the werepanther. It wasn\u0027t that I disliked Mel, I thought. It was just that I didn\u0027t know him very well, and I didn\u0027t feel an automatic trust in him the way you feel about people from time to time. Mel was different. Even for a werepanther, he was hard to read, but that didn\u0027t mean he was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter offering Mel something to drink, which was only polite, I asked Jason if he was going to stay the day, run around on my errands with me. I had serious doubts he would say yes. Jason was feeling rejected (by a fairy great-grandfather he\u0027d never met and didn\u0027t want to acknowledge), and that was a state of affairs Jason didn\u0027t handle well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go around with you,\" he said, unsmiling and stiff. \"First, let me run over to the house and check out my rifle. I\u0027ll need it, and it hasn\u0027t been sighted in a coon\u0027s age. Mel? You coming with me?\" Jason simply wanted to be out of my presence to calm down. I could read it as easily as if he\u0027d written it on the grocery list pad by the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel rose to go with Jason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mel, what did you make of Jason\u0027s visitor this morning?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aside from the fact that he could throw me across the room and looked enough like Jason to make me turn to make sure your brother was coming out of his bedroom? Not much,\" Mel said. Mel had managed to dress in his usual khakis and polo shirt, but the blue bruises on his arms kind of ruined his neat appearance. He shrugged on a jacket with great care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you in a while, Sookie. Come around to get me,\" Jason said. Of course, he\u0027d want to ride in my car and burn up my gas, since we were running my errands. \"In the meantime, you got my cell number.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I\u0027ll see you in an hour or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince being alone hadn\u0027t been a normal state of affairs for me lately, I would have actually enjoyed the feeling of having the house to myself if I hadn\u0027t been worried that a supernatural killer was after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened. I ate a bowl of cereal. Finally, I decided to risk taking a shower despite myPsycho memories. I made sure all the outside doors were locked, and I locked the bathroom door, too. I took the quickest shower on record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody had tried to kill me yet. I dried off, put on some makeup, and dressed for work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was time to go, I stood on the back porch and eyeballed the distance between the steps and my car door, over and over. I figured I\u0027d have to take ten steps. I unlocked the car with the keypad. I took a few deep breaths and unlocked the screen door. I pushed it open and fairly leaped off the porch, bypassing the steps entirely. In an undignified scramble, I yanked open the car door, slid inside, and slammed and locked the door. I looked around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed a little breathlessly. Silly me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing so tense was making all the scary movies I\u0027d ever seen pop into my head. I was thinking of Jurassic Park and dinosaurs - maybe my thought link was that fairies were the dinosaurs of the supernatural world - and I half expected a piece of goat to fall on my windshield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn\u0027t happen, either. Okay ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inserted the key and turned it, and the motor turned over. I didn\u0027t blow up. There was no Tyrannosaurus in my rearview mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, so good. I felt better once I\u0027d begun going slowly down the driveway through the woods, but I was sure keeping my eyes busy. I felt a compulsion to get in touch with someone, to let someone know where I was and what I was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whipped my cell phone out of my purse and called Amelia. When she answered, I said, \"I\u0027m driving over to Jason\u0027s. Since Tray is so sick, Jason\u0027s going around with me today. Listen, you know Tray was spelled by a fairy into drinking rotten vampire blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m at work here,\" Amelia said, caution in her voice. \"Yes, he called ten minutes ago, but he had to go throw up. Poor Tray. At least the house was okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia\u0027s point was that her wards had held. Well, she had a right to be proud of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re great,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Listen, I\u0027m really worried about Tray. I tried calling him back after a few minutes, but he didn\u0027t answer. I hope he\u0027s just sleeping it off, but I\u0027m going over there after I leave work. Why don\u0027t you meet me there? We can figure out what to do about getting you some more security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll come over right after I get off work, probably around five.\" Phone in my hand, I jumped out and grabbed the mail from my mailbox, which sat up on Hummingbird Road. Then I got back in my car quick as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been stupid. I could have gone without checking the mail for one day. Habits are very hard to break, even when they\u0027re unimportant habits. \"I really am lucky you live with me, Amelia,\" I said. That might have been spreading it on a little thick, but it was the absolute truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Amelia had gone off on another mental path. \"You\u0027re speaking to Jason again? You told him? Aboutthings ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I had to. Great-grandfather can\u0027t have everything his own way. Stuff has happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It always does, around you,\" Amelia said. She didn\u0027t sound angry, and she wasn\u0027t condemning me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not always,\" I said after a sharp moment of doubt.In fact, I thought, as I turned left at the end of Hummingbird Road to go to my brother\u0027s,that point Jason made about everything changing when the vamps came out ... that just might have been something I really agree with .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProsaically, I realized my car was almost out of gas. I had to pull into Grabbit Quik. While I was pumping the liquid gold into my car, I fell back to puzzling over what Jason had told me. What would be urgent enough to bring a reclusive and human-hating half fairy to Jason\u0027s door? Why would he tell Jason ... ? I shouldn\u0027t be thinking about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was stupid, and I should be watching out for myself instead of trying to solve Jason\u0027s problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after a few more seconds of turning the conversation over in my head, I began to have a sneaking suspicion that I understood it a little better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Calvin. At first he didn\u0027t get what I was saying, but then he agreed to meet me at Jason\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught a glimpse of Jason in the backyard when I pulled into the circular driveway of the neat, small house my dad had built when he and my mother were first married. It was out in the country, out farther west than Arlene\u0027s trailer, and though it was visible from the road, it had a pond and several acres lying behind it. My dad had loved to hunt and fish, and my brother did, too. Jason had recently put in a makeshift range, and I could hear the rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to come through the house, and I took care to yell when I was at the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Jason called back. He had a 30-30 in his hands. It had been our father\u0027s. Mel was standing behind him, holding a box of ammo. \"We decided we better get in some practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea. I wanted to be sure you didn\u0027t think I was your crazy caller, come back to yell some more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason laughed. \"I still don\u0027t understand what good Dermot thought he\u0027d do, coming up to the front door like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I do,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason held out his hand without looking, and Mel gave him some bullets. Jason opened the rifle and began loading. I looked over at the sawhorse he\u0027d set up, noted all the empty milk jugs lying on the ground. He\u0027d filled them with water so they\u0027d sit steady, and thanks to the bullet holes, the water was flowing out onto the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good shooting,\" I said. I took a deep breath. \"Hey, Mel, you want to tell me about Hotshot funerals? I haven\u0027t ever been to one, and Crystal\u0027s will take place as soon as the body comes back, I reckon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel looked a little surprised. \"You know I haven\u0027t lived out there for years,\" he protested. \"It\u0027s just not for me.\" Except for the fading bruises, he didn\u0027t look like he\u0027d been thrown across the room by anyone, much less a crazed half fairy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder why that guy threw you around instead of Jason,\" I said, and felt Mel\u0027s thoughts ripple with fear. \"Are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved his right shoulder a little. \"I thought I\u0027d broken something. But I guess it\u0027s just going to be sore. I wonder what he was. Not one of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t answered my question, I noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason looked proud that he hadn\u0027t blabbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not entirely human,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel looked relieved. \"Well, that\u0027s good to know,\" he said. \"My pride was pretty much shot to hell when he threw me around. I mean, I\u0027m a full-blood panther, and it was like I was kindling or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason laughed. \"I thought he\u0027d come on in and kill me then, thought I was a goner. But once Mel was down, this guy just started talking to me. Mel was playing possum, and here\u0027s this fella looks a lot like me, telling me what a favor he\u0027s done me ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was weird,\" Mel agreed, but he looked uncomfortable. \"You know I\u0027d\u0027ve been on my feet if he\u0027d started punching on you, but he really rang my bell, and I figured I might as well stay down once it looked like he wasn\u0027t going to go after you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mel, I hope you\u0027re really okay.\" I made my voice concerned, and I moved a little closer. \"Let me have a look at that shoulder.\" I extended my hand, and Jason\u0027s eyebrows knit together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you need to ... ?\" An awful suspicion was creeping over his face. Without another word, he stepped behind his friend and held him firm, his hands gripping Mel on either side right below Mel\u0027s shoulders. Mel winced with pain, but he didn\u0027t say anything, not a word; he didn\u0027t even pretend to be indignant or surprised, and that was almost enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put a hand on either side of Mel\u0027s face, and I closed my eyes, and I looked in his head. And this time Mel was thinking about Crystal, not Jason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did it,\" I said. I opened my eyes and looked at my brother\u0027s face across Mel\u0027s shoulder. I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason screamed, and it wasn\u0027t a human sound. Mel\u0027s face seemed to melt, as if all the muscles and bones had shifted. He hardly looked human at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me look at you,\" Mel pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason looked confused, since Mel was looking at me; he couldn\u0027t look anywhere else, the way Jason was holding him. Mel wasn\u0027t struggling, but I could see every muscle under his skin standing out, and I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d be passive forever. I bent down and picked up the rifle, glad Jason had reloaded it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants to look at you, not me,\" I told my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddammit,\" Jason said. His breathing was heavy and ragged as if he\u0027d been running, and his eyes were wide. \"You have to tell me why .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back and raised the rifle. At this distance, even I couldn\u0027t miss. \"Turn him around, since he wants to talk to you face-to-face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in profile to me when Jason spun Mel around. Jason\u0027s grip refastened on the werepanther, but now Jason\u0027s face was a foot from Mel\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalvin walked around the house. Crystal\u0027s sister, Dawn, was with him. There was also a boy of about fifteen trailing along. I remembered meeting the boy at the wedding. He was Jacky, Crystal\u0027s oldest first cousin. Adolescents practically reek of emotion and confusion, and Jacky was no exception. He was struggling to conceal the fact that he was both nervous and excited. Maintaining a cool demeanor was just killing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three newcomers took in the scene. Calvin shook his head, his face solemn. \"This is a bad day,\" he said quietly, and Mel jerked at the sound of his leader\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the tension leaked out of Jason when he saw the other werepanthers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sookie says he did it,\" he said to Calvin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good enough for me,\" Calvin said. \"But, Mel - you should tell us yourself, brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not your brother,\" Mel said bitterly. \"I haven\u0027t lived with you for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was your own choice,\" Calvin said. He walked around so he could see Mel\u0027s face, and the other two followed him. Jacky was snarling; any pretense at being cool had vanished. The animal was showing through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t anyone else in Hotshot like me. I would have been alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason looked blank. \"There are lots of guys in Hotshot like you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Jason,\" I said. \"Mel\u0027s gay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not okay with that?\" my brother asked Calvin. Jason hadn\u0027t yet gotten the party line on a few issues, apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re okay with people doing what they want to do in bed after they\u0027ve done their duty to the clan,\" Calvin said. \"Purebred males have to father a young \u0027un, no matter what.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t do it,\" Mel said. \"I just plain couldn\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you were married once,\" I said, and wished I hadn\u0027t spoken. This was a matter for the clan now. I hadn\u0027t called Bud Dearborn; I\u0027d called Calvin. My word was good enough for Calvin, not for court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our marriage didn\u0027t work in that department,\" Mel said. His voice sounded almost normal. \"Which was okay with her. She had her own fish to fry. We never had ... conventional sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I found this distressing, I could only imagine how hard it had been for Mel. But when I remembered what Crystal had looked like up on that cross, all my sympathy drained away in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you do that to Crystal?\" I asked. I could tell from the rage building in the brains around me that the time for talking was almost over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel looked beyond me, past my brother, away from his leader, his victim\u0027s sister and cousin. He seemed to be focused on the winter-bare limbs of the trees around the still, brown pond. \"I love Jason,\" he said. \"I love him. And she abused him and his child. Then she taunted me. She came here that day... . I\u0027d stopped off to get Jason to help me build some shelves at the shop, but he wasn\u0027t here. She drove up while I was out in the yard writing Jason a note. She began to say ... she said awful things. Then she told me I had to have sex with her, that if I did, she\u0027d tell them at Hotshot and I\u0027d be able to go back to live there, and Jason could come live with me. She said, \u0027His baby\u0027s inside me; doesn\u0027t that get you all hot?\u0027 And it got worse and worse. The bed of the truck was down because the wood I\u0027d bought was sticking out, and she kind of backed up to it and lay down, and I could see her. It was ... she was ... she kept telling me what a pussy I was and that Jason would never care about me ... and I slapped her as hard as I could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn Norris turned to one side as though she was going to throw up. But she pressed her lips together in a hard line and straightened up. Jacky wasn\u0027t that tough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wasn\u0027t dead, though.\" My brother forced the words between his clenched teeth. \"She bled all down the cross. She lost the baby after she\u0027d been hung up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about that,\" Mel said. His gaze returned from the pond and the trees and focused on my brother. \"I thought the blow had killed her - I really did. I would never have left her to go in the house if I\u0027d thought she was still alive. I would never have let someone else get her. What I did was bad enough, because I intended for her to die. But I didn\u0027t crucify her. Please believe me. No matter what you think of me for hurting her, I would never have done that. I thought if I took her somewhere else, no one would think you did it. I knew you were going out that night, and I figured if I put her somewhere else, you\u0027d have an alibi. I figured you\u0027d end up spending the night with Michele.\" Mel smiled at Jason, and it was such a tender look that my heart ached. \"So I left her in the back of the truck, and I came in the house to have a drink. And when I came back out, she was gone. I couldn\u0027t believe it. I thought she\u0027d gotten up and walked away. But there wasn\u0027t any blood, and the wood was gone, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why Merlotte\u0027s?\" Calvin said, and his voice came out like a growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Calvin,\" Mel said. His face was almost sublime with his relief from the load of his guilt, with the release of confessing his crime and his love for my brother. \"Calvin, I know I\u0027m about to die, and I swear to you that I have no idea what happened to Crystal after I went into the house. I did not do that horrible thing to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what to make of that,\" Calvin said. \"But we have your confession, and we\u0027ll have to proceed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I accept that,\" Mel said. \"Jason, I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn turned her head just a fraction so her eyes could meet mine. \"You better go,\" she said. \"We got things to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked off with the rifle, and I didn\u0027t turn to look even when the other panthers began to tear Mel apart. I could hear it, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t scream after a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left Jason\u0027s rifle on his back porch, and I drove to work. Somehow having a bodyguard didn\u0027t seem important anymore. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-and-gone-sookie-stackhouse-9/page-15.html","bookId":2199,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:55 PM"}
