{"id":84866,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eI had taken a circuitous route to make sure Sally\u0027s car was indeed at the library. It was, and I dropped her off right by it with some relief. I watched her unlock it and climb in the driver\u0027s seat. I wondered what to do, and then I realized that it wasn\u0027t up to me to do anything. This situation was Perry\u0027s responsibility, and all I could do was be a friend to him so he could talk if he needed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI patted him on the shoulder when I passed him in the employees\u0027 lounge, and he looked up at me and nodded, a short, jerky nod of acknowledgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made an appointment with Dr. Zelman for her next week,\" he said. \"She tries to cover it up, and she\u0027s pretty good at it, but it\u0027s getting worse and worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere really wasn\u0027t anything else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two remaining hours of work flew by. There were lots of people coming in and out, lots of computer use, and the book order to complete. When it was time for me to clock out, I was actually glad. There were so many ways for me to go, I couldn\u0027t pick one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy plans for the rest of the afternoon took an unexpected turn when I went to the employee parking lot and found Bryan Pascoe leaning on my car. His office was within easy walking distance of the library; it was in the old, ambience-laden, inconvenient Jasper Building, which also held Cartland Sewell\u0027s office. So it had been easy for Bryan Pascoe to get where he was. The question was why he was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Teagarden,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mr. Pascoe,\" I said, and even I could hear the question clearly in my voice. It was a relief not to have to tilt my head back to look Bryan Pascoe in the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out his hand, and I shook it. He had fine bones. \"Please call me Bryan,\" he said politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bryan,\" I murmured, and retrieved my hand. \"Aurora,\" I said after a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother, Phillip, said you tried to call me? I would have returned your calls.\" I wanted to be sure Bryan Pascoe marked the fact that he was pushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I wanted to talk to you face-to-face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I said hesitantly when he\u0027d been at a full stop for a long moment. \"Did you want to go to your office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we walk around the block? I\u0027ve been shut in my office all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was brisk, but not truly cold. \"Certainly,\" I said after an uncertain pause. What the heck was going on here? \"My legs are short, I don\u0027t go at a very quick pace.\" Robin always seemed to be two paces ahead of me. Thinking about Robin instantly made me feel bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your legs are fine,\" he said, again catching me off balance, and off we went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has something come up about John David?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027ve talked to Miss Burns. For the moment, she backs up John David a hundred percent. She says he was doing legal work for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced sideways at Bryan, and he smiled at me. He had gleaming white teeth. \"She\u0027s been drawing up her will, she says,\" Bryan added in an absolutely neutral way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Poppy were alive, Romney Burns\u0027d need it.\" I found myself smiling back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s interesting. Did you see your sister-in-law as a jealous woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mulled that over. \"I don\u0027t think she would have wanted to be humiliated, if John David decided to divorce her, or something about his little relationships became flagrant. Like him taking Romney to the company Christmas party, or something like that,\" I said finally. \"I guess that\u0027s different from being gut-jealous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel about that?\" the lawyer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like that was a strange question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped and faced him. Luckily, we were on the sidewalk by the side of the little downtown movie theater, and no one was going in or out at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What difference does that make?\" I could feel my eyebrows drawing together in a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Personal curiosity,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why you want to know.\" But I could see no reason to refuse to tell him, either. \"I thought it was really... distasteful,\" I said, selecting the mildest word that would fit. \"Though I\u0027m not an angel myself, for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you giving me your opinion in such a tentative way? You don\u0027t have to attach disclaimers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know you. For all I know, you cheat on your wife every day,\" I said bluntly. \"I hate to sound holier-than-thou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you call me yesterday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John David thought of you. You\u0027re the best, I hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, Aurora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like I was missing something here. \"I\u0027m glad to know you\u0027re so confident,\" I said a little dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was glad to hear your voice on the phone yesterday. I\u0027ve had my eye on you for quite some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027ve done something illegal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I want to date you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were married, Bryan,\" I said, genuinely astonished. Come to think of it, he had mentioned \"ex-wife\" yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was, for five years. We got divorced over a year ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" I said, feeling like he\u0027d just smacked me in the head with a dead fish, or something equally startling. \"Well, Bryan, I\u0027m real flattered, but I\u0027ve been dating Robin Crusoe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" He smiled again. His smile managed to be confident, predatory, and hopeful, all at the same time. \"But my sources tell me he\u0027s been flirting with Janie Spellman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch,\" I said sharply. \"That was below the belt. Who\u0027s your source?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not bound by law to cover for her. My source is Janie Spellman herself, who is my cousin once removed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Janie is not too particular about whom she flirts with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re angry, but you can\u0027t deny it,\" Bryan said unequivocally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have to reply any way at all, deny or admit or any which thing.\" I glared up at him. \"In fact, this part of our conversation is over.\" Suddenly, I thought of the gas station receipt in my purse. I couldn\u0027t let anything slip by just because I was irritated with Bryan. \"Now, I need to talk business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk away.\" If I\u0027d in any way ruffled Bryan, he wasn\u0027t letting it show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explained about finding the receipt that morning, about its significance, and told him the names of the people who\u0027d been in my house. Then I looked at my watch and exclaimed, \"Oh no! I have to be at Poppy\u0027s right now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\" Bryan had listened to my account very carefully, which had made me feel better about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Scene Clean guy is supposed to be at John David and Poppy\u0027s house,\" I explained. \"Someone called from SPACOLEC to say the house had been... well, released. So I called Zachary Lee and confirmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see the crime scene anyway. Can I come with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so,\" I said ungraciously. We walked back to the library parking lot and I unlocked my Volvo. Bryan talked about local politics all the way over to Swanson Lane. I felt the touch of his attention every time he looked at me, and he looked at me a lot. My cheeks were hot by the time we parked behind a bright yellow van with scene clean and a logo on the side. At least there were no macabre graphics. I fussed with my keys, yanked at my purse, anything to avoid looking into the eyes of the man beside me. We got out of the car and stood at the end of the walkway leading up to the front door. A young man with Asian features was waiting for us. He was absorbed in a book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was nervous about going into the house again. \"I\u0027m glad Arthur released the house,\" I said, just to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet Arthur has had a rough couple of days,\" Bryan said, clearly inviting me to ask why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any murder investigation ...\" I said slowly. \"But that\u0027s not what you\u0027re implying, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you have heard that Poppy used to see him. A couple of years ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was going to pass right out. I could actually feel the blood rush from my head. Bryan put his left arm around me and held on to my right hand with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good God,\" I said, trying to gain some time. \"But then he should be the last man on earth to be involved in investigating her death!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan said, \"Do you feel all right? Wasn\u0027t he your fianc¨¦ at one time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, shaking my head to clear it out. \"No, we never... Did you do that on purpose? Spring that on me? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did date him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About a million years ago. Way before I married Martin.\" I gave him an incredulous look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wondered if Arthur had a thing for the women in your family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re confusing me.\" I stepped away from his arm and walked up the sidewalk to the door, just as I\u0027d done yesterday. I faltered for a moment as that comparison hit me, then picked up my stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan was beside me by then. \"Hello,\" he said to the young man waiting on the ornamental bench outside Poppy\u0027s front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zachary Lee?\" I asked as he rose. Zachary Lee was much taller than I\u0027d expected, maybe six feet, and looked like a very happy mix of Caucasian and Asian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s me,\" he said happily. \"Zachary Lee, Scene Clean, at your service. I\u0027m a certified crime-scene cleaner, and I\u0027ve had extensive experience with the Atlanta Police Department. I took a course to learn how to do this properly, and I follow all safety and health regulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe beamed at us. Apparently, Zachary Lee enjoyed his work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did the police give you the okay?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am, and Mr. Queensland, the husband of the deceased, gave me his permission to do the job. By the way, he said to tell you thanks.\" Zachary\u0027s teeth were perfectly straight and white, and his eyes tilted pleasantly when he smiled, which seemed to be most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Aurora Teagarden,\" I said, \"and this is Bryan Pascoe, Mr. Queensland\u0027s lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pleased to meet you\" was said all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me just show you the, um, site,\" I said, fumbling with the words. \"Mr. Pascoe wants to have a look before you clean it. I\u0027ll wait here until you\u0027re through, then lock up after you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Zachary Lee looked less than happy, probably at the idea of us sitting around the crime scene while he worked. But I wanted to see him off the premises, and just generally keep an eye on him. The young man was probably perfectly all right, but we knew very little about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house had been closed, and it smelled less than wonderful. Poppy would have been embarrassed. There was the awful smell of blood, and the more mundane odor of a much-used litter box. Once again, I was distressed that Moosie hadn\u0027t been found. Somehow, the cat\u0027s disappearance was an insult to Poppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what you did yesterday when you came in,\" Bryan said, and I thought maybe he was distracting me. I was grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went upstairs,\" I said. \"No one was there. I came back down and went toward the kitchen.\" I guided him down the short hall into the kitchen, where everything was the same as it had been, except for fingerprint powder. We stepped around the counter, and I waved a hand weakly toward the spot where Poppy had lain. The gesture was hardly necessary. The blood was a powerful testimony. In fact, seeing it like this - dried and dark - made its impact somehow more violent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Zachary Lee went over to the sliding glass door to have a look outside, I felt that my head was buzzing just a bit. I put a hand out to Poppy\u0027s breakfast bar, which was laden with bright cookbooks and dried flowers, to steady myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, Bryan steered me out of the kitchen/dining room and into the living room. Instead of depositing me on the couch, he put his arms around me. And he didn\u0027t say a word. His left hand stroked my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really liked that silence. Robin, since words were his livelihood, never quite seemed to know when they weren\u0027t necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, there\u0027s nothing upstairs?\" Zachary Lee asked from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to pull away, but Bryan Pascoe\u0027s arms tightened. \"The fingerprint dust,\" he said. \"No blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" the cleanup guy said, happy once again. \"Why don\u0027t you two sit out by the pool? It\u0027s a beautiful day. I\u0027ve got to go suit up and bring in my gear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBizarre as it seemed at first, that turned out to be excellent advice. As we walked out the front door and around to the gate at the side of the house (rather than crossing the bloody threshold of the sliding glass door), Bryan gave me rather unnecessary help. I have to confess I enjoyed it, after coping with Phillip and the assorted shocks of the past twenty-four hours. Sometimes I just didn\u0027t understand myself. Half of me wanted to stand upright and independent, and half of me wanted to lean against someone stronger. Possibly the answer could be found in a good partnership, in which one could take turns leaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one of those unexpected little moments of clarity that make life so frightening, I realized (as I sat by the pool of a murdered woman, being comforted by an attentive lawyer) that my first marriage had not been such a partnership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right?\" Bryan was saying anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m fine.\" I sounded like a polite robot. I shook myself a little. \"Thank you for asking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that awkward juncture, another presence made itself known. Teresa Stanton, Uppity Woman par excellence, swept through the patio gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor Aurora!\" Teresa called. Teresa was a terrifying woman. I hadn\u0027t known that a pantsuit with matching jacket was the appropriate outfit to wear to the house of a murdered woman; until I saw Teresa, that is. She wore one, dark burgundy with golden brown touches, and so that was exactly the right thing. Teresa\u0027s dark hair was beautifully cut and blow-dried, so the short sides fanned back from her face, her makeup was discreet, and her teeth were perfectly white. Intelligence gleamed through her contact lenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Teresa,\" I muttered. Bryan, of course, stood. I suddenly remembered that the woman to whom Bryan had been married was the newly rewed Teresa Stanton. Teresa Pascoe Stanton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had the devil\u0027s own time catching up to you,\" Teresa said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hardly felt I needed to apologize. \"This has been a very busy day,\" I said noncommittally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, of course! No doubt! Hello, Bryan.\" Teresa made sure we knew she was adding the greeting as an elaborate afterthought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Teresa, good to see you,\" he said, his voice cool and un-inflected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried real hard to think of a good excuse to get up and run away, but none popped to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that man doing there?\" Teresa asked, distracted by Zachary Lee, who appeared to be wearing a space suit. He was working right inside the sliding glass door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s cleaning up the blood,\" I said. Of course, that didn\u0027t faze Teresa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad you were able to find someone who does that sort of thing,\" she said conversationally. \"Where\u0027s your Mr. Crusoe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" I refused to explain or elaborate. I wondered what she would do if I asked her where Shorty Stanton was. I was so powerfully tempted that I actually opened my mouth, but then common sense prevailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, all the women in the club want to know what we can do to help,\" Teresa said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Melinda needs some baby-sitting,\" I suggested. \"Since she\u0027s got her own two kids and Poppy\u0027s boy, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeresa wrote this down on her little pocket notebook. \"What else?\" she asked. \"We\u0027ve already taken food to your mother\u0027s house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rethink backing Bubba Sewell for representative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think he is involved with Poppy\u0027s death?\" Teresa was nothing if not direct, if she thought directness would serve her purposes best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, actually, I don\u0027t, but I think his reputation may take a beating if the investigation ends in a trial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it\u0027s true: He was messing around with Poppy.\" Teresa looked very cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t meet her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who can\u0027t keep his pants zipped,\" Teresa said flatly. \"We don\u0027t want that in a public servant. I think we\u0027ve all seen enough of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all fell silent, and in that sudden hush I could hear the splash of the pool across the privacy fence. Some music was playing, too; it sounded like Handel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cara!\" Teresa called. \"Are you doing your laps? Can you take a break?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that Teresa?\" a high voice hooted back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, girl. Come over here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a little-used gate in the high privacy fence between the two properties. It made a high-pitched squeak as Cara Embler pushed it open. Cara was pulling off a swim cap as she walked toward us, and she\u0027d wrapped a big towel around her because it was a brisk, cool day. Her hairstyle had been chosen to complement her athleticism; she wore her blond hair (now mixed with gray) short and straight. Cara had been a champion swimmer in high school and college, and someone had told me that she was training for a seniors competition. Lawrenceton people were bemused by Cara - swimming in all temperatures, goal-oriented - but they respected her dedication and her excellent physical condition. Married to a cardiologist who seemed always to be on call, Cara had a lot of time to shape as she pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the Emblers had a son, who was studying to be an environmental engineer or something equally laudable, he was in college in northern California and seldom came home. So Cara swam, ran, dabbled in political causes, tutored kids at the junior high, and organized the annual fund-raising drive for the United Way. She had a couple of dogs, schnauzers; she was famous locally for going to any lengths to help the pound raise money, and she was ferocious about turning in animal abusers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t understand why she hadn\u0027t been on the list for Uppity Women years ago, but I figured that by now she should be fairly close to the top of the list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s John David?\" Cara asked me. She plopped down into one of the lawn chairs, draping her head and neck with yet another towel. The day was cool enough that I would have been shivering had I been wet, but Cara seemed impervious to the temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About like you\u0027d expect.\" Actually, I hadn\u0027t seen John David since yesterday, and I had no idea how he was holding up. But somehow, that didn\u0027t seem the right thing to confess. I was a little surprised that Cara asked. I hadn\u0027t been aware she\u0027d ever had a conversation with John David.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is just awful, and in the house right behind me,\" Cara went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t thought of that. I would sure be scared, too. In fact, I\u0027d be shaking in my shoes. But Cara seemed concerned, not frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear anything peculiar?\" Teresa asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara, who was somewhere between forty and fifty, shrugged her muscular shoulders. \"No, the day was just as usual. Swam in the morning, decorated the house for Thanksgiving, went to lunch with a friend, came back, did my second set of laps -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that\u0027s when I heard a lot of coming and going over here - and then in the late afternoon, I made plans for a Christmas party my husband and I are giving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sure that Cara Embler\u0027s plans for a party would be somewhat more sophisticated and complex than mine would be. Probably the guests would be more sophisticated, too, if they were from her husband\u0027s workplace. Did you entertain cardiologists and hospital administrators the same way you did, oh, say realtors and librarians? The wine would have to be better for the hospital people... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aurora,\" Teresa was saying none too gently. \"Are you listening to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. I saw Bryan turn hastily to one side to conceal a smile. Maybe I had been a tad blunt. \"Sorry, I was drifting,\" I murmured. \"What were you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was reminding Cara that she was next on the list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day after Poppy had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeresa was not Ms. Sensitive, but this was callous, even for her. We all regarded her in a long moment of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The circumstances take most of the zest out of becoming an Uppity Woman,\" Cara said finally, looking past Teresa\u0027s shoulder as she spoke. \"Give me a call to let me know the time and place. If you leave it on my machine, I\u0027ll write it down. I can\u0027t remember anything if you tell me away from a pad and pencil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know how that is,\" Teresa agreed. \"I live by my Day Planner.\" She was quite oblivious to her offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who on earth is that?\" Cara asked. She, too, had caught a glimpse of Zachary Lee in his space suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan took on the duty of explaining, What a long day it had been. And there was more to come. But I roused myself to ask Cara if she\u0027d seen Moosie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep an eye out for him,\" she promised. \"He\u0027s a cute cat. I personally don\u0027t believe in declawing, but I know the rationale was that declawing would keep him from climbing the fence and wandering the neighborhood. I guess Poppy\u0027s heart was in the right place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t have Moosie declawed,\" I told her. \"She adopted him like that. He was in the animal shelter. Just give me a call if you catch sight of him. I know John David would like to know Moosie is safe.\" If John David had had a chance to think about the cat at all: In his place, I wasn\u0027t sure I would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara excused herself and went back to her side of the fence. Before she left, she glanced once more at Zachary Lee, who\u0027d opened the sliding door to clean its runners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" Teresa said in the hushed voice you reserve for passing along scandal, \"Stuart Embler used to drop by to see Poppy before he headed home, at least before Poppy had the baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t heard Cara splashing in the water, and I hoped she was not standing right on the other side of the fence, listening. To my relief, I heard her dogs barking as she slid open her own glass patio door. They were welcoming her back into the house with rapture, it sounded like. Maybe I should get a dog, I thought. Then I thought about what Madeleine would do to a dog, and I canceled the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan had a certain amount of distaste in his face as he looked at his former wife, but he also looked interested. \"I wonder where Stuart was yesterday around eleven,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That should be easy enough to find out. But I\u0027d be extremely surprised if Stuart had anything to do with this. His affair with Poppy was stale, and he wouldn\u0027t care if there was a little scandal anyway. Cardiologists can call the shots. I mean, if you had a sick heart, and this guy was the best chance of your surviving, would you care if you heard he\u0027d had an extramarital roll in the hay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see Teresa\u0027s point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way, Aurora, speaking of extramarital affairs,\" Teresa began, and my eyes fixed on her. \"Rumor has it that you saw someone leaving this house yesterday as you pulled up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow the hell had such a story started making the rounds?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet it was a man. Or the wife of some man she\u0027d been carrying on with.\" Teresa\u0027s face was avid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, my voice as cold as a Tastee-Freez Coke slush. \"That is not true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, my goodness, I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t realize I was hitting a nerve. We all figured you\u0027d about got this solved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think I blinked at all as I glared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan said, \"Isn\u0027t there somewhere you need to be, Teresa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped dead, her mouth open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve come by, you\u0027ve given your condolences, and you\u0027ve gotten some suggestions of ways the Uppities can help. I\u0027m sure you have another errand or appointment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do need to stop by the store, and phone the committee members,\" she said slowly. Her face was red. \"Good-bye, Aurora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGosh, I just loved seeing Teresa upbraided. Not the most pleasant side of my character, I\u0027m afraid. \"Good-bye,\" I said politely and distantly, and Bryan stood as Teresa did, then opened the gate to the front yard for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t help it, you know,\" he said when he sat in the chair beside mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize that she has many fine qualities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised one eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She runs the Uppity Women smooth as a whistle,\" I told him. \"She\u0027s organized and focused, and we do a lot of good under her leadership.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was married to her. I know just how organized and focused she can be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you\u0027ve been divorced for a year?\" Was it tacky to mention that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She married Shorty Stanton about seven months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He works at one of the banks, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s the president of Southern Security,\" Bryan said a little dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, big money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forbore remarking that Bryan himself couldn\u0027t be hurting for a healthy cash flow, unless he had a secret vice like gambling or drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about the car.\" His voice was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the crouching, dim figure of the crime-scene cleaner. He was working on the glass again now. I considered and discarded several responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see any car,\" I said very carefully. \"But I did find evidence that someone had been here before we got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know who it was,\" Bryan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him sideways. \"No wonder you have such a good reputation as a lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s deserved, I promise you. Who was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you that right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you care more about this person than about your sister-in-law?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat took him aback, but the lawyer rallied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t trust me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you about the receipt,\" I remarked mildly. \"And I\u0027ll tell you something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his hand palm up, meaning, Give.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone\u0027s been in the house since yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This house?\" He pointed at it, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The upstairs curtains are closed. They were open yesterday when I was up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan stared at the curtains in the master bedroom as if they could tell him why they were pulled together. \"Maybe the police closed them last night, so no one could see what they were doing,\" he suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan seemed to give up. \"Let\u0027s go check it out. I believe the man is telling you he\u0027s finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, Zachary Lee had emerged from the house, unsuited, looking cheerful as ever. \"I\u0027ve got the rug rolled up and in my van; here\u0027s a receipt,\" he said. \"I\u0027m going to take it back to the shop and work on it. Everything else is done. You\u0027ll need to call a regular housecleaning service to get everything else back to normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel that little frown of confusion contracting my brows. \"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The upstairs. I went up to clean up the fingerprint powder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the upstairs?\" I cast a sideways glance at Bryan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This wasn\u0027t a homicide during a burglary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had better show us what you mean,\" Bryan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, I walked through every room of the ground floor, and it all looked normal. Upstairs, though, was a different story. The room that had received the most attention was the master bedroom. Everything was tossed around, as if a demented child had had a field day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t look like this when you found the body?\" Bryan asked, his eyes missing nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it looked like a home.\" I couldn\u0027t think of anything else to say. \"Surely the police wouldn\u0027t do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They would take the bedding to check for evidence,\" Bryan said. And they had. \"But they wouldn\u0027t do this.\" Drawers were pulled out of the chest of drawers, the dressing table, the lingerie chest, the jewelry chest. Poppy\u0027s side of the small walk-in closet was demolished. Out-of-season shoes had been dumped from their neat stack of boxes, and a set of stacked cubes that had held sweaters had been disassembled and lay strewn on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was horrible. I felt like Poppy had been violated all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told myself instantly that this was a dumb reaction. What I was seeing was just a rummage through her things, not nearly as bad as sinking a knife into her, for goodness sake! But the invasiveness of it... I thought of how much I would hate someone going through my personal stuff, and I had to sit down abruptly on the needlepoint-covered stool that was intended to occupy the kneehole of the dressing table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan did a big production number about how I was feeling - asking if he should call the paramedics (which horrified me considerably) and muttering various things about how terrible a shock I had sustained. He had called the police already, so I let him run on for a bit. Was he trying to impress me with his empathy, with his regard for me as a delicate southern flower? I was a pretty wilted blossom, if so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished Robin were there. Then I slapped myself mentally. No point wishing for that. He was flirting with Janie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger stiffened my spine once more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/poppy-done-to-death-aurora-teagarden-8/page-6.html","bookId":2243,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:45 PM"}
