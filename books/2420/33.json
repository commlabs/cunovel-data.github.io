He stood frozen, looking at something—perhaps Sam Barrera’s body below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs quietly as I could, I cal ed, “Jem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirman must have missed him. Stirman had given up when he heard the alarms. The police cars would be heading this way. It couldn’t take them long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jem,” I said. “Come on—I’l get you out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped closer and froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem wasn’t staring over the edge. He was staring at Wil Stirman, who was crouching in front of him at the edge of the walkway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was tel ing Jem something, pointing his gun at the boy’s feet. I could’ve sworn he was giving Jem a lecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirman saw me. He rose, calmly. We leveled our guns at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear police cars now. Tires slashing through water, turning onto Jones. They were running without sirens, but I knew they were cops. There is something unmistakable about the sound of police engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s over,” I told Stirman. “Let Jem go back to his mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirman blinked slowly. He seemed to be losing his grip on consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single police light flashed—circling once across the neon skywalk and the face of the West Tower. An officer must have hit the switch accidental y while getting out of his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light snapped Stirman back to his senses. He looked around. He was backed into a corner, forty feet in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tel me where the money is,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too late for that,” I said. “You’l never get out of the building.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I owe Soledad. I can’t give up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t giving up. It’s deciding to live. If you run, you’l die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown in front of the museum, car doors were opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to get Jem away from Stirman. I had to get him out of the line of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirman held my eyes. He seemed to understand what I was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hand on Jem’s shoulder, gently pushed him toward me. “Go on, boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem dug in his heels. His hand was closed, as if he were holding something small . “But . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go on,” Stirman ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem shook his head stubbornly. “But you told me—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s al right.” Stirman’s voice cracked. “Just go on, now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jem was final y safe behind me, Stirman said, “Now tel me about the cash. Quick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t see what difference it would make. I told him where the money was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding dawned on Stirman’s face—the sense that what I said had to be true. “Goddamn Fred Barrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined the police inside the building, the slow pulse of the glass elevator as it rose through the gal eries, fil ed with heavily armed men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirman took one last look at Jem—hesitating long enough to erase any chance of escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bear witness, Jem,” he said. “Be good to your mother, hear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he jumped. The drop should have been enough to break his legs, but he hit the roof of the lower gal ery on solid footing and cleared the other side, dropping into the darkness behind the museum. There was at least a square mile of woods and flooded riverbanks back there. The police would have to search it on foot. But they would find him. I was sure of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem stared at the spot where Stirman had disappeared—wet treetops hissing in the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to put my hand on his shoulder, but I sensed the barrier he was putting up. He wanted no more hand-holding, no comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He won’t come back,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone wasn’t what I expected from an eight-year-old who’d just had a conversation with evil. He sounded wistful. He wore the same expression he’d worn the night we watched his mother’s van go floating away down Rosil io Creek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped his hand into his pocket, depositing whatever he was holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could ask what it was, I heard a groan from the roof below us. A man’s voice said, “Hel .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay here,” I told Jem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered myself over the railing. Stirman had done it. How hard could it be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid, Navarre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lost my footing immediately and slid down the slick roof. I would have gone over the edge and into the skylights below had I not caught the wet bottom rung of a service ladder. Slowly, I managed to crawl back up to where Sam Barrera was lying on his back, his arm bent underneath him at an ugly angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn bastard,” he muttered. “You get him, Fred?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat next to him, too exhausted to correct his ragged memory. “Yeah. I got him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat seemed to comfort the old man. He put his head back and let the rain fal on his face. Police were popping up in al the windows of the museum now—SWAT team members on the skywalk, aiming assault rifles at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” I told Sam, “for trying to save us up there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did I do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I always was pretty damn brave,” Barrera said. “I don’t know about taking the money, though. It feels wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it is,” I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him, and asked careful y, “What about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did your wife get him out okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was silent for a long time as the police moved in, DeLeon now visible above us, not looking happy, or in any hurry to cal off her firing squad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Erainya got him out,” I told Barrera. “The baby is fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at Ana DeLeon in the broken glass and neon. I raised my hands in surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 25\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane was a twin-engine Cessna, so old no self-respecting drug-runner would use it anymore, but it could stil make the flight to Mexico below radar in under an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot waited in the drizzle on the tarmac at Stinson Field. He checked his watch. His client was late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a crummy night to fly, but anticipating his payment made him feel better. He imagined the money in his bank account. He would make separate cash deposits, space them out careful y, keep them under the mandatory reporting limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was deep in thought about a comfortable retirement when somebody put a gun to his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong after the police took Erainya Manos away, Pablo had waited in the ventilation shaft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe expected the woman to sel him out. Any second, the muzzle of an assault rifle would poke its way into his hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Pablo kept waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he couldn’t stand it anymore, he crawled out. No one was waiting in the storage room to ambush him. His gun was stil lying on the floor by the window. They hadn’t even bothered bagging it for evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would the police leave the scene so fast?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked the magazine. Stil loaded, minus the bul et Erainya Manos had fired to rattle the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDangerous, he had told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’ll throw them off balance, she said. When they find out I fired the gun, they’ll relax their guard about everything. They’ll believe I’m alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t trusted her, but he’d gone along. He couldn’t run. He couldn’t surrender. He couldn’t bring himself to kil her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crept down the stairs, spotted two uniformed cops at the front entrance. They looked bored, like they’d been put there to keep people out. They weren’t paying any attention to the inside of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePablo slipped out the back, onto the loading docks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain felt good on his face, but he told himself he would never make it across open ground. There were probably stil snipers on the surrounding rooftops. His shoulder blades tensed for the bul et he expected in his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jogged down a dark al ey. Nothing happened. He made it three blocks away, came out next to St. Paul Square. A bunch of tourist rental cars were parked on the street. He strol ed down the line, glancing casual y through windows. A Dodge Neon had the driver’s keys just sitting there on the front seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo easy. Had to be a trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police would surround him as soon as he turned the ignition. The engine would explode. Something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he got in, started the Neon, and pul ed away from the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he got to the highway, he was crying like a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had come that close to kil ing Erainya Manos, and she’d been tel ing him the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot found himself facing a young Latino with cobwebs in his hair, ragged clothes, dirt and scratches on his arms like he’d crawled out of a col apsed building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot tried for calm. He raised his hands. “I got nothing you can rob, partner. Unless you want an airplane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actual y,” the Latino said, “that is exactly what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot blinked. “You’re Wil Stirman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know the Calabras airstrip, south of Juárez?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” The pilot didn’t feel the need to mention he’d flown heroin from that airstrip a dozen times. “You have my hundred grand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Latino smiled. He nudged the pilot’s nose affectionately with his gun. “Actual y, se?or, there’s been a slight change of plans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWil Stirman found his money, right where Navarre said it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black duffel bag was lighter than when Wil had packed it, eight years ago, but that was to be expected. Fred Barrow must’ve used a good half mil ion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWil stuffed a couple of hundred-dol ar bil s in his pocket, rezipped the bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had one last score to settle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed the wooden stairs out of the basement, the knife wound in his shoulder throbbing so badly he could hardly think. He found an intact section of roof to stand under. Rain was blowing through the skeletal remains of the house. The dark hil s around him smel ed of wet juniper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWil cal ed the SAPD. He was pleasantly surprised to get a connection so far from the city. He told the dispatcher he was the outside accomplice who’d helped Wil Stirman escape, and now he had a guilty conscience. He gave her enough details about the jailbreak to be sure she was taking him seriously. Then he told her where they could find one of the missing Floresvil e Five. A hunting cabin in the woods of Wisconsin. He gave her directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWil hung up, feeling satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith any luck, his guess would be right. The Guide might be stupid enough to lay low there. He might have thought Wil had forgotten about the Wisconsin property, which the Guide had shown him once, years ago— his little retirement dream house. But Wil never forgot a good hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked back to the main road in the dark—a good half mile, through mosquitoes and mud and brambles. Down toward the river, the only visible light was a kerosene lamp glowing in a curtained window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA caretaker’s cabin, maybe. Wil avoided it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t seen another human being for thirty miles, since he exited the main highway. Every farmhouse had been dark, every road abandoned. Anybody crazy enough to ignore the evacuation orders, Wil wanted to stay clear of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed into the truck and stared at the empty seat next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou failed Soledad, Navarre had said. You let the past stay buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words weighed on Wil ’s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight years ago, he had taken the coward’s way out. He’d never tried to find out what real y happened to Soledad’s baby— his baby. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/southtown-tres-navarre-5/page-33.html","bookId":2420,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:32:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:32:20 PM"}
