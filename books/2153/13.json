He had seen a warrior religion there, a fire spreading across the universe with the Atreides green and black banner waving at the head of fanatic legions drunk on spice liquor.

He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this - the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely, I cannot choose that way , he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he saw again in his mind\u0027s eye the shrine of his father\u0027s skull and the violence with the green and black banner waving in its midst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica cleared her throat, worried by his silence. \"Then . . . the Fremen will give us sanctuary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up, staring across the green-lighted tent at the inbred, patrician lines of her face. \"Yes,\" he said. \"That\u0027s one of the ways.\" He nodded. \"Yes.

He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting even me, for he said I was a witch like all the others. And when I sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self-preservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and asked if I thought him a weakling. I saw then that he had been aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all royalty. As I look back on it, I think there may have been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s shared common ancestry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- \"In My Father\u0027s House,\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now Harkonnen shall kill Harkonnen,\" Paul whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had awakened shortly before nightfall, sitting up in the sealed and darkened stilltent.

His mind focused on the storm as he had seen it begin through the transparent end of their stilltent - cold dribbles of sand crossing the basin, then runnels and tails furrowing the sky. He had looked up to a rock spire, seen it change shape under the blast, becoming a low, Cheddar-colored wedge. Sand funneled into their basin had shadowed the sky with dull curry, then blotted out all light as the tent was covered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure, then - silence broken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their sand snorkel pumping air from the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try the receiver again,\" Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No use,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found his stillsuit\u0027s watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm swallow into his mouth, and he thought that here he truly began an Arrakeen existence - living on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body. It was flat and tasteless water, but it soothed his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit clinging to her body, but she refused to accept her thirst. To accept it would require awakening fully into the terrible necessities of Arrakis where they must guard even fractional traces of moisture, hoarding the few drops in the tent\u0027s catchpockets, begrudging a breath wasted on the open air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much easier to drift back down into sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there had been a dream in this day\u0027s sleep, and she shivered at memory of it. She had held dreaming hands beneath sandflow where a name had been written: Duke Leto Atreides . The name had blurred with the sand and she had moved to restore it, but the first letter filled before the last was begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sand would not stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dream became wailing: louder and louder. That ridiculous wailing - part of her mind had realized the sound was her own voice as a tiny child, little more than a baby. A woman not quite visible to memory was going away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy unknown mother , Jessica thought. The Bene Gesserit who bore me and gave me to the Sisters because that\u0027s what she was commanded to do.

Her Bene Gesserit training sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll his life he has been trained to hate Harkonnens , she thought. Now, he finds he is Harkonnen . . . because of me. How little he knows me! I was my Duke\u0027s only woman. I accepted his life and his values even to defying my Bene Gesserit orders .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tent\u0027s glowtab came alight under Paul\u0027s hand, filled the domed area with green radiance. Paul crouched at the sphincter, his stillsuit hood adjusted for the open desert - forehead capped, mouth filter in place, nose plugs adjusted. Only his dark eyes were visible: a narrow band of face that turned once toward her and away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secure yourself for the open,\" he said, and his voice was blurred behind the filter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica pulled the filter across her mouth, began adjusting her hood as she watched Paul break the tent seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSand rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran into the tent before he could immobilize it with a static compaction tool. A hole grew in the sandwall as the tool realigned the grains. He slipped out and her ears followed his progress to the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat will we find out there? she wondered. Harkonnen troops and the Sardaukar, those are dangers we can expect. But what of the dangers we don\u0027t know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of the compaction tool and the other strange instruments in the pack. Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious dangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they were exposed above the filter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pass up the pack.\" It was Paul\u0027s voice, low and guarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved to obey, heard the water literjons gurgle as she shoved the pack across the floor. She peered upward, saw Paul framed against stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" he said and reached down, pulled the pack to the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she saw only the circle of stars. They were like the luminous tips of weapons aimed down at her. A shower of meteors crossed her patch of night. The meteors seemed to her like a warning, like tiger stripes, like luminous grave slats clabbering her blood. And she felt the chill of the price on their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry up,\" Paul said. \"I want to collapse the tent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shower of sand from the surface brushed her left hand. How much sand will the hand hold? She asked herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall I help you?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed in a dry throat, slipped into the hole, felt static-packed sand rasp under her hands. Paul reached down, took her arm. She stood beside him on a smooth patch of starlit desert, stared around. Sand almost brimmed their basin, leaving only a dim lip of surrounding rock. She probed the farther darkness with her trained senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoise of small animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBirds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fall of dislodged sand and faint creature sounds within it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul collapsing their tent, recovering it up the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarlight displaced just enough of the night to charge each shadow with menace. She looked at patches of blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack is a blind remembering , she thought. You listen for pack sounds, for the cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most primitive cells remember. The ears see. The nostrils see .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, Paul stood beside her, said: \" Duncan told me that if he was captured, he could hold out . . . this long. We must leave here now.\" He shouldered the pack, crossed to the shallow lip of the basin, climbed to a ledge that looked down on open desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica followed automatically, noting how she now lived in her son\u0027s orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas , she thought.

The long swish of it lifted on an invisible wave with syllables of boomerang antennae, funnels arcing back, a pi-shaped upthrusting at the stern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn orange glare burst above the silhouette and a line of brilliant purple cut downward toward the glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother line of purple!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd another upthrusting orange glare!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like an ancient naval battle, remembered shellfire, and the sight held them staring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pillars of fire,\" Paul whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ring of red eyes lifted over the distant rock.

His sapho-stained lips were drawn into a straight line with radial creases spreading upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA robed man squatted silently on sand across from Hawat, apparently unmoved by the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two crouched beneath a rock overhang that looked down on a wide, shallow sink. Dawn was spreading over the shattered outline of cliffs across the basin, touching everything with pink. It was cold under the overhang, a dry and penetrating chill left over from the night. There had been a warm wind just before dawn, but now it was cold. Hawat could hear teeth chattering behind him among the few troopers remaining in his force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man squatting across from Hawat was a Fremen who had come across the sink in the first light of false dawn, skittering over the sand, blending into the dunes, his movements barely discernible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen extended a finger to the sand between them, drew a figure there. It looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out of it. \"There are many Harkonnen patrols,\" he said. He lifted his finger, pointed upward across the cliffs that Hawat and his men had descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany patrols.

Mentat training was supposed to give a man the power to see motives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had been the worst night of Hawat\u0027s life. He had been at Tsimpo, a garrison village, buffer outpost for the former capital city, Carthag, when the reports of attack began arriving. At first, he\u0027d thought: It\u0027s a raid. The Harkonnens are testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut report followed report - faster and faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo legions landed at Carthag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive legions - fifty brigades! - attacking the Duke\u0027s main base at Arrakeen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA legion at Arsunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo battle groups at Splintered Rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the reports became more detailed - there were Imperial Sardaukar among the attackers - possibly two legions of them.

That was an ordinary enough gambit in this kind of House-to-House warfare. Lighters landed and took off on Arrakis regularly to transport the spice for House Atreides. Hawat had taken precautions against random raids by false spice lighters. For a full attack they\u0027d expected no more than ten brigades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were more than two thousand ships down on Arrakis at the last count - not just lighters, but frigates, scouts, monitors, crushers, troop-carriers, dump-boxes . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than a hundred brigades - ten legions!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire spice income of Arrakis for fifty years might just cover the cost of such a venture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI underestimated what the Baron was willing to spend in attacking us , Hawat thought.

I should\u0027ve killed that Bene Gesserit witch when I had the chance . There was no doubt in his mind who had betrayed them - the Lady Jessica. She fitted all the facts available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your man Gurney Halleck and part of his force are safe with our smuggler friends,\" the Fremen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Gurney will get off this hell planet. We \u0027re not all gone .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat glanced back at the huddle of his men. He had started the night just past with three hundred of his finest. Of those, an even twenty remained and half of them were wounded. Some of them slept now, standing up, leaning against the rock, sprawled on the sand beneath the rock. Their last \u0027thopter, the one they\u0027d been using as a ground-effect machine to carry their wounded, had given out just before dawn. They had cut it up with lasguns and hidden the pieces, then worked their way down into this hiding place at the edge of the basin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat had only a rough idea of their location - some two hundred kilometers southeast of Arrakeen. The main traveled ways between the Shield Wall sietch communities were somewhere south of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen across from Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to reveal sandy hair and beard. The hair was combed straight back from a high, thin forehead. He had the unreadable total blue eyes of the spice diet. Beard and mustache were stained at one side of the mouth, his hair matted there by pressure of the looping catchtube from his nose plugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man removed his plugs, readjusted them. He rubbed at a scar beside his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you cross the sink here this night,\" the Fremen said, \"you must not use shields. There is a break in the wall . . . \" He turned on his heels, pointed south. \" . . . there, and it is open sand down to the erg. Shields will attract a . . . \" He hesitated. \". . . worm. They don\u0027t often come in here, but a shield will bring one every time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said worm , Hawat thought. He was going to say something else. What? And what does he want of us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not recall ever before being this tired. It was a muscle weariness that energy pills were unable to ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose damnable Sardaukar!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a self-accusing bitterness, he faced the thought of the soldier-fanatics and the Imperial treachery they represented. His own Mentat assessment of the data told him how little chance he had ever to present evidence of this treachery before the High Council of the Landsraad where justice might be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you wish to go to the smugglers?\" the Fremen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it possible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way is long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fremen don\u0027t like to say no ,\" Idaho had told him once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat said: \"You haven\u0027t yet told me whether your people can help my wounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are wounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same damned answer every time!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know they\u0027re wounded!\" Hawat snapped. \"That\u0027s not the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peace, friend,\" the Fremen cautioned. \"What do your wounded say? Are there those among them who can see the water need of your tribe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t talked about water,\" Hawat said. \"We - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can understand your reluctance,\" the Fremen said. \"They are your friends, your tribesmen. Do you have water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen gestured to Hawat\u0027s tunic, the skin exposed beneath it. \"You were caught in-sietch, without your suits. You must make a water decision, friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we hire your help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen shrugged. \"You have no water.\" He glanced at the group behind Hawat. \"How many of your wounded would you spend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat fell silent, staring at the man. He could see as a Mentat that their communication was out of phase. Word-sounds were not being linked up here in the normal manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Thufir Hawat,\" he said. \"I can speak for my Duke. I will make promissory commitment now for your help. I wish a limited form of help, preserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself beyond vengeance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wish our siding in a vendetta?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The vendetta I\u0027ll handle myself. I wish to be freed of responsibility for my wounded that I may get about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen scowled. \"How can you be responsible for your wounded? They are their own responsibility. The water\u0027s at issue, Thufir Hawat. Would you have me take that decision away from you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat tensed, wondering: Is there betrayal here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you fear?\" the Fremen demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese people and their disconcerting directness! Hawat spoke cautiously. \"There\u0027s a price on my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-h-h-h.\" The Fremen removed his hand from his weapon. \"You think we have the Byzantine corruption. You don\u0027t know us. The Harkonnens have not water enough to buy the smallest child among us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had the price of Guild passage for more than two thousand fighting ships , Hawat thought. And the size of that price still staggered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both fight Harkonnens,\" Hawat said. \"Should we not share the problems and ways of meeting the battle issue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are sharing,\" the Fremen said. \"I have seen you fight Harkonnens. You are good. There\u0027ve been times I\u0027d have appreciated your arm beside me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say where my arm may help you,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows?\" the Fremen asked. \"There are Harkonnen forces everywhere. But you still have not made the water decision or put it to your wounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must be cautious , Hawat told himself. There\u0027s a thing here that\u0027s not understood .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said: \"Will you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stranger-thinking,\" the Fremen said, and there was a sneer in his tone. He pointed to the northwest across the clifftop. \"We watched you come across the sand last night.\" He lowered his arm. \"You keep your force on the slip-face of the dunes. Bad. You have no stillsuits, no water. You will not last long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ways of Arrakis don\u0027t come easily,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truth. But we\u0027ve killed Harkonnens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you do with your own wounded? \"Hawat demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does a man not know when he is worth saving?\" the Fremen asked. \"Your wounded know you have no water.\" He tilted his head, looking sideways up at Hawat. \"This is clearly a time for water decision. Both wounded and unwounded must look to the tribe\u0027s future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tribe\u0027s future , Hawat thought. The tribe of Atreides. There\u0027s sense in that . He forced himself to the question he had been avoiding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you word of my Duke or his son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnreadable blue eyes stared upward into Hawat\u0027s. \"Word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their fate!\" Hawat snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fate is the same for everyone,\" the Fremen said. \"Your Duke, it is said, has met his fate. As to the Lisan al-Gaib, his son, that is in Liet\u0027s hands. Liet has not said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew the answer without asking , Hawat thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced back at his men. They were all awake now. They had heard. They were staring out across the sand, the realization in their expressions: there was no returning to Caladan for them, and now Arrakis was lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat turned back to the Fremen. \"Have you heard of Duncan Idaho?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was in the great house when the shield went down,\" the Fremen said. \"This I\u0027ve heard . . . no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped the shield and let in the Harkonnens , he thought. I was the one who sat with my back to a door. How could she do this when it meant turning also against her own son? But . . . who knows how a Bene Gesserit witch thinks . . . if you can call it thinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. \"When will you hear about the boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know little of what happens in Arrakeen,\" the Fremen said. He shrugged. \"Who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have ways of finding out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps.\" The Fremen rubbed at the scar beside his nose. \"Tell me, Thufir Hawat, do you have knowledge of the big weapons the Harkonnens used?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe artillery , Hawat thought bitterly. Who could have guessed they\u0027d use artillery in this day of shields?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You refer to the artillery they used to trap our people in the caves,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve . . . theoretical knowledge of such explosive weapons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to die,\" the Fremen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you ask about these weapons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liet wishes it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that what he wants from us? Hawat wondered. He said: \"Did you come here seeking information about the big guns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you should just go take one,\" Hawat sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" the Fremen said. \"We took one. We have it hidden where Stilgar can study it for Liet and where Liet can see it for himself if he wishes. But I doubt he\u0027ll want to: the weapon is not a very good one. Poor design for Arrakis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You . . . took one?\" Hawat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a good fight,\" the Fremen said. \"We lost only two men and spilled the water from more than a hundred of theirs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were Sardaukar at every gun , Hawat thought. This desert madman speaks casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the Harkonnens,\" the Fremen said. \"Some of those are good fighters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Hawat\u0027s men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. \"Are you talking about Sardaukar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s talking about Sardaukar,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sardaukar!\" the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his voice. \"Ah-h-h, so that\u0027s what they are! This was a good night indeed. Sardaukar. Which legion? Do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We . . . don\u0027t know,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sardaukar,\" the Fremen mused. \"Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing. Is that not strange?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you know they are Sardaukar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who am I?\" Hawat asked bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are Thufir Hawat,\" the man said matter-of-factly. \"Well, we would have learned it in time. We\u0027ve sent three of them captive to be questioned by Liet\u0027s men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat\u0027s aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: \"You . . . captured Sardaukar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only three of them,\" the Fremen said. \"They fought well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only we\u0027d had the time to link up with these Fremen , Hawat thought. It was a sour lament in his mind. If only we could\u0027ve trained them and armed them. Great Mother, what a fighting force we\u0027d have had!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al-Gaib,\" the Fremen said. \"If he is truly the Lisan al-Gaib, harm cannot touch him. Do not spend thoughts on a matter which has not been proved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I serve the . . . Lisan al-Gaib,\" Hawat said. \"His welfare is my concern.

With a tired shrug, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced conversation arise among the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen said: \"There is always a way to water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind Hawat, a man cursed. Hawat\u0027s aide called: \"Thufir! Arkie just died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen put a fist to his ear. \"The bond of water! It\u0027s a sign!\" He stared at Hawat. \"We have a place nearby for accepting the water. Shall I call my men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide returned to Hawat\u0027s side, said: \"Thufir, a couple of the men left wives in Arrakeen. They\u0027re . . . well, you know how it is at a time like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen still held his fist to his ear. \"Is it the bond of water, Thufir Hawat?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat\u0027s mind was racing. He sensed now the direction of the Fremen\u0027s words, but feared the reaction of the tired men under the rock overhang when they understood it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bond of water,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let our tribes be joined,\" the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the rocks above them. They darted back under the overhang, rolled the dead man in a loose robe, lifted him and began running with him along the cliff wall to the right. Spurts of dust lifted around their running feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was over before Hawat\u0027s tired men could gather their wits. The group with the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around a turn in the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Hawat\u0027s men shouted: \"Where they going with Arkie? He was - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re taking him to . . . bury him,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fremen don\u0027t bury their dead!\" the man barked. \"Don\u0027t you try any tricks on us, Thufir.

The memory of one who died in this fashion will live as long as the memory of man endures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hawat\u0027s men advanced, angry looks on their faces. One had captured a lasgun. He started to draw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop right where you are!\" Hawat barked. He fought down the sick fatigue that gripped his muscles. \"These people respect our dead. Customs differ, but the meaning\u0027s the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to render Arkie down for his water,\" the man with the lasgun snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?\" the Fremen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t even see the problem , Hawat thought. The na��vet�� of the Fremen was frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re concerned for a respected comrade,\" Hawat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own,\" the Fremen said. \"This is the bond of water.

He reached beneath his robes, brought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawat recognized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its blue-within-blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it.
