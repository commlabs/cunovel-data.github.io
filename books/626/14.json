Mrs. Jewls passed them out to the class.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, Dana,\" said Leslie. \"Ill trade you my black jelly bean for your red one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Okay,\" said Dana.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone traded jelly beans. That was the most fun part of the party.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bebe was very excited. \"Tell everybody what you\u0027re getting for your birthday, Calvin!\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 78\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know,\" Calvin mumbled as he stared at his yellow jelly bean.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s getting the best present!\" said Bebe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What are you getting, Calvin?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin frowned. \"I don\u0027t know!\" he griped. \"I mean, I know what it is, but I don\u0027t know what it is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Huh?\" asked Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"See, I usually get toys,\" Calvin tried to explain. \"But they always break, or get lost, or something happens to them. But this year I\u0027m getting something 111 never lose. I\u0027ll have it for the rest of my life.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it?\" asked Terrence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A tattoo,\" said Calvin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oooh, how neat!\" exclaimed Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone thought it was a great present.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re so lucky, Calvin,\" said Rondi. \"I wish I could get a tattoo too! Instead I got a tutu.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I got a tutu too,\" said Dana.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My parents won\u0027t let me get a tattoo,\" complained John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My parents wouldn\u0027t let me get one either,\" said Calvin. \"Then, for my birthday, they said I could get one. But now I can\u0027t decide what to get. My dad\u0027s taking me to the tattoo parlor after school today! I just can\u0027t make up my mind.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get a snake,\" said Stephen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, get an eagle,\" said Deedee. \"They\u0027re the best!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A dead rat!\" suggested Kathy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 79\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I just don\u0027t know,\" said Calvin. \"I\u0027ve never had to make such a tough decision. Nothing else I do matters very much. It\u0027s not like choosing jelly beans! If you pick the wrong color jelly bean, big deal, you can always spit it out. But once you get a tattoo, you can\u0027t change your mind. You can\u0027t erase tattoos. Whatever I get 111 have for the rest of my life!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get a naked lady,\" said Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin shook his head. \"I just don\u0027t know. I just don\u0027t know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are you going to put your tattoo?\" asked Allison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin threw up his hands. \"I don\u0027t know!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You should put it on your arm,\" said Myron. \"That\u0027s the best place for tattoos.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re crazy, Myron,\" said Todd. \"Put it on your chest, Calvin.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know where you should put it,\" said Dana. \"But I can\u0027t say.\" She giggled like a maniac. Then she whispered it in Jenny\u0027s ear. Jenny giggled too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All day everyone had lots of suggestions for Calvin. They told him what kind of tattoo he should get, and where he should put it. A rainbow on his forehead. A flower on his cheek. An anchor on his arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was easy for the others to make suggestions. They wouldn\u0027t have to live with it for the rest of their lives.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I just don\u0027t know,\" Calvin repeated over and over again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bebe drew a lot of pictures for him, in case he wanted to choose one of those. She drew lions, tigers, buffaloes, and butterflies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you like one, I can draw it on your skin for you,\" said Bebe. \"Then the tattoo man can trace over it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I just don\u0027t know,\" muttered Calvin. \"I just don\u0027t know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After school Calvin\u0027s father picked him up and drove him to the tattoo parlor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next day when he walked into class, everybody stared at him. They couldn\u0027t see a tattoo.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you get one?\" asked Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin smiled. \"Yep,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is it?\" asked Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana gasped. \"I know where!\" she exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She and Jenny giggled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, what\u0027d you get?\" asked Todd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was a real tough decision,\" said Calvin. \"I almost got a leopard fighting a snake. But then my dad told me to think about it. He said it was sort of like getting a second nose. You may think you want another nose, because that way if one nose gets stuffed up, you can breathe through the other nose. But then he asked me, \u0027Calvin, do you really want two noses?\u0027 \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your father is very wise,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 81\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin nodded. \"That made me think,\" he said. \"I decided I didn\u0027t want a snake and a leopard fighting on my body for the rest of my life. I suddenly knew exactly what I wanted.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He pulled up his left pant leg. There was a small tattoo just above his ankle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone crowded around to look at it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A potato!\" exclaimed Leslie. \"How stupid!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the worst tattoo in the world!\" said Mac.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They all thought it was a dumb tattoo.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Anything is better than a potato!\" said Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s a pretty potato,\" said Bebe, trying to be nice. \"I wish I could draw potatoes that good.\" But even Bebe thought it was a dumb tattoo.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I like potatoes,\" said Calvin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would hope so,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin could tell Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027t like his tattoo either.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would have gotten an eagle,\" said Deedee, \"soaring across the sky!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not me,\" said Terrence. \"I would have gotten a lion!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I would have gotten a kangaroo,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All day everyone told Calvin what they would have gotten: a fire-breathing dragon, a lightning bolt, a creature from outer space.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e None of them said they would have gotten a potato.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Calvin knew better. He knew it was easy for his friends to say what would they have gotten, be-\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 82\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e cause they really hadn\u0027t had to choose. He was the only one who really knew what It was like to pick a tattoo. Even Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027t know that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked at his potato. He smiled. It made him happy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was sure he had made the right choice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At least he was pretty sure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56871.html","bookId":626,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:32 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:32 AM"}
