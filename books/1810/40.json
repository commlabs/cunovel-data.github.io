And every one of them has at least two girls fawning over him. Out of the corner of my eye I see a salt-and-pepper-haired guy motorboating the tits of a blonde with pigtails and a Catholic-schoolgirl uniform. Behind them, a black-haired Asian woman stands na**d on a table, sliding a Blow Pop into her twat. Then she leans down and pops it into the mouth of the college-age kid salivating in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKind of reminds you of Sodom or Gomorrah, doesn’t it? And we all know how they ended up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to warn you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarla explains, “To the left is our game room. I’ve reserved a poker table for your party as you requested, Matthew. Darts and billiards are also available. Down that hall are the booths for private dances, and upstairs we have fully appointed rooms for even more private interactions, should you desire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leads us to the bar. “First round is on the house. This is Jane.” Carla motions to a dark-haired girl behind the bar, wearing a suit jacket and nothing else. “She’ll be your private server.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren’s eyes follow a long-legged blonde wearing assless leather chaps as she walks by. “I thought it was against the law to have na**d girls and alcohol in the same place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew shakes his head. “That’s only in New York and Jersey. This is the land of legalized prostitution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold up a finger. “But all other rules apply. Which means no touching, unless somebody tells you otherwise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarren’s mouth is still hanging open. I close it ungently. “Get a grip, man. Don’t embarrass us or I’ll make you go sit in the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forces his face to relax. Then he bobs his head and slumps his shoulders. “No, it’s good. I’m cool. I’m . . . holy shit! Do you see that chick with the lollipop?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn away. “Jane, I’ll take a whiskey on the rocks, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eService with a smile. “Coming right up, Mr. Evans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarla takes her leave. “I’ll be close by should you need my assistance. Enjoy your evening, gentlemen.” As soon as she steps away, five girls converge on us, each more stunning than the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sip my whiskey as one blue-lingerie-clad stripper meets my eyes. “So this is a bachelor party? And you’re the groom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. “That’s me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love grooms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmall talk with strippers is not really the norm. Usually it’s more of a transaction: rubbing and gyrating in exchange for a few singles. But this isn’t your typical strip club. And I’m a friendly guy. “How come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re always the wildest ones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not me. Tonight is more for my buddies. I’m just an innocent bystander.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggles and pinches my cheek. “You don’t look innocent.” She gives my face a mini slap. “You look more like the naughty type.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wink. “Guilty as charged.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA curly-haired girl with wide hips, wearing a purple bikini and standing next to Jack, vies for my attention next. “You wanna see a magic trick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of nowhere, she holds up a large cucumber. “I’m going to make this cucumber disappear. Watch closely.” She peels off her bikini bottoms, spreads her legs, and inserts the end of the cucumber into her pu**y. Then she holds her hands up over her head. Her abdominal muscles clench, and magically the cucumber slides up, disappearing into her twat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow all of our mouths are hanging open like Warren’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, the cucumber peeks out and slides down. She grabs it and says sweetly, “Ta-da!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clap my hands. “You are a very talented girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes—I’m going to hell. But at least I’ll be in good company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack holds up his hands, fingers spread. “I give it a ten for creativity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew adds, “You’d be a shoo-in for that X Factor show.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just smirks at me. “How about a private dance and I can show you all of my talents?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug her off. “Maybe later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hour, a few drinks, and about a hundred $1 bills later, Carla rejoins our little group. “I hope you gentlemen are enjoying yourselves?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I pass the time watching two girls tongue-kissing each other at the direction of a middle-aged patron, Matthew answers, “We are, thank you. The service and amenities are impeccable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We aim to please. And now it’s time to give the guest of honor a true Paradise welcome.” She takes my arm. “If you’ll come with me, Drew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat takes my attention away from the Female Foreplay Show. “I’m fine right here, thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles persuasively. “I’m afraid it’s not optional. Your friends insisted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown at the guys. “What did you douche bags do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew laughs sinisterly. “Nothing you weren’t expecting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s your last night of freedom, man. Enjoy it,” Jack adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more girls come up behind me. They and Carla pull me off my stool and guide me onstage as Steven yells out, “It’ll only hurt for a minute!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to go with the flow. It was too much to hope that the guys didn’t have some sick, twisted event planned. Best to just get it over with now. A lone chair sits empty in the middle of the stage. As three pairs of feminine hands push me down in it, the lights dim even lower. Spotlights dance around the room, and when “One More Night” by Maroon 5 comes on, the crowd cheers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo woman bounce out from backstage. They’re wearing black G-strings and sheer, black button-down tops. After a few ass shakes and high kicks for the crowd, they turn toward me. One drops to her knees and crawls around my legs like a submissive—and appealing—kitten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands slide up my calves to my knees and she pushes—roughly jerking them apart. Then she ties each ankle to the leg of the chair with a surprisingly sturdy ribbon. The girl in back scratches red fingernails down my chest, stopping just above the danger zone. Then she yanks both my arms back and ties my wrists behind me. It’s not exactly enjoyable. Some guys like to be dominated, but as history has shown, I’m much more of the dominator type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut my interest is piqued. The crowd goes wild as another woman appears front and center—swinging gracefully around the pole, obviously the star of the show. She’s petite, but thigh-high, leather, black boots with insanely spiked heels make her seem taller. Her hair is tucked under a black leather cap, shocking red gloss covers her lips, and dark sunglasses disguise much of her face. The rest of her body, however, is bared for all to see. A black thong with a scarcely there triangle hangs on her hips. Her tits are adorned with stick-on nipple tassels—and nothing else. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tied-tangled-4/page-40.html","bookId":1810,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM"}
