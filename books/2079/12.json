{"id":88713,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe voice was shrill, almost hysterical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnbalanced, Rashel thought dazedly, looking around. The sound of her secret being yelled out loud\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estunned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just for an instant. The next moment she was moving swiftly between the rows of girls, looking for...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nyala!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know why you\u0027re here!\" Nyala sat up tensely. She looked just as she had when Rashel had seen her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elast, cocoa skin, queenly head, wide haunted eyes. She was even dressed in the same dark clothes she\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen wearing the night they caught Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re here because you were in on it all along! You pretend to be a vampire hunter-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Rashel said desperately. Nyala was shouting loud enough to be heard on the other side\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the door. She knelt on Nyala\u0027s bed. \"I\u0027m not pretending, Nyala.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how come you\u0027re free and we\u0027re all chained up? You\u0027re on their side! You call yourself the Cat-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel clamped a hand over her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me,\" she hissed. Her heart was pounding. All the girls around her were staring and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpected to hear the cellar door open at any moment. \"Nyala, listen. I know you don\u0027t like me or trust\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme-but you\u0027ve got to stop yelling that. We may only have one chance to get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNyala\u0027s chest was heaving. Her eyes, the color of dark plums, stared into Rashel\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a vampire hunter,\" Rashel whispered, willing Nyala to believe it. \"I made a mistake letting that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire go that night... I admit it. But I\u0027ve been trying ever since to put things right. I got captured on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epurpose so I could find out what was going on here-and now I\u0027m going to try to get all these girls free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke slowly and distinctly, hoping Nyala could sense the truth of her words. \"But, Nyala, if the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight People find out I\u0027m a vampire hunter-much less the Cat-they are going to take me out and kill me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eright this minute. And then I don\u0027t think the rest of you have a chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped to breathe. \"I know it\u0027s hard to trust me. But please, please try. Do you think you can do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long pause. Nyala\u0027s eyes searched hers. Then, at last, Nyala nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel took her hand off Nyala\u0027s mouth. She sat back on the bed and they stared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Rashel said. \"I\u0027m going to need your help.\" Then she shook her head. \"But how did you get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehere? How did you find the club?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t find any club. I went back to that street with the warehouses on Wednesday. I thought maybe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe vampire might come back. And then-somebody grabbed me from behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Nyala.\" Wednesday night, Rashel thought. The night Daphne saw Ivan carry in a new girl and put\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher on a cot. That girl was Nyala. Rashel put a hand to her head. \"Nyala-I almost saved you. I was there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe next night-when Daphne fell out of the truck. Do you remember that? If I had only known...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNyala wasn\u0027t listening. \"Then there was this whisper in my mind, telling me to sleep. And I couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emove-I couldn\u0027t move my arms or my legs. But I wasn\u0027t asleep. And then he carried me into a warehouse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand he bit me.\" Her voice was detached, almost pleasant. But her eyes froze Rashel in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He bit me in the neck and I knew I was going to die, just like my sister. I could feel the blood coming\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout. I wanted to scream but I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t do anything.\" She smiled oddly at Rashel. \"I\u0027ll tell\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou a secret. It\u0027s still there, the bite. You can\u0027t see it, but it\u0027s still there.\" She turned her head to show a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmooth unblemished neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God, Nyala.\" Rashel had felt awkward trying to make gestures of comfort with Daphne, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow she didn\u0027t think. She just grabbed Nyala and hugged her hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me,\" she said fiercely. \"I know how you feel. I mean-no, I don\u0027t know, because it hasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappened to me. But I\u0027m sorry. And I know how you felt when you lost your sister.\" She leaned back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand looked at Nyala, almost shaking her. \"But we have to keep fighting. That\u0027s what\u0027s important right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow. We can\u0027t let them win. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes...\" Nyala looked slowly around her bed, then up at Rashel. \"Yes, that\u0027s right.\" Her eyes seemed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto sharpen and focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m making a plan to get out of here. And you have to stay calm and help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Nyala sounded more definite this time. Then she smiled almost serenely and whispered, \"And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe\u0027ll get our revenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Rashel pressed her hand. \"Somehow, we will. I promise you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked back to her cot feeling eyes on her, although nobody asked any questions. Her own eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere stinging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened to Nyala was her fault. The girl had already been on the edge, and because of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel, she\u0027d gotten herself caught and attacked by a vampire. And now...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Rashel was worried about Nyala\u0027s sanity, even if they did manage to get off the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right about one thing, though, Rashel thought. Revenge. It\u0027s the only way to wipe out the things that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave been done to these girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire in her chest was back-as if there were coals where her throat and heart ought to be. She let it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eharden her and burn away any stray thoughts of mercy for Quinn. Strange how she kept having thoughts\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof him, long after she\u0027d made the resolution to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she okay?\" Daphne said worriedly. \"I remember her from the warehouse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Rashel took the lockpick and sat on Daphne\u0027s cot. She began to work at Daphne\u0027s shackles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if she\u0027s okay. The vampires haven\u0027t been living in harmony with her.\" She glanced bitterly at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFayth, who just looked back gravely and steadily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody thinks all the Night People are good,\" Fayth said. \"Or all the humans. We don\u0027t approve of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eviolence. We want to stop it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sometimes it takes violence to stop violence,\" Rashel said shortly. Fayth didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why was she calling you a cat?\" Daphne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel could feel Fayth\u0027s gaze on her. \"The Cat. It\u0027s the name of a vampire hunter, one who\u0027s killed a lot\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne\u0027s dark blue eyes widened slightly. \"Is it you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel sprung a lock. Somehow, with these two girls staring at her, she didn\u0027t feel quite so brash as she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad a moment ago. She didn\u0027t feel terribly proud of being the Cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout looking up, she said, \"Yes.\" Then she glanced behind her at Fayth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFayth said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s going to be more killing before this is all done,\" Rashel said. \"And I can\u0027t think of anybody who\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeserves it more than the vampires who brought us here. So you let me take care of that, and we won\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eargue about it. All right?\" She sprung the other lock on Daphne\u0027s shackles. Daphne immediately stretched\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher legs luxuriously, then swung them to the floor. Fayth just nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then. Listen. The first thing we\u0027ve got to do is get these girls organized.\" Rashel moved to work\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon Fayth\u0027s chains. \"You\u0027re both good talkers. I want the two of you to go around and talk to them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eindividually. I want to know who\u0027s going to be able to help us and who\u0027s still under mind control. I want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto know who\u0027s going to be a problem. And I especially want to know who has any experience with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boats?\" Fayth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No place on this island is safe. We have to get off. There are four boats in the harbor right now- if we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan just find somebody to handle them.\" She looked from Daphne to Fayth. \"I want you to bring me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback at least two sensible girls who have some chance of not sinking a powerboat. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne and Fayth glanced at each other. They nodded. \"Right, boss,\" Daphne murmured, and they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estarted off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel sat, weighing a chain in her hand and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethinking. There was no need to tell Daphne-yet-that she didn\u0027t plan to ship out with the boats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later Daphne and Fayth stood before her beaming. At least Daphne was beaming; Fayth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas wearing that grave smile that was starting to drive Rashel crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allow me to introduce Annelise,\" Daphne said, leading Rashel to a cot. \"Originally a native of Denmark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s done the race circuit in Antigua-whatever that means. Anyway, she says she can handle a boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl in the cot was one of the oldest there, eighteen or nineteen. She was blond, long-legged, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebuilt like a Valkyrie. Rashel liked her at once. \"And this is Keiko over here,\" Fayth said in her simple\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eway. \"She\u0027s young, but she says she grew up around boats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one Rashel wasn\u0027t so sure about. She was tiny, with hair like black silk and a rosette mouth. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked like a collector\u0027s doll. \"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirteen,\" Keiko said softly. \"But I was born on Nantucket. My parents have a Ciera Sunbridge. I think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can do what you\u0027re asking-it\u0027s just the navigation that worries me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t anybody else,\" Daphne stage-whispered in Rashel\u0027s ear. \"So my advice is we trust the kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the navigation will be straight west,\" Rashel said. She smiled reassuringly at Keiko. \"Anyway,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven the open ocean will be safer than here.\" She gestured to Daphne and Fayth to come back to their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecorner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Good job. You\u0027re right about trusting the kid; I don\u0027t think we have any other choice. We\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edefinitely need two boats for all these girls. What else did you find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the ones that are still under mind control are the ones that came with us,\" Daphne said. \"Juanita\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Missy. And the one that might cause trouble is your buddy Nyala. She\u0027s not completely hinged, if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel nodded. \"The mind control may be a problem-how long did it take to wear off the others,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFayth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A day or so after they came in. But that\u0027s not the only problem, Rashel. Annelise and Keiko think they\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan handle the boats-but not tonight. Not until tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t wait until tomorrow,\" Rashel said impatiently. \"That\u0027s cutting it way too fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think we have a choice. Rashel, all these girls are tranquilized. Drugged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel blinked. \"How-?\" She shut her eyes. \"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The food,\" Fayth said, as Rashel nodded in resignation. \"I realized right off that there was something in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit. I think most of the girls know-and they\u0027d rather be tranquilized than think about what\u0027s happening to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel rubbed her forehead wearily. No wonder the girls hadn\u0027t asked her any questions. No wonder\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey weren\u0027t all screaming their heads off. They were doped to the gills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From now on we\u0027ve got to keep them from eating,\" she said. \"They need clear heads if we\u0027re going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eescape.\" She looked at Fayth. \"Okay. We wait. But that\u0027s going to make everything more dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow often do they bring food in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twice a day. Late morning and around eight at night. And then they take us to the bathroom two by\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who does it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rudi. Sometimes he has another werewolf with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne bit her lip anxiously. \"Are we equipped for werewolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel smiled. Holding her knife, she pulled the decorative knob at the end of the sheath. It came off,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erevealing a metal blade. She reversed the knob and stuck it in the end of the sheath, so the blade stuck\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout like a bayonet. The hard wooden sheath itself was now a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blade is silver-coated steel,\" she said in satisfaction. \"We are equipped for werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see?\" Daphne said to Fayth. \"This girl thinks of everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel put the knife away. \"All right. Let\u0027s talk to everybody again. I want to explain my plan. When we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo this tomorrow night, it\u0027s going to take cooperation and precision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, she thought, a lot of luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chow time!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRudi walked between the rows of cots, tossing packages from a plastic bag to either side of him. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked, Rashel thought, exactly like a trainer throwing herring to seals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scanned the aisle behind him. No other werewolf at the door. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a long night and a longer day. The girls were dizzy from lack of food, keyed up, and getting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore tense with each untranquilized hour. A couple of them couldn\u0027t seem to shake their first impression\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof Rashel-which had come from Nya-la\u0027s yelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eat up, girlies. Got to keep up your strength.\" A slightly warm foil package hit Rashel\u0027s lap, another hit\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe mattress. Same thing as brunch-hot dogs of the kind you get at a convenience store. Smeared with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emustard and drugs. The girls had been surviving on the grapefruit juice he\u0027d poured for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Rudi turned to throw a package to Juanita, Rashel rose smoothly from her cot. In one motion she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleaped and came down right on target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make a sound,\" she said in Rudi\u0027s ear. \"And don\u0027t even think about changing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had his arm twisted behind his back and the silver knife to his throat. Rudi didn\u0027t seem to know how\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe\u0027d gotten there. There were hot dogs all over the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Rashel said. \"Let\u0027s talk about jujitsu. This is what you call a proper hold. Resistance to it will\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecause serious pain and quite possibly a fractured joint. Are you getting this, Rudi?\" Rudi wiggled a little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand Rashel exerted pressure upward on his knuckles. Rudi yelped and danced on his toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush! What I want to know is, where is the other werewolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guarding the dock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else is on the dock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-nobody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anybody on the stairs or in the kitchen? Don\u0027t lie to me, Rudi, or I\u0027ll get annoyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They\u0027re all in the gathering room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel nodded at Daphne. Daphne jumped out of her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember-quick and quiet everybody,\" she said, like a cheerleader who\u0027d been promoted to drill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esergeant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel felt Rudi boggle as every girl in the room kicked off her covers and stood up free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the-what the-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Rudi.\" Keeping his elbow trapped against her, Rashel exerted pressure again, moving him easily\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the direction she wanted. \"You go first. You\u0027re going to unlock the top door for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annelise and Keiko in front,\" Daphne said. \"Missy right here. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t unlock it. I can\u0027t. They\u0027ll kill me,\" Rudi muttered, as Rashel moved him up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rudi, look at these young women.\" Rashel swung him around so he had a good view of the prisoners\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebehind him. They stood in one tense,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edear-eyed, lightly breathing mass. \"Rudi, if you don\u0027t unlock that door, I am going to tie you up and leave\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou alone with them... and this silver knife. I promise, whatever the vampires do to you won\u0027t be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRudi stared at the girls, who stared back at him. All ages, all sizes, united.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll unlock the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fumbled getting the door open. When it was done, Rashel pushed him through first, looking tensely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound. If there were vampires here, she had to change tactics fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen was empty-and music was blasting from somewhere inside the house. Rashel gave a quick\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esavage grin. It was a lucky break she wouldn\u0027t have dared to pray for. The music might just save these\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirls\u0027 lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled Rudi out of the way and nodded to Daphne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne stood at the head of the stairs, silently waving the girls out. Fayth led the way with the Valkyrie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnelise and the tiny Keiko behind her. The other girls hurried past, and Rashel was proud of how quiet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" she whispered, pushing Rudi back into the stairwell. \"One last question. Who\u0027s throwing the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebloodfeast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRudi shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who hired you? Who bought the slaves? Who\u0027s the client, Rudi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know! I\u0027m telling you! Nobody knows who hired us. It was all done on the phone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel hesitated. She wanted to keep questioning him-but right now the important thing was to get the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirls off the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne was still waiting in the kitchen, watching Rashel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel looked at her and then helplessly at Rudi\u0027s bushy brown head. She should kill him. It was the only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmart thing to do, and it was what she\u0027d planned to do. He was a conspirator in the plan to brutally\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emurder twenty-four teenage girls-and he enjoyed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Daphne was watching. And Fayth would give her that look if she heard Rashel had done him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel let out her breath. \"Sleep tight,\" she said, and hit Rudi on the head with the hilt of her knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slumped unconscious and she shut the cellar door on him. She turned quickly to Daphne. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne almost skipped ahead of her. They went out the back door and picked up the hiking path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel moved swiftly, loping across the beaten-down wild grass. She caught up to the string of girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, Missy,\" she whispered. \"Nice and quiet. Nyala, you\u0027re limping; does your leg hurt? A little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efaster, everybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her way up to the front. \"Okay, Annelise and Keiko. When we get there, I\u0027ll take care of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eguard. Then you know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find which boats we can handle. Destroy whatever we can on the others and set them adrift. Then each\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etake half the girls and head west,\" Annelise said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. If you can\u0027t make it to land, do your best and then call the Coast Guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not right away,\" Keiko put in. \"Lots of islanders use ship-to-shore radio instead of telephones. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampires may be monitoring it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel squeezed her shoulder. \"Smart girl. I knew you were right for the job. And remember, if you do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecall the Coast Guard, don\u0027t give the right name of the boat and don\u0027t mention this island.\" It was perfectly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epossible that there were Night People in the Coast Guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were almost at the bottom of the cliff, and so far no alarms had sounded. Rashel scanned the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoving group again, then became aware that Daphne was behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So far,\" Daphne said breathlessly. She added, \"You\u0027re good at this, you know. Encouraging them and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel shook her head. \"I\u0027m just trying to keep them together until they\u0027re not my problem anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne smiled. \"I think that\u0027s what I just said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wharf was below them, the boats bobbing quietly. The ocean was calm and glassy. Silver moonlight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egave the scene a postcard look. Ye Olde Quaint Marina, Rashel thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loped to the front again. \"Stay behind me all of you.\" She added to Daphne, \"I\u0027ll show you what I\u0027m good at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few feet of rocks and sand and she was on the wharf. Eyes on the shack, knife ready, she moved\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esilently. She wanted to take care of the werewolf without noise, if possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a dark shape came hustling out of the shack into the moonlight. It took one look at Rashel and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrew back its head to howl. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-12.html","bookId":2079,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM"}
