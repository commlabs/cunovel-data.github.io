It was leaning out of the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get away from me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouting broke the spell. She vaulted off the bed, landing in a tangle of sheets in the middle of her room. She kicked the sheets free and was at the light switch by the door in one movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight filled the room, glowing off the ocher walls. There was no dark figure anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTacked over the bed between an African mask and a length of embroidered cloth from Syria was a poster. A poster of Bruce Lee. It was just where the figure had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee approached it slowly, warily, ready for anything. She got close and looked at it. Just an ordinary poster. Bruce Lee\u0027s image stared out blandly over her head. There was something almost smug about his expression....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly Dee reached out and ripped the poster off the wall, scattering pushpins. She crumpled it with both hands and threw it in the general direction of the wastebasket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she sat back against the headboard, breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach had been lying for hours, unable to get to sleep. Too many thoughts crowding his brain. Thoughts-and images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHim and Jenny as kids. Playing Indians in the cherry orchard. Playing pirates in the creek. Always playing something, lost in some imaginary world. Because imaginary worlds were better than the real thing. Safer, Zach had always thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach breathed out hard. His eyes fluttered open-and he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuspended in the air above him was the head of a twelve-point buck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hanging inches from his nose, so close his dark-adjusted eyes could see it clearly. But he was paralyzed. He wanted to twist to the side, to get away from it, but his arms and legs wouldn\u0027t obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was falling on him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis whole body gave a terrible jerk and adrenaline burst through him. His arm flung up to ward the thing off. His eyes shut, anticipating the blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt never came. He dropped his arm, opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpty air above him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach struck out at it anyway. Only believing it was gone when his hand encountered no resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and turned on the lights. He didn\u0027t stay to look around the room, though. He went downstairs, to the den, flipping on the lights there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the wood-paneled wall where his father\u0027s trophies hung, the twelve-pointer rested in its usual place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach looked into its liquid-dark glass eyes. His gaze traveled over the splendid antlers, the shockingly delicate muzzle, the glossy brown neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all real and solid. Too heavy to move, bolted to the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich means maybe I\u0027m losing my mind. Imagination gone completely wild. That would be a laugh, wouldn\u0027t it, to get through the Game and then come home and lose my mind over nothing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHa ha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe den was as still as a photograph around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t going to get any sleep tonight. Normally, he would have gone out to his darkroom in the garage and done some work. That was what he\u0027d always done before when he couldn\u0027t sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that had been-before. Tonight he\u0027d rather just stare at the ceiling. Nothing else was any use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hypnopompic hallucination,\" Michael said to Dee the next morning. \"That\u0027s when you think you\u0027ve woken up, but your mind is still dreaming, The dark figure in your room is a classic example. They even have a name for it-the Old Hag Syndrome. Because some people think it\u0027s an old lady sitting on their chest, paralyzing them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Dee said. \"Well, that\u0027s what it must have been, then. Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same with you, Zach,\" Michael said, turning to look at him. \"Only yours was hypnagogic hallucination-you thought you weren\u0027t asleep yet, but your brain was in la-la land already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about me?\" Audrey said. \"I was asleep-but when I woke up, my dream was true.\" She touched polished fingernails to the back of her neck, just beneath the burnished copper French twist. \"I was wet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweat,\" Michael said succinctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t sweat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, ladylike perspiration, then. It\u0027s been hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked around at the group on the knoll. They all sounded so calm and rational. But Michael\u0027s grin was strained, and Zach was paler than ever. Dee\u0027s nervous energy was like an electrical field. Audrey\u0027s lips were pressed together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of the brave words, they were all on edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where\u0027s Tom? Jenny thought. He should be here. No matter what he thinks of me, he should be here for the sake of the others. What\u0027s he doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard there was a body found up in the Santa Ana foothills,\" Dee said. \"A guy from this school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gordon Wilson,\" Audrey said, wrinkling her nose. \"You know-that senior with the cowboy boots. People say he runs over cats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027s not going to run over any more. They think a mountain lion got him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom had heard about the body yesterday afternoon, and his first irrational thought had been: Zach? Michael?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had both been safe. And Jenny was safe at school today-although maybe school wasn\u0027t so safe, either. Yesterday, she\u0027d gotten herself sent home from computer applications after something -it was hard to figure out exactly what from the conflicting stories-had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brief thought crossed his mind that he might call her and ask-but Tom had already chosen his course. He couldn\u0027t change it now, and she probably wouldn\u0027t want him to. He\u0027d seen her in the car, that look when the song came on. Scared, yes, but with something underneath the scaredness. She\u0027d never looked like that at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter. He\u0027d protect her anyway. But yesterday, knowing she was home for good, he\u0027d taken the afternoon off and gone to the police station. He\u0027d used charm on a female detective and learned exactly where the body had been found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday he was skipping school completely. Teachers were going to start asking questions about that soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom found the dry creek bed. It wasn\u0027t too far from the famous Bell Canyon Trail, where a six-year-old had been attacked by a mountain lion. The air was scented with sage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a crinkled yellow \"crime scene\" ribbon straggling along the creek bed and little flags of various colors planted in the ground. Tom scrambled down the slope and stood where tiny traces of a dark stain on the rocks still showed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around. One place on the opposite bank had seen a lot of activity. Cactus had been broken, pineapple weed uprooted. There were footprints in the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom followed the trail up to a slope covered with purple sage. Coastal live oak and spreading sycamores cast an inviting shade nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom studied the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment he began to walk, slowly, toward the trees. He skirted brush. He came to three old sycamores growing so closely that their branches were entwined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was heavier here. It had a strange smell. Very faint, but disturbing. Feral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a predator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes there were huge patches of poison ivy under these old trees. Tom looked carefully, then stirred the brush underneath with his foot. The smell came stronger. Something heavy had lain here for quite some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and retraced his steps slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw it. On a dusty rock directly between the trees and the place where the creek bank was disturbed. A splatter of black like tar. A thick, viscous substance that looked as if it had bubbled at the edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom\u0027s breath hissed in, and he knelt, eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sign that any of it had been scraped off. Either the police hadn\u0027t seen it or they hadn\u0027t cared. It clearly wasn\u0027t the blood of anything on earth. It didn\u0027t look like anything important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was. It was very important. Tom took out a Swiss army knife and scraped some of the gunk up to examine it. It had an odd, musky smell, and spread very thin it was not black but red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he sat back on his heels and shut his eyes, trying to maintain the control he was famous for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Thursday Jenny noticed that Zach had dark circles under his eyes and Dee was jumpier than ever. Michael\u0027s face was blotchy, and one of Audrey\u0027s nails actually looked bitten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all falling apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of dreams. That was all they were. Nothing really happened at night, nothing hurt them. But the dreams were enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriday they were scheduled to go postering, but Jenny had to stop by the YMCA first, a few blocks from the Center. And it was there that something really did happen at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny had been waiting so long, searching for so long, that she ought to have been prepared. But when the time came, she found she wasn\u0027t prepared at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was inside the Y, talking to Mrs. Birkenkamp, the swim coach. Jenny volunteered every Friday with the swim class for disabled kids. She loved it and hated to miss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I have to,\" she said miserably. \"And maybe next Friday, too. I should have told you before, but I forgot-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny, it\u0027s okay. Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny lifted her eyes to the clear blue ones which looked at her steadily. There was something so wise about them-Jenny had the sudden impulse to throw herself into the woman\u0027s arms and tell her everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Birkenkamp had been Jenny\u0027s hero for years. She never gave up or lost faith. She\u0027d taught a child without arms to swim. Maybe she would have an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what could Jenny say? Nothing that an adult would believe. Besides, it was up to Jenny to do things for herself now. She couldn\u0027t rely on Tom anymore; she had to stand on her own feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be fine,\" she said unsteadily. \"Tell all the kids hello-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when Cam came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee was behind him. She had been waiting outside in her jeep. \"He came over from the Center. He won\u0027t talk to anybody but you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam said simply, \"I found her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny gasped. She actually felt dizzy for an instant. Then she said, \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got her address.\" Cam thrust a hand into the pocket of his skin-tight jeans and pulled out a grimy slip of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Jenny said. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Mrs. Birkenkamp said. \"Jenny, what\u0027s all this about-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right, Mrs. Birkenkamp,\" Jenny said, whirling around and hugging the willowy coach. \"Everything\u0027s going to be all right now.\" She really did feel that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam directed them to the house. \"Her name\u0027s Angela Seecombe. Kimberly Hall\u0027s big sister Jolie knows a guy who knows her. This is the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilbert Street. East of Ramona Street, where P.C. lived, just south of Landana. Audrey and Jenny had been there, distributing flyers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not inside this yellow two-story house with the paint-chipped black iron fence. Jenny couldn\u0027t remember why they hadn\u0027t been let in here, but they hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay here,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve got to do this myself. But, Cam-thank you.\" She turned to look at him, this tough kid with dandelion-fluff hair whose life had changed because his sister had gone to a party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, but his eyes met hers, grateful for the acknowledgment. \"I wanted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one answered the door of the yellow house. Jenny leaned on the bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill no answer. But faintly, from inside, came the sound of a TV set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny glanced at the driveway. No car there. Maybe no adults home. She waved to Dee and Cam to stay in the car, then went around the side of the house. She unlatched the creaking iron gate and waded through thigh-deep foxtails to the back porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grasped the knob of the back door firmly, Then she cast a look heavenward, took a deep breath, and tried it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was unlocked. Jenny stepped inside and followed the sound of the TV into a small family room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on a rust-colored couch was the Crying Girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped up in astonishment at the sight of Jenny, spilling popcorn from a microwave bag onto the carpet. Her long dark hair swung over her shoulders. Her haunted eyes were wide, and her mouth was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be afraid,\" Jenny said. \"I\u0027m not going to hurt you. I told you before, I need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHatred flashed through the girl\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk to you!\" She darted to the telephone. \"I\u0027m calling the police-you\u0027re trespassing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead and call them,\" Jenny said with a calm she didn\u0027t feel. \"And I\u0027ll tell them that you know things you haven\u0027t told them about the morning P.C. disappeared. You saw P.C., didn\u0027t you? You know where he went.\" She was gambling. Angela had threatened to tell in the beginning; in the bathroom she\u0027d said she could prove P.C. didn\u0027t kill Summer. But she hadn\u0027t told-which must mean she didn\u0027t want to. Jenny was gambling that Angela would rather tell her than the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl said nothing, her slim olive-tan hand resting on the phone limply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angela.\" Jenny went to her as she had four days ago in the high school bathroom. She put her hands on the girl\u0027s shoulders, gently this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did see P.C., didn\u0027t you? And you saw what he had with him. Angela, you\u0027ve got to tell me. You don\u0027t understand how important it is. If you don\u0027t tell me, the thing that happened to P.C. could happen to other people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small bones under Jenny\u0027s hands lifted as Angela heaved in a shaky breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate you____\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t. You want something to hate because you hurt so much. I understand that. But I\u0027m not your enemy, and I\u0027m not a soshe or a prep or any of those things. I\u0027m just another girl like you, trying to cope, trying to stop something bad from happening. And I hurt, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark, pensive eyes studied her face. \"Oh, yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Like hell. And if you don\u0027t believe it, you\u0027re not as smart as you look.\" Jenny\u0027s nose and eyes were stinging. \"Listen, Summer Parker-Pearson was one of my best friends. I lost her. Now I\u0027ve lost my boyfriend over this, too. I just don\u0027t want anything worse to happen-which it will, if you don\u0027t help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela\u0027s eyes dropped, but not before Jenny saw the shimmer of tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny spoke softly. \"If you know where P.C. went that morning, then you have to tell me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela shrugged off Jenny\u0027s hands and turned away. Her entire body was tense for a moment, then it slumped. \"I won\u0027t tell you-but I\u0027ll show you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny? Are you in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s voice, from the back door. As Dee appeared, narrow-eyed and moving like a jaguar, Jenny reached out quickly to Angela. \"It\u0027s okay. She\u0027s my friend. You can show us both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl hesitated, then nodded, giving in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Jenny\u0027s surprise, she didn\u0027t head for the front door, but led them out back. Cam followed them through the foxtails. The backyard sloped down to dense brush; there was far more land here than Jenny had realized. Beside an overhanging clump of trees was a warped and leaning toolshed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" Angela said. \"That\u0027s where P.C. went.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no you don\u0027t.\" Jenny caught Dee in mid-lunge and held her back. \"This isn\u0027t the time to be yanking doors open. Remember the Game?\" She herself was trembling with anxiety, triumph, and anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela was fumbling with a large old-fashioned locket she had tucked into her tank top. \"You need this to open it, anyway. I locked it again-afterward. It was our secret place, P.C.\u0027s and mine. Nobody else wanted it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny took the key. \"So you saw him go in that morning. And then ... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slug went in, too. P.C. climbed the porch and woke me up to get the key. That\u0027s my bedroom.\" She pointed to a second-story window above the porch roof. \"Then he and Slug went down and unlocked the shed and went in. I could see everything from my room. I waited for them to come out-usually they just stashed stuff there and came out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this time they didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No... so I waited and waited, then I got dressed. When I came down here, the door was still shut. So I opened it-but they weren\u0027t inside.\" She turned on Jenny suddenly, her dark eyes huge and brilliant with unshed tears. \"They weren\u0027t inside! And there aren\u0027t any windows, and they didn\u0027t go out the door. And the key was on the ground. P.C. would never leave the key on the ground; he always locked up and gave it back to me. Where did they go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny answered with a question. \"There was something else on the ground, wasn\u0027t there? Besides the key?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A...\" Jenny took a breath. \"A paper house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. A baby thing. It wasn\u0027t even new, it was kind of crumpled, and it was taped up with electrician\u0027s tape from the shed. I don\u0027t know why they took it. They usually took stuff like-\" She broke off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee cut a glance at Jenny, amused at the admission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Jenny said. \"At least we know everything now. And it should still be inside if this place has been locked ever since that morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela nodded. \"I didn\u0027t touch anything, even though-well, I sort of wanted to look at the house. But I didn\u0027t; I left it there on the floor. And nobody else has a key.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s go get it,\" Jenny said. Deep inside she was shaking. The paper house was here. They\u0027d found it-and no wonder it had eluded them so long, sitting in a locked toolshed used by juvenile delinquents for hiding stolen goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monster positions?\" Dee suggested with a flash of white teeth. She was clearly enjoying this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Jenny took up a position beside the door. Dee stood in front of it in a kung fu stance, ready to kick it shut. It was the way they\u0027d learned to open doors in the paper house. \"Stand back, Angela. You, too, Cam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now.\" Jenny turned the key, pulled the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing frightening happened. A rectangle of sunlight fell into the dusty shed. Jenny blocked it off with her own shadow as she stepped into the doorway. Then she moved inside, and Dee blocked the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on in-I can\u0027t see-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she did see-and her mind reeled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blank white box was on the floor, open. Beside it was the paper house Jenny had described to the police. A Victorian house, three stories and a turret. Blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee made a guttural sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jenny had last seen the paper house, it had been crushed flat to fit in the box. It was different now. It had been straightened and reinforced with black tape. But that wasn\u0027t what made Jenny\u0027s head spin and her breath catch. That wasn\u0027t what made her knees start to give way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper house was exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn shreds. Roof gone. Outer walls in tatters. Floors gutted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if something very large had burst out from the inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the floor nearby, scratched impossibly deep into the concrete, was a mark. The rune Uruz. A letter from a magical alphabet, a spell to pierce the veil between the worlds. Jenny had seen it before on the inside of the box that had led them into the Shadow World. It was shaped like an angular and inverted U, with one stroke shorter than the other,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now she was looking at it upside-down, so that it should have looked like a regular U. But this particular rune was very uneven, the short stroke very short. From where she was standing it looked almost like a squared-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a signature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Jenny turned toward Dee, she felt herself falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re too late,\" she whispered. \"He\u0027s out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Dee said, some minutes later, still holding her. \"Okay, okay ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not okay.\" She saw Cam and Angela peering in the doorway, and her head cleared a bit. \"You two get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came forward. \"Is that it? What you\u0027ve been looking for?\" Cam squatted by the ruined house, his eyes as large and blue as Summer\u0027s. Light from the doorway made his dandelion hair glow at the edges. \"What happened to it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela\u0027s dark eyes were huge-and despairing. \"What happened to P.C.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny looked at the house. It was gutted, every floor shredded. Her eyes filled again and she swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he\u0027s probably dead,\" she said softly. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" The sight of Angela\u0027s misery cleared her head a little, brought her out of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to tell the police? About P.C. and me and this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police,\" Jenny said bleakly, \"are useless. We\u0027ve learned that. There\u0027s nothing they can do. Maybe nothing anybody can do-\" She stopped as an idea came to her. A desperate hope. \"Angela, you said you didn\u0027t touch anything here-but are you sure? You didn\u0027t see anything on the floor, did you-like any jewelry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela shook her head. Jenny searched for it anyway. It had been inside the box; maybe it had just rolled away. It wouldn\u0027t make the police believe them, but it might just save her-if they could find it and destroy it-She looked in the opened box and all around on the concrete floor. She shook out the ruins of the paper house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t anywhere. The gold ring that Julian had put on her finger, the one she tried to throw away, was gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-chase-the-forbidden-game-2/page-7.html","bookId":2435,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:26 PM"}
