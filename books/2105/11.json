Not water, though, but something darker. A red hue, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crank creaked, and the halfling dropped an inch closer. His face was contorted, his mouth wide, as if in a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no screams could be heard. Just the groans of the crank and a sinister laugh from an unseen torturer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe misty scene shifted, and the crank came into view, worked slowly by a single hand that seemed unattached to anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause in the descent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the evil voice laughed one final time. The hand jerked quickly, sending the crank spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream resounded, piercing and cutting, a cry of agony - a cry of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat stung Bruenor\u0027s eyes even before he had fully opened them. He wiped the wetness from his face and rolled his head, trying to shake away the terrible images and adjust his thoughts to his surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in the Ivy Mansion, in a comfortable bed in a comfortable room. The fresh candles that he had set out burned low. They hadn\u0027t helped; this night had been like the others: another nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor rolled over and sat up on the side of his bed. Everything was as it should be. The mithril armor and golden shield lay across a chair beside the room\u0027s single dresser. The axe that he had used to cut his way out of the duergar lair rested easily against the wall beside Drizzt\u0027s scimitar, and two helmets sat atop the dresser, the battered, one-horned helm that had carried the dwarf through the adventures of the last two centuries, and the crown of the king of Mithril Hall, ringed by a thousand glittering gemstones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut to Bruenor\u0027s eyes, all was not as it should be. He looked to the window and the darkness of the night beyond. Alas, all he could see was the reflection of the candlelit room, the crown and armor of the king of Mithril Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a tough week for Bruenor. All the days had been filled with the excitement of the times, of talk of the armies coming from Citadel Adbar and Icewind Dale to reclaim Mithril Hall. The dwarf\u0027s shoulders ached from being patted so many times by Harpells and other visitors to the mansion, all anxious to congratulate him in advance for the impending return of his throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Bruenor had wandered through the last few days absently, playing a role thrust upon him before he could truly appreciate it. It was time to prepare for the adventure Bruenor had fantasized about since his exile nearly two centuries before. His father\u0027s father had been king of Mithril Hall, his father before him, and back to the beginnings of Clan Battlehammer. Bruenor\u0027s birthright demanded that he lead the armies and retake Mithril Hall, that he sit in the throne he had been born to possess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was in the very chambers of the ancient dwarven homeland that Bruenor Battlehammer had realized the truth of what was important to him. Over the course of the last decade, four very special companions had come into his life, not one of them a dwarf. The friendship the five had forged was bigger than a dwarven kingdom and more precious to Bruenor than all the mithril in the world. The realization of his fantasy conquest seemed empty to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moments of the night now held Bruenor\u0027s heart and his concentration. The dreams, never the same but always with the same terrible conclusion, did not fade with the light of day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another one?\" came a soft call from the door. Bruenor looked over his shoulder to see Catti-brie peeking in on him. Bruenor knew that he didn\u0027t have to answer. He put his head down in one hand and rubbed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About Regis again?\" asked Catti-brie, moving closer. Bruenor heard the door softly close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rumblebelly,\" Bruenor softly corrected, using the nickname he had tagged on the halfling who had been his closest friend for nearly a decade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor swung his legs back up on the bed. \"I should be with him,\" he said gruffly, \"or at least with the drow and Wulfgar, lookin\u0027 for him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yer kingdom awaits,\" Catti-brie reminded him, more to dispel his guilt than to soften his belief in where he truly belonged - a belief that the young woman wholeheartedly shared. \"Yer kin from Icewind Dale\u0027ll be here in a month, the army from Adbar in two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, but we can\u0027t be going to the halls till the winter\u0027s past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie looked around for some way to deflect the sinking conversation. \"Ye\u0027ll wear it well,\" she said cheerfully, indicating the bejeweled crown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which?\" Bruenor retorted, a sharp edge to his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie looked at the dented helm, pitiful beside the glorious one, and nearly snorted aloud. But she turned to Bruenor before she commented, and the stern look stamped upon the dwarf\u0027s face as he studied the old helmet told her that Bruenor had not asked in jest. At that moment, Catti-brie realized, Bruenor saw the one-horned helmet as infinitely more precious than the crown he was destined to wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re halfway to Calimport,\" Catti-brie remarked, sympathizing with the dwarf\u0027s desires. \"Maybe more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, and few boats\u0027ll be leaving Waterdeep with the winter coming on,\" Bruenor muttered grimly, echoing the same arguments Catti-brie had leveled on him during his second morning in the Ivy Mansion, when he had first mentioned his desire to go after his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve a million preparations before us,\" said Catti-brie, stubbornly holding her cheerful tone. \"Suren the winter\u0027ll pass quickly, and we\u0027ll get the halls in time for Drizzt and Wulfgar and Regis\u0027s return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor\u0027s visage did not soften. His eyes locked on the broken helmet, but his mind wandered beyond the vision, back to the fateful scene at Garumn\u0027s Gorge. He had at least made peace with Regis before they were separated...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor\u0027s recollections blew away from him suddenly. He snapped a wry glance upon Catti-brie. \"Ye think they might be back in time for the fighting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie shrugged. \"If they put right back out,\" she replied, curious at the question, for she knew that Bruenor had more in mind than fighting beside Drizzt and Wulfgar in the battle for Mithril Hall. \"They can be coverin\u0027 many miles over the southland - even in the winter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor bounced off the bed and rushed for the door, scooping up the one-horned helmet and fitting it to his head as he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Middle o\u0027 the night?\" Catti-brie gawked after him. She jumped up and followed him into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor never slowed. He marched straight to Harkle Harpell\u0027s door and banged on it loudly enough to wake everyone in that wing of the house. \"Harkle!\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie knew better than to even try to calm him. She just shrugged apologetically to each curious head that popped into the hall to take a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Harkle, clad only in a nightshirt and ball-tipped cap, and holding a candle, opened his door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor shoved himself into the room, Catti-brie in tow. \"Can ye make me a chariot?\" the dwarf demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what?\" Harkle yawned, trying futilely to brush his sleep away. \"A chariot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A chariot!\" Bruenor growled. \"Of fire. Like the Lady Alustriel bringed me here in! A chariot of fire!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Harkle stammered. \"I have never - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can ye do it?\" Bruenor roared, having no patience now for unfocused blabbering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,...uh, maybe,\" Harkle proclaimed as confidently as he could. \"Actually, that spell is Alustriel\u0027s specialty. No one here has ever...\" He stopped, feeling Bruenor\u0027s frustrated glare boring into him. The dwarf stood straight-legged, one bare heel grinding into the floor, and his gnarled arms crossed over his chest, the stubby fingers of one hand tapping an impatient rhythm on his knotted biceps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall speak to the lady in the morning,\" Harkle assured him. \"I am certain - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alustriel\u0027s still here?\" Bruenor interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, yes,\" Harkle replied. \"She stayed on a few extra - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is she?\" Bruenor demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down the hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall take you to her in the morn - \" Harkle began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor grabbed the front of the wizard\u0027s nightshirt and brought him down to a dwarf\u0027s eye level. Bruenor proved the stronger even with his nose, for the long, pointy thing pressed Harkle\u0027s nose flat against one of his cheeks. Bruenor\u0027s eyes did not blink, and he spoke each word of his question slowly and distinctly, just the way he wanted the answer. \"Which room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Green door, beside the bannister.\" Harkle gulped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor gave the wizard a goodhearted wink and let him go. The dwarf turned right past Catti-brie, returning her amused smile with a determined shake of his head, and burst into the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he should not disturb the Lady Alustriel at this late hour!\" Harkle protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie could not help but laugh. \"So stop him yerself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkle listened to the dwarf\u0027s heavy footsteps resounding down the hall; Bruenor\u0027s bare feet thudded on the wooden floor like bouncing stones. \"No,\" Harkle answered her offer, his smile widening to match her own. \"I think not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly awakened in the night, the Lady Alustriel appeared no less beautiful, her silvery mane somehow mystically connected to the soft glow of the evening. Bruenor composed himself when he saw the lady, remembering her station and his manners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, begging the lady\u0027s pardon,\" he stammered, suddenly very embarrassed by his actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is late, good King Bruenor,\" Alustriel said politely, an amused smile on her face as she viewed the dwarf, dressed only in his nightshirt and broken helmet. \"What might have brought you to my door at this hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What with all that\u0027s going on about, I did not even know ye were still in Longsaddle,\" Bruenor explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have come to see you before I left,\" Alustriel replied, her tone still cordial. \"No need to disturb your sleep or mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me thoughts weren\u0027t for good-byes,\" Bruenor said. \"I be needing a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Urgently?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor nodded emphatically. \"A favor I should\u0027ve asked afore we e\u0027er got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlustriel led him into her room and closed the door behind them, realizing the seriousness of the dwarf\u0027s business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need another one of them chariots,\" said Bruenor. \"To take me to the south.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean to catch your friends and aid in the search for the halfling,\" Alustriel reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, I know me place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I cannot accompany you,\" Alustriel said. \"I have a realm to rule; it is not my place to journey unannounced to other kingdoms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be askin\u0027 ye to go,\" replied Bruenor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then who will drive the team? You have no experience with such magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor thought for just a moment. \"Harkle\u0027ll take me!\" he blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlustriel couldn\u0027t hide a smirk as she thought of the possibilities for disaster. Harkle, like so many of his Harpell kin, usually hurt himself when spellcasting. The lady knew that she would not sway the dwarf, but she felt it her duty to point out all of the weaknesses of his plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calimport is a long way indeed,\" she told him. \"The trip there on the chariot will be speedy, but the return could take many months. Will not the true king of Mithril Hall lead the gathering armies in the fight for his throne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will,\" Bruenor replied, \"if it be possible. But me place\u0027s with me friends. I owe them at least that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You risk much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more than they\u0027ve risked for me - many the times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlustriel opened the door. \"Very well,\" she said, \"and my respect on your decision. You will prove a noble king, Bruenor Battlehammer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf, for one of the few times in his life, blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now go and rest,\" said Alustriel. \"I will see what I might learn this night. Meet me on the south slope of Harpell Hill before the break of dawn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor nodded eagerly and found his way back to his room. For the first time since he had come to Longsaddle, he slept peacefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the lightening sky of predawn, Bruenor and Harkle met Alustriel at the appointed spot. Harkle had eagerly agreed to the journey; he had always wanted a crack at driving one of Lady Alustriel\u0027s famed chariots. He seemed out of place next to the battle-charged dwarf, though, wearing his wizard\u0027s robe - tucked into leather hip boots - and an oddly shaped silver helmet with fluffy white fur wings and a visor that kept flopping down over his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlustriel had not slept the rest of that night. She had been busy staring into the crystal ball the Harpells had provided her, probing distant planes in search of clues to the whereabouts of Bruenor\u0027s friends. She had learned much in that short time and had even made a connection to the dead mage Morkai in the spirit world to garner further information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what she had learned disturbed her more than a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood now, components in hand and awaiting the break of dawn, quietly facing the east. As the first rays of the sun peeked over the horizon, she swept them into her grasp and executed the spell. Minutes later, a flaming chariot and two fiery horses appeared on the hillside, magically suspended an inch from the ground. The licks of their flames sent tiny streams of smoke rising from the bedewed grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Calimport!\" Harkle proclaimed, rushing over to the enchanted carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay,\" Alustriel corrected. Bruenor turned a confused glance on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friends are not yet in the Empire of the Sands,\" the lady explained. \"They are at sea and will find grave danger this day. Set your course to the southwest, to the sea, then true south with the coast in sight.\" She tossed a heartshaped locket to Bruenor. The dwarf fumbled it open and found a picture of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The locket will warm when you approach the ship that carries your friends,\" Alustriel said. \"I created it many weeks ago, that I might have known if your group approached Silverymoon on your return from Mithril Hall.\" She avoided Bruenor\u0027s probing gaze, knowing the myriad of questions that must have been going through the dwarf\u0027s mind. Quietly, almost as if embarrassed, she added, \"I should like it returned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor kept his sly remarks to himself. He knew of the growing connection between Lady Alustriel and Drizzt. It became clearer and clearer every day. \"Ye\u0027ll get it back,\" he assured her. He scooped the locket up in his fist and moved to join Harkle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tarry not,\" Alustriel told them. \"Their need is pressing this day!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" came a call from the hill. All three turned to see Catti-brie, fully outfitted for the road, with Taulmaril, the magical bow of Anariel that she had recovered from the ruins of Mithril Hall, slung easily over her shoulder. She ran down to the back of the chariot. \"Ye weren\u0027t meaning to leave me so?\" she asked Bruenor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor couldn\u0027t look her in the eye. He had indeed meant to leave without so much as a good-bye to his daughter. \"Bah!\" he snorted. \"Ye\u0027d have only tried to stop me going!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never I would!\" Catti-brie growled right back at him. \"Me thinkin\u0027s that yer doing right. But ye\u0027d do righter if ye\u0027d move over and make room for me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor shook his head emphatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve as much the right as yerself!\" Catti-brie protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah!\" Bruenor snorted again. \"Drizzt and Rumblebelly are me truest friends!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And mine!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Wulfgar\u0027s been akin to a son to me!\" Bruenor shot back, thinking he had won the round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a might bit more than that to me,\" Catti-brie retorted, \"if he gets back from the South!\" Catti-brie didn\u0027t even need to remind Bruenor that she had been the one who introduced him to Drizzt. She had defeated all of the dwarf\u0027s arguments. \"Move aside, Bruenor Battlehammer, and make room! I\u0027ve as much at stake as yerself, and I\u0027m meaning to come along!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027ll be seeing to the armies?\" Bruenor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Harpells\u0027ll put them up. They won\u0027t be marching to the halls until we\u0027re back, or until the spring, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if both of you go and do not return,\" Harkle interjected, letting the thought hang over them for a moment. \"You are the only ones who know the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor saw Catti-brie\u0027s crestfallen look and realized how deeply she desired to join him on his quest. And he knew she was right in coming, for she had as much at stake in the chase across the southland as he. He thought for a moment, suddenly shifting to Catti-brie\u0027s side in the debate. \"The lady knows the way,\" he said, indicating Alustriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlustriel nodded. \"I do,\" she replied. \"And I would gladly show the armies to the halls. But the chariot will carry only two riders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor\u0027s sigh was as loud as Catti-brie\u0027s. He shrugged helplessly at his daughter. \"Better that ye stay,\" he said softly. \"I\u0027ll bring \u0027em back for ye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie wouldn\u0027t let it go so easily. \"When the fighting starts,\" she said, \"and suren it will, would ye rather ye had Harkle and his spells beside ye, or me and me bow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor glanced casually at Harkle and immediately saw the young woman\u0027s logic. The wizard stood at the reins of the chariot, trying to find some way to keep the visor of his helmet up on his brow. Finally Harkle gave up and just tilted his head back far enough so he could see under the visor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, ye dropped a piece of it,\" Bruenor said to him. \"That\u0027s why it won\u0027t stay up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkle turned and saw Bruenor pointing to the ground off the back of the chariot. He shuffled around beside Bruenor and bent over, trying to see what the dwarf was pointing at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Harkle bent to look, the weight of his silver helmet - which actually belonged to a cousin much large than he - toppled him over and left him sprawled face down on the lawn. In the same moment, Bruenor swept Catti-brie into the chariot beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, drats!\" Harkle whined. \"I would have so loved to go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lady\u0027ll make ye another one to fly,\" Bruenor said to comfort him. Harkle looked to Alustriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow morning,\" Alustriel agreed, quite amused by the whole scene. Then to Bruenor she asked, \"Can you guide the chariot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As well as he, by me guess!\" the dwarf proclaimed, grabbing up the fiery reins. \"Hold on, girl. We\u0027ve half a world to cross!\" He snapped the reins, and the chariot lifted into the morning sky, cutting a fiery streak across the blue-gray haze of dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind rushed past them as they shot into the west, the chariot rocking wildly from side to side, up and down. Bruenor fought frantically to hold his course; Catti-brie fought frantically just to hold on. The sides wobbled, the back dipped and climbed, and once they even spun in a complete vertical circle, though it happened so fast - luckily - that neither of the riders had time to fall out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, a single thundercloud loomed ahead of them. Bruenor saw it, and Catti-brie yelled a warning, but the dwarf hadn\u0027t mastered the subtleties of driving the chariot well enough to do anything about their course. They blew through the darkness, leaving a hissing steam tail in their wake, and rocketed out above the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Bruenor, his face glistening with wetness, found the measure of the reins. He leveled off the chariot\u0027s course and put the rising sun behind his right shoulder. Catti-brie, too, found her footing, though she still clung tightly to the chariot\u0027s rail with one hand, and to the dwarf\u0027s heavy cloak with the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver dragon rolled over onto its back lazily, riding the morning winds with its legs - all four - crossed over it and its sleepy eyes half closed. The good dragon loved its morning glide, leaving the bustle of the world far below and catching the sun\u0027s untainted rays above the cloud level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dragon\u0027s marvelous orbs popped open wide when it saw the fiery streak rushing at it from the east. Thinking the flames to be the forerunning fires of an evil red dragon, the silver swooped around into a high cloud and poised to ambush the thing. But the fury left the dragon\u0027s eyes when it recognized the strange craft, a fiery chariot, with just the helm of the driver, a one-horned contraption, sticking above the front of the carriage and a young human woman standing behind, her auburn locks flying back over her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts huge mouth agape, the silver dragon watched as the chariot sped past. Few things piqued the curiosity of this ancient creature, who had lived so very many years, but it seriously considered following this unlikely scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cool breeze wafted in then and washed all other thoughts from the silver dragon\u0027s mind. \"Peoples,\" it muttered, rolling again onto its back and shaking its head in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie and Bruenor never even saw the dragon. Their eyes were fixed squarely ahead, where the wide sea was already in sight on the western horizon, blanketed by a heavy morning mist. A half-hour later, they saw the high towers of Waterdeep to the north and moved out from the Sword Coast and over the water. Bruenor, getting a better feel of the reins, swung the chariot to the south and dropped it low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiving into the gray shroud of mist, they heard the lapping of the waves below them and the hiss of steam as the spray hit their fiery craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring her up!\" Catti-brie yelled. \"Ye\u0027re too low!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Need to be low!\" Bruenor gasped, fighting the reins. He tried to mask his incompetence, but he fully realized that they were indeed too close to the water. Struggling with all his might, he managed to bring the chariot up a few more feet and level it off. \"There,\" he boasted. \"Got it straight, and got it low.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over his shoulder at Catti-brie. \"Need to be low,\" he said again into her doubting expression. \"We have to see the durn ship to find it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie only shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then they did see a ship. Not the ship, but a ship nonetheless, looming up in the mist barely thirty yards ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie screamed - Bruenor did, too - and the dwarf fell back with the reins, forcing the chariot upward at as steep an angle as possible. The ship\u0027s deck rolled out below them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the masts still towered above them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf all the ghosts of every sailor who had ever died on the sea had risen from their watery graves and sought vengeance on this particular vessel, the lookout\u0027s face would not have held a truer expression of terror. Possibly he leaped from his perch - more likely he toppled in fright - but either way, he missed the deck and dropped safely into the water at the very last second before the chariot streaked past his crow\u0027s nest and nipped the top of the mainmast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatti-brie and Bruenor composed themselves and looked back to see the tip of the ship\u0027s mast burning like a single candle in the gray mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027re too low,\" Catti-brie reiterated. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-elf-trilogy-exile-the-dark-elf-trilogy-2/page-11.html","bookId":2105,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:49:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:49:29 PM"}
