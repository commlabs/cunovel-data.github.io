I have something special in mind for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- \u003d I have isolated the city-experience within me and have examined it closely. The idea of a city fascinates me. The formation of a biological community without a functioning, supportive social community leads to havoc. Whole worlds have become single biological communities without an interrelated social structure and this has always led to ruin. It becomes dramatically instructive under overcrowded conditions. The ghetto is lethal. Psychic stresses of overcrowding create pressures which will erupt. The city is an attempt to manage these forces. The social forms by which cities make the attempt are worth study. Remember that there exists a certain malevolence about the formation of any social order. It is the struggle for existence by an artificial entity. Despotism and slavery hover at the edges. Many injuries occur and, thus, the need for laws. The law develops its own power structure, creating more wounds and new injustices. Such trauma can be healed by cooperation, not by confrontation. The summons to cooperate identifies the healer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- The Stolen Journals MONEO ENTERED Leto\u0027s small chamber with evident agitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe actually preferred this meeting place because the God Emperor\u0027s cart lay in a depression from which a deadly attack by the Worm would be more difficult, and there was the undeniable fact that Leto allowed his majordomo to descend in an Ixian tube-lift rather than via that interminable ramp. But Moneo felt that the news he brought this morning was guaranteed to arouse The Worm Who Is God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to present it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn lay only an hour past, the fourth Festival Day, a fact Moneo could greet with equanimity only because it brought him that much nearer the end of these tribulations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto stirred as Moneo entered the small chamber.

Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe danger, Moneo knew from experience, lay in the temptation to reveal too much too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have spent some time with the Reverend Mother Anteac,\" he said. \"Although she keeps it well hidden, I\u0027m sure she is a Mentat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.

This form of disobedience amuses me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you will not punish them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moneo, I am ultimately the only parent my people have. A parent must be generous as well as severe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s in a good mood, Moneo thought. A small sigh escaped Moneo, at which Leto smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anteac objected when I told her you had ordered an amnesty for a selected few Face Dancers among our captives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a Festive use for them,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will tell you later. Let\u0027s get to the news which brings you bursting in upon me at this hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... ahhh...\" Moneo chewed at his upper lip. \"The Tleilaxu have been quite garrulous in the attempt to ingratiate themselves with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they have. And what have they revealed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They... ahhh, provided the lxians with sufficient advice and equipment to make a... uhhh, not exactly a ghola, and not even a clone. Perhaps we should use the Tleilaxu term: a cellular restructuring. The... ahhh, experiment was conducted within some sort of shielding device which the Guildsmen assured them your powers could not penetrate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the result?\" Leto felt that he was asking the question in a cold vacuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are not certain. Tleilaxu were not permitted to witness. However, they did observe that Malky entered this... ahhh, chamber and that he emerged later with an infant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! I know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" Moneo was puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By inference. And all of this happened some twenty-six years ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is correct, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They identify the infant as Hwi Noree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are not certain, Lord, but...\" Moneo shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. And what do you deduce from this, Moneo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is a deep purpose built into the new Ixian Ambassador.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly there is. Moneo, has it not struck you as odd how much Hwi, the gentle Hwi, represents a mirror of the redoubtable Malky? His opposite in everything, including sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had not thought of that, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will have her sent back to Ix immediately,\" Moneo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will do nothing of the kind!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Lord, if they...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moneo, I have observed that you seldom turn your back on danger. Others often do, but you-seldom. Why would you have me engage in such an obvious stupidity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoneo swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I like it when you recognize the error of your ways,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also like it when you express your gratitude sincerely, as you have just done. Now, Anteac was with you when you heard these revelations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you ordered, Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent. That will stir things up a bit. You will leave now and go to the Lady Hwi. You will tell her that I desire to see her immediately. This will disturb her. She is thinking that we will not meet again until I summon her to the Citadel. I want you to quiet her fears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what way, Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto spoke sadly: \"Moneo, why do you ask advice on something at which you are an expert? Calm her and bring her here reassured of my kindly intentions toward her.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/god-emperor-of-dune-dune-chronicles-4/page-18.html","bookId":2156,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:26:28 PM"}
