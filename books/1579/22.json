Come with me now.” He pivots around and walks out, not bothering to look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething is off; I sense it as we fol ow the staffer outside and along the brick path toward the library. His pace is more than just brisk and urgent; there is fear propel ing his boots forward. No one speaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking through the front doors and into the library feels like walking into the lion\u0027s den.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, the fi rst thing I sense are bodies. Lots of them, perhaps two dozen, staffers and sentries standing just inside the foyer. all of them are wearing shades, all off to the side, standing stiffl y at attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t swivel your eyes back and forth. Don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody moves. I let my eyes adjust to the darkness slowly, taking long, sustained breaths. It\u0027s cold inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing good is going to come out of this. The only silver lining: They don\u0027t know yet. That I\u0027m a heper. If they knew, I wouldn\u0027t still be standing here. They\u0027d have pounced on me the second I entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear his voice before I see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I trust you have found these accommodations to your satisfac-tion?” the Director says in a tempered tone. He is standing in the center of the room, just off the side of a table, the right side of his face lit by a mercuric lamp, his left side blanketed in blackness. His lithe fi gure, cutting an inconspicuous line in the room, possesses the thinness of a slashing razor. As he speaks, even the books on the shelves seem to tilt slightly away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, they have been wonderful. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head arcs upward as if fol owing a fl ock of birds hastily taking fl ight. “We worried about the size of the sleep- holds. They weren\u0027t custom- fi t for you. We apologize for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They were a coincidental y good fi t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were they now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazes casual y at me with seeming disinterest, but beneath his stare a keen coldness lingers. Without warning, his feet suddenly lift off the ground as he leaps toward the ceiling. His body spins upward, his feet a half second later locking into the sleep- holds, the very sleep- holds I have never used. Minutely, his body sways lan-guorously, like the pendulum of an ancient grandfather clock. His eyes, upside down, are still locked cool y on mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amazing how different the world is from this position, when everything is turned on its head. Do you fi nd that to be true?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I do,” I answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Makes you see things from a different perspective. And that\u0027s why I\u0027m upside down, looking at you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I\u0027m trying to see you in a different light. Trying to see what\u0027s so special about you. Trying to see why the Palace is singling you out, giving you the royal treatment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I just don\u0027t see anything about you that\u0027s distinguishing.” He closes his eyes, luxu-riating in a long, drawn- out blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Royal treatment, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, playing dumb, I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take a look around,” he whispers, “at this whole wide library that is yours alone. It\u0027s even bigger than my chambers! And you tel me the Palace is not giving you the royal treatment.” He descends slowly from the sleep- holds and lands unnervingly close to me, an arm\u0027s length away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fi ght the urge to step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, just a few minutes ago, I received yet another directive from the Palace. Concerning you. Again.” He pauses, a glint in his eyes. “There are very few things in life that leave me at a loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this kind of attention from the Palace for someone as bland and insignifi cant as you . . . wel , quite frankly, it\u0027s left me fl ummoxed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I confess I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re referring to. Another directive, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No confessions, please.” He takes a step back to a nearby desk, his fi nger trailing along the back of a chair. He pul s it out, sits down. And that\u0027s when I notice the two attaché cases. On the table, refl ecting the faint gleam of the mercuric lights. They stand straight up like everyone else in the room, at attention. But with an ominous air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If there\u0027s one thing I disdain, it\u0027s being kept in the dark. It\u0027s a cold stiff arm of disrespect. And the Palace has been doing this repetitively over the past few weeks. To me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRandom directives arriving on my desk daily, without explanation or rationale, last minute twists and turns regarding the Hunt. Fortunately, my bright intel ect helps me see the method to all the madness of these directives.” His lips downturn. “Except when it comes to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding off to my right, Ashley June hasn\u0027t moved. Her arms hang still by her sides, her face lost in the dark shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ve done my research on you. Apparently, you\u0027re quite an intel-lectual standout at school, not nearly as dumb as you\u0027ve been pretending to be here. Quite the brains, so they say. A natural, despite your only moderately above par grades. How did the report put it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, yes, that yours was a stupendous and prodigious intel igence not ful y tapped. That\u0027s the intel on you, anyway.” He pauses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could that be what garners all this attention, favoritism?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour so-cal ed intel igence?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe says, staring condescendingly at me with the naked disdain of someone feeling threatened. “Tel me: What do you think this Hunt is about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s testing me. Sizing me up. “Hunting hep—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And don\u0027t say ‘hunting hepers.\u0027 Because it\u0027s never been about hunting or hepers or hunting hepers. So don\u0027t use any of those words separately or in combination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s all about the Ruler,” I answer, strangely emboldened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes snap to mine, but there is no menace in them. “Ah, the lad might have a mind, after all . Expound, then, if you wil .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause. “I\u0027d rather not, I think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head snaps back. “You\u0027d rather so, I should think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a pause, I speak, in as even- keeled a voice as I can muster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Ruler knows that his popularity rating has been sagging recently. This is unfair because he is a truly dynamic leader, the best this land has ever known in all its storied and glorious past. But our Ruler is not so much interested in his popularity numbers as he is in the happiness of his people. And nothing else brings as much communal bliss and sense of societal camaraderie as a Heper Hunt. It is to that end that he plans and executes the Heper Hunt with such adroit skil . Of course, it is merely incidental that— as history bears out— nothing will help his numbers as much as a Heper Hunt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bingo,” the Director whispers, his eyes closing in ecstasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My, my, my. The boy wonder surprises after all .” He scratches his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But that was an easy question. The warm- up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slight shake of the head and then he sets his eyes on mine, a hardness fl itting across his face. “Explain to me . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall of this,” he says, his arms fl oating above him momentarily like a bal erina. “Explain the reason for this training orientation. After all , who needs training to hunt down hepers? Why the idiotic lectures, workshops, training sessions? And explain the festivities, the fanfare of the Gala, explain the reason for the media, reporters, and photographers fl ooding into this Institute as we speak. And explain why on earth we are arming the hepers with FLUNs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t say sorry,” he says. And he waits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not so smart after all . Are you?” His upper lip snarls up re- proachful y, exposing the lower half of his fangs. “Fact is, you\u0027re just like everyone else around here, all the incompetent staff who need to be hand- fed intel igence, my intel igence. Clueless. Brainless. Empty-headed.” His eyes stare out at me, fl aring down his nose and upturned chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Empty as this Institute,” he says, bitterness souring his words. “Empty as this Institute,” he says again, quieter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns his back to me, stares out the window. When he speaks, the cratered emptiness of his voice surprises me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn\u0027t always this way. The hal ways used to hum with foot traffi c; classrooms spil ed over with the very brightest fi rst- rate minds; laboratories were hives of activity, brimming with experiments conducted by top- notch scientists. And the heper pens! They were fi l ed, from top to bottom, with dozens of hepers, young to old. Our breeding program— my breeding program— was about to really take off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was energy about this place, a spark running along the wal s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had purpose, recognition, admiration, respect, even envy. We had everything.” He stops speaking, stops moving, his chest so still , it is as if he has stopped breathing. “Everything but self- control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then his eyes turn to the sentries and staff standing stiffl y around us, his icy stare pinning each of them like moths to the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until one day, we had virtual y no hepers left,” he continues, turning to face me. “This will be the very last Heper Hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ruler knows this. But he is most unwil ing to have what\u0027s been a popularity cow for him come to an end. So he has devised a way to keep feeding off this Hunt for years to come, in perpetuity, even.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley June, off to my right, hasn\u0027t moved. Not a sound out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A book. A nonfi ction account of this Hunt. The public has always been insanely curious about the Hunt. The good citizens, who salivate over every detail of the Heper Hunt, wil keep this book on the best- sel er list for de cades. And this book will not be a dry journalistic work. No; rather— and here is the stroke of genius— it will be a memoir penned by the winner. The winner of this Hunt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strokes his cheek with the backs of his fi ngers, up and down, up and down. “Do you see how everything fi ts together now? Do you see why we have a training period?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe Gala? the media fl ooding the Institute?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I see it. It all makes sense now. “It\u0027s all for the book,” I whisper. “To draw out the Hunt, stretch it out to a week- long event, to provide material for the book. To make it all the more exciting. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-22.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
