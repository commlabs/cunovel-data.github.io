Had Martha been compeled to believe I\u0027d attacked her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Damon compel ed her? It was possible, and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. She\u0027d barely even opened her eyes before she blamed me. And she hadn\u0027t listened to me at first, she\u0027d simply screamed, as if she\u0027d been primed to do so. There were only two people that could have compel ed her to think that way: the vampire I chased to the docks, or Damon, after I\u0027d left her with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ordered a whiskey and turned back to the tables. I could question one suspect right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hel o, brother!\" Damon said pleasantly, holding his glass out to me as a form of greeting. \"I\u0027m afraid the excitement distracted you from your duties for the evening. I believe you were in charge of the bar tab?\" he asked expectantly. \"I had a few more whiskeys than I\u0027d intended, but I think they\u0027re justified, given the circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you do it?\" I hissed as I slid into the chair opposite him. I kept thinking of the girl\u0027s thin, reedy scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what?\" Damon asked innocently, taking another sip of his drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I\u0027m talking about,\" I said darkly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t, actual y. I\u0027m sorry if I was unsatisfactory in playing nursemaid to some no-name girl. How was your kil er-catching?\" he said, arching an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not playing games. And I don\u0027t care if you don\u0027t want to help, but I know the killer is a vampire, I said under my breath, in a voice low enough that only Damon could hear. If anything, I thought I saw a vague flicker of surprise cross his eyes. I couldn\u0027t catch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what? Damon asked after a pause. In all your years roaming you never encountered another one of us, except for the vampire freak house you and Lexi lived in down in New Orleans? You always seem so surprised. We kill, brother. It\u0027s nothing novel. Or particularly interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing interesting about this is seeing you learn this lesson, over and over again. Hasn\u0027t this finally taught you not to meddle? No one appreciates it. Not humans, and not vampires, Damon said, stil smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chil crept up my spine. Had Damon framed me for the murders? Had that been his grand plan? Because he knew that I\u0027d try to help. I couldn\u0027t stop myself from getting far too involved in human problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t seek out problems, I said simply. And I don\u0027t create them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, maybe you should. They can be fun. Of course, this problem is stupid and careless and blood-drunk, leaving us to clean up his dirty work, Damon mused. \"But what\u0027s the point?\" Damon asked in his normal voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you find him. Then what?\" he asked, steepling his fingers, then resting his chin against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I . . .\" I floundered. Would I kil him? Bring him to the police?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon looked at me with a bemused expression. \"See? You used to think too much. Now you don\u0027t think at al . I always thought it would do you good to be more impulsive, but your impulsivity is getting you nowhere. And you know why?\" he asked, leaning in close toward me, so much so that I could smel rich, sweet blood on his breath. But was it Charlotte\u0027s blood? Or Martha\u0027s? Or could it be someone else\u0027s entirely?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I asked. The scent of the blood was overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re not doing it for yourself. You\u0027re doing it for humanity. For the greater good,\" Damon said, sarcasm dripping from his voice. \"But remember, we\u0027re not part of humanity anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So then why are you constantly compel ing yourself into social circles and playing stupid tricks on people? Why are you insistent on being Damon the duke, or Damon the viscount? If we\u0027re not part of humanity, why don\u0027t you remove yourself from society?\" I asked. Despite my words, I wasn\u0027t angry at him. Rather, I just wanted to understand what Damon was after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where would I go?\" Damon asked, a faraway expression on his face. But al of a sudden, he grinned making his searching look seem to be nothing more than a trick of the light. \"And I compel myself into social circles because I can. Because it intrigues me. And my pleasure is al that matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so?\" I hissed. I noticed that he didn\u0027t fol ow up that statement with how his other drive in life was to make mine a living hel , but I refrained from mentioning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Wel , brother,\" Damon said suddenly, draining his whiskey and smacking his lips. \"This has been a perting evening, but if you\u0027l forgive me, I have dinner plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said, not wanting to hear what his evening plans entailed. As Damon stood up to leave the tavern, Violet sidled up to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you leaving already?\" Violet asked, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m terribly sorry, but as I was saying to Stefan, I have a dinner appointment that I couldn\u0027t possibly miss,\" Damon said, standing and kissing her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s so late.\" Violet pouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I\u0027l see you tomorrow. Won\u0027t I, dear?\" Damon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dock party at Canary Wharf! Of course!\" Violet smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe docks? Perhaps the runaway shadow from earlier would be there, if those invited included the undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027l be a party to die for,\" Damon said with a knowing smile that caused my skin to crawl. That was the problem: When we were humans, Damon had his dark side, but he was always himself. Now, I had no idea where the real Damon was, or what I should believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027l be there,\" Violet said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you later, brother,\" Damon said as he sauntered out the door without a backward glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up too, a wave of dizziness washing over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go, Violet,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, not bothering to tel Alfred she was leaving. It didn\u0027t matter. The tavern felt like an outpost of the police station. In fact, most of the patrons were now police officers, going through their notes and trudging upstairs to check on Martha. Occasional y they\u0027d look over at me and scribble something in their notebooks. I couldn\u0027t stay any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViolet hooked her arm in mine and we made our way back toward our hotel. Violet was silent and drawn, caught up in her own thoughts. I knew tonight\u0027s events just reminded her of Cora, and I didn\u0027t have the words to comfort her, not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" Violet asked in a smal voice as we stepped onto the dark, plush carpet of the hotel. She was so sweet to be concerned about me at a time like this, I felt my heart almost break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forced myself to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wil be,\" I said. But she knew I was lying. Death surrounded me, and it was only a matter of time before it caved in - or I broke free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, there would be blood. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-ripper-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-12.html","bookId":2112,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:15 PM"}
