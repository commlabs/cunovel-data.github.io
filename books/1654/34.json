But now it’s been long enough…” I heard what she didn’t say. She wanted him to follow his heart, even if it was worrisome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He hasn’t said anything to me or attended any of our drills. Tell him if he still wants to join up, it needs to be after he’s worked with us some.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll ask why you’ve accepted strangers over him, no questions asked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because they’re trained soldiers and he’s not. It would be irresponsible to take him into action without first teaching him how to fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds fair.” She was visibly relieved that we weren’t both marching off today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended the discussion with a hug, but I couldn’t linger. It wouldn’t look good if I ordered the men to be ready in an hour and I showed up late. Lead by example, Silk always said—and though I didn’t agree with everything she’d shouted at me, that tenet stuck. Momma Oaks accompanied me to the gate, and as she’d promised, Edmund arrived soon after with a light metal rod. It wasn’t so long it would be unwieldy or so heavy it would be a problem to carry. In efficient motions, she stitched the pennant to the pole while I counted heads. Fade was here, Thornton and Tegan too … Zach Bigwater, Harry Carter, all the scouts, along with Morrow, Tully, and Spence. I’d memorized all the men’s names because they weren’t numbers to me. I ran down the roster mentally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone’s present,” I said. “Company D, move out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a miserable march, though our official flag cheered the men up considerably. They took turns carrying it and eventually took to wagering over who got the privilege. I had nothing to do with that; they awarded it to one another for whimsical reasons: a good song, stealthy movements, a cheerful tale. Though I expected some of the new men to complain, as they weren’t used to life in the field, none of them whined. That was a good start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground was marshy from melting snow and frozen by turns, so I watched my step. Stalker and his scouts ran vanguard, finding us a good, safe route to Winterville. Since I didn’t know what we’d face once we arrived, it seemed best not to expend our energies more than necessary. There would definitely be fighting in town, and I hated the thought of killing humans. The handful of times I’d done so, I only enjoyed it once. Gary Miles, the Salvation soldier who thought girls were good for only one purpose, was no loss to the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the weather, we made good time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the outskirts of Winterville, I waited while Stalker and his scouts surveyed the opposition. The rest of us were tense, listening for any sign that the afflicted were venturing past the Winterville boundaries. Now and again, I heard inhuman shrieks, wordless growls, awful but distinctive from any sound I ever heard the Freaks utter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is horrible,” Tegan whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. The scouting party didn’t return a moment too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the former Wolf was tough, even he was shaken when they returned. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” Stalker said, still panting. “Every house is barricaded from the inside, windows and doors. And the town itself…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go on,” I prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are people everywhere, attacking anything that moves … eating each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorror ran through me. Regardless whether the scientist, Wilson, had good intentions, he’d experimented without considering the consequences, and it now seemed that his work would end as badly as those that started all the trouble in the first place. If these people turn into Freaks … With some effort, I curtailed my urge to speculate and focused on the facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many?” I asked Stalker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seventy-five to a hundred. That’s just an estimate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are they working together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStalker shook his head. “No. If anything, they’re competing to get into the houses. It’s … grim, maybe the worst thing I’ve ever seen. You’ll understand when we move in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering what he and I had been through, that was quite a statement. But I didn’t doubt him. Armed with this disturbing information, I went back to the others and gave the orders. “We’re splitting into four teams of eleven. I’ll assign squad leaders to each, and you’ll follow their instructions as if I had given them. Understood?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir,” they chorused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went on, “We have a devil of a mess to tidy up. While it’s true we didn’t make it, the people trapped in those houses are counting on us. I have no idea whether what Wilson did to these poor madmen is contagious, so protect yourselves from their teeth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTegan bounced, which I took to mean she had something to add. “Blood can carry diseases, too, so be careful. Try not to get it in your eyes or mouths, and if you have any open wounds, make sure they’re covered before the battle begins.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything else, Doc?” She flushed with pleasure when I called her that, but she shook her head. That was the extent of her warnings, apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent. Some of you may hesitate when it sinks in—that we’re fighting people. But remember, there’s no help for them. That’s the reason Wilson kept them penned up; he was trying to find a cure, but they’re broken beyond fixing, and it’s a kindness to put them down.” The words sounded hard and cold to my own ears, but the men were nodding. “Now then, team leaders: Stalker, Fade, me, Morrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storyteller looked surprised to be called out, but he was smart, and he’d lead his men with the same care and wisdom he’d offered Tegan during their training sessions. To avoid any question of favoritism and for the sake of speed, men counted off by fours and then divided up accordingly. I ended up with Thornton and Spence, but not Tully, along with Tegan, three scouts, Zach Bigwater, and three fresh recruits. It was a good mix of skills with enough veterans that we should be able to compensate if Zach panicked under pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone knows who’s in their squads?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey agreed in unison that they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Then, Stalker, you take the eastern section. I’ll go west. Fade, you have the north, and, Morrow, you’ve got the south, where the problem started. But from what Stalker said, there’s trouble all over Winterville now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m clear on the objective,” Stalker said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorrow inclined his head. “Me too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Fade stepped close, gesturing to his men to wait a second. They were checking their weapons, talking in low voices about the fight to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned in with a furrowed brow. “Are you positive you want me in charge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood that he thought he wasn’t the Hunter he had been, and he had doubts about his leadership. But Fade needed to stop treading in my shadow; he was every bit as fierce and strong as he had been, maybe more so. Blasted few people could survive an experience like his. Even less would be able to wade into battle afterward. He was one of the strongest, bravest people I’d ever known, and it was past time for him to acknowledge that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne step at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I met his gaze, I didn’t do so as the girl who loved him or the Huntress partnered with him down below. My tone was firm and cool. “Are you questioning my judgment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read the shock in his gaze, quickly veiled by a thick sweep of lashes. Then he stepped back. “No, sir. I have my assignment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pitched my voice to carry. “When you clear your quadrant, head for the lab at the center of town. You can’t miss it.” I described the building, just in case. “Now let’s get this done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlaughterhouse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anything, Stalker understated the chaos and carnage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinterville reeked of infection and death. The wind carried the stench from all corners, which told me nothing about where we’d find the afflicted ones. I stepped over a puddle of blood and scanned the area before I led my group west. Bloody palm prints stood out in sharp relief on the pale metal of the buildings. Zach Bigwater was an unknown quantity, but fortunately, I had veterans to compensate for his inexperience, and the rest of my team should be competent. My nerves drew taut as I listened. With a glance at Tegan, I confirmed that she heard it too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty paces on, we ran into the source of the noise. Ten feral humans surrounded a house, scrabbling at the barricaded windows, and their utter wrongness pierced me like a blade. As we approached, they turned—an uncontrollable impulse more than a decision—and ran at us with lips curled away from their teeth. I caught a glimpse of rabid eyes with starbursts of blood in the corners, normal human hands with nails untended until they were curled and yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I’d cautioned my people not to hesitate, I hated it when I drew my knives. These people didn’t deserve this; Wilson had done it to them—with the best of intentions—but still, their suffering could be laid at his door. When the first lunged at me, I saw that he was Edmund’s age. He might’ve been a farmer before, a normal man who loved his family and hated parsnips. Please, give me the strength to do what’s needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a rush of sorrow, I took him down, and that kill set the tone for everyone else. I glanced around for Tegan, but she was executing the staff maneuvers Morrow had taught her with complete precision. We all accounted for one except for Zach; he froze while the rest of us defended. Afterward, he hunched and lost his breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you?” he asked in a low whisper. “They were people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears filled Tegan’s eyes. “I know. But it was a mercy. They couldn’t ever be who they were again. If they were in their right minds, it wouldn’t be necessary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked all the bodies to make sure they were dead, taking care with their blood as Tegan had suggested. Thornton watched, then he etched what I’d learned was the sign of the cross. I’d seen Morgan do that as well; and he had explained it had spiritual significance when I asked. My family had religion, but they didn’t favor that gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lying there, they look so normal, almost like us,” the older man answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was eerie. This was what it must’ve been like long ago, before everyone changed; I glimpsed the Freak genesis in these poor lunatics, and it chilled me to the bone. With care, I closed all the eyes, so they weren’t staring at the sky with eternal hunger. At last, satisfied they were all dead, I straightened, though part of me couldn’t help a primitive fear that these corpses would rise and shamble after us. Apparently the others felt the same because they backed off, and didn’t turn until we moved more than fifty paces away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell into step with Zach, keeping my tone low so the others couldn’t hear, though they might well guess what I was saying. “The next fight might be more challenging, and we can’t carry your weight. Don’t let me down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, looking ashamed. “It won’t happen again, I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt for him, this boy who had lost his whole family, and now had to learn to fight when that hadn’t been his role from the beginning, as it had mine. But in this world, people had to adapt, or they died. Cowardice would haunt him all his life, if he didn’t find the courage to raise a weapon and hold his ground. It wasn’t that I thought people who couldn’t fight were worthless; that judgment came from deep inside the kid. He needed to earn his own self-respect. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/horde-razorland-3/page-34.html","bookId":1654,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:42 PM"}
