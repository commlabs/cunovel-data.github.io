But … that empire is gone, Paran. If it ever existed at all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that’s a sharp observation . ‘Nothing lasts, Quick Ben. Speaking of which, how do you warrant Kalam and Minala’s chances?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben grunted and the sound might have been wry laughter, or sympathy. ‘I don’t. And while I think they’d be good together, they keep trying to wear each other’s skin, if you know what I mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sort of.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s not love that’s the problem.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s all the rest.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben nodded, and then he shrugged. ‘So tell me, O Master of the Deck of Dragons, what awaits us now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That depends.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘On what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gods below, where do I begin?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Start with the worst it could get.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worst? ‘How much do you already know?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben rubbed vigorously at his face, as if trying to rearrange his own features. And, maybe, become someone else . ‘Not as much as you might believe,’ he said. ‘Shadowthrone’s not yet gotten over some past slight I offered him – though for the life of me I can’t recall what it might have been. In any case, we’re not exactly whispering in each other’s ear.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Still,’ Paran said, not quite convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well. You have to understand – I usually work alone. And if I need help, I make sure the bargain I make is mutually beneficial … to keep down the chances of taking a knife in the back. I admit it, High Fist, I really trust no one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No one at all?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The trust I have … for some people … comes down to how well I know them, and then it’s a matter of my trusting them to do what I think they’re going to do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s a rather cynical take on trust,’ Paran observed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s the safest. It doesn’t take much insight to realize that most people are only looking out for themselves. And once you figure out what they want, you can—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Manipulate them?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard shrugged. ‘Am I that much of a mystery? I have twelve souls in me. Think about that. All those lives, all those desires, regrets, hurts. Whatever you feel about your life, I have that a dozen times over. And some of those souls in me … are old .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yet, of necessity, you all have to work together, for a common purpose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If you say so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParan studied the man. Mystery? What mystery? ‘Right. Very well. The worst? Here goes, then. Kurald Galain falls to vengeful Tiste Liosan, and they walk that path right into the heart of Shadow, ousting Shadowthrone, and from there they march onward, to this world, joining with the Forkrul Assail in a tide of slaughter, until not one city is left standing, not one field planted, not one human child born into the world. Do you want the rest?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There’s more?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Elder Gods, having at last freed the Otataral Dragon, succeed in the annihilation of magic, barring that paid for in blood – unless of course Korabas is killed, but if that happens it will mean that the Eleint, who are now or will soon be loose in this realm, will have killed it – and they will in turn seek domination, not just of this realm, but of all realms, delivering chaos wherever they go. And so, even with us wiped from the earth, terrible powers will contest the claim to our legacy. The gods will be dead, magic a thirst only fools would dare invite, and … well, should I go on?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben licked dry lips. ‘Parts of Burn are dying – on our way here, whenever we touched the soil of this world, I could feel her skin searing, drying and shrivelling into something … lifeless.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Otataral Dragon, yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I probably already knew that,’ Quick Ben muttered. ‘Just trying not to think about it and hoping it would all go away. Hood’s breath! Ganoes Paran – tell me what we can do to prevent all this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe High Fist’s brows rose. ‘How unfortunate. That is the question I was going to ask you, Quick Ben.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s not funny.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wasn’t meant to be.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your sister—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, my sister. You were with her, wizard. She must have explained her plan.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben looked away. ‘She would free the Crippled God.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And that’s it?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-320.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
