{"id":84486,"no":54,"title":"Page 54","content":"\u003cp\u003eKellan\u0027s car was in the driveway as I hurried past it to the front door. I hated to ask him to do anything, and I really didn\u0027t need another awkward car ride, but maybe he could help me out and take me to Pete\u0027s? My shift started in ten minutes. If I had to take yet another bus, I was going to be so incredibly late...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swiftly went to my room and set down my bag. Pulling off my blouse, I grabbed my Pete\u0027s t-shirt from the floor, where I had tossed it last night after my shift. Quickly, I put it on then scrounged around the room for an elastic band. Finding one in-between the bed and the nightstand, I hastily began pulling my hair into a low ponytail. I put my jacket back on and grabbed my bag again, and made my way to the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just wondering where Kellan might be, when I heard soft music from his room and I noticed that his door was cracked open. Only thinking that I was massively late and needed his help, I went to the door and automatically put my hand on it, opening it slightly wider. I froze in shock when I peered through the crack in the door. My stomach clenched and threatened to rise. My mind wouldn\u0027t register what I was witnessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKellan was sitting on the edge of his bed. His head was down, his eyes were closed, he was biting his bottom lip and his hand was clutching the sheets. My mind resisted, but the rest of the picture snapped painfully into focus. A woman with loose blonde curls was kneeling on the floor in front of him, her head in his lap. Looking at the picture as a whole, there was no mistaking what she was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWholly absorbed in what they were clearly enjoying, I don\u0027t think they were even aware of me standing at the partially open door. I felt ill. I wanted more than anything to run as far away as I could, before I lost my stomach right here. I couldn\u0027t move though, I couldn\u0027t stop staring in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman must have finally felt another presence in the room. She started to raise herself off of him. Kellan was not so aware, either that, or he didn\u0027t care. His lips parted - his breath noticeably faster, and cringing slightly, he moved his hand automatically to firmly hold her in place. The woman went nuts, she immensely enjoyed that. I however, felt the acid in my stomach starting to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally able to move, I ran from the room and down the stairs. Only thinking of escape, my fight or flight response in full alert, I hastily grabbed Kellan\u0027s car keys from where he had tossed them on the entryway table. I slammed the front door shut behind me - if he hadn\u0027t been aware I was home before, he was now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped through the keys as I rushed to his car, and stopped on the one for the ignition. He never locked his...baby, so I opened the door and slipped inside, immediately starting it. A perverse thrill went through me as the car growled to life, knowing that he would hear it, and instantly recognize what I had done. I watched the door for half a second, but he didn\u0027t rush out. I threw it in reverse and peeled out in my haste to get away from him. Watching the house through the rearview mirror, the front door never opened. Perhaps he was too busy enjoying his \"date\" to care about his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke a half-dozen traffic laws getting to work on time, but I did. I smiled when I parked the car in the lot at Pete\u0027s. It was really fun to drive, and I loved the thrill that Kellan was going to be so angry about his precious car being gone. Good. I shouldn\u0027t be the only one angry in the house. Grinning wickedly, I turned his radio to a station that was playing what sounded like polka music and cranked the volume before I shut the car off. It was a childish prank, I know, but it made me feel better, and I was grinning ear to ear as I walked through the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you\u0027re peppy tonight,\" Jenny exclaimed as I bounced through the front door, still a little high from my carjacking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? No particular reason...\" I grinned at her as I shoved his keys into my front jeans pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout my shift though, my joyride-high faded, and sadness from the scene I had unintentionally witnessed took over. It was one thing to hear one of Kellan\u0027s dates, it was quite another to see one. I was feeling pretty melancholy when the doors to Pete\u0027s angrily burst open, about an hour later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed and looked over to the door. Kellan was striding through, looking decidedly more put together than I had last seen him. He also looked decidedly pissed off. His fiery blue eyes locked onto mine instantly. Matt came in closely behind him and attempted to place a hand on his shoulder. Kellan snapped his head around to him, pulling back his body, and said something heated. Matt immediately dropped his hand and held them up in the air, apparently backing off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart started racing and panicking, I backed up a couple steps. Taking his car was not a good idea. What was I thinking? Should I just toss him the keys and make a run for it? Irritation flashed through me and I took a deep breath. No! He would never physically hurt me. If the jerk wants his keys...let him come over and get them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strode over to my location. The people between us quickly scooted out of his way at the look on his face. His blazing eyes narrowed in anger, his lips compressed into a thin line, his hands clenched into fists, his chest noticeably rising and falling - he was strikingly attractive angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked right up to me and simply held his hand out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpecting a more flagrant reaction, I snottily said, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keys,\" he seethed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What keys?\" I wasn\u0027t sure why I was goading him. Maybe the sight I had witnessed had finally unhinged me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep calming breath. \"Kiera...my car is right over there.\" He pointed to where it was in the lot outside. \"I heard you take it-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you heard me take it, why didn\u0027t you try to stop me?\" I quipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed a finger into his chest roughly, cutting him off. \"You were,\" I raised my fingers into air quotation marks, \"on a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face noticeably paled. Apparently, he hadn\u0027t realized I had seen that. Scowling, his color returned. \"So? That gives you the right to steal my car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, of course, not that I would ever admit that to him. \"I borrowed. Friends borrow, right?\" I asked haughtily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took another deep breath and then shoved his hand into my front jeans pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" I tried to beat him away, but he already had them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding them up in front of me, he seethed, \"We\u0027re not friends, Kiera. We never were.\" Then he turned and stalked out of the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face heated at his hurtful words and turning, I fled to the hallway, then to the safety of the bathroom. I collapsed against the wall, breathing heavily through my mouth, trying not to cry. I felt pale, I felt faint. My heart felt torn to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the door opening entered my awareness, as I sat there inhaling and exhaling forcibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiera...?\" Jenny\u0027s soft voice asked. I couldn\u0027t answer her. I could only stare up at her blankly. She walked and knelt down beside me. \"What was that about...you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head weakly. Then I started to sob, wracking, tortured sobs. She immediately sat by my side, gently putting her arm around my shoulders. \"Kiera, what\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn-between sobs, I managed to choke out, \"I made a horrible mistake...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stroked my hair and pulled me tight. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, I didn\u0027t just want to tell her about taking the car...I wanted to tell her everything. I choked up, how could I tell her? She would hate me, she wouldn\u0027t understand...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked over at me. \"You can tell me, Kiera. I won\u0027t say anything to Denny, if you don\u0027t want him to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sobs eased as I blinked at her in surprise, did she already know? It came out before I could stop it, \"I slept with Kellan.\" I held my breath, shocked at myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I was afraid of that.\" She hugged me with both arms. \"It will be okay. Tell me what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so shocked, I could only ask, \"You knew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned back against the wall, putting her hand on her lap. \"I suspected.\" She stared at her hand quietly for a second, twirling a ring on her finger. \"I\u0027ve seen things, Kiera. Looks you would give him, when you thought no one was watching. Smiles he would give you. I\u0027ve seen him touch you in discreet ways, like he didn\u0027t want anyone to notice. I\u0027ve seen your face when he sings. Your reaction to him at his party... I\u0027ve wondered for awhile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes. She really had seen way too much. Had anyone else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuietly she asked, \"When did it happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sobs started again and finally through my sobs, I opened up to her, and told her everything. It was such a relief to finally talk about it with someone. She listened in silence, occasionally nodding, smiling, or looking sympathetic. I told her about the first innocent touches. Our drunken first time while Denny was gone. His coldness afterwards. My panicked reaction to him almost leaving, which led to our second time. Our not-so-innocent flirtations. The club, although, I left out what I did to Denny, and what Kellan did with my sister - I just couldn\u0027t talk about that yet. The fight in the car, which made her gasp and say, \"He said what!\" My jealousy over his women...the last one that was still burning through my mind. His last hurtful comment...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny drew me tight to her, both arms around me. \"God, Kiera...I\u0027m so sorry. I knew he was like that with women. Maybe I should have warned you earlier? He\u0027s just that kind of guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sagged against her, tired from the emotional night, and she held me until my sniffles stopped. \"What are you going to do now?\" she asked quietly, pulling away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides kill him?\" I wasn\u0027t sure if I was joking or not. \"I don\u0027t know...what can I do? I love Denny. I don\u0027t want him to ever know, I don\u0027t want to hurt him. But Kellan...I can\u0027t stand the women, it kills me. I feel-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love Kellan?\" she asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure, Kiera? If you weren\u0027t angry, what would your answer be?\" I didn\u0027t answer her. I couldn\u0027t, I wasn\u0027t sure. Sometimes I felt...something for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout warning, the bathroom door swung open. Kate stood in the doorway, looking down at us on the floor. \"Oh, hey...there you are. It\u0027s getting crazy out there. Are you guys coming back...please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny piped up. \"Yeah, we\u0027re coming. Just give us another couple minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate gave me a sympathetic look, as a few tears escaped my eyes and I hurriedly wiped them away. \"Oh, okay...no problem.\" She smiled sweetly at me, then left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Jenny.\" I looked over at her, grateful for her listening to me without judging me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore tears dropped on my cheeks and she wiped them away. \"It will be okay, Kiera. Have faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pretty quiet for the rest of my shift, and absorbed myself in helping to solve my customer\u0027s simple problems. That helped. By closing time, I at least no longer felt like sobbing. I also didn\u0027t feel like going home. I didn\u0027t know if Kellan had had enough...dating, for one day. Who knows, maybe he ran out of milk and went to the store, only to pick up another hussy there. I was pretty sure that for people who looked like him, those kinds of things were stocked items, tucked right in-between the deli meats and the day old bread rack. Yes, I\u0027ll take a pound of ham, and the busty brunette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and approached the bar, where Kate and Jenny were talking to Rita. Pete had ducked out early. He usually was the very last one to leave, probably hours after the rest of us, but tonight, he\u0027d grabbed his coat right at closing and told Rita to lock up. She was taking advantage of his absence by pouring drinks for us girls. She sat a shot of something dark in front of me as I came over to stand beside Jenny. I sighed again. At least it wasn\u0027t tequila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay ladies,\" she said holding her glass high, \"one for the road.\" We all raised ours, clinking them together and then downed them quickly. Kate and Jenny giggled as I made a horrid face. Whatever it had been, burned. Rita made no face at all and began pouring us all another. \"Okay, one more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate and Jenny made a face at each other, but let her pour one more. I didn\u0027t care, I wasn\u0027t driving, and it had been one heck of a long day. I glanced over at Jenny who smiled reassuringly, her pale blue eyes sparkling warmly at me. She truly was the nicest person. She offered me a ride home every night, and even though I felt bad about accepting, she wouldn\u0027t take no for an answer if I had no one else to take me. She insisted that she drove past my street anyway, so it really was no big deal. That made me feel a little better about the whole thing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thoughtless-thoughtless-1/page-54.html","bookId":1887,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:26 PM"}
