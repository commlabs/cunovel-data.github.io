She thought over the matter long and earnestly. She was standing in the magnificent drawing-room one morning, when Arthur Hollis entered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How does it happen that you are not out for a canter on horseback with our host and Captain Drury?\" she asked. \"This is such a delightful morning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, Miss Deane,\" he replied, laughingly, showing a handsome set of white teeth, \"I was just bemoaning that fact. But I had some important letters to write, and I was obliged to remain in my room and finish them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At that moment they saw their young hostess crossing the lawn. Vivian saw Arthur Hollis look after her with a long, steady, earnest gaze, until she was quite out of their sight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [160]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you admiring our young hostess?\" she asked, suddenly, with something like a frown on her face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" he answered, frankly. \"I was just thinking that Mrs. Mallard has the sweetest face and most charming manner of any woman I ever met.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you admire her style of beauty?\" said Vivian, a little piqued.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, very much,\" said Arthur Hollis. \"If I had met her before she married our friend Eugene, I think I should have fallen in love with her myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The words were innocent enough; but Arthur Hollis never for a moment dreamed of the terrible mischief they were to do in the after years.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Those words so simply uttered sent a thrill through the heart of the girl who listened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, I have it!\" she said to herself. \"A way is opened to me at last to part Eugene Mallard and his wife. I will encourage Arthur Hollis\u0027s admiration for the beautiful Ida. Men are easily flattered. There is no knowing what the end will be.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a plot worthy of a fiend incarnate; but this girl, who loved Eugene Mallard, would stop at nothing to gain her end.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1691/49809.html","bookId":1156,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM"}
