You love him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too soon. I’m too young.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re twenty-four. That’s the perfect age.” Determination straightened my mother’s spine. For once, that didn’t bother me, because it restored some of her spirit. “I’m not going to let you ruin this, Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Her eyes took on a calculating gleam. “Trust me and slow down. I’ll handle this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. That wasn’t at all reassuring when she was on Gideon’s side of the marriage argument and not mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI WAS STILL thinking about my mom when I left the Crossfire at five o’clock. The Bentley waited at the curb and as I walked up to it, Angus climbed out and smiled at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good evening, Eva.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi.” I smiled back. “How are you, Angus?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent.” He rounded the rear of the car and opened the back door for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched his face. How much did he know about Nathan and Gideon? Did he know as much as Clancy? Or even more than that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipping into the cool backseat, I pulled out my smartphone and called Cary. It went to voice mail, so I left a message. “Hey, just reminding you that I’ll be gone this weekend. Would you do me a favor and think about moving into a place we share with Gideon, and we can talk about it when I get back? Someplace new, that we can all afford. Not that he has to worry about that,” I added, imagining Cary’s expression. “Okay. If you need me and you can’t reach me on my cell, send me an e-mail. Love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d just hit the end button when the door opened and Gideon joined me. “Hi, ace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught me by the back of the neck and kissed me, his mouth sealing over mine. His tongue licked into my mouth, tasting me, making my thoughts grind to a halt. I was breathless when he let me go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, angel,” he said roughly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth curved. “How was lunch with your mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That good, huh?” He caught my hand. “Tell me about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. It was weird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus got in the driver’s seat and pulled into traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Weird?” Gideon prompted. “Or uncomfortable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Both.” I looked out the tinted window as we slowed due to traffic. The sidewalks were clogged with people, but they were moving briskly. It was the cars that were stuck. “She’s so focused on money. That’s nothing new, but I’m used to her acting like it’s just common sense to want financial security. Today, she seemed … sad. Resigned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thumb stroked soothingly over my knuckles. “Maybe she’s feeling guilty for cheating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She should! But I don’t think that’s it. I think it’s something else, but I don’t have a clue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want me to look into it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head to meet his gaze. I didn’t answer right away, thinking it over. “I do, yes. But I feel icky about it, too. I researched you, Dr. Lucas, Corinne … I keep digging for people’s secrets instead of just asking about them outright.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So ask her,” he said, in that matter-of-fact male way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did. She said she’d talk about it when I wasn’t upset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Women,” he scoffed, with warm amusement in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did Giroux want? Did you know he was coming by?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “He wants someone to blame for his marriage troubles. I’m convenient.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why doesn’t he stop blaming and start fixing? They need to go into counseling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or get a divorce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened. “Is that what you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I want is you,” he purred, releasing my hand to grab me instead and pull me onto his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fiend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea. I have diabolical plans for you this weekend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heated look he raked me with had my thoughts shifting in a much naughtier direction. I was pulling his head down for a kiss when the Bentley turned, and it was suddenly dark. Looking around, I realized we’d pulled into a parking garage. We drove around two levels, pulled into a spot, then immediately pulled out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with four other black Bentley SUVs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” I asked, as we headed back toward the exit with two Bentleys in front of us and two behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shell game,” he said, nuzzling my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled back out into traffic, heading in different directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we being followed?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just being cautious.” His teeth sank gently into my flesh, making my nipples hard. Supporting my back with one arm, he brushed the side of my breast with his thumb. “This weekend is ours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d taken my mouth in a lush, deep kiss when we pulled into another parking garage. We slid into a spot and the door was yanked open. I was trying to figure out what was going on, when Gideon swung his legs to the side and slipped out of the Bentley with me held firmly in his arms, only to immediately step into the back of another car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were on the road again in less than a minute, with the Bentley pulling out into traffic in front of us and heading in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is insane,” I said. “I thought we were leaving the country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are. Trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were soft on my face. “I know you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t have any more stops on the way to the airport. We pulled right onto the tarmac after a brief security check, and I preceded Gideon up the short flight of steps into one of his private jets. The cabin was luxurious yet understated in its elegance, with sofa seating on the right and table and chairs on the left. The flight attendant was a handsome young guy with black dress slacks and vest embroidered with the Cross Industries logo and his name, Eric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good evening, Mr. Cross. Miss Tramell,” Eric greeted us with a smile. “Would you like something to drink as we prepare for takeoff?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cranberry and Kingsman for me,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The same,” Gideon replied, shrugging out of his jacket and handing it over to Eric, who waited while Gideon stripped off his vest and tie, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched appreciatively, throwing in a whistle for good measure. “I’m liking this trip already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angel.” He shook his head, his eyes laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gentleman in a navy suit entered the plane. He greeted Gideon warmly, shook my hand when introduced, then requested our passports. He was gone as quickly as he’d come, and the cabin door was closed. Gideon and I were buckled in at the table with our drinks when the plane started taxiing down the runway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to tell me where we’re headed?” I asked, lifting my drink in a toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clinked his crystal tumbler against mine. “Don’t you want it to be a surprise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Depends on how long it takes to get there. I might go crazy with curiosity before we land.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I expect you’ll be too busy to think about it.” His mouth curved. “This is a mode of transportation, after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” I glanced back, seeing the little hallway of doors at the back of the plane. One would be a lavatory, one an office, and the other a bedroom. Expectation coursed through me. “How much time have we got to kill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hours,” he purred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy toes curled. “Oh, ace. The things I’m going to do to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. “You’re forgetting this is my weekend to have you any way I want. That was the deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On our trip? That doesn’t seem fair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said that before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was true then, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile widened and he took a drink. “As soon as the captain gives the go-ahead to get up, I want you to head into the bedroom and get naked. Then lie on the bed and wait for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of my brows arched. “You love the idea of having me rolling around naked waiting for you to fuck me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do, yes. I recall the reverse being a fantasy of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm.” I took a drink, relishing the way the vodka went down icy and smooth, then heated in my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane leveled out and the captain made a brief announcement freeing us to move about the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon shot me a look that said, Well? Run along now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNarrowing my gaze at him, I got up, taking my drink with me. I took my time, provoking him. And making myself more excited. I loved being at his mercy. As much as I loved making him lose his mind over me, I couldn’t deny that his control was a major turn-on. I knew how absolute that control could be, which made it possible for me to trust him completely. I didn’t think there was anything I wouldn’t allow him to do to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was a conviction that would be tested sooner rather than later, I realized when I entered the sleeping cabin and saw the red silk-and-suede restraints lying so prettily on the white comforter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning my head, I looked at Gideon only to find him gone. His empty glass sat on the table, the square cubes of ice glittering like diamonds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart thudded. I stepped into the room, tossing back the rest of my drink. I couldn’t bear to be restrained during sex, unless it was by Gideon. By his hands or the weight of his muscled body. We’d never gone beyond that. I wasn’t sure I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set my empty tumbler on the nightstand, my hand shaking slightly. I didn’t know if that was due to fear or excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Gideon would never hurt me. He worked so hard to make sure I was never afraid. But what if I disappointed him? What if I couldn’t give him what he needed? He’d mentioned bondage before and I knew one of his fantasies was to have me completely restrained and open to him, my body spread and helpless for him to use. I understood that desire, the need to feel total and utter possession. I felt that way toward him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/entwined-with-you-crossfire-3/page-46.html","bookId":1924,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM"}
