I was on the seventh floor and had a great shot of what the students here called Middle Earth, a beautiful central park located within the campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the problems I was running into were that many of the girls could have been A. Peterson. Hell, most of them were cute with dark hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" said a voice behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away from the window. I saw that the class across the hall had just let out, and I had already missed a few faces. Damn. But standing in front of me was clearly A. Peterson. Cute face, cute button nose. But the cuteness ended there. Everything else about the girl was anything but cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Peterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, frowning. \"Are you the private investigator that came to see my mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked haunted. No. She was haunted. Her pale eyes were empty, troubled and suspicious. A heavy backpack weighed her down, and she was hunched forward to support some of the weight. Her arms were crossed in front of her, her hands holding her bony shoulders. Her hair was dyed pitch black, skin pale and milky. She had a nose, tongue and brow ring. Had she decided to wear make-up, she would have been able to cover the dark rings around her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom described you. She called me last night. Said a tall muscular man with a full head of blond hair and a tattoo of a black horse on his forearm had come to see her about Amanda.\" Her voice was soft and wispy. I strained to listen to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I fit the description?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at my crossed arms. The black horse, shooting steam from its nostrils, was clear on my left forearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus,\" she said, \"You\u0027re packing heat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed to the bulge under my left armpit. I was leaning against the wall in such a way that the bulge was evident to those who knew where to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would make a hell of an investigator,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Investigative journalism is my major.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t think of a more fitting job,\" I said. \"What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annette,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you found my classroom, so you\u0027re not so bad yourself.\" She might have grinned, but she had probably forgotten how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Glad I have your vote of confidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume you\u0027re here to talk with me about my sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"That and more. Is there somewhere we can have privacy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e32.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were in Middle Earth, surrounded by oaks and pines and a lot of rolling green hills. Students with laptops were banging away under trees nearby. Other students were soaking in the sun, and too few were making out. There was one couple, however, going at it like minks. Good for them. College at its best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were sitting on the grass. My back was up against the trunk of a gnarled ash tree, and Annette was leaning against her massive backpack which was filled to overflowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a senior?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you live at home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head vehemently. \"I needed to get away. Far away. But I couldn\u0027t leave mother and my sisters. So I compromised with my mother. I live in a dorm here at UCI, and my sisters and mother can come visit me anytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Your father is abusive.\" It wasn\u0027t a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where my mom called me from last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a sinking feeling. \"The hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"You are good. Two broken ribs and a broken nose. Said she fell down the stairs. We don\u0027t have fucking stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit is right. The man is a goddamn animal and I have hated him my entire life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He abuse you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sexually?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not me. I wouldn\u0027t let him. I fought him. So he settled on beating the shit out of me. Broke my arm twice. In the same fucking place. Loves to grab it and shake until something snaps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were your sisters sexually abused?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, and I\u0027m pretty sure little Alyssa is getting the worst of it now, especially now that she\u0027s alone with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has your mother ever tried to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He tells her he will kill her and her daughters. Classic shit. She\u0027s terrified of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has anyone ever gone to the police? Have any teachers ever noticed the bruises, questioned your broken arms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The answer is no. Father is an assemblyman for the county. He can have anyone\u0027s job. He knows it and they know it. Our plight has been ignored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plight,\" I said, grinning at her. \"You must be a writer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someday soon I hope to even make money at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like your father to stop the abuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Stupid fucking question.\" She leaned forward, hands flat in the grass. Not surprisingly, her nails were unpainted. \"Are you going to stop him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"I could give a shit if he\u0027s an assemblyman. I work for myself. I could make most men on this earth bend to my will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe actually laughed and clapped, and that pretty much made my day. She said, \"That\u0027s such a funny way to describe that you are going to royally kick his ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Royally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a big guy,\" she said. \"But you\u0027re bigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m bigger than most. And if I happen to break his arm in the process?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze hardened. \"Tell him it was from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Frisbee landed next to us. I flicked it back to an embarrassed young lady. She caught it neatly with one hand and dashed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more thing,\" I said. \"Do you know why Amanda quit her school band?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the band director was a creep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He made a pass at her,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did she do about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Told him to leave her alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume he didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then she quit?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she often confide in you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away. \"Yeah, we were close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her one of my cards, and she looked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice picture, Mr. Knighthorse,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e33.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was early morning and the crowd in McDonald\u0027s consisted mostly of old men in tan shorts, white tee shirts and running shoes. Most didn\u0027t look like they did much running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was eating a Big Breakfast with Jack at the back of the restaurant. He was sipping his lukewarm black coffee and looking very ungodlike in his bum outfit. Then again, according to him, this is how I expected him to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who\u0027s running the universe if you\u0027re down here with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can be in many places.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Convenient,\" I said. \"Must make waiting in line for Zeppelin tickets a breeze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And makes doing chores a snap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that a joke?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God jokes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do you think invented humor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The devil?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no devil, you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that because you told me there\u0027s no devil. I\u0027m still not convinced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in front of me shrugged and sipped his coffee. I\u0027ve noticed that Jack often didn\u0027t care if I believed him or not. I found that interesting and a little disconcerting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prove to me you\u0027re God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prove I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touche,\" I said. \"What\u0027s the square root of one million?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"But I will later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then ask me later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said. \"Perform a miracle.

Turn it into ice cold beer and let me drink it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like an alcoholic, Jim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drinking is not good for your body.

You would ask for another miracle, and then another. Always doubting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to perform a miracle, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. That is, not in the way that you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you perform other miracles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every day.
