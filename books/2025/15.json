There\u0027s no reason not to go through with it. Besides, the invitations are already sent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . . the . . . you . . . I . . . insane!\" I spluttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve already bought my present,\" she reminded me. \"You don\u0027t have to do anything but show up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made an effort to calm myself. \"With everything that is going on right now, a party is hardly appropriate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Graduation is what\u0027s going on right now, and a party is so appropriate it\u0027s almost pass��.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, and tried to be serious. \"There are a few things we need to get in order now, and that\u0027s going to take a little time. As long as we\u0027re sitting here waiting, we might as well commemorate the good stuff. You\u0027re only going to graduate from high school - for the first time - once. You don\u0027t get to be human again, Bella. This is a once-in-a-lifetime shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward, silent through our little argument, flashed her a warning look. She stuck out her tongue at him. She was right - her soft voice would never carry over the babble of the cafeteria. And no one would understand the meaning behind her words in any case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What few things do we need to get in order?\" I asked, refusing to be sidetracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward answered in a low voice. \"Jasper thinks we could use some help. Tanya\u0027s family isn\u0027t the only choice we have. Carlisle\u0027s trying to track down a few old friends, and Jasper is looking up Peter and Charlotte. He\u0027s considering talking to Maria . . . but no one really wants to involve the southerners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice shuddered delicately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It shouldn\u0027t be too hard to convince them to help,\" he continued. \"Nobody wants a visit from Italy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But these friends - they\u0027re not going to be . . . vegetarians, right?\" I protested, using the Cullens\u0027 tongue-in-cheek nickname for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Edward answered, suddenly expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here? In Forks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re friends,\" Alice reassured me. \"Everything\u0027s going to be fine. Don\u0027t worry. And then, Jasper has to teach us a few courses on newborn elimination. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s eyes brightened at that, and a brief smile flashed across his face. My stomach suddenly felt like it was full of sharp little splinters of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you going?\" I asked in a hollow voice. I couldn\u0027t stand this - the idea that someone might not come back. What if it was Emmett, so brave and thoughtless that he was never the least bit cautious? Or Esme, so sweet and motherly that I couldn\u0027t even imagine her in a fight? Or Alice, so tiny, so fragile-looking? Or . . . but I couldn\u0027t even think the name, consider the possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A week,\" Edward said casually. \"That ought to give us enough time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe icy splinters twisted uncomfortably in my stomach. I was suddenly nauseated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look kind of green, Bella,\" Alice commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward put his arm around me and pulled me tightly against his side. \"It\u0027s going to be fine, Bella. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, I thought to myself. Trust him. He wasn\u0027t the one who was going to have to sit behind and wonder whether or not the core of his existence was going to come home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it occurred to me. Maybe I didn\u0027t need to sit behind. A week was more than enough time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re looking for help,\" I said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Alice\u0027s head cocked to the side as she processed the change in my tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked only at her as I answered. My voice was just slightly louder than a whisper. \"I could help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s body was suddenly rigid, his arm too tight around me. He exhaled, and the sound was a hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Alice, still calm, who answered. \"That really wouldn\u0027t be helpful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" I argued; I could hear the desperation in my voice. \"Eight is better than seven. There\u0027s more than enough time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not enough time to make you helpful, Bella,\" she disagreed coolly. \"Do you remember how Jasper described the young ones? You\u0027d be no good in a fight. You wouldn\u0027t be able to control your instincts, and that would make you an easy target. And then Edward would get hurt trying to protect you.\" She folded her arms across her chest, pleased with her unassailable logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I knew she was right, when she put it like that. I slumped in my seat, my sudden hope defeated. Beside me, Edward relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whispered the reminder in my ear. \"Not because you\u0027re afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Alice said, and a blank look crossed her face. Then her expression became surly. \"I hate last- minute cancellations. So that puts the party attendance list down to sixty-five. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sixty-five!\" My eyes bulged again. I didn\u0027t have that many friends. Did I even know that many people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who canceled?\" Edward wondered, ignoring me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ren��e.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was going to surprise you for your graduation, but something went wrong. You\u0027ll have a message when you get home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I just let myself enjoy the relief. Whatever it was that went wrong for my mother, I was eternally grateful to it. If she had come to Forks now . . . I didn\u0027t want to think about it. My head would explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe message light was flashing when I got home. My feeling of relief flared again as I listened to my mother describe Phil\u0027s accident on the ball field - while demonstrating a slide, he\u0027d tangled up with the catcher and broken his thigh bone; he was entirely dependent on her, and there was no way she could leave him. My mom was still apologizing when the message cut off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s one,\" I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One what?\" Edward asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One person I don\u0027t have to worry about getting killed this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why won\u0027t you and Alice take this seriously?\" I demanded. \"This is serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Confidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful,\" I grumbled. I picked up the phone and dialed Ren��e\u0027s number. I knew it would be a long conversation, but I also knew that I wouldn\u0027t have to contribute much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just listened, and reassured her every time I could get a word in: I wasn\u0027t disappointed, I wasn\u0027t mad, I wasn\u0027t hurt. She should concentrate on helping Phil get better. I passed on my \"get well soon\" to Phil, and promised to call her with every single detail from Forks High\u0027s generic graduation. Finally, I had to use my desperate need to study for finals to get off the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s patience was endless. He waited politely through the whole conversation, just playing with my hair and smiling whenever I looked up. It was probably superficial to notice such things while I had so many more important things to think about, but his smile still knocked the breath out of me. He was so beautiful that it made it hard sometimes to think about anything else, hard to concentrate on Phil\u0027s troubles or Ren��e\u0027s apologies or hostile vampire armies. I was only human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I hung up, I stretched onto my tiptoes to kiss him. He put his hands around my waist and lifted me onto the kitchen counter, so I wouldn\u0027t have to reach as far. That worked for me. I locked my arms around his neck and melted against his cold chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo soon, as usual, he pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my face slip into a pout. He laughed at my expression as he extricated himself from my arms and legs. He leaned against the counter next to me and put one arm lightly around my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you think that I have some kind of perfect, unyielding self-control, but that\u0027s not actually the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish,\" I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he sighed, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After school tomorrow,\" he said, changing the subject, \"I\u0027m going hunting with Carlisle, Esme, and Rosalie. Just for a few hours - we\u0027ll stay close. Alice, Jasper, and Emmett should be able to keep you safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh,\" I grumbled. Tomorrow was the first day of finals, and it was only a half-day. I had Calculus and History - the only two challenges in my line-up - so I\u0027d have almost the whole day without him, and nothing to do but worry. \"I hate being babysat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s temporary,\" he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jasper will be bored. Emmett will make fun of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll be on their best behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" I grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it occurred to me that I did have one option besides babysitters. \"You know . . . I haven\u0027t been to La Push since the bonfire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched his face carefully for any change in expression. His eyes tightened the tiniest bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be safe enough there,\" I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about it for a few seconds. \"You\u0027re probably right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was calm, but just a little too smooth. I almost asked if he\u0027d rather I stayed here, but then I thought of the ribbing Emmett would no doubt dish out, and I changed the subject. \"Are you thirsty already?\" I asked, reaching up to stroke the light shadow beneath his eye. His irises were still a deep gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\" He seemed reluctant to answer, and that surprised me. I waited for an explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want to be as strong as possible,\" he explained, still reluctant. \"We\u0027ll probably hunt again on the way, looking for big game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That makes you stronger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe searched my face for something, but there was nothing to find but curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he finally said. \"Human blood makes us the strongest, though only fractionally. Jasper\u0027s been thinking about cheating - adverse as he is to the idea, he\u0027s nothing if not practical - but he won\u0027t suggest it. He knows what Carlisle will say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would that help?\" I asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. We aren\u0027t going to change who we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. If something helped even the odds . . . and then I shuddered, realizing I was willing to have a stranger die to protect him. I was horrified at myself, but not entirely able to deny it, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe changed the subject again. \"That\u0027s why they\u0027re so strong, of course. The newborns are full of human blood - their own blood, reacting to the change. It lingers in the tissues and strengthens them. Their bodies use it up slowly, like Jasper said, the strength starting to wane after about a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How strong will I be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Stronger than I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stronger than Emmett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grin got bigger. \"Yes. Do me a favor and challenge him to an arm-wrestling match. It would be a good experience for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. It sounded so ridiculous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I sighed and hopped down from the counter, because I really couldn\u0027t put it off any longer. I had to cram, and cram hard. Luckily I had Edward\u0027s help, and Edward was an excellent tutor - since he knew absolutely everything. I figured my biggest problem would be just focusing on the tests. If I didn\u0027t watch myself, I might end up writing my History essay on the vampire wars of the South.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a break to call Jacob, and Edward seemed just as comfortable as he had when I was on the phone with Ren��e. He played with my hair again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it was the middle of the afternoon, my call woke Jacob up, and he was grouchy at first. He cheered right up when I asked if I could visit the next day. The Quileute school was already out for the summer, so he told me to come over as early as I could. I was pleased to have an option besides being babysat. There was a tiny bit more dignity in spending the day with Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of that dignity was lost when Edward insisted again on delivering me to the border line like a child being exchanged by custodial guardians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how do you feel you did on your exams?\" Edward asked on the way, making small talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"History was easy, but I don\u0027t know about the Calculus. It seemed like it was making sense, so that probably means I failed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"I\u0027m sure you did fine. Or, if you\u0027re really worried, I could bribe Mr. Varner to give you an A.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, thanks, but no thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again, but suddenly stopped when we turned the last bend and saw the red car waiting. He frowned in concentration, and then, as he parked the car, he sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked, my hand on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Nothing.\" His eyes were narrowed as he stared through the windshield toward the other car. I\u0027d seen that look before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not listening to Jacob, are you?\" I accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not easy to ignore someone when he\u0027s shouting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I thought about that for a second. \"What\u0027s he shouting?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m absolutely certain he\u0027ll mention it himself,\" Edward said in a wry tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have pressed the issue, but then Jacob honked his horn - two quick impatient honks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impolite,\" Edward growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Jacob,\" I sighed, and I hurried out before Jacob did something to really set Edward\u0027s teeth on edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved to Edward before I got into the Rabbit and, from that distance, it looked like he was truly upset about the honking thing . . . or whatever Jacob was thinking about. But my eyes were weak and made mistakes all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted Edward to come to me. I wanted to make both of them get out of their cars and shake hands and be friends - be Edward and Jacob rather than vampire and werewolf. It was as if I had those two stubborn magnets in my hands again, and I was holding them together, trying to force nature to reverse herself. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, and climbed in Jacob\u0027s car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Bells.\" Jake\u0027s tone was cheerful, but his voice dragged. I examined his face as he started down the road, driving a little faster than I did, but slower than Edward, on his way back to La Push.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob looked different, maybe even sick. His eyelids drooped and his face was drawn. His shaggy hair stuck out in random directions; it was almost to his chin in some places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right, Jake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tired,\" he managed to get out before he was overcome by a massive yawn. When he finished, he asked, \"What do you want to do today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eyed him for a moment. \"Let\u0027s just hang out at your place for now,\" I suggested. He didn\u0027t look like he was up for much more than that. \"We can ride our bikes later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, sure,\" he said, yawning again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s house was vacant, and that felt strange. I realized I thought of Billy as a nearly permanent fixture there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over at the Clearwaters\u0027. He\u0027s been hanging out there a lot since Harry died. Sue gets lonely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob sat down on the old couch that was no bigger than a loveseat and squished himself to the side to make room for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. That\u0027s nice. Poor Sue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah . . . she\u0027s having some trouble. . . .\" He hesitated. \"With her kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, it\u0027s got to be hard on Seth and Leah, losing their dad. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" he agreed, lost in thought. He picked up the remote and flipped on the TV without seeming to think about it. He yawned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with you, Jake? You\u0027re like a zombie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got about two hours of sleep last night, and four the night before,\" he told me. He stretched his long arms slowly, and I could hear the joints crack as he flexed. He settled his left arm along the back of the sofa behind me, and slumped back to rest his head against the wall. \"I\u0027m exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why aren\u0027t you sleeping?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a face. \"Sam\u0027s being difficult. He doesn\u0027t trust your bloodsuckers. I\u0027ve been running double shifts for two weeks and nobody\u0027s touched me yet, but he still doesn\u0027t buy it. So I\u0027m on my own for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Double shifts? Is this because you\u0027re trying to watch out for me? Jake, that\u0027s wrong! You need to sleep. I\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no big deal.\" His eyes were abruptly more alert. \"Hey, did you ever find out who was in your room? Is there anything new?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored the second question. \"No, we didn\u0027t find anything out about my, um, visitor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll be around,\" he said as his eyes slid closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake . . . ,\" I started to whine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, it\u0027s the least I can do - I offered eternal servitude, remember. I\u0027m your slave for life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want a slave!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes didn\u0027t open. \"What do you want, Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want my friend Jacob - and I don\u0027t want him half-dead, hurting himself in some misguided attempt -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut me off. \"Look at it this way - I\u0027m hoping I can track down a vampire I\u0027m allowed to kill, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. He looked at me then, peeking at my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kidding, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, any special plans next week? You\u0027re graduating. Wow. That\u0027s big.\" His voice turned flat, and his face, already drawn, looked downright haggard as his eyes closed again - not in exhaustion this time, but in denial. I realized that graduation still had a horrible significance for him, though my intentions were now disrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No special plans,\" I said carefully, hoping he would hear the reassurance in my words without a more detailed explanation. I didn\u0027t want to get into it now. For one thing, he didn\u0027t look up for any difficult conversations. For another, I knew he would read too much into my qualms. \"Well, I do have to go to a graduation party. Mine.\" I made a disgusted sound. \"Alice loves parties, and she\u0027s invited the whole town to her place the night of. It\u0027s going to be horrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes opened as I spoke, and a relieved smile made his face look less worn. \"I didn\u0027t get an invitation. I\u0027m hurt,\" he teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Consider yourself invited. It\u0027s supposedly my party, so I should be able to ask who I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" he said sarcastically, his eyes slipping closed once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you would come,\" I said without any hope. \"It would be more fun. For me, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, sure,\" he mumbled. \"That would be very . . . wise . . .\" His voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few seconds later, he was snoring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Jacob. I studied his dreaming face, and liked what I saw. While he slept, every trace of defensiveness and bitterness disappeared and suddenly he was the boy who had been my very best friend before all the werewolf nonsense had gotten in the way. He looked so much younger. He looked like my Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nestled into the couch to wait out his nap, hoping he would sleep for a while and make up some of what he\u0027d lost. I flipped through channels, but there wasn\u0027t much on. I settled for a cooking show, knowing, as I watched, that I\u0027d never put that much effort into Charlie\u0027s dinner. Jacob continued to snore, getting louder. I turned up the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was strangely relaxed, almost sleepy, too. This house felt safer than my own, probably because no one had ever come looking for me here. I curled up on the sofa and thought about taking a nap myself. Maybe I would have, but Jacob\u0027s snoring was impossible to tune out. So, instead of sleeping, I let my mind wander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinals were done, and most of them had been a cakewalk. Calculus, the one exception, was behind me, pass or fail. My high school education was over. And I didn\u0027t really know how I felt about that. I couldn\u0027t look at it objectively, tied up as it was with my human life being over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered how long Edward planned to use this \"not because you\u0027re scared\" excuse. I was going to have to put my foot down sometime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were thinking practically, I knew it made more sense to ask Carlisle to change me the second I made it through the graduation line. Forks was becoming nearly as dangerous as a war zone. No, Forks was a war zone. Not to mention . . . it would be a good excuse to miss the graduation party. I smiled to myself as I thought of that most trivial of reasons for changing. Silly . . . yet still compelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Edward was right - I wasn\u0027t quite ready yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I didn\u0027t want to be practical. I wanted Edward to be the one. It wasn\u0027t a rational desire. I was sure that - about two seconds after someone actually bit me and the venom started burning through my veins - I really wouldn\u0027t care anymore who had done it. So it shouldn\u0027t make a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to define, even to myself, why it mattered. There was just something about him being the one to make the choice - to want to keep me enough that he wouldn\u0027t just allow me to be changed, he would act to keep me. It was childish, but I liked the idea that his lips would be the last good thing I would feel. Even more embarrassingly, something I would never say aloud, I wanted his venom to poison my system. It would make me belong to him in a tangible, quantifiable way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I knew he was going to stick to his marriage scheme like glue - because a delay was what he was clearly after and it was working so far. I tried to imagine telling my parents that I was getting married this summer. Telling Angela and Ben and Mike. I couldn\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t think of the words to say. It would be easier to tell them I was becoming a vampire. And I was sure that at least my mother - were I to tell her every detail of the truth - would be more strenuously opposed to me getting married than to me a becoming vampire. I grimaced to myself as I imagined her horrified expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, for just a second, I saw that same odd vision of Edward and me on a porch swing, wearing clothes from another kind of world. A world where it would surprise no one if I wore his ring on my finger. A simpler place, where love was defined in simpler ways. One plus one equals two. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob snorted and rolled to his side. His arm swung off the back of the couch and pinned me against his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly crow, but he was heavy! And hot. It was sweltering after just a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to slide out from under his arm without waking him, but I had to shove a little bit, and when his arm fell off me, his eyes snapped open. He jumped to his feet, looking around anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What?\" he asked, disoriented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just me, Jake. Sorry I woke you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look at me, blinking and confused. \"Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, sleepy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, man! Did I fall asleep? I\u0027m sorry! How long was I out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few Emerils. I lost count.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flopped back on the couch next to me. \"Wow. Sorry about that, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI patted his hair, trying to smooth the wild disarray. \"Don\u0027t feel bad. I\u0027m glad you got some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe yawned and stretched. \"I\u0027m useless these days. No wonder Billy\u0027s always gone. I\u0027m so boring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re fine,\" I assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh, let\u0027s go outside. I need to walk around or I\u0027ll pass out again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, go back to sleep. I\u0027m good. I\u0027ll call Edward to come pick me up.\" I patted my pockets as I spoke, and realized they were empty. \"Shoot, I\u0027ll have to borrow your phone. I think I must have left his in the car.\" I started to unfold myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Jacob insisted, grabbing my hand. \"No, stay. You hardly ever make it down. I can\u0027t believe I wasted all this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me off the couch as he spoke, and then led the way outside, ducking his head as he passed under the doorframe. It had gotten much cooler while Jacob slept; the air was unseasonably cold - there must be a storm on the way. It felt like February, not May.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wintry air seemed to make Jacob more alert. He paced back and forth in front of the house for a minute, dragging me along with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m an idiot,\" he muttered to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, Jake? So you fell asleep.\" I shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to talk to you. I can\u0027t believe this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to me now,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob met my eyes for a second, and then looked away quickly toward the trees. It almost looked like he was blushing, but it was hard to tell with his dark skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly remembered what Edward had said when he dropped me off - that Jacob would tell me whatever he was shouting in his head. I started gnawing on my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Jacob said. \"I was planning to do this a little bit differently.\" He laughed, and it sounded like he was laughing at himself. \"Smoother,\" he added. \"I was going to work up to it, but\" - and he looked at the clouds, dimmer as the afternoon progressed - \"I\u0027m out of time to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again, nervous. We were still pacing slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath. \"I want to tell you something. And you already know it . . . but I think I should say it out loud anyway. Just so there\u0027s never any confusion on the subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI planted my feet, and he came to a stop. I took my hand away and folded my arms across my chest. I was suddenly sure that I didn\u0027t want to know what he was building up to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s eyebrows pulled down, throwing his deep-set eyes into shadow. They were pitch black as they bored into mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in love with you, Bella,\" Jacob said in a strong, sure voice. \"Bella, I love you. And I want you to pick me instead of him. I know you don\u0027t feel that way, but I need the truth out there so that you know your options. I wouldn\u0027t want a miscommunication to stand in our way.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-15.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
