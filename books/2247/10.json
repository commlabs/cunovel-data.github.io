I get hot and horny just thinking about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooner Cap realized he was being had. \"How about I smash you right in your smart-ass little mouth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster gulped. \"For the love of God, Wayne, let it go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks tensed. Here it came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelPrego pointed. \"Holy shit. What\u0027s that behind you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooner Cap said, \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to fall for-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelPrego didn\u0027t wait to see if he fell for it or not. He brought the uppercut fast, popped Sooner Cap on the point of his chin. The redneck\u0027s head snapped back. He stumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTattoo Man swung the pool cue at Jenks, but Jenks ducked. The cue struck Lancaster in the face, swept him off the barstool like he was made of tissue. Lancaster yelled, blood spraying from his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks stomped hard with his heel on top of Tattoo Man\u0027s left tennis shoe. His heel struck the foot hard. Jenks heard and felt the man\u0027s bone snap. Tattoo Man screamed. Jenks double-punched him in the kidneys, and Tattoo Man bent, grabbed himself. Jenks swung hard, and his knuckles smacked just over Tattoo Man\u0027s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTattoo Man fell over into a little heap, didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooner Cap had DelPrego in a headlock. Jenks picked up Tattoo Man\u0027s pool cue, swung hard, and broke the wood over Sooner Cap\u0027s back. He let go of DelPrego, who turned and threw a quick punch into the redneck\u0027s massive gut. Sooner Cap whuffed air and went to one knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough!\" the bartender barked. He held an aluminum baseball bat and banged it on the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooner Cap started to get up. He was breathing hard. \"You... fuckers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" Jenks grabbed Lancaster under one arm, started for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelPrego took Lancaster\u0027s other arm, burst out of the saloon and into the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe redneck\u0027s curses followed them. \"You little faggots. Come back here again and you\u0027re dead. You hear me? Dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three poets sat in a nearly deserted Wendy\u0027s. Jenks ate a double cheeseburger and a Biggie fries. DelPrego held a small Frosty to the side of his head where his ear had swollen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster sat with his head tilted back, crumpled and bloody napkins on the table in front of him. He\u0027d torn little strips of napkin and had jammed them into his nostrils to stanch the blood flow. Once in a while he\u0027d moan quietly and rub his temples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, boy, where\u0027d you learn to fight like that?\" Jenks asked DelPrego. \"You almost got your fucking self killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I watch a lot of Rockford Files reruns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TV. Shit, that figures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we qualify as tight now?\" Lancaster asked, his stuffed nose making him hard to understand, the words coming out \"Do be qualiby ad dight dow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks laughed. \"Almost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure we are,\" DelPrego said. \"We\u0027re a hell of a team. The brother, the white guy, and the faggot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and so did Jenks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLancaster groaned and very slowly lifted his middle finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeighteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan tried to roll over, but Ginny\u0027s slab of thigh held him in place. He didn\u0027t want to wake her. He lay still, staring at the ceiling, feeling empty and listless. The mad tumble with Ginny had been a good distraction after Annette had shrugged him off, but already Ginny\u0027s hot skin pressed against him in bed. Oppressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn\u0027t just Annette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time Morgan had been directionless. He\u0027d realized it while working with the old man, Fred Jones. It was the first time he\u0027d felt like a poet or a teacher in years. And he\u0027d realized it again talking to Annette Grayson, telling her how he\u0027d blown with the wind from one temporary job to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was Annie Walsh. The dreams were getting worse. In the most recent, he could hear her clawing under the ground. His dream self tried to dig her out, pale hands ripping at the hard winter ground, digging without a shovel, fingernails hurt and bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinny\u0027s breathing changed, and Morgan suspected she was awake. They both pretended to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter half an hour, Morgan figured something had to give. He opened his mouth, drew breath to speak, didn\u0027t know what to say, and shut it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Ginny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know if you were awake yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan still didn\u0027t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinny said, \"It\u0027s like we have a secret together. Don\u0027t you think that makes people close? It\u0027s kind of a prefabricated intimacy. And I need this once in a while, to be close and naked with somebody I can trust. Maybe a weird kind of trust but it\u0027s there, and I want you to feel it too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t seem like you do. I can\u0027t handle boys my age. If they sleep with a girl once, they either think they own her or they want to throw her out like an empty beer can. I like that you\u0027re older. I want us to be friends. I read your poetry book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one? A Shot of Bourbon for the Soul?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other one. The hat one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the Museum of Men\u0027s Hats. That was my first one. It wasn\u0027t very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it was pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you working on anything now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan squirmed, shifted away from her. \"Not right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Writer\u0027s block.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" It came out more harsh than he\u0027d meant. \"I just haven\u0027t decided on anything yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re stuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you know about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to be able to tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not anything for you to worry about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is part of it,\" Ginny said. \"I want us to tell each other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shrug. \"Got to tell somebody. Do you have anyone to talk to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a talker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah...\" He didn\u0027t know what he wanted to say. He\u0027d been closed up, closed off, didn\u0027t know how to say what was wrong. Maybe he didn\u0027t even know because he couldn\u0027t say it out loud. \"What if I try, really try my best, and nothing comes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d never said that out loud before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all get scared.\" She twirled his chest hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all she said. Morgan suddenly felt tired again. He moved closer to her, put his head on the pillow. He felt lighter. He drifted. Sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he awoke, Ginny was gone. Morgan didn\u0027t feel bad about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked around the cold house naked, looked into each room. He didn\u0027t know what he was looking for, but he felt he was looking for something. An invisible need drew him. He wandered to his desk, opened the bottom drawer. An old accordion folder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis poetry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfhearted attempts at least a year old. He winced at the pages. Old themes and strategies mixed and matched and rehashed. It was painful to read but he made himself. He wrapped up the folder, put his head in his hands, and closed his eyes. It was worse than he remembered. Even his grad students were showing brighter sparks of originality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head. Set his jaw. It was time. Too long he\u0027d galumphed along, stagnant. What was it Keats had written? Half in love with easeful death. That was Morgan all over. He\u0027d been walking around dead, and it had been easy, so Morgan let it go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe showered, dressed. He scooped up the poems quickly before he could change his mind. He jogged to his Buick, drove to campus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Albatross Hall he took the stairs up two at a time. On the fifth floor, he listened for the music. It wasn\u0027t there, but it didn\u0027t matter. He knew the way. He found Valentine\u0027s office, knocked once, barged inside. He was breathing hard, heart thumping into his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValentine sat on his couch, sipping a cup of tea. He arched his eyebrows at Morgan. There was a portable TV the size of a toaster on Valentine\u0027s lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are some of my poems.\" Morgan showed him the folder. \"I\u0027m-\" He shook his head, cleared his throat. \"I\u0027m having some problems with my writing, and you\u0027re the single greatest living poet I know. I need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Valentine said. \"Wheel of Fortune is on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean Whittaker sat at his desk, shuffled papers, made stern phone calls to department heads. He went about the machinery of being dean, the dogged determination of an academic administrator. He crossed T\u0027s, dotted i\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhittaker looked up. \"Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swung open, and Jay Morgan walked in. He flipped a two-fingered salute at the dean and sat in the chair across from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. You got my message,\" Whittaker said. \"I tried to find you in your office, but you\u0027re a hard man to track down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, I was consulting with a colleague.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dean searched Morgan\u0027s face. There was something different about the man. His head was up. He was smiling. There was an easy look in his eyes. The dean thought he might smell alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to talk to you about the Spring Reading. We usually have a few handpicked grad students read. I want you to make sure Sherman Ellis is one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan smiled big. \"Sure. Let\u0027s give him an NEA grant too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhittaker frowned, shot radioactive heat rays out of his eyes at Morgan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan gulped. \"You\u0027re serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhittaker raised an eyebrow. He\u0027d had nothing but complaints about this Ellis kid, and so he wasn\u0027t surprised at Morgan\u0027s lack of enthusiasm. He\u0027d had to be tough with a few of the faculty to keep them in line on the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it he\u0027s doing well in your workshop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\" Morgan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tough titty. Look, Morgan, we both know this is a public relations move. The university wants to show off their new African-American student. With or without you the administration wants Ellis. But if you don\u0027t want to be part of this, I completely understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan stood. \"I don\u0027t want to be part of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhittaker cleared his throat, the rough sound of a surgical saw cutting into bone. \"However...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan sat down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d hate to think you weren\u0027t a team player.\" The dean shook his head like he was disappointed with a puppy that had shit on the carpet. \"After all, when you go to your next job after this, you\u0027ll want to give me as a reference. They always check your last employer, and they always want to know if a professor is a team player.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan felt sweat behind his ears. He wiped his forehead, swallowed hard. \"I don\u0027t think you understand. Ellis read his last poem, and, well, he scared the crap out of everybody in the class. I mean, I just don\u0027t think it\u0027s the feel-good poetry you want for a public relations event.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s exactly what we want,\" Whittaker said. \"Tell Ellis to let it all hang out. Let him be ethnic as hell. We\u0027ll show the regents we can be as multicultural as anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s another consideration,\" the dean said. \"I\u0027m getting a little concerned about Professor Valentine. He might be close to retirement. That would mean an open position for a tenure track professor.\" The dean could see he had Morgan\u0027s interest. The classic carrot and stick ploy. A brand-new job or a ruined career. \"I\u0027m sure you know what a lot of trouble it is to put together a search committee and go through a hiring process. It would sure be easier on everyone if there was a poet right here under our nose who fit the bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan nodded slowly. \"I want to be a team player, Dr. Whittaker. I\u0027ll get ahold of Ellis. I\u0027ll make it happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhittaker sat back in his chair, an evil smile spread thin across his face. \"I knew we could count on you, Morgan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan felt excited and frightened and a little sick as he left the dean\u0027s office. Sherman Ellis. Why in the hell did they want this gangster rap craziness as part of their annual poetry reading?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Morgan wanted that job. God, how he wanted it. He tried not to think of Valentine. Hey, it was eat or be eaten. Morgan was tired of going from school to school. What if he couldn\u0027t get another position? He couldn\u0027t live on adjunct pay. Hell, he might actually have to resort to teaching high school. No, he wouldn\u0027t be able to stomach that. Teenagers scared the hell out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, he\u0027d find Ellis. Tell him he was going to read some goddamn poetry and that was it. Morgan would write the poems himself if he had to. All Sherman Ellis would have to do was stand up there and read them without alienating every white person in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks had set up the deal for early in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelPrego had been strangely eager. Lancaster didn\u0027t want anything to do with it, but Jenks had insisted over and over again that Lancaster would only be required to sit in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenks rode between Lancaster and DelPrego in DelPrego\u0027s fifteen-year-old pickup truck. The day was cold but clear, and they drove with the windows down, huddled close across the truck\u0027s bench seat. Jenks wore a heavy army surplus jacket, baggy, big pockets. He pulled his dark blue watch cap over his ears. Lancaster wore a long camel hair coat, slightly worn at the elbows. It had once been an expensive garment, but Lancaster confessed he\u0027d picked it up at a thrift store in Tulsa. DelPrego\u0027s denim jacket was too light for the weather, but the cold never seemed to bother him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey each sipped a large cup of convenience store coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you talked me into this,\" Lancaster said. \"A drug sale. This is nothing but a common drug sale. We\u0027re criminals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A thousand bucks to each of you just to ride along,\" Jenks said. \"This guy\u0027s a professional dealer. He don\u0027t get it from me, he just gets it from somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get all that cocaine?\" DelPrego asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a fluke. This is my one deal.\" Jenks held his coffee cup with both hands, felt the warmth. \"As soon as I get this money it\u0027s straight and narrow for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Lancaster said. \"Otherwise, count me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" DelPrego said. \"I\u0027m flat-ass broke. They cut off my phone. I need cash so bad I\u0027d sell coke to my grandmother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay then. One score and it\u0027s all done.\" Jenks pointed to the left. \"Down that dirt road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell you know where to go?\" DelPrego turned the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was out here yesterday to find the guy. He said come back today and he\u0027d have the cash. That\u0027s why I needed you guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how did you know the first time?\" DelPrego shot a glance at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep your ears open and you hear things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still don\u0027t like it,\" Lancaster said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can stop the truck and let you out,\" Jenks said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying I don\u0027t like it,\" Lancaster said. \"I\u0027m nervous that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Keep you on your toes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe land sloped up gently, and they saw the gray, weatherworn barn on a rise a half mile up. They drove toward it easy and slow. A little squat house a few dozen yards from the barn. One half-assed tornado would knock the place to kindling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t where drug dealers live in the movies,\" DelPrego said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pistol-poets/page-10.html","bookId":2247,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:02 PM"}
