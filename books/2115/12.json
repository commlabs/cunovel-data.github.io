I\u0027d kneecap anyone busting in on our reverse S \u0026amp;M moment too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at the single large shadow that swallowed the threshold before the one who cast it had even entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I saw who it was. Grizelle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" she demanded, her green eyes looking black in the meager lamplight. \"What. Are. You. Doing?\" she repeated, stalking toward the bed on its raised step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuicksilver danced in front of her, poised to leap for her long black throat five feet off the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll eviscerate your dog if you don\u0027t call him off,\" she threatened, lifting a formidably nailed hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quick! Back.\" I eyed Grizelle again. \"And you get out of here. This is a private sickroom. What. Are. You. Doing. Here?\" I parroted her with matching fury and venom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a long stride forward to brace one leg on the riser and peer at Ric in the bed. I leaned over him to block her view but she was tall enough to see what she wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" she said. \"It is you! You must stop your bizarre healing ritual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Why would I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For every scar you diminish on your lover my master lies flayed below, his back laced with bloody stripes that keep appearing out of nowhere. I knew you must have something to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned, I tried to piece the two bizarre scenes together. For every whip scar I kissed away, Snow received a fresh slash in the same position on his own albino back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruly creepy. Impossible notions ran through my mind involving Quicksilver\u0027s healing tongue and my accepting Snow\u0027s Brimstone Kiss and converting it into a Resurrection Kiss. Now maybe a Retribution Kiss had boomeranged on its dispenser?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must stop now!\" Grizelle shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, memories of my humiliating moments standing half-naked and defenseless in front of Snow burned hot in my chest and throat, an attack of emotional heartburn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes! My anger against Snow almost choked me. The bastard deserved to writhe under the lash. Better him than Ric. I\u0027d make that choice forever and ever, amen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the horror of what was happening on some floor above us hit me. No creature deserved to feel all at once what El Demonio had meted out to Ric over years of abuse. I pictured Snow\u0027s skin as white and firm as Michelangelo\u0027s David, reproduced at Caesars Palace. I shuddered to imagine the violation, pain, and wounds it had absorbed already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrizelle had backed off the riser toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The damage is mostly done,\" she said bitterly. \"You have caused my master trouble since you came to this city and now you have made him suffer beyond belief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood statue-still on the riser, glancing back at Ric. Only a few of the horrible scar ridges remained. Could I stop just short of completion without undoing all I\u0027d accomplished?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn\u0027t there a fairy tale? A girl\u0027s seven brothers had been bespelled into swans, so she spent years weaving shirts from punishing nettles to reclaim their proper form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers bled from the task but she didn\u0027t quite make the deadline. As she threw the nettle garments on her swan-brothers\u0027 backs, one shirt was missing an arm. One brother would wear a swan wing for an arm for all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moral? Leaving any small part of a magical task undone could have irreversible consequences. I couldn\u0027t leave Ric half-healed, still unconscious. He might never wake up but remain suspended between the pain of the past and the pleasure of the present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t risk it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I told Grizelle. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I can\u0027t stop now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrizelle stopped, turned, and stood even taller in her disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only a few strokes more.\" I sounded lame even to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My master\u0027s back is in bleeding shreds already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He raised a medieval dragon from its ashes. He must have some magic to overcome this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I can\u0027t stop now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Quicksilver circled stealthily around behind her, I watched Grizelle shape-shift so fast that in one blink she was her human self and the next she had stretched long and low into full Big Cat form, six hundred pounds and nine feet long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe roared, making the walls vibrate. The carnivore stink of hot tiger\u0027s breath alone almost drove me off my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer front fangs looked longer than scissor blades and her open maw as high as a human torso was wide. I\u0027d seen enough domestic cats chasing birds to realize she was hunched to attack. One bound would do for both me and Ric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clasped my hands together in front of me, not praying, but calling the silver familiar to war. Would a thing made of Snow\u0027s hair defend me now? Desert him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwin chains sped down my arms to my palms. Achilles was in the familiar\u0027s magical mix now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the most fully realized form of the silver familiar yet-a shining sword blade-in my conjoined hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Grizelle\u0027s enormous white-and-black-striped, furred body sprang into the air, Quicksilver attacked her rear flank and was lofted upward by his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind flashed options. First I should strike for a huge gorgeous green eye, then the throat if I missed that. If she still bounded over me I\u0027d have one last chance to rip out the belly. What a shame... for one of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI braced myself at the foot of the bed feeling her shadow fall over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that instant, the Big Cat\u0027s huge body twisted and flailed in the air, falling back to the carpeting and struggling there. It was as if an invisible leash had jerked her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe half-shifted into human form as she writhed on the floor, snarling between any words she could get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fool!\" She shook a rear leg and Quicksilver fell off, still watchful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw blood seeping onto the rug from her left hip, but she disregarded it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t call this off,\" she said in a human voice still too rough and tigerish to reassure me. \"Remember that. You will pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted back to tiger form, watching me with suspicious lowered head, then turned and stalked out, blood staining the white fur on her left flank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and sat on the end of the bed, lowering the sword that seemed glued to my hands. It softened into twin serpents and migrated up my forearms to become upper-arm bracelets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick sat down, tilted his head quizzically, and whimpered at the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my head over my shoulder. Ric slept on, the flat dunes of his back gleaming silver with scar tissue in the lamplight. I eyed the ugly ridges still remaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My job,\" I told Quicksilver. I doubted even his proven healing tongue could outdo mine after the Brimstone Kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe trotted away to stand guard outside the double doors Grizelle had broken. That dog never walked, just trotted or ran flat out. And after a tiger attack, he still had the stones to take up a position between it and me should Grizelle\u0027s tiger self desire any reruns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy relieved mind oddly at peace, I crawled back up on the bed to run a forefinger along one of the seven remaining welts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been going to tell Quicksilver, \"My job, my pleasure,\" but knowing every erased welt here would reappear as pain elsewhere made me lose my appetite for the pleasure part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made quick work of it, letting Ric\u0027s satisfied murmurs override the whimpers of my conscience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast, I brought my trembling lips to the bandage covering the wide and deep neck wound the vampires had made. Through the gauze mesh, I tasted blood, careful not to siphon any up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was one old scar Ric could never hide and didn\u0027t want to. It was also his oldest erotic zone. Having missed out on the forbidden thrill of high school hickies, my loving lips had made this site an \"instant on\" zone and didn\u0027t I feel guilty about that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf my Brimstone Kissed lips could \"cure\" this most vicious and lethal wound, the only remaining sign of Ric\u0027s being vampire bait...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA migraine headache from Hell assailed me with disturbingly mixed mental images and emotional sensations. I felt and saw my lips on Ric and Snow and then vampire lips on Ric in such fast succession that waves of love and hate, passion and compassion, sexual and blood lust made me shake as if being electrocuted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reaction\u0027s speed had jerked me away from Ric before he could be contaminated by more than a sleeping murmur of reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome places even healing intentions couldn\u0027t go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced again at the silver tracery of his back scars. He now bore a beautiful ghost tattoo and I was drained into a stupor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI curled up next to him and went to sleep. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-sunrise-delilah-street-3/page-12.html","bookId":2115,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:47 PM"}
