Su’s smile was extremely enchanting, and also extremely calm. However, Rochester wouldn’t develop the slightest emotional fluctuation because of this. At their level, their calculation ability already covered the changes to the entire environment, battles that should be won could definitely be won.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eAs soon as Rochester’s return question just left his mouth, he suddenly sensed that of the thirteen waves of energy that gathered over, there was one that was suddenly broken!

Power and long life, this was what allowed them to face everything calmly, their intelligence moreover covering the entire planet’s changes. Even if they encountered some type of inconceivable situation, their first choice would be to strengthen their calculation ability, see if there is anything they overlooked or couldn’t detect. Shock and doubt were actions that completely wasted stamina and energy. Even the slightest bit of waste was still waste.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“I’ve also bred some biological weapons.” Su said, explaining similarly, not a habit of ultra life forms.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“I’ve assigned a sufficient amount of biological weapons to every single node beast!” Rochester was already a bit hysterical, no longer able to tend to his appearance. It was because while he was speaking, the second node beast already died.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSu stared at Rochester’s original body that was turned into a brain, saying, “My biological weapon is… Stupa.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Impossible!” Rochester screamed out in alarm, this time, his voice truly carrying fear. “How could you have bred Stupas? That is something only the creator has a chance of accomplishing! However, you definitely aren’t ‘one’!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSu released a breath of air again, a hint of bewilderment flashing through the depths of his eyes. Rochester’s question was something not even he knew the answer to. Stupa wasn’t an ordinary biological weapon, but rather a true high level weapon, a giant weapon that aimed for complete suppression in a stellar war. Completely grown and evolved Stupas could exceed a thousand kilometers in size, capable of interstellar travel on their own. Its uses were similar to the Starship Valhalla, even though its combat strength was far inferior to the former, Valhalla was almost completely a singular existence, while Stupas could be reproduced almost limitlessly, as long as there were enough resources to do so.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThat Stupa that moved at low altitude, even though it was a young body that only begun to possess life, it wasn’t something a node beast could resist.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe brain frantically squirmed about, ruptures continuously appearing on the membrane, a clear sign of energy overload. Rochester was already staking it all, but Su’s defenses were still firm, clearly still able to hold on for some time. Meanwhile, as the node beasts died off one by one, Rochester’s energy supply also quickly depleted, his offensive output also weakening. Soon afterwards, he couldn’t maintain the other types of magic attacks, even the lightning attacks eventually dropping below Su’s critical point. Su’s defensive force field immediately stabilized, his defensive strength also slowly rising.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003e“Su! I curse you!” Rochester’s final scream resounded through space, filled with despair, unwillingness, and anger. Meanwhile, Su already broke through the energy shackles, rushing straight into the brain, quickly rushing towards the nucleus. Large amounts of intruder cells frantically spread, crazily devouring and converting the neurons in the brain, a large gray-black color expanding.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSu heard Rochester’s final curse, as well as his ‘I will return!’ declaration, but didn’t attach too much importance to it. It was extremely difficult for apostles to die, true apostles were existences similar to spiritual bodies, they could regenerate through many different methods. However, even if Rochester reawakened hundreds or thousands of years later, that was something to deal with later. Without several decades of time to peacefully grow or the resources of the entire continent, there was no way a newborn Rochester could face the current Su. At that time, what he needed to do was pray to not be discovered by Su.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eWith victory in sight, Su instead felt a faint sense of grief from the bottom of his heart. Rochester was indeed an apostle, moreover an apostle who perfectly preserved the consciousness of this world. From this point, Su also understood that he was like himself, both of them always fighting against their instincts, not letting their will of this world disappear. Meanwhile, for Rochester to die under his hands, it was the same as how Su died under Serendela’s hands. Even if he was reborn again, it as possible that only completely awakened instincts remained. For Su to perfectly retain his own will that time, he felt that it was inconceivable even now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eAnother inconceivable thing was the Stupa. High level biological weapons and mid level biological weapons were entirely different, their evolution and production having over a million years of difference. The power of the mid level biological weapons Su originally created wasn’t too great, much inferior to Rochester’s improved biological weapons. However, all of the biological weapons Su produced were from developed systems, he only extracted a few weapons from the giant system suitable for this planet’s environment, while Rochester’s biological weapons were clearly developed by himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHowever, the crux of the problem was still the Stupa. The Stupa was a high level weapon he shouldn’t have been able to research with his current level of understanding, not even Rochester able to research it. Only the one he spoke of, ‘one’, also the creator, sixth apostle, had a chance of creating such a terrifying biological weapon. However, Su wasn’t the creator, but rather directly obtained all of the Stupa’s information from the Bisindle divine language, moreover using this to create a young biological body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eEverything was just this simple, and also this natural. However, the excessive smoothness instead made Su feel a mysterious fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe brain began to quickly shrink, continuously cave in. The core region was continuously absorbed into Su’s body. There was a massive amount of data and information, to the extent where some of Rochester’s opinions and consciousness still remained. What Su noticed was that Rochester felt some type of deep fear from this place. This was a fear that was even deeper than on the genetic level. Even if Rochester revived, he would revive with this fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe problem was, what was this, for even an apostle to feel fear?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-37-12\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-38-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-37-13","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM"}
