He recently moved to Phoenix, and he’s probably busy getting settled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you give Noah his phone number and let him talk to him,” Theo suggested. “People tend to sit up and take notice when the FBI calls. And on my worst day I couldn’t be as abrasive as he can be. He’s better at coercion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, right.” Noah scoffed at the notion. Turning to Michelle, he said, “I’ve seen Theo make grown men cry. It was kind of funny actually . . . watching a coldhearted killer, who happens to be the head of a crime organization, blubber like a baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s exaggerating,” Theo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m not,” Noah argued. “However, it is true that the average person doesn’t know what the attorneys over in Justice do. Come to think about it, I’m not so sure I know. Besides making criminals cry, what exactly do you do, Theo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much,” he answered dryly. “We drink a lot . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a given.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And try to think of things for you guys to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll bet you do.” Turning to Michelle, Noah added, “Those lazy Justice attorneys make the dedicated FBI agents do all the hard work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo smiled. “It’s called delegating. We do it so the little people won’t feel left out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe insults began to fly, and some of the outrageous things they said were hilarious. Vastly amused, she sat back and relaxed. When the subject eventually returned to her clinic, she said, “I’m not going to worry about this any longer. I’ve been blowing this out of proportion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s that?” Noah asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was so spooked after I saw the mess, I thought I was being followed. You know that feeling you get? It’s hard to explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d pay attention to that feeling if I were you,” Noah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But no one was following me,” she insisted. “I would have spotted him . . . wouldn’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not if he’s good,” Noah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a very small community. Strangers would stick out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah? What about a man driving a van with maybe a cable company logo on the side? Would he stick out? And what about all the men and women who come here to fish? If they were dressed in fishing gear and carrying a pole, would you think they didn’t belong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichelle stood. “I see your point, and I appreciate your taking the time to look at the clinic, but I really believe this was just an isolated incident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that belief is based on what?” Theo asked. “Wishful thinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ignored his sarcasm. “This is Bowen,” she said. “If anyone had a problem with me, he’d tell me so. Now that I’ve had time to think about it, I didn’t start jumping at shadows until after I saw the clinic. I overreacted. I will remind you,” she hastened to add when he looked as though he was going to interrupt, “that nothing else has happened. You want to find a conspiracy, and there just isn’t one.” Turning to Noah, she said, “I do thank you for coming to Bowen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t need to thank me,” Noah said. “To be honest, I only did the favor to get a favor. Theo’s agreed to drive back to Biloxi with me. He’s going to give a lecture for me, and I would have driven cross country to get out of that. I still have to go finish the training session, but at least I don’t have to write a speech.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When do you have to be back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Monday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” She turned away before either of them could see her disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah watched her walk away. “Damn, Theo, she’s something else. If we were going to stay around for a while, I’d give you a run for your money. I’ve always been a sucker for redheads.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a sucker for anything that wears a skirt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not true. Remember the Donovan case? Patty Donovan always wore skirts, and that didn’t do anything for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo rolled his eyes. “Patty was a transvestite. He didn’t turn anyone on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He had good legs. I’ll give him that,” Noah drawled. “So tell me something. What’s happening with you and Michelle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing’s happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a shame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never told me the topic of the lecture I’m giving,” Theo said in hopes of getting Noah to change the subject. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah grinned. “Anger management.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo laughed. “Was this your boss’s idea of a joke?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure it was,” he said. “You know Morganstern. He’s got a twisted sense of humor. He’s making me run the training program to punish me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’d you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t want to know.” Noah paused and then said, “Morganstern could use a man like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, the hidden agenda comes out at last. Did Pete ask you to talk to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah shrugged. “He might have mentioned . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell him I’m not interested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He likes the way your mind works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not interested,” Theo reiterated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re happy where you are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo shook his head. “I’m done. All used up,” he said. “I’m going back to the office, tie up loose ends, and hand in my resignation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah was stunned. “You aren’t kidding, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m not kidding. It’s time . . . past time,” he corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what are you going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got a couple of ideas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does one of those ideas have red hair?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo didn’t answer. Before Noah could press, a man came over to the table and asked Theo if he could talk to him about a legal matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure,” Theo said. “Let’s sit at the bar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up, rolled his shoulders to work the kinks out, and then went behind the bar to pour himself a beer. “What can I do for you?” he asked the young man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later, Theo wanted to punch the man. Noah saw Theo’s expression and went behind the bar to find out what was wrong. He heard Theo say, “Jake didn’t suggest that you talk to me, did he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but I heard you were helping people who had legal troubles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the problem?” Noah asked. He opened a long-neck bottle of beer, tossed the cap in the trash, and walked over to stand next to Theo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Cory,” Theo said. “He’s got two kids. A boy and a girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah squinted at the unpleasant-looking man. He looked more like a grungy teenager than a father of two children. Cory had long dirty blond hair that hung down in his eyes, and yellow stained teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old are you?” Noah asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be twenty-two next month.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’ve already got two kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right. I got divorced from Emily over six months ago because I met another woman I wanted to be with. Her name’s Nora, and she and me want to get married. I’ve moved on, but Emily thinks I ought to keep paying child support, and that don’t seem fair to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you want me to help you figure out a way you can get out of paying child support?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, that’s right. That’s what I want. I mean, they’re her kids now. They’re living with her, and like I said, I’m ready to move on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscle in Theo’s jaw flexed. Michelle was standing in the kitchen doorway, holding an empty pitcher in her hand. She’d heard the conversation and knew from the way Theo’s back had stiffened that he was angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice continued to be quite mild and pleasant as he remarked to Noah, “Cory’s ready to move on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready for him to move on?” Noah asked as he set his beer bottle on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure am,” Theo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Noah smiled. “Let me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can get the door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichelle started forward, then stopped. Theo moved so quickly she was astonished. One second he was smiling at Noah and the next he was around the bar, had Cory by the nape of his neck and the back of his jeans, and was dragging him across the floor. Noah raced ahead and opened the door, then got out of the way so Theo could toss the man outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, that’s what I call moving on,” Noah drawled as he shut the door behind him. “The little prick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what I wonder? How could such a butt-ugly man get two women to sleep with him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo laughed. “No accounting for taste, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men were walking toward the bar when the door behind them opened again and three men rushed inside. The last of the three looked like a bouncer who’d taken one too many hits in the face. The man was huge, at least six foot four, and his nose obviously had been broken several times in the past. He was frighteningly mean looking and carried a baseball bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which one of you as**oles is Theo Buchanan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah had already turned. He had his eye on the baseball bat. Michelle saw him reach behind his back and unsnap the holster housing his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bar emptied. Even Paulie, who had never been known to do anything in a hurry, made it out the front door in less than five seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Michelle, go into the kitchen and shut the door,” Theo said before he turned around. “I’m Theo Buchanan. Now, which one of you is Jim Carson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’d be me,” the shortest of the three announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo nodded. “I’ve been hoping you’d stop by.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just who do you think you are?” Jim railed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just told you who I am. Weren’t you paying attention?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A real smartass, huh? You think you can lock up my money and fix it at my bank so I can’t even get a nickel out? You think you can do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did do that,” Theo calmly pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim Carson looked like his brother. He was short, squat, with eyes that were a little too closely set in his moon-shaped face. He didn’t smile like his brother, though. While Gary oozed false sincerity, Jim was the master of vulgarity. He took another threatening step toward Theo and let loose with a string of grossly obscene blasphemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said, “You’re going to be sorry you interfered in my business. Gary and I are going to shut down the mill, and then this town will lynch you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d worry about my neck if I were you. How long have you been telling your employees you’re on the verge of bankruptcy? Imagine how . . . disappointed people will be when they find out what your annual take is and what you have squirreled away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our assets are confidential information,” Jim yelled. “You might know about our money, but you’re an outsider trying to cause trouble, and if you tell anyone, they won’t believe you. No one will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People tend to believe what’s written in the paper, don’t they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you saying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wrote a nice little editorial that’s going to be in Sunday’s paper. Of course, I want it to be as accurate as possible,” he added. “So, why don’t I fax you over a copy of it tomorrow, and you can check it. Personally, I think it’s some of my best work. I listed every cent in every account that you’ve made over the past five years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t do that. It’s confidential.” Jim was shouting now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo glanced at Noah. “You know, I should have added their tax returns for the past five years too. I guess I still could.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re finished, Buchanan. I’m not going to let you cause any more trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim was so angry, his brow was dripping with sweat. The man had worked himself into a lather, and it was obviously infuriating to him that Theo was unimpressed with his tantrum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve only just started making trouble, Jim. When I’m finished with you and your brother, the employees are going to own the mill. It’s going to happen fast too,” he added. “And you will be living on the streets. That’s a promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to put that baseball bat down now?” Noah asked the giant with the nose splattered all over his homely face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit, no. I’m not putting this bat down before I use it. Isn’t that right, Mr. Carson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right, Happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo laughed. “Happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We live in a strange world,” Noah replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m supposed to break Buchanan’s legs with this bat, and that’s what I’m gonna do. I’m gonna hurt you too,” he told Noah. “So you better stop laughing at me, because you’re gonna be sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah was now keeping a wary eye on the third man. He was almost as tall as the giant, but had a thin, wiry frame and large cauliflower ears. Both backup men looked like street fighters, but in Noah’s opinion, Cauliflower was the real threat. He probably was carrying a concealed weapon. Oh, yes, he was the one who could give him real trouble, and he was apparently the surprise element Jimmy Boy had brought along in the event Happy didn’t get the job done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bruiser was slapping the butt of the baseball bat in the palm of his hand. The smacking noise irritated Noah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put the bat down,” he ordered once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not before I break a couple of bones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah suddenly smiled. He looked as if he’d just won the lottery. “Hey, Theo, you know what?” “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d call Happy’s remarks threats. Wouldn’t you say they were threats? I mean, you’d know, since you’re a lawyer in Justice, and I’m just a lowly little FBI agent. Those were threats. Right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo knew exactly what Noah’s game was. He was letting the three men know who they were so they couldn’t say they hadn’t been informed when they were locked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I’d have to say they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, smartass,” Jim said, addressing Noah, “you get in my way, and I’m going to enjoy hurting you too.” He stabbed the air in front of Noah’s face with his stubby finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah wasn’t paying him any attention. “Maybe we ought to let one of them hit us,” he suggested to Theo. “It would probably look better in court.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mercy-buchanan-renard-2/page-29.html","bookId":1834,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:46 PM"}
