However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Death Eaters, for sure,\" said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room windows. \"Reckon they know we\u0027re in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" said Hermione, though she looked frightened, \"or they\u0027d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"D\u0027you reckon he\u0027s been in here and has his tongue tied by Moody\u0027s curse?\" asked Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Hermione, \"otherwise he\u0027d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn\u0027t he? But they\u0027re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do they ¨C?\" began Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They\u0027ll know Sirius left you the place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. They had not heard a word form anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley\u0027s Patronus, and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket; This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you stop it!\" she cried on the third evening of Kreacher\u0027s absence, as all the light was sucked from the drawing room yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, sorry!\" said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. \"I don\u0027t know I\u0027m doing it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, can\u0027t you find something useful to occupy yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, like reading kids\u0027 stories?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumbledore left me this book, Ron ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" ¨C and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I\u0027m supposed to use it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody\u0027s voice asked, \"Severus Snape?\" Then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was not I who killed you, Albus,\" said a quiet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry pointed the wand into the middle of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t move!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream, \"Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold your fire, it\u0027s me, Remus!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, thank goodness,\" said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show yourself!\" he called back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the Marauder\u0027s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all right,\" said Harry, lowering his wand, \"but I had to check, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn\u0027t be so quick to lower your defenses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sign of Severus, then?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Harry. \"What\u0027s going on? Is everyone okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Lupin, \"but we\u0027re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can\u0027t know you\u0027re in here or I\u0027m sure they\u0027d have more people out there; they\u0027re staking out everywhere that\u0027s got any connection with you, Harry. Let\u0027s go downstairs, there\u0027s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,\" said Lupin. \"So, you came straight here after the wedding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Harry, \"only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a caf¨¦ on Tottenham Court Road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how did they find you so quickly? It\u0027s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it doesn\u0027t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wondered,\" said Hermione tentatively, \"whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible,\" said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. \"Apart from anything else, they\u0027d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn\u0027t they? But I can\u0027t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that\u0027s worrying, really worrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us what happened after we left, we haven\u0027t heard a thing since Ron\u0027s dad told us the family was safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Kingsley saved us,\" said Lupin. \"Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?\" interjected Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they\u0027re the same thing now,\" said Lupin. \"There were about a dozen of them, but they didn\u0027t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it\u0027s true, he didn\u0027t give you away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man\u0027s final act had been to try to protect Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,\" Lupin went on. \"They found the ghoul, but didn\u0027t want to get too close ¨C and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,\" he added quickly, forestalling the question, \"but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle\u0027s house, but as you know he wasn\u0027t there, and they used the Cruciarus Curse on Tonks\u0027s family. Again, trying to find out where you went after you visited them. They\u0027re all right ¨C shaken, obviously, but otherwise okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks\u0027s parents\u0027 garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you\u0027ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,\" said Lupin. \"They\u0027ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we\u0027d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they\u0027d come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry\u0027s whereabouts out of people?\" asked Hermione, an edge to her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Lupin said. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, \"you\u0027ll know sooner or later anyway. That\u0027s their pretext for going after you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read the headline over it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read anymore: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after Dumbledore had fallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Harry,\" Lupin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?\" asked Hermione furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But surely people realize what\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,\" said Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The official version of Scrimgeour\u0027s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?\" asked Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend his power beyond the Ministry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren\u0027t confide in each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,\" said Harry, \"involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s certainly a part of it,\" said Lupin, \"and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is dead, you ¨C the Boy Who Lived ¨C were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hat\u0027s death, Voldemort has not only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin pointed at the Daily Prophet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at page two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had when handling Secrets of the Darkest Art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Muggle-born Register!\" she read aloud. \"\u0027The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called \"Muggle-borns\" the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People won\u0027t let this happen,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is happening, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how are they supposed to have \u0027stolen\u0027 magic?\" said Ron. \"It\u0027s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn\u0027t be any Squibs, would there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" said Lupin. \"Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon glanced at Hermione, then said, \"What if purebloods and halfbloods swear a Muggle-born\u0027s part of their family? I\u0027ll tell everyone Hermione\u0027s my cousin ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione covered Ron\u0027s hand with hers and squeezed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Ron, but I couldn\u0027t let you ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t have a choice,\" said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. \"I\u0027ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione gave a shaky laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron, as we\u0027re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don\u0027t think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What\u0027s Voldemort planning for Hogwarts?\" she asked Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,\" he replied. \"That was announced yesterday. It\u0027s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it\u0027s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status ¨C meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent ¨C before they are allowed to attend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never see their families again either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s... it\u0027s...\" he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly, \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll understand if you can\u0027t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did,\" Harry replied, \"and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they\u0027re coming with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you confide in me what the mission is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t, Remus, I\u0027m sorry. If Dumbledore didn\u0027t tell you I don\u0027t think I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d say that,\" said Lupin, looking disappointed. \"But I might still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione, however, looked puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about Tonks?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about her?\" said Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Hermione, frowning, \"you\u0027re married!

There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents\u0027 house; she was, after all, a member of the Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remus,\" said Hermione tentatively, \"is everything all right... you know... between you and ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything is fine, thank you,\" said Lupin pointedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, \"Tonks is going to have a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, how wonderful!\" squealed Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent!\" said Ron enthusiastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, \"So... do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon and Hermione both looked at Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just ¨C just to be clear,\" he said. \"You want to leave Tonks at her parents\u0027 house and come away with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be perfectly safe there, they\u0027ll look after her,\" said Lupin.

Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione\u0027s eyes swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand,\" said Lupin at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Explain, then,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ¨C I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks.

I should never have married her, I\u0027ve made her an outcast!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore\u0027s protection at Hogwarts!

And the child ¨C the child ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My kind don\u0027t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it ¨C how can I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child?

Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,\" Harry said, \"what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father\u0027s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon he\u0027d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How ¨C how dare you?\" said Lupin. \"This is not about a desire for ¨C for danger or personal glory ¨C how dare you suggest such a ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re feeling a bit of a daredevil,\" Harry said, \"You fancy stepping into Sirius\u0027s shoes ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, no!\" Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin\u0027s livid face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d never have believed this,\" Harry said. \"The man who taught me to fight dementors ¨C a coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin\u0027s cloak disappearing around the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remus, Remus, come back!\" Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry!\" wailed Hermione. \"How could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was easy,\" said Harry. He stood up, he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look at me like that!\" he snapped at Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you start on her!\" snarled Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ¨C no ¨C we mustn\u0027t fight!\" said Hermione, launching herself between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have said that stuff to Lupin,\" Ron told Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had it coming to him,\" said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and his mother\u0027s voice, begging for mercy...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parents,\" said Harry, \"shouldn\u0027t leave their kids unless ¨C unless they\u0027ve got to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry ¨C \" said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin\u0027s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, communicating silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I shouldn\u0027t have called him a coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you shouldn\u0027t,\" said Ron at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s acting like one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the same...\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" said Harry. \"But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it\u0027ll be worth it, won\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and Hermione\u0027s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry\u0027s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his mind was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore\u0027s name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and Aberforth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore\u0027s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry thought of photos of Native Americans he\u0027d seen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus\u0027s nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby Ariana\u0027s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the headline:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby Rita Skeeter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her husband Percival\u0027s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric\u0027s Hollow, the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter\u0027s strange escape from You-Know-Who.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric\u0027s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband\u0027s crime she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade Cauldron Cakes,\" says Bathilda Bagshot. \"The first year they were there I only ever saw the two boys. Wouldn\u0027t have known there was a daughter if I hadn\u0027t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took her back inside. Didn\u0027t know what to make of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric\u0027s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter\u0027s existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana\u0027s existence could be counted upon to keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them. \"My sister is too frail for school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext week: Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts ¨C the Prizes and the Pretense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to go to Godric\u0027s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him: he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the newspaper, to ask Ron\u0027s and Hermione\u0027s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, \"Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Expelliarmus!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMundungus\u0027s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled him and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron\u0027s grip. \"Wha\u0027ve I done? Setting a bleedin\u0027 \u0027house-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha\u0027ve I done, lemme go, lemme go, of ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not in much of a position to make threats,\" said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus\u0027s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair was matted and his robes stained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,\" croaked the elf. \"Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the thief in the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve done really well, Kreacher,\" said Harry, and the elf bowed low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, we\u0027ve got a few questions for you,\" Harry told Mundungus, who shouted at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an\u0027 that was bleedin\u0027 You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there. I said all along I didn\u0027t wanna do it ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re a bunch of bleedin\u0027 \u0027eroes then, aren\u0027t you, but I never pretended I was up for killing meself ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,\" said Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus\u0027s baggy, bloodshot eyes. \"We already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, why the \u0027ell am I being \u0027unted down by \u0027ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets again?

Harry\u0027s wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundungus\u0027s nose that Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,\" Harry began, but Mundungus interrupted him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sirius never cared about any of the junk ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the sound of pattering fee, a blaze of shining copper, an echoing clang, and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call \u0027im off, call \u0027im off, \u0027e should be locked up!\" screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kreacher, no!\" shouted Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKreacher\u0027s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the honors,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you very much, Master,\" said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,\" Harry began again, \"you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.\" Harry\u0027s mouth was suddenly dry: He could sense Ron and Hermione\u0027s tension and excitement too. \"What did you do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" asked Mundungus. \"Is it valuable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve still got it!\" cried Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he hasn\u0027t,\" said Ron shrewdly. \"He\u0027s wondering whether he should have asked more money for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More?\" said Mundungus. \"That wouldn\u0027t have been effing difficult...bleedin\u0027 gave it away, di\u0027n\u0027 I?
