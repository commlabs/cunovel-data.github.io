It eats it straight from his palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch out,\" I warn. \"He could bite your hand off with those massive buck teeth of his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re harmless,\" he says. \"They won\u0027t bite you. Try it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the brown bag of food I\u0027ve just paid ten sheckels for. Ten sheckels for the risk of getting a huge buck alpaca tooth in your palm. No thank you very much. I walk up to a small baby alpaca and just pet it. Its fur is soft, but a bit wiry. And I laugh when she looks at me with her big gunmetal eyes and large underbite. My orthodontist, Dr. Robbins (otherwise known as Miracle Worker to his patients), could have a field day with this animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I can try and feed this one because it\u0027s small. And she looks at my brown bag the way I look when I see a good sushi restaurant. I reach in the bag and pull out some \u0027feed\u0027. The little bugger can\u0027t even wait for me to situate the stuff in my hand before she noses it with her face and scoops it all up with her choppers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, don\u0027t you have any manners?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alpaca starts chewing the food in a very unladylike manner; little pieces of food are falling out of her mouth with each chew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch out,\" Ofra says as she walks up behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" I step back several steps, away from the animal. \"Avi ...Avi told me they\u0027re harmless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are,\" Moron chimes in. \"But they spit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whad\u0027ya mean, \u0027they spit\u0027?\" I say, moving farther back away from the buck-toothed spitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Snotty says. \"It\u0027s more like a loud growling-like burp, then spit. At least they give you warning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if having the small alpaca after my brown bag wasn\u0027t enough, once they hear me close my bag the noise alerts about ten of the large ones and they come after me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not an animal person,\" I say as I run toward Avi. \"I\u0027m not an animal person,\" I chant repeatedly until I reach him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They love you,\" Avi says. \"Look, they\u0027re all following you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place the brown paper bag with the \u0027feed\u0027 (what exactly is inside this stuff to make it \u0027feed\u0027?) into his hand and hide behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fearless Avi takes the whole bag and dumps it into one of his palms. As he feeds the things, I hear what Snotty was talking about...this loud growl-like burping sound. I crouch farther behind Avi in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" I hear him say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I can\u0027t see anything because I\u0027m still behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It got me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who got you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns around and I see, stuck in Avi\u0027s hair, a slobber-phlegm spot with little pieces of chewed-up \u0027feed\u0027 inside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ew, gross!\" I say, stepping away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got spit on trying to protect you from it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re my hero, now get away from me. It\u0027s totally grossing me out,\" I say, then laugh at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t that long ago I washed the snake off your foot. That was pretty nasty. Now give me a kiss,\" he says, moving toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hide behind a laughing Ofra. \"I did not ask you to kiss me after the snake incident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops. And looks so cute all \u0027feed\u0027 encrusted and vulnerable. I walk up to him, keep my distance, and pucker so it\u0027s just my lips touching his. Then I pull back. \"Now you have to wash your hair.\" Then I add, \"Twice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHistory is something that should be remembered but never repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur next stop (after Avi washed his hair in the sink back at the alpaca farm) is a place called Mount Masada. I\u0027ve never heard of it and I wonder why a \"mount\" could be a place people would want to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as we drive (And I realize the vast majority of Israel is a barren desert. I truly wonder why it is so sought after.) and we come up to Mount Masada, I ask Avi, \"Why are we going to this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To show you a piece of the history of your people. I think you\u0027ll like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy people? Who exactly are my people? I\u0027m not sure myself, even though the rest of the gang thinks I\u0027m Jewish. The fact is I\u0027ve been brought up as nothing. Mom doesn\u0027t believe in religion, just like she doesn\u0027t believe in low-carb diets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe used to light a Christmas tree for the holidays until I realized at the age of seven Santa wasn\u0027t a real guy. They should honestly tell the older kids on the school bus not to tell the first graders the truth about the tooth fairy or Santa. You\u0027d be surprised what kids learn on that yellow bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, after I found out Santa wasn\u0027t real, I told Mom I didn\u0027t need a tree anymore. The tree didn\u0027t symbolize Christianity or anything. It symbolized Santa. Since the reality of Santa was gone there was no reason for a tree anymore. That was the extent of my religious experience, which wasn\u0027t really religious in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaze at the reddish-colored massive thing called Mount Masada as I get out of the car. Everybody is taking their water bottles out of the car and I wonder why they aren\u0027t staring at the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old is it?\" I ask no one in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoron, with his ever-present gun strapped to his shoulder, says, \"The war here was in seventy-three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to him. \"Nineteen seventy-three?\" I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Earlier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fourteen seventy-three?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Doo-Doo says. \"Just plain seventy-three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust plain seventy-three? \"You mean, like, almost two thousand years ago?\" Yep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaze again, this time more carefully, at this important mountain in the middle of the Israeli desert. I try to imagine a war here two thousand years ago between the Jews and their enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder what it\u0027s like up there,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re about to find out,\" Avi says as he hands me a water bottle. \"You\u0027ll need to drink regularly or you\u0027ll get dehydrated during the climb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I can climb this thing?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you can, Amy. Like your ancestors before you. See that winding snake path?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they call it a snake path because it\u0027s infested with snakes?\" \u0027Cause I\u0027m tough, but I\u0027ve had all the snake experiences for one trip, thank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s called that because of its shape,\" he says, only temporarily reassuring me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk closer to the bottom of the \u0027mount\u0027 and I can make out the narrow, winding path leading to the top. I watch as Doo-Doo, Snotty, Ofra, O\u0027dead, and Moron start their ascent up the mountain. Off to my left I see a big cable coming from the top. I follow where it leads and the end is a cable car situated at the foot of the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we take the cable car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi starts toward the supposedly non-infested \u0027snake\u0027 path. \"Because then you\u0027ll miss the great sense of accomplishment of actually reaching the top on your own. I\u0027ve done it many times and it\u0027s like nothing else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow Avi to the start of the snake path. At first it\u0027s easy ...if I just put one foot in front of the other I\u0027ll be at the top in no time at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut twenty minutes later, I\u0027m panting and my thigh muscles are starting to quiver. I mean, Illinois doesn\u0027t have mountains, let alone hills, and I\u0027m not used to it. I slow down, and Avi stays right with me. I know he could go way faster up the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" I say as we reach about midpoint of the thing. \"If I don\u0027t die of heat exhaustion, I\u0027m going to die of drowning in my own sweat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you do. Now get those feet moving so we can reach the top before sundown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do it, only because he grabs my hand and guides my limp body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who were the Jews fighting here?\" I ask. \"The Palestinians?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The Romans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would the Romans want to come here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do the Jews hate all Palestinians?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops and turns to me. \"We do not hate all Palestinians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort in disbelief. \"I\u0027ll believe that when I see it on CNN,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the top of Mount Masada is in sight and it\u0027s only taken me an hour to walk up the thing. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027ve actually climbed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reach the top, the ancient ruins amaze me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, the Jews won the battle with the Romans here?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO\u0027dead says, \"Not really. Jews committed suicide here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" I say, shocked and a little creeped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfra steps in front of him. \"Our ancestors climbed Masada and lived up here during the war. The Romans were at a loss, they couldn\u0027t safely climb the mountain without being attacked from the top of Masada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi leads me to one of the ruins. \"It is said nine hundred and sixty Jews lived here. They fought as long as they could, but knew it wouldn\u0027t be long before the Romans\u0027 weapons would be able to reach the top of it. If they were captured by the Romans, they would be killed or sold into slavery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at Moron, who\u0027s gazing down onto a colorful tile mosaic inside one of the homes built inside the mountain. It\u0027s absolutely beautiful and it touches my heart people lived on this mountain to save themselves and their families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they committed suicide?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi continues, \"They agreed as Jews they should be servants to God and God alone. To be sold into slavery wasn\u0027t an option. They would rather die bravely as free people than become slaves at the hands of the Romans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They destroyed all of their possessions except their food supply so the Romans would know it was not starvation that led to their demise, but to show they preferred death over slavery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy knees go weak from the story and I get chills all over my body. I can\u0027t believe how strong-willed the Jews were ...and still are. I aimlessly walk on the flat-topped mountain and take in all of the half-walls made of stone my ancestors built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTouching a brick with my fingers, I imagine the women and men two thousand years ago knowing their chances of survival were slim, but having enough courage to build beautiful homes for themselves that would last thousands of years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I scan the top of the mountain, I see a group of soldiers reach the top of Masada and congregate together. I notice little pockets on the sides of their army boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are those little pockets in their boots?\" I ask Moron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Americans call the identification tags around a soldier\u0027s neck \u0027dog tags\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Israeli combat soldiers wear tags around their necks and one in each shoe. In case their body parts are separated during combat, they can be identified. It is Jewish custom that every person be buried with all body parts, so every effort is taken to make sure that happens for our soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. What a somber thing to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they doing?\" I ask him as I watch the soldiers gather together and recite some Hebrew words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re taking an oath here \u0027Masada shall not fall again,\" Moron explains. \"This is a very spiritual place for all Jewish people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if the rock I was touching is hot, I pull my hand back. \"Ohmygod,\" I say, and stumble backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Avi says, concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\" I don\u0027t want to admit Masada is a spiritual place for me, too. And for the first time since coming to Israel I know why I\u0027m here and it scares me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember what Softa said. Being Jewish is more in your heart than in your mind. Religion is very personal. It will always be there for you if you want or need it. You can choose to embrace it... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-21.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM"}
