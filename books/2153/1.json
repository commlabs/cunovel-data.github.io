This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad\u0027Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad\u0027Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- from \"Manual of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul\u0027s room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow - hair like matted spiderwebs, hooded \u0027round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he not small for his age, Jessica?\" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul\u0027s mother answered in her soft contralto: \"The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve heard, so I\u0027ve heard,\" wheezed the old woman. \"Yet he\u0027s already fifteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Your Reverence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s awake and listening to us,\" said the old woman. \"Sly little rascal.\" She chuckled. \"But royalty has need of slyness. And if he\u0027s really the Kwisatz Haderach . . . well . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two bird-bright ovals - the eyes of the old woman - seemed to expand and glow as they stared into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep well, you sly little rascal,\" said the old woman. \"Tomorrow you\u0027ll need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul lay awake wondering: What\u0027s a gom jabbar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest thing he had seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour Reverence .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench instead of what she was - a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke\u0027s concubine and mother of the ducal heir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar . . . Kwisatz Haderach .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so different from Caladan that Paul\u0027s mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis - Dune - Desert Planet .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThufir Hawat, his father\u0027s Master of Assassins, had explained it: their mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice, melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides in fief-complete - an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said, this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular among the Great Houses of the Landsraad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful,\" Hawat had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrakis - Dune - Desert Planet .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a cathedral as he listened to a faint sound - the drip-drip-drip of water. Even while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening. He always remembered the dreams that were predictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dream faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed - thinking . . . thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age, perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to command them: will-o\u0027-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of the Imperial Regate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArrakis - Dune - Desert Planet .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses: he fell into the floating awareness . . . focusing the consciousness . . . aortal dilation . . . avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness . . . to be conscious by choice . . . blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions . . . one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone . . . animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct . . . the animal destroys and does not produce . . . animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual . . . the human requires a background grid through which to see his universe . . . focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid . . . bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of cell needs . . . all things/cells/beings are impermanent . . . strive for flow-permanence within . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver and over and over within Paul\u0027s floating awareness the lesson rolled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen dawn touched Paul\u0027s window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held with a black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes staring solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re awake,\" she said. \"Did you sleep well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- in the minutiae of observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry and dress,\" she said. \"Reverend Mother is waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dreamed of her once,\" Paul said. \"Who is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she\u0027s the Emperor\u0027s Truthsayer. And Paul . . . \" She hesitated. \"You must tell her about your dreams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did not get Arrakis.\" Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. \"Don\u0027t keep Reverend Mother waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul sat up, hugged his knees. \"What\u0027s a gom jabbar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the river orchards toward Mount Syubi . \"You\u0027ll learn about . . . the gom jabbar soon enough,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica spoke without turning. \"Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning room. Please hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a tapestried chair watching mother and son approach. Windows on each side of her overlooked the curving southern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the Atreides family holding, but the Reverend Mother ignored the view. She was feeling her age this morning, more than a little petulant. She blamed it on space travel and association with that abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive ways. But here was a mission that required personal attention from a Bene Gesserit-with-the-Sight. Even the Padishah Emperor\u0027s Truthsayer couldn\u0027t evade that responsibility when the duty call came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thought. If only she\u0027d borne us a girl as she was ordered to do!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica stopped three paces from the chair, dropped a small curtsy, a gentle flick of left hand along the line of her skirt. Paul gave the short bow his dancing master had taught - the one used \"when in doubt of another\u0027s station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nuances of Paul\u0027s greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She said: \"He\u0027s a cautious one, Jessica.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica\u0027s hand went to Paul\u0027s shoulder, tightened there. For a heartbeat, fear pulsed through her palm. Then she had herself under control. \"Thus he has been taught, Your Reverence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does she fear? Paul wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker: face oval like Jessica\u0027s, but strong bones . . . hair: the Duke\u0027s black-black but with browline of the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin, disdainful nose; shape of directly staring green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal grandfather who is dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura - even in death , the Reverend Mother thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Teaching is one thing,\" she said, \"the basic ingredient is another. We shall see.\" The old eyes darted a hard glance at Jessica. \"Leave us. I enjoin you to practice the meditation of peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica took her hand from Paul\u0027s shoulder. \"Your Reverence, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica, you know it must be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked up at his mother, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica straightened. \"Yes . . . of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked back at the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother\u0027s obvious awe of this old woman argued caution. Yet he felt an angry apprehension at the fear he sensed radiating from his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul . . . \" Jessica took a deep breath. \". . . this test you\u0027re about to receive . . . it\u0027s important to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Test?\" He looked up at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember that you\u0027re a duke\u0027s son, \"Jessica said. She whirled and strode from the room in a dry swishing of skirt. The door closed solidly behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul faced the old woman, holding anger in check. \"Does one dismiss the Lady Jessica as though she were a serving wench?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. \"The Lady Jessica was my serving wench, lad, for fourteen years at school.\" She nodded. \"And a good one, too. Now, you come here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he could think about it. Using the Voice on me , he thought. He stopped at her gesture, standing beside her knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See this?\" she asked. From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal cube about fifteen centimeters on a side. She turned it and Paul saw that one side was open - black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your right hand in the box,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said: \"Is this how you obey your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up into bird-bright eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul put his hand into the box. He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his hand were asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA predatory look filled the old woman\u0027s features. She lifted her right hand away from the box and poised the hand close to the side of Paul\u0027s neck. He saw a glint of metal there and started to turn toward. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the Voice again! He swung his attention back to her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hold at your neck the gom jabbar,\" she said. \"The gom jabbar, the high-handed enemy. It\u0027s a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don\u0027t pull away or you\u0027ll feel that poison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul tried to swallow in a dry throat. He could not take his attention from the seamed old face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around silvery metal teeth that flashed as she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A duke\u0027s son must know about poisons,\" she said. \"It\u0027s the way of our times, eh? Musky, to be poisoned in your drink. Aumas, to be poisoned in your food. The quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between. Here\u0027s a new one for you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePride overcame Paul\u0027s fear. \"You dare suggest a duke\u0027s son is an animal?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us say I suggest you may be human,\" she said. \"Steady! I warn you not to try jerking away. I am old, but my hand can drive this needle into your neck before you escape me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" he whispered. \"How did you trick my mother into leaving me alone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent.\" A dry finger touched his neck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" she said. \"You pass the first test. Now, here\u0027s the way of the rest of it: If you withdraw your hand from the box you die. This is the only rule. Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul took a deep breath to still his trembling. \"If I call out there\u0027ll be servants on you in seconds and you\u0027ll die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door. Depend on it. Your mother survived this test. Now it\u0027s your turn. Be honored. We seldom administer this to men-children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity reduced Paul\u0027s fear to a manageable level. He heard truth in the old woman\u0027s voice, no denying it. If his mother stood guard out there . . . if this were truly a test . . . And whatever it was, he knew himself caught in it, trapped by that hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He recalled the response from the Litany against Fear as his mother had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit rite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt calmness return, said: \"Get on with it, old woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old woman!\" she snapped. \"You\u0027ve courage, and that can\u0027t be denied. Well, we shall see, sirra.\" She bent close, lowered her voice almost to a whisper. \"You will feel pain in this hand within the box. Pain. But! Withdraw the hand and I\u0027ll touch your neck with my gom jabbar - the death so swift it\u0027s like the fall of the headsman\u0027s axe. Withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar takes you. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s in the box?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly together. How could this be a test? he wondered. The tingling became an itch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman said; \"You\u0027ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? There\u0027s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe itch became the faintest burning. \"Why are you doing this?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To determine if you\u0027re human. Be silent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased in the other hand. It mounted slowly: heat upon heat upon heat . . . upon heat. He felt the fingernails of his free hand biting the palm. He tried to flex the fingers of the burning hand, but couldn\u0027t move them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It burns,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silence!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain throbbed up his arm. Sweat stood out on his forehead. Every fiber cried out to withdraw the hand from that burning pit . . . but . . . the gom jabbar. Without turning his head, he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle poised beside his neck. He sensed that he was breathing in gasps, tried to slow his breaths and couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony, the ancient face inches away staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burning! The burning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the flesh crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt stopped!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul felt his right arm trembling, felt sweat bathing his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough,\" the old woman muttered. \"Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must\u0027ve wanted you to fail.\" She leaned back, withdrawing the gom jabbar from the side of his neck. \"Take your hand from the box, young human, and look at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fought down an aching shiver, stared at the lightless void where his hand seemed to remain of its own volition. Memory of pain inhibited every movement. Reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it!\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerked his hand from the box, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No sign of agony on the flesh. He held up the hand, turned it, flexed the fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pain by nerve induction,\" she said. \"Can\u0027t go around maiming potential humans. There\u0027re those who\u0027d give a pretty for the secret of this box, though.\" She slipped it into the folds of her gown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the pain - \" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pain,\" she sniffed. \"A human can override any nerve in the body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul felt his left hand aching, uncurled the clenched fingers, looked at four bloody marks where fingernails had bitten his palm. He dropped the hand to his side, looked at the old woman. \"You did that to my mother once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever sift sand through a screen?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher awareness: Sand through a screen , he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain. \"And that\u0027s all there is to it - pain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I observed you in pain, lad. Pain\u0027s merely the axis of the test. Your mother\u0027s told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching in you. Our test is crisis and observation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the confirmation in her voice, said: \"It\u0027s truth!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him. He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be the one? She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself: \"Hope clouds observation .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know when people believe what they say,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated test were in his voice. She heard them, said: \"Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Sit down, little brother, here at my feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I prefer to stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother sat at my feet once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hate us a little, eh?\" She looked toward the door, called out: \"Jessica!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door flew open and Jessica stood there staring hard-eyed into the room. Hardness melted from her as she saw Paul. She managed a faint smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?\" the old woman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I both love and hate you,\" Jessica said. \"The hate - that\u0027s from pains I must never forget. The love - that\u0027s . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just the basic fact,\" the old woman said, but her voice was gentle. \"You may come in now, but remain silent. Close that door and mind it that no one interrupts us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to it. My son lives , she thought. My son lives and is . . . human. I knew he was . . . but . . . he lives. Now, I can go on living . The door felt hard and real against her back. Everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy son lives .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked at his mother. She told the truth . He wanted to get away alone and think this experience through, but knew he could not leave until he was dismissed. The old woman had gained a power over him. They spoke truth . His mother had undergone this test. There must be terrible purpose in it . . . the pain and fear had been terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove against all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been infected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some day, lad,\" the old woman said, \"you, too, may have to stand outside a door like that. It takes a measure of doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul looked down at the hand that had known pain, then up to the Reverend Mother. The sound of her voice had contained a difference then from any other voice in his experience. The words were outlined in brilliance. There was an edge to them. He felt that any question he might ask her would bring an answer that could lift him out of his flesh-world into something greater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you test for humans?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To set you free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man\u0027s mind,\u0027 \" Paul quoted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible,\" she said. \"But what the O.C. Bible should\u0027ve said is: \u0027Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.\u0027 Have you studied the Mentat in your service?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve studied with Thufir Hawat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Great Revolt took away a crutch,\" she said. \"It forced human minds to develop. Schools were started to train human talents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bene Gesserit schools?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Politics,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kull wahad!\" the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve not told him. Your Reverence,\" Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. \"You did that on remarkably few clues,\" she said. \"Politics indeed. The original Bene Gesserit school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in human affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock - for breeding purposes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old woman\u0027s words abruptly lost their special sharpness for Paul. He felt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for rightness . It wasn\u0027t that Reverend Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she said. It was something deeper, something tied to his terrible purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said: \"But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don\u0027t know their ancestry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The genetic lines are always in our records,\" she said. \"Your mother knows that either she\u0027s of Bene Gesserit descent or her stock was acceptable in itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why couldn\u0027t she know who her parents are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some do . . . Many don\u0027t. We might, for example, have wanted to breed her to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait. We have many reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Paul felt the offense against rightness. He said: \"You take a lot on yourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering: Did I hear criticism in his voice? \"We carry a heavy burden,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test. He leveled a measuring stare at her, said: \"You say maybe I\u0027m the . . . Kwisatz Haderach. What\u0027s that, a human gom jabbar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul,\" Jessica said. \"You mustn\u0027t take that tone with - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll handle this, Jessica,\" the old woman said. \"Now, lad, do you know about the Truthsayer drug?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood,\" he said. \"My mother\u0027s told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever seen truthtrance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The drug\u0027s dangerous,\" she said, \"but it gives insight. When a Truthsayer\u0027s gifted by the drug, she can look many places in her memory - in her body\u0027s memory. We look down so many avenues of the past . . . but only feminine avenues.\" Her voice took on a note of sadness. \"Yet, there\u0027s a place where no Truthsayer can see. We are repelled by it, terrorized. It is said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot - into both feminine and masculine pasts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Kwisatz Haderach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the one who can be many places at once: the Kwisatz Haderach. Many men have tried the drug . . . so many, but none has succeeded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They tried and failed, all of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no.\" She shook her head. \"They tried and died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo attempt an understanding of Muad\u0027Dib without understanding his mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, is to attempt seeing Truth without knowing Falsehood. It is the attempt to see the Light without knowing Darkness. It cannot be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- from \"Manual of Muad\u0027Dib\" by the Princess Irulan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings. The globe sat on a freeform stand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a patchwork of multicolored scrolls, filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room from golden balls hanging in mobile suspensor fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ellipsoid desk with a top of jade-pink petrified elacca wood stood at the center of the room. Veriform suspensor chairs ringed it, two of them occupied. In one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years, round of face and with sullen eyes. The other held a slender, short man with effeminate face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in shadows spinning it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the chuckle: \"There it is, Piter - the biggest mantrap in all history. And the Duke\u0027s headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assuredly, Baron,\" said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet, musical quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat hand descended onto the globe, stopped the spinning. Now, all eyes in the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind of globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors of the Empire. It had the stamp of Imperial handicraft about it. Latitude and longitude lines were laid in with hair-fine platinum wire. The polar caps were insets of finest cloud-milk diamonds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat hand moved, tracing details on the surface. \"I invite you to observe,\" the basso voice rumbled. \"Observe closely, Piter, and you, too, Feyd-Rautha, my darling: from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south - these exquisite ripples. Their coloring: does it not remind you of sweet caramels? And nowhere do you see blue of lakes or rivers or seas. And these lovely polar caps - so small. Could anyone mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly unique. A superb setting for a unique Victory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile touched Piter\u0027s lips. \"And to think. Baron: the Padishah Emperor believes he\u0027s given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a nonsensical statement,\" the Baron rumbled. \"You say this to confuse young Feyd-Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the black leotards he wore. He sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in the wall behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enough to accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and scanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" the Baron demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fool answered us, Baron!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?\" the Baron asked. \"Well, what does he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as \u0027Harkonnen\u0027 - no \u0027Sire et Cher Cousin,\u0027 no title, nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good name,\" the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his impatience. \"What does dear Leto say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says: \u0027Your offer of a meeting is refused. I have ofttimes met your treachery and this all men know.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" the Baron asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says: \u0027The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire. \u0027 He signs it: \u0027Duke Leto of Arrakis.\u0027 \" Piter began to laugh. \"Of Arrakis! Oh, my! This is almost too rich!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be silent, Piter,\" the Baron said, and the laughter stopped as though shut off with a switch. \"Kanly, is it?\" the Baron asked. \"Vendetta, heh? And he uses the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made the peace gesture,\" Piter said. \"The forms have been obeyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter,\" the Baron said. And he thought: I must do away with that one soon. He has almost outlived his usefulness . The Baron stared across the room at his Mental assassin, seeing the feature about him that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of blue within blue, the eyes without any white in them at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin flashed across Piter\u0027s face. It was like a mask grimace beneath those eyes like holes. \"But, Baron! Never has revenge been more beautiful. It is to see a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to make Leto exchange Caladan for Dune - and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How waggish of you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a cold voice, the Baron said: \"You have a flux of the mouth, Piter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I am happy, my Baron. Whereas you . . . you are touched by jealousy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Piter!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-ah. Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this delicious scheme by yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someday I will have you strangled, Piter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truth without fear surprises the Baron,\" Piter said. His face drew down into a caricature of a frowning mask. \"Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, I know as a Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as I am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I\u0027m yet of much use. I know what it is you learned from that lovely Dune planet - waste not. True, Baron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron continued to stare at Piter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. These wrangling fools! he thought. My uncle cannot talk to his Mental without arguing. Do they think I\u0027ve nothing to do except listen their arguments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feyd,\" the Baron said. \"I told you to listen and learn when I invited you in here. Are you learning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Uncle.\" the voice was carefully subservient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I wonder about Piter,\" the Baron said. \"I cause pain out of necessity, but he . . . I swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself, I can feel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against him soon, and that\u0027ll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose hand directed the pliant doctor . . . and knowing that will be a terrible thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why haven\u0027t you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his ribs quietly and efficiently?\" Piter asked. \"You talk of pity, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Duke must know when I encompass his doom,\" the Baron said. \"And the other Great Houses must learn of it. The knowledge will give them pause. I\u0027ll gain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but I don\u0027t have to like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Room to maneuver,\" Piter sneered. \"Already you have the Emperor\u0027s eyes on you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a legion or two of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that\u0027ll be an end to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d like to see that, wouldn\u0027t you, Piter?\" the Baron asked. \"You\u0027d enjoy seeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this castle. You\u0027d truly enjoy that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the Baron need to ask?\" Piter whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should\u0027ve been a Bashar of the Corps,\" the Baron said. \"You\u0027re too interested in blood and pain. Perhaps I was too quick with my promise of the spoils of Arrakis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly behind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and the youth looked up at Piter with a worried frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not toy with Piter, Baron,\" Piter said. \"You promised me the Lady Jessica. You promised her to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what, Piter?\" the Baron asked. \"For pain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiter stared at him, dragging out the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side, said: \"Uncle, do I have to stay? You said you\u0027d - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My darling Feyd-Rautha grows impatient,\" the Baron said. He moved within the shadows beside the globe. \"Patience, Feyd.\" And he turned his attention back to the Mentat. \"What of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear Piter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The trap will bring him to you, Baron,\" Piter muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not my question,\" the Baron said. \"You\u0027ll recall that you predicted the Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke. You were wrong, eh, Mentat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not often wrong, Baron,\" Piter said, and for the first time there was fear in his voice. \"Give me that: I\u0027m not often wrong. And you know yourself these Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters. Even the Emperor\u0027s consort had produced only females.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle,\" said Feyd-Rautha, \"you said there\u0027d be something important here for me to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to my nephew,\" the Baron said. \"He aspires to rule my Barony, yet he cannot rule himself.\" The Baron stirred beside the globe, a shadow among shadows. \"Well then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, I summoned you here hoping to teach you a bit of wisdom. Have you observed our good Mentat? You should\u0027ve learned something from this exchange.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Uncle - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn\u0027t you say, Feyd?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look at his eyes! He might\u0027ve come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool. Efficient, Piter, but he\u0027s still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts. Efficient, Piter, but he still can err.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePiter spoke in a low, sullen tone: \"Did you call me in here to impair my efficiency with criticism, Baron?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. I wish only for my nephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you already training my replacement?\" Piter demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Replace you? Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your cunning and venom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same place you found me, Baron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I should at that,\" the Baron mused. \"You do seem a bit unstable lately. And the spice you eat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could I object to that? I merely wish my nephew to observe this about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m on display,\" Piter said. \"Shall I dance? Shall I perform my various functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precisely,\" the Baron said. \"You are on display. Now, be silent.\" He glanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew\u0027s lips, the full and pouting look of them, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in amusement. \"This is a Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned to perform certain duties. The fact that it\u0027s encased in a human body, however, must not be overlooked. A serious drawback, that. I sometimes think the ancients with their thinking machines had the right idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were toys compared to me,\" Piter snarled. \"You yourself, Baron, could outperform those machines .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" the Baron said. \"Ah, well . . . \" He took a deep breath, belched. \"Now, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign against the House of Atreides.
