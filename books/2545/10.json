Until then his desk was snow-banked with demanding papers, his telephone rang constantly and an army of insistent visitors attacked his walls. By twelve, his nerves were pulled like violin strings knobbed to their tightest. By one, the strings drew close to shearing; by one-thirty they began to snap. He had to get away; now, immediately; flee to some shadowy restaurant booth, have a cocktail and a leisurely meal; listen to somnolent music. He had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown on the street, he walked beyond the zone of eating places he usually frequented, not wishing to risk seeing anyone he knew. About a quarter of a mile from the office he found a cellar restaurant named Franco\u0027s. At his request, the hostess led him to a rear booth where he ordered a martini; then, as the woman turned away, he stretched out his legs beneath the table and closed his eyes. A grateful sigh murmured from him. This was the ticket. Dim-lit comfort. Muzak thrumming at the bottom fringe of audibility, a curative drink. He signed again. A few more days like this, he thought, and I\u0027m gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hi, Don.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes in time to see the man drop down across from him, \u0027How goes it?\u0027 asked the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027 Donald Marshall stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Gawd,\u0027 said the man. \u0027What a day, what a day.\u0027 He grinned tiredly. \u0027You, too?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t believe -\u0027 began Marshall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ah!\u0027 the man said, nodding, pleased, as a waitress brought the martini. \u0027That for me.

The man did the same.

Will you kindly accept that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked around as if for help.

You don\u0027t know me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarshall drew in a deep breath, teeth clenched against rising fury. The man drew back. The look on his face was, suddenly, frightening to Marshall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027One of us is out of his mind,\u0027 Marshall said. The levity he\u0027d intended never appeared in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNolan swallowed raggedly. He looked down at his drink as if unable to face the other man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarshall suddenly laughed. \u0027Dear Lord,\u0027 he said, \u0027What a scene. You really think you know me, don\u0027t you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man grimaced.

That\u0027s impossible,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No,\u0027 said the man flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Marshall got the notion that this was some sort of insidious plot against him; but the distraught expression on the man\u0027s face weakened the suspicion. He took a sip of his martini, then, carefully, set down the glass and laid his palms on the table as if seeking the reinforcement of its presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027American-Pacific Steamship Lines?\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man nodded once. \u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarshall shook his head obdurately; \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027There\u0027s no other Marshall in our offices.

An out-and-out case of mistaken identity was one thing. A mistaken identity which seemed not quite wholly mistaken was another. How had the man known these things about him?

And one of the ideas used repeatedly was that of the alternate universe: a lunatic theory which stated that for every possibility there was a separate universe. Following his theory there might, conceivably, be a universe in which he knew this Nolan, ate at Franco\u0027s with him regularly and had graduated from Columbia a semester earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was absurd, really, yet there it was. What if, in entering Franco\u0027s, he had, accidentally, entered a universe one jot removed from the one he\u0027d existed in at the office? What if, the thought expanded, people were, without knowing it, continually entering these universes one jot removed? What if he himself had continually entered them and never known until today �C when, in an accidental entry, he had gone one step too far?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and shuddered. Dear Lord, he thought; dear, heavenly Lord, I have been working too hard. He felt as if he were standing at the edge of a cliff waiting for someone to push him off. He tried hard not to think about his talk with Nolan. If he thought about it he\u0027d have to fit into the pattern. He wasn\u0027t prepared to do that yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while he paid his check and left the restaurant, the food like cold lead in his stomach. He cabbed to Pennsylvania Station and, after a short wait, boarded a North Shore train. All the way to Huntington, he sat in the smoker car staring out at the passing countryside, an unlit cigarette between his fingers. The heavy pressure in his stomach wouldn\u0027t go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Huntington was reached, he walked across the station to the cab stand and, deliberately, got into one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake me home, will you?\u0027 he looked intently at the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sure thing, Mr Marshall,\u0027 said the driver, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarshall sank back with a wavering sigh and closed his eyes. There was a tingling at his fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re home early,\u0027 said the driver. \u0027Feeling poorly?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarshall swallowed. \u0027Just a headache,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he rode home, Marshall kept staring at the town, despite himself, looking for discrepancies, for differences. But there were none; everything was just the same. He felt the pressure letting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth was in the living room, sewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don.\u0027 She stood up and hurried to him. \u0027Is something wrong?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, no,\u0027 he said putting down his hat. \u0027Just a headache.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh.\u0027 She led him, sympathetically, to a chair and helped him off with his suit coat and shoes. \u0027I\u0027ll get you something right away,\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Fine.\u0027 When she was gone upstairs, Marshall looked around the familiar room and smiled at it. It was all right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuth was coming down the stairs when the telephone rang. He started up, then fell back again as she called, \u0027I\u0027ll get it, darling.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All right,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her in the hallway as she picked up the receiver and said hello. She listened. \u0027Yes, darling,\u0027 she said automatically. \u0027You -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she stopped and, holding out the receiver, stared at it as if it were something monstrous in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put it back-to her ear. \u0027You... won\u0027t be home until late?\u0027 she asked in a faint voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarshall sat there gaping at her, the beats of his heart like someone striking at him. Even when she turned to look at him, the receiver lowered in her hand, he couldn\u0027t turn away. Please, he thought. Please don\u0027t say it. Please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who are you?\u0027 she asked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shock/page-10.html","bookId":2545,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:09:31 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:09:31 AM"}
