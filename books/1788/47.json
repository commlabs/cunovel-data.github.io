It\u0027s not easy to live with the memories of the people I hurt in the past. Including you and your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christopher,\" she murmured, throwing him a distracted glance. \"I don\u0027t know what to say. I need some time to consider things?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take all the time you wish,\" he said gently. \"If I can\u0027t be what I once was to you ... I will have to be satisfied as a friend-in-waiting.\" He smiled slightly, his eyes filled with a tender glow. \"And if you should ever want more?a single word is all it will take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twelve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrdinarily Cam would have been pleased by the arrival of Lord and Lady St. Vincent at Stony Cross Park. However, Cam wasn\u0027t looking forward to the prospect of telling St. Vincent about his decision to quit the club. St. Vincent wouldn\u0027t like it. Not only would it be inconvenient to have to find a replacement manager, but the viscount wouldn\u0027t understand Cam\u0027s desire to live as a Roma. St. Vincent was nothing if not an enthusiastic advocate of fine living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany people feared St. Vincent, who possessed a lethal way with words and a calculating nature, but Cam was not one of them. In fact, he had challenged the viscount on more than one occasion, both of them arguing with a vicious articulateness that would have sliced anyone else to ribbons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe St. Vincents arrived with their daughter Phoebe, a red-haired infant with an alarmingly changeable temperament. One moment the child was placid and adorable. The next, she was a squalling devil-spawn who could only be soothed by the sound of her father\u0027s voice. \"There, darling,\" St. Vincent had been known to coo into the infant\u0027s ear. \"Has someone displeased you? Ignored you? Oh, the insolence. My poor princess shall have anything she wants? And, appeased by her father\u0027s outrageous spoiling, Phoebe would settle into hiccupping smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby was duly admired and passed around in the parlor. Evie and Lillian chattered without stopping, frequently hugging and linking arms in the way of old friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while Cam, St. Vincent, and Lord Westcliff withdrew to the back terrace, where an afternoon breeze diffused the scents of the river and reed sweetgrass and marsh marigold. The raucous honks of greylag geese punctuated the peace of the Hampshire autumn, along with the lowing of cattle being driven along a well-worn path to a dry meadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men sat at an outside table. Cam, who disliked the taste of tobacco, waved his hand in dismissal as St. Vincent offered him a cigar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Westcliff\u0027s interested regard, Cam and St. Vincent discussed the progress of the club\u0027s renovations. Then, seeing no reason to tiptoe around the issue, Cam told St. Vincent of his decision to quit the club as soon as the work was completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re leaving me?\" St. Vincent asked, looking perturbed. \"For how long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For good, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs St. Vincent absorbed the information, his pale blue eyes narrowed. \"What will you do for money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelaxed in the face of his employer\u0027s displeasure, Cam shrugged. \"I already have more money than anyone could spend in a lifetime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe viscount glanced heavenward. \"Anyone who says such a thing obviously doesn\u0027t know the right places to shop.\" He sighed shortly. \"So. If I\u0027m to understand correctly, you intend to eschew civilization altogether and live as a savage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I intend to live as a Roma. There\u0027s a difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rohan, you\u0027re a wealthy young bachelor with all the advantages of modern life. If you\u0027ve got ennui, do what every other man of means does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam\u0027s brows lifted. \"And that would be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gamble! Drink! Buy a horse! Take a mistress! For God\u0027s sake, have a little imagination. Can you think of no better option than to throw it all away and live like a primitive, thereby inconveniencing me in the process? How the devil am I to replace you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0027s irreplaceable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are. No other man in London can do what you do. You\u0027re a walking account book, you\u0027ve got eyes in the back of your head, you\u0027ve got the tact of a diplomat, the mind of a banker, the fists of a boxer, and you can put down a fight in a matter of seconds. I\u0027d need to hire at least a half-dozen men to your job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have the mind of a banker,\" Cam said indignantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After all your investment coups, you can\u0027t deny?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t on purpose!\" A scowl spread across Cam\u0027s face. \"It was my good-luck curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking satisfied to have unsettled Cam\u0027s composure, St. Vincent drew on his cigar. He exhaled a smooth, elegant stream of smoke and glanced at Westcliff. \"Say something,\" he told his old friend. \"You can\u0027t approve of this any more than I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not for either of us to approve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Cam muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"However,\" Westcliff continued, \"I urge you, Rohan, to reflect adequately on the fact that while half of you is a freedom-loving Gypsy, the other half is Irishâ€”a race renowned for its fierce love of land. Which leads me to doubt that you will be as happy in your wandering as you seem to expect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point rattled Cam. He had always tried to ignore the gadjo half of his nature, lugging it around like some oversized piece of baggage he would have liked to set aside but for which he could never find a convenient place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If your point is that I\u0027m damned whatever I do,\" Cam said tersely, \"I\u0027d rather err on the side of being free.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-47.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
