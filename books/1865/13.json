As she and Dillon greeted their guests the night of their engagement party, she found her head becoming dizzy with literal fear. Looking down at her watch, a frantic string of emotions raced through her mind, knowing she would soon face Gavin. The heavy weight of it all had her feeling as though her nerves were beginning to fray like a rope one fiber at a time. Her spinning thoughts slowed when she felt Dillon\u0027s gentle touch brush against her arm. For tonight, she needed to focus on him - and him only - no matter how difficult she knew it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you alright?\" he asked, scooping her up into a hug. He planted a kiss on her lips and moved her hair away from her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m fine,\" she answered, sliding her hands down the lapels of his black suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you look beautiful tonight,\" he crooned. \"I just may have you for dessert when this whole thing\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard that, Dillon,\" Lisa\u0027s voice broke through the air, one brow cocked above her hazel eyes. \"Please refrain from referring to my baby sister as dessert,\" she laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon smirked and pulled Emily in closer. \"But she\u0027s so...delectable, Lisa. I mean, honestly, I can\u0027t get enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shook her head and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I seriously don\u0027t need to hear how delectable she is.\" She gave Emily a light tug on her arm, effectively releasing her from his hold. \"I\u0027d like to speak to my sister in private for a second, if that\u0027s okay with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s all yours,\" he replied, branding one last kiss on Emily\u0027s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching for her hand, Lisa led her through the knot of guests that started to trickle into the banquet room. Emily smiled and returned their greetings along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two sisters made their way through the party, it was then that Emily noticed Dillon spared no expense for the night. The restaurant was truly beautiful. A mahogany bar was located in the corner of the room set beside a massive window that overlooked New York Harbor. Deep-red leather couches and matching upholstered wingback chairs were scattered throughout. Ornate sconces hung on the walls while an exquisite dimly lit chandelier anchored the room. Adjacent to a baby grand piano echoing music through the air was a glowing fireplace that crackled its warmth in the space, setting the romantic mood for the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter turning a corner that led to an empty hall, they ducked into a vacant room, and Lisa closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlacing her hands on Emily\u0027s shoulders, Lisa\u0027s eyes softened with genuine concern. \"I can tell you\u0027re a nervous wreck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slanted a hand through her hair, the weakest of smiles tipping her lips. \"Is it that obvious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to others, but I know you better than anyone else,\" she said softly, reaching for Emily\u0027s hand. \"Is he here yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Believe me, when he\u0027s here, you\u0027ll know it,\" she replied with a nervous laugh. Biting her lip, she paused for a moment, her features smoothing, voice low. \"I wish Mom was here, Lisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sweetie, I do, too,\" she whispered, leaning in for a hug. Emily squeezed her tight, her warmth reminding her of the very woman they were still mourning. The grief swelled in Emily\u0027s chest like a fresh bruise. \"But, even if she was here, Emily, she\u0027d tell you to go with what your heart wants. She couldn\u0027t make your decision any easier. I just need to know - just like mom would - that this is what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the slightest hesitation, she answered, \"Yes, I do want this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay then, let\u0027s go enjoy your party.\" Lisa grabbed for Emily\u0027s hand and started heading back into the main dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon emerging, the amount of guests had doubled in size - the majority consisting of family, coworkers, and friends of Dillon. Sure, Emily had met a few of them over the last year, but most were a distant blur of Dillon\u0027s aunts, uncles, and cousins that she had encountered briefly at family gatherings. Essentially, the amount of people Emily knew in attendance could fit at one table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a room filled with people, in that moment, she felt oddly alone - until her eyes locked onto Gavin\u0027s. For Emily, the world seemed to stop. The music whispered in the background while voices became muted and unimportant. Again, the undeniable connection between them was apparent from across the space, even if not witnessed by anyone else. It was there - unwavering and unrelenting through their unspoken words. She found it hard to breathe as the overwhelming tidal wave of emotions took hold and pulled her into the current - pounding and roaring with a power greater than she could ever be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes swept over him. He was wearing a charcoal-colored suit that covered his built yet graceful frame. Beneath, he wore a white-collared shirt and pinstriped black-and-gray tie. His lustrous dark hair was sexily mussed as if he didn\u0027t bother fixing it after showering. His impressive presence in the room was that of polished power, economical grace, and unyielding demand. He simply was a force that she couldn\u0027t help but notice. Although he had his arm snaked around what Emily believed to be one of the most beautiful women she had ever seen, his eyes were trained on Emily\u0027s, steady and focused. He sent her a smile from across the room that still managed to disarm her, leaving her in a sea of desire, want, and need, struggling to resurface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClenching Emily\u0027s now sweaty hand, hazel eyes bright with curiosity, Lisa asked, \"Is that him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded and a lump wedged itself between the walls of her throat as she watched Dillon approach Gavin, motioning her over in the process. Licking her dry lips, she squeezed Lisa\u0027s hand, and with trepidation, she started making her way across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, she\u0027s so beautiful, Gavin thought to himself as he watched Emily close the space between them. Her body swayed with elegant poise beneath an emerald silk evening gown. His eyes followed her sleek legs down to a pair of silver strappy stilettos adorning her feet. He tried to keep his eyes from traveling back up to her subtle curves and long dark locks of hair because it only brought back that familiar ache. He fought to push it away, but his body continued to respond to her as she drew nearer. He could feel his pupils dilate as she swept her tongue across her lips, causing his blood to pump with brutal force toward necessary extremities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a desire for every inch of her - the smell of her sweet breath on his hungry lips, the taste of her tongue against his, the soft feel of her skin beneath his hands, and the sound of her husky voice whispering in his ears. She was an assault on his senses, a constant thirst needing to be quenched. Although he\u0027d had a taste, he feared the only thing he would have left was his instinct of wanting her more and needing to feel her again and again. With all of this, what captivated him the most was her eyes - those deep pools of alluring green that felt as if they were boring into his very soul. His grip may have tightened around Stephanie\u0027s waist, but in his mind, his hands were on Emily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Emily and Lisa approached, Dillon reached for her, positioning her back against his chest. \"Babe, this is Gavin\u0027s date, Stephanie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a smile, Emily pulled in a slow and shaky breath. \"It\u0027s very nice to meet you, Stephanie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too,\" she replied, tucking a few errant strands of her honey-hued hair behind her ear. Her porcelain-like features emphasized her large whiskey-colored eyes. \"Congratulations on your engagement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Emily said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin\u0027s gaze captured Emily\u0027s, a smile on his face. \"Yes...congratulations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his voice so calm, cool, and collected, Emily couldn\u0027t help but wonder if she was the only ball of nerves standing there. Smiling, she simply nodded her thanks. As soon as she did, her stomach recoiled when she swore she saw a sparkle of amusement in his eyes at her reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just an assumption,\" Gavin continued, turning in Lisa\u0027s direction, \"but there must be some sort of relation between you and Emily. Your features are strikingly similar\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she replied. \"I\u0027m her sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm, younger or older?\" he asked casually with his dimpled smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he\u0027s quite the charmer,\" Lisa laughed, looking at Emily. She brought her attention back to Gavin. \"I\u0027m older by ten years, but thank you for the compliment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He certainly is,\" Emily deadpanned, shifting nervously against Dillon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smirk curled the brim of Gavin\u0027s mouth, but he remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep my thoughts to myself about that one,\" Dillon clipped with a smirk of his own. Gavin shook his head. \"But, for now, I need another drink. Babe, do you want another glass of wine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one way she was going to survive the rest of the night. Emily smiled. \"I\u0027ll take a shot of something...strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon nodded and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin flicked Emily another stroke of amusement with his eyes. She could tell he felt her sinking, and all it was doing was pissing her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could dwell too long on her desire to knock him clear across the head, Trevor and Fallon approached. Emily smiled at them, happy that they were working out well as a couple. They genuinely enjoyed being together and seemed to be a perfect match of fire and ice. She guessed Dillon would beg to differ since he laughed at the whole courtship when he found out about it. Nonetheless, Emily was thrilled, knowing he would now have no choice but to accept Fallon as her friend. To seal the deal, she made Fallon one of her bridesmaids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFormal introductions were made between Stephanie and Fallon before Trevor asked the group if he could steal Emily away for a dance. She obliged his request, placing her hand in the crook of his arm as he guided her out onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the pianists playing \"The Summer Wind\" by Frank Sinatra in the background, they began dancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up to him, she said, \"I didn\u0027t know you liked slow dancing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. \"I don\u0027t to tell you the truth. I actually hate it.\" Emily gave him a questioning look. \"I just wanted to talk to you about what I had said the last time we spoke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily knew he was referring to the mess between her and Gavin. It came as a surprise to her when Trevor called to let her know his feelings on the situation. He wasn\u0027t harsh about his opinion over the whole matter, but one would consider his approach a little less than understanding to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she nodded. \"Well, you\u0027ve explained that it puts you in a bad position. I understand that, but to be honest, nothing more\u0027s going to happen between us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face softened as he lowered his voice. \"I consider you my adoptive sister, and I wanted to apologize for the things I had said - well, mostly, the way I had said them. I just wanted you to know that, whether or not you and Gavin decide to carry on anything, it\u0027s none of my business. You\u0027re two grown adults, and it\u0027s your lives. Would it be an odd situation for me because I\u0027m friends with Dillon? Absolutely. But I would have to learn to deal with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWidening her eyes, she tilted her head to the side. \"Trevor, I\u0027m engaged now, and like I said, nothing more\u0027s going to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis devil-may-care sneer lit up his features, showing his amusement at her remark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you have that look on your face?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may wear glasses, Emily, but I\u0027m not blind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" she asked, pulling back slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gently pulled her closer. \"One, I\u0027ve known Gavin since I was a kid, and his perseverance to go after something he wants has never been an issue for him. And two, even though I haven\u0027t known you as long as him, I can see it all over your face when you look at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped swaying to the music, but Trevor kept them moving swiftly. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about this,\" she said with a smile on her face, trying to appear unfazed in the crowded room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s cool with me. I just wanted to put it out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I thank you for your blessings that are not needed in this case, Dad.\" He laughed at that. \"Now let\u0027s move on to the next subject, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" he smiled. \"So how do you feel about Dillon being gone for a few days in October?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going away? He never told me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we both are. The firm\u0027s sending us to Florida to score an account from some Japanese mogul, Takatsuki Yamamoto,\" he laughed, struggling to pronounce the name correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frown creased her brows. \"Wait, Dillon told me he already landed that account.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not yet,\" he shook his head. \"You must have it confused with another one. We\u0027re trying to get it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkimming through her memory, she was almost positive that was Dillon\u0027s reason for bailing on their date in Central Park. She remembered he\u0027d said he was in New Jersey. However, with everything that had happened since, she started questioning herself in that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of Dillon clearing his throat broke through her thoughts. \"May I cut in?\" he asked, looking to Trevor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowing gracefully, Trevor chuckled. \"Go for it. I\u0027ll catch up with you two in a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor made his way back over to Fallon, Stephanie, and Gavin. Olivia and her girlfriend, Tina, had also joined the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, Dillon curled one hand around Emily\u0027s waist. \"Are you having a good time?\" he whispered into her hair, his free hand stroking her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a little overwhelming right now, but yes.\" He smiled and pulled her closer. \"Can I ask you something, Dillon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as it\u0027s about what positions I plan on putting you in after I slip you out of this dress tonight, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I\u0027m being serious, Dillon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Okay, okay. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d you tell me that you were in New Jersey the morning we were supposed to meet in Central Park?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCocking his head to the side, his hold on her waist tightened. \"Because I was in New Jersey. That was weeks ago. Why are you asking me about this now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you going away to Florida in October?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped moving, his eyes narrowing on her. \"Why are you answering my question with another question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re not answering mine,\" she replied without missing a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his hands to his side. \"Emily, just get to your fucking point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaken aback by his response, she studied his demeanor for a second. \"You told me you were in New Jersey that morning because some guy from Japan flew out and wanted to meet with you personally, correct?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Emily, he wanted to meet with me. I met with him and gained his account for the firm. Like I said, get to the fucking point already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill shocked at the way he was acting under her scrutiny, she drew in a deep breath. \"My point, Dillon, is that Trevor just said you two are going away on business in a couple of weeks to meet with the exact same Japanese gentleman whom you already had claimed to have landed an account with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily watched his eyes scan the room as if debating on what to say to her. Waiting for his response, she impatiently crossed her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePinching the bridge of his nose, his eyes traveled back to hers. \"Okay, I lied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked breathlessly, the feeling of rising bile quickly making its way into the back of her throat. \"Where were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she pulled away, he circled his arms around her and drew her near. \"That was the morning...\" He hesitated a second. \"I was picking up the engagement ring.\" She parted her lips to speak, but he continued. \"They thought there was a problem with the set, and I got held up there. I almost fucking lost it, thinking that I was going to have to go somewhere else to get one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could question him, his mother floated over - her blonde hair twisted into a tight bun, which only further exaggerated her high cheekbones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dillon, Uncle Bruce and Aunt Mary just arrived. They\u0027re not feeling well with their emphysema. Damn smokers,\" she huffed. \"Anyway, they want to say hello to you and Emily. Do me a favor and go over and greet them.\" With the flick of her wrist, she motioned in the direction of the couple sitting comfortably at a table across the room. Each with their own breathing machine anchored next to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon reached for Emily\u0027s hand. \"Sure, we\u0027ll be there in a second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I need to use the restroom,\" she replied, walking away from him. \"Go ahead without me, and I\u0027ll meet you over there in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing his hand through his hair, Dillon looked to her and nodded. As he crossed the room with his mother, Emily let out a sigh. She didn\u0027t need to use the restroom. She needed a breather to clear her racing thoughts. Confusion spun through her mind. She didn\u0027t understand why, even though she had explained that she knew about the upcoming trip, he had continued to lie to her. She understood that he couldn\u0027t actually tell her where he was on that particular morning - especially if he was indeed purchasing her ring - but here, right now, why not just confess to it? When one of the waiters approached her with much-needed bubbling champagne, she earnestly plucked two glasses off the tray, downed one, and then thanked him. With that, she turned in the direction of the terrace, only to discover Gavin watching her every move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEffectively ignoring him, she made her way outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin shifted uncomfortably in his chair, trying to drag his eyes away from Emily as she exited the restaurant. She looked like a princess - so beautiful that she made his chest ache with the need to touch her. Even though laughter and conversation between Stephanie, Fallon, and Tina hummed around him, he couldn\u0027t help the urge of somehow finding a way to follow her outside. His chance came when Trevor approached the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone need a drink?\" Trevor asked. \"I\u0027m going over to the bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get me and Tina an Alabama Slammer each,\" Olivia piped out, adjusting the straps to the silver dress she was wearing. \"Actually, get us two each.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor nodded at her request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising to his feet, Gavin smiled. \"I need another, and I\u0027ll take a walk with you.\" He turned to Stephanie. \"Did you want something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m okay, but thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling like the slithering snake he knew he was for leaving Stephanie like that, Gavin surveyed the crowd in an attempt to locate Dillon. He found him consumed in a conversation among a few men that appeared to be his age. Gavin figured that they were his friends from high school or college. As he and Trevor approached the bar, it was apparent to Gavin - based on the look in Trevor\u0027s eyes - that his friend knew something was up. Trevor placed the order with the bartender and turned to Gavin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need a drink, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t,\" Gavin stated, his gaze moving over the room before coming back to Trevor. \"I want to talk to Emily for a few minutes. Keep an eye on Dillon for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender slid the glasses across to Trevor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Stephanie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Olivia to keep her busy; she\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head, Trevor lifted his drink and sipped from it. \"You\u0027re playing with fire, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle the burn. Just do what I asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a backward glance, Gavin navigated his way through the crowd, dashing and darting through the maze of evening gowns and tailored suits. When he emerged on the terrace, he found Emily with her back to him, her auburn hair whipping around in the cool late-September air. Unaware of him watching, it was as if her body beckoned him. He tried - God knows he tried - to stay away. The past few weeks had been hell, and he had attempted to save them both by not going to her job and not showing up at her apartment when he knew Dillon wouldn\u0027t be there. However, seeing her, being here with her, sucking in her presence had him feeling as though his mind was possessed. Every neuron fired into a tempest of sparks, and he couldn\u0027t believe that his body was able to contain it. He was amazed that his flesh wasn\u0027t cracking into a million glittering pieces. No matter the situation, right there and then, he needed to go to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step forward, and as if she sensed him, she whipped around, a piece of her silken hair catching in her mouth. \"What are you doing out here?\" she asked, her voice low, shaky even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved toward her, allowing only a few feet to separate them. \"I need to speak with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to talk about,\" she said, turning her back to him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a lot we need to talk about, and you\u0027re going to turn around and face me, Emily.\" The rough whisper was breathed out with classic male dominance as he stepped closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone caught her attention, her heart slamming to a stop before jump-starting again. She twirled around and stared straight into his eyes. He was looking at her as if he was trying to read her mind, and she felt naked under his gaze. So sexy, dangerous, and completely confident, it almost sickened her. As arrogant as his demand was, it still managed to suck her into a vortex of spiraling desire. Like a defiant teenager pissed at a parent, she crossed her arms and waited for him to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel me when I\u0027m not with you, Emily?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith shock shimmering in her eyes, she nervously laughed. \"What kind of question is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One that I\u0027m asking you,\" he growled. \"Because I can feel you when you\u0027re not with me. Now answer my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re back to this again, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Now get those pretty lips to answer the question,\" he demanded as he stepped closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass woman she knew existed beneath her skin smashed under her passion, lust, and want. The splinters of herself scattered and recomposed themselves into the man who consumed her every thought - the man who was standing right in front of her. This was it - her breaking point. She wasn\u0027t going to deny him or herself what she felt anymore. Gavin brought her to the edge, and there was no looking back. Her stomach knotted over knowing what she was about to confess, but more so because of how much she was about to confess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to hear me say it?\" she hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, he felt her now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith blatant intention, he did the one thing he knew would get her riled up. He slowly dragged his bottom lip between his teeth as his eyes bore right through her. \"Yes, I want to hear you say it,\" he answered as calm as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine! I want to fuck you just like you want to fuck me, Gavin,\" she blurted out in a hard whisper. \"I\u0027ve wanted to fuck you since the first moment I laid my eyes on you. I\u0027ve dreamt of you. I feel you when you\u0027re not with me. I\u0027ve even masturbated with a clear picture of you in my thoughts. Are you happy now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, he couldn\u0027t count the amount of times he got himself off thinking about her in the same way, but that wasn\u0027t what was driving him. His expression creased with a mix of shock, anger, and hurt from her accusation. \"No, I\u0027m not happy. You think this is about me wanting to fuck you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that, she laughed again. \"Oh, give me a break. What else would it be about? I know I\u0027m naive when it comes to certain things, but I\u0027m not a dumbass, Gavin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in her eyes and in the set of her body filled him with heat. The edge of vulnerability in her voice sliced at his chest, and hell, it tore him apart. But combined with her explosion of defiance and anger, it only made the need for her eat into him like a painful disease. He stepped forward, bringing his arm around her waist, pinning her close to his hip, as he quickly guided her out of view. They\u0027d gotten lucky thus far in being alone, but he knew it was only a matter of time before that ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" she huffed, struggling against him, the sound of her heels clicking frantically against the concrete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger of his own surged hot and deep inside him as he backed her against a wall on the side of the terrace. He stared at her, his blue eyes brooding in the dimly lit space with an expression so hard it was granite. \"This has nothing to do with me wanting to fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it doesn\u0027t?\" she breathed out, wiping her wind-blown hair away from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, \u0027cause let\u0027s not forget that I could\u0027ve fucked you.\" Positioning his hand on the wall above her, he pressed his entire body against hers. She brought her hands up against his chest and tried to push him away, but his strength overpowered hers. Grazing his lips against her ear, he drew his words out in a slow, hot whisper. \"I could\u0027ve fucked you over...and over...and over again, and I could\u0027ve fucked you very well to be honest, but I stopped because that\u0027s not the way I want you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her chest heaving for air, her heart racing, and her panties saturated in desire, she looked away. \"Then what do you want from me, Gavin?\" she asked, her voice an aggravated whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her by the chin and made her look at him, his eyes - that light, wild blue - blazing into hers. \"Damn it, Emily. I want us! You belong with me, not him.\" He half snarled the declaration. \"Every part of you was made for me. Your lips were made to kiss mine, your eyes were made to wake up to me looking at you in my bed every morning, and your fucking tongue was made to roll my name off of it. I am more certain of us than I\u0027m certain that I require oxygen to breathe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a thief in the night, his words nearly stole her breath. She looked practically on the verge of tears and went to speak, but Gavin suddenly brought his hand up and cupped it over her mouth. He gave a quick shake of his head. At first, she didn\u0027t realize what he was doing, and then the sound of Dillon and Trevor\u0027s voices cut through their frantic breathing. With widened eyes, Emily\u0027s heart quickened as she stared at Gavin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, where is she?\" Dillon asked, his tone filled with anger and concern. \"And where the fuck is Gavin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few seconds went by before Trevor answered, and as fast as Emily\u0027s heart was pounding, she was sure Dillon could hear it. All Dillon had to do was round the corner of the terrace to find her and Gavin in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The room was too loud, and Gavin had to take a business call. He went upstairs to find somewhere quiet.\" Trevor cleared his throat a few times. \"Let\u0027s go back in, and I\u0027ll have Olivia check out the restrooms again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily heard Dillon let out a heavy breath, and then their footsteps receded back inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the oxygen redistributed itself back into her depleted lungs, Gavin slowly dragged his hand away from her mouth. Other than the distant sound of laughter and conversation from the party, deafening silence descended as they stared at one another. Emily pushed herself from the wall and started to walk away, but as soon as she did, Gavin called out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came to an abrupt stop but didn\u0027t turn to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly came up behind her, brushing his hands down her arms, his spoken words muffled into the crook of her neck. \"I\u0027d never hurt you, Emily. Stop fighting me. Stop fighting what you already know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his touch heady and intoxicating and her heart still slamming in her chest, she didn\u0027t turn around. She couldn\u0027t. On shaky legs, she made her way back into the party, the sudden need for absolute numbness overriding her thoughts. She gave the room a once over to make sure Dillon wasn\u0027t in her line of sight. As soon as she knew it was clear, she weaved through the guests, her mind racing a mile a minute with the fear that Dillon could\u0027ve caught them. Her body jerked with a surge of adrenaline when she felt a hand grab for her elbow, but the tension in her shoulders deflated when she turned to find it was Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with me,\" Olivia quickly said, leading her to the front of the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stepped outside, and Olivia handed her a bottle of aspirin. \"Tell Dillon you had a headache, and you sent the valet to bring the car around because you needed to get these from the glove compartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dillon has the valet ticket,\" Emily hastily whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia flashed a smile. \"Don\u0027t worry about it. I use to fuck around with him,\" she motioned over to a lanky valet attendant that was watching them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a half smirk, Emily flicked her eyes in his direction and then back to Olivia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Olivia chirped. \"It was my pre-women days, and he owed me a favor. I already talked to him, and he said he would back up the story if need be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded. \"Okay. This will work, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, your fiance,\" she replied, crinkling her nose, \"is definitely pissed, but yeah, the excuse should work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, they walked back into the party, and as soon as they did, Emily\u0027s gaze locked onto Gavin\u0027s. He was coming back in from the terrace, watching her as intently as she was watching him. He strolled over to Stephanie, reached for her hand, and spoke to her for a few minutes. With Stephanie on his arm, he started making his way through the crowd, heading straight in Emily\u0027s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia laughed, and Emily shot her a look. \"Well, you have to find the humor in all of this, chick.\" Olivia smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was far from humorous for Emily. It was painful, confusing, and drained her emotions dry, but before she could tell Olivia any of those things, Gavin and Stephanie approached them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore a smile on face, but a glimpse of pain was evident in his eyes. \"It\u0027s getting late, so we\u0027re gonna get going,\" he said as he looked at Emily. \"Just tell Dillon I\u0027ll talk to him during the week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded, wanting to somehow comfort him. After tonight, she felt they both might be going to bed, licking their wounds - at least she knew she would. \"I\u0027ll tell him,\" she answered, her voice just above a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was nice to meet you,\" Stephanie smiled. \"Again, congratulations to you and your fiance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Emily replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia leaned in to give Gavin a hug. When she released him, he cast one last weary look toward Emily, and without another word spoken, he and Stephanie walked out of the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it came without alcohol, Emily felt numb after he left. Pain and confusion continued to crush in around her for the remainder of the evening. Olivia was correct. Dillon bought into her story of needing a dose of aspirin for a headache, but that didn\u0027t make Emily feel any better. As she carried on conversations with guests, Gavin\u0027s words echoed through her head, burning a hole in her heart and taking the last piece of something away from her. Just a few months before, Emily had believed she was able to see through and peel away some of his many layers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, tonight, Gavin peeled away hers. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collide-collide-1/page-13.html","bookId":1865,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:42:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:42:35 PM"}
