{"id":31750,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. THE WAR BEGINS.","content":"No President ever assumed office under such circumstances as Abraham Lincoln. Nominally chief magistrate of the whole United States, seven members of the confederation had already seceded. These were South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Louisiana. Some had been hurried out of the union by a few hot-headed politicians, against the wishes of a considerable part of their inhabitants. It is known that General Lee and Alexander H. Stephens, though they ultimately went with their States, were exceedingly reluctant to array themselves in opposition to the Government.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Stephens used these patriotic words in an address before the Legislature of Georgia, Nov. 14, 1860, after the result of the election was made known: “The first question that presents itself{209} is, shall the people of the South secede from the union in consequence of the election of Mr. Lincoln to the Presidency of the United States? My countrymen, I tell you candidly, frankly, and earnestly that I do not think that they ought. In my judgment the election of no man, constitutionally chosen to that high office, is sufficient cause for any State to separate from the union. It ought to stand by and aid still in maintaining the Constitution of the country. To make a point of resistance to the Government, to withdraw from it because a man has been constitutionally elected, puts us in the wrong.... We went into the election with this people. The result was different from what we wished; but the election has been constitutionally held. Were we to make a point of resistance to the Government, and go out of the union on this account, the record would be made up hereafter against us.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These wise and moderate counsels did not prevail. There was a feeling of bitterness which impelled Southern men to extreme measures. More over, the temper and firmness of the North were misunderstood. It was thought they would make the most humiliating concessions to preserve the{210} integrity of the union, while on the other hand the constancy and determination of the Southern people were not sufficiently appreciated at the North.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Lincoln’s first necessary act was to make choice of a Cabinet. He demonstrated his sagacity in surrounding himself with trained and experienced statesmen, as will be seen at once by the following list:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Secretary of State, William H. Seward, of New York; Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio; Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania; Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, of Connecticut; Secretary of the Interior, Caleb B. Smith, of Indiana; Postmaster-General, Montgomery Blair, of Maryland; Attorney-General, Edward Bates, of Missouri.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These gentlemen were confirmed, and entered upon the discharge of their duties. Thus the new Administration was complete. Simon Cameron, as Secretary of War, was superseded in less than a year by Edwin M. Stanton, who proved to be the right man in the right place. A man of remarkable executive talent, never shrinking from the heavy burden of labor and care which{211} his office imposed, he worked indefatigably, and though he may have offended some by his brusque manners, and unnecessary sternness, it is doubtful whether a better man could have been selected for his post. He had been a member of Mr. Buchanan’s Cabinet in its last days, and did what he could to infuse something of his own vigor into the timid and vacillating Executive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It will be seen that Mr. Lincoln called to the most important place in the Cabinet the man who was his most prominent rival for the nomination, William H. Seward. In doing this he strengthened his administration largely in the minds of the people at large, for who was there who was ignorant of Mr. Seward’s great ability and statesmanship? It may be remarked here that the new President left to each of his Secretaries large discretion in their respective departments, and did not interfere with or overrule them except in cases of extreme necessity. A man of smaller nature would have gratified his vanity and sense of importance by meddling with, and so marring the work of his constitutional advisers; but having selected the best men he could find, Mr. Lincoln left them free to act, and held them responsible{212} for the successful management of their departments.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The new President was not long left in uncertainty as to the intentions of the seceding States. On the 13th of March he received a communication from two gentlemen, claiming to be commissioners from a government composed of the seven seceding States, expressing a desire to enter upon negotiations for the adjustment of all questions growing out of the separation. To have received them would have been to admit the fact and right of secession, and therefore their request was denied. On the 11th of April, General Beauregard, in accordance with instructions from the rebel Secretary of War, demanded of Major Anderson, in command at Fort Sumter, the surrender of the fort. Major Anderson declined, but was compelled to do so on the morning of the 4th, after a bombardment of thirty-three hours. Thus the South had taken the initiative, and had made an armed attack upon the Government. Thus far the President had pursued a conciliatory—some thought it a timid—policy, but when he heard that Sumter had been taken forcible possession of by rebellious citizens, he felt that{213} there was no more room for hesitation. The time had come to act.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the day succeeding the evacuation of the fort, he issued a proclamation calling for 75,000 soldiers to recover possession of the “forts, places, and property which have been seized from the union,” and at the same time summoned an extra session of both Houses of Congress, to assemble on Thursday, the fourth day of July, “to consider and determine such measures as, in their wisdom, the public safety and interest may seem to demand.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is needless to say that the evacuation of Fort Sumter, and the President’s proclamation, created a whirlwind of excitement. The South was jubilant, the North was deeply stirred, and the proclamation was generally approved and promptly responded to. These spirited lines of the poet Whittier are well called\n\u003cbr\u003e THE VOICE OF THE NORTH.\n\u003cbr\u003e Up the hill-side, down the glen\n\u003cbr\u003e Rouse the sleeping citizen;\n\u003cbr\u003e Summon out the might of men!\n\u003cbr\u003e Like a lion growling low—\n\u003cbr\u003e Like a night-storm rising slow—\n\u003cbr\u003e Like the tread of unseen foe—{214}\n\u003cbr\u003e It is coming—it is nigh!\n\u003cbr\u003e Stand your homes and altars by,\n\u003cbr\u003e On your own free threshold die!\n\u003cbr\u003e Clang the bells in all your spires,\n\u003cbr\u003e On the grey hills of your sires\n\u003cbr\u003e Fling to heaven your signal fires!\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh! for God and duty stand,\n\u003cbr\u003e Heart to heart, and hand to hand,\n\u003cbr\u003e Round the old graves of the land.\n\u003cbr\u003e Who so shrinks or falters now,\n\u003cbr\u003e Who so to the yoke would bow,\n\u003cbr\u003e Brand the craven on his brow.\n\u003cbr\u003e Freedom’s soil has only place\n\u003cbr\u003e For a free and fearless race—\n\u003cbr\u003e None for traitors false and base.\n\u003cbr\u003e Perish party—perish clan,\n\u003cbr\u003e Strike together while you can,\n\u003cbr\u003e Like the strong arm of one man.\n\u003cbr\u003e Like the angel’s voice sublime,\n\u003cbr\u003e Heard above a world of crime,\n\u003cbr\u003e Crying for the end of Time.\n\u003cbr\u003e With one heart and with one mouth\n\u003cbr\u003e Let the North speak to the South;\n\u003cbr\u003e Speak the word befitting both.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In contrast with this, I will cite a poem, which might be called, not inappropriately,{215}\n\u003cbr\u003e THE VOICE OF THE SOUTH.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rebels! ’tis a holy name!\n\u003cbr\u003e The name our fathers bore,\n\u003cbr\u003e When battling in the cause of Right\n\u003cbr\u003e Against the tyrant in his might,\n\u003cbr\u003e In the dark days of yore.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rebels! ’tis our family name!\n\u003cbr\u003e Our father, Washington,\n\u003cbr\u003e Was the arch rebel in the fight,\n\u003cbr\u003e And gave the name to us—aright\n\u003cbr\u003e Of father unto son.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rebels! ’tis our given name!\n\u003cbr\u003e Our mother Liberty\n\u003cbr\u003e Received the title with her fame,\n\u003cbr\u003e In days of grief, of fear and shame,\n\u003cbr\u003e When at her breast were we.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rebels! ’tis our sealed name!\n\u003cbr\u003e A baptism of blood!\n\u003cbr\u003e The war—ay, and the din of strife—\n\u003cbr\u003e The fearful contest, life for life—\n\u003cbr\u003e The mingled crimson flood!\n\u003cbr\u003e Rebels! ’tis a patriot’s name!\n\u003cbr\u003e In struggles it was given;\n\u003cbr\u003e We bore it then when tyrants raved,\n\u003cbr\u003e And through their curses ’twas engraved\n\u003cbr\u003e On the doomsday book of heaven.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rebels! ’tis our fighting name!\n\u003cbr\u003e For peace rules o’er the land,{216}\n\u003cbr\u003e Until they speak of craven woe—\n\u003cbr\u003e Until our rights received a blow,\n\u003cbr\u003e From foes’ or brother’s hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rebels! ’tis our dying name!\n\u003cbr\u003e For although life is dear,\n\u003cbr\u003e Yet freemen born and freemen bred,\n\u003cbr\u003e We’d rather live as freemen dead\n\u003cbr\u003e Than live in slavish fear.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then call us Rebels if you will—\n\u003cbr\u003e We glory in the name;\n\u003cbr\u003e For bending under unjust laws,\n\u003cbr\u003e And swearing faith to an unjust cause.\n\u003cbr\u003e We count a greater shame.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1558/46186.html","bookId":1279,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:37:17 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:37:17 AM"}
