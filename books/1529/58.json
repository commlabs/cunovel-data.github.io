Not until Nasser was face-to-face with him and supplied concrete evidence that his parents were released and safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they had agreed to rendezvous here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInformation for his parents\u0027 freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Gray was no fool. He knew Nasser would never release his parents. This was all a trap by Nasser—and a pure delaying tactic by Gray. Both men knew this. Still, they had no choice but to continue this dance of deceptions. All Gray could do was keep Nasser strung along, to keep hanging that carrot in front of him, in order to buy Director Crowe as much time as possible to find his mother and father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had risked a short call Stateside after hanging up with Nasser, using Seichan\u0027s disposable phone. Fearing that Nasser might quickly tap the cell towers in the remote region, Gray had to keep their talk short as he updated Painter. The director had only grim news in return. Sigma had no new leads on his parents, and there continued to be no word on Monk and Lisa\u0027s whereabouts. Gray had heard the frustration and fury in the man\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdd raw terror to the mix, and it matched Gray\u0027s mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter had again offered to send assets to support Gray out here, but until his parents were safe and secure, he dared not accept them. As Seichan had warned, this was Guild home turf. Any mobilization would only reveal that Gray was still secretly in communication with Washington. It was a small advantage, but one Gray did not want to risk losing. But more importantly, if Nasser got a whiff that a line of communication was open between Gray and Sigma command, he would immediately kill his parents. Gray needed Nasser to feel fully confident that his team was cut off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Gray had taken one small risk and had asked for a tiny concession from Painter. Afterward, with the matter settled, all Gray had to do was keep extending that time frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still had another two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator door chimed open behind him. He heard the old wrought-iron door ratchet back. \"I see you all arrived safely,\" a voice spoke calmly behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser stepped out of the cage and into the lobby, dressed in a dark suit, no tie. \"It looks like we can get this meeting started early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen in khaki uniforms and black berets appeared from the halls to either side. Behind him, Gray heard the pound of boots on the porch outside. A score more soldiers clambered down the curved stairs ahead. Though no weapons were in sight, Gray did not doubt they were all armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKowalski must have sensed this, too. He already had his hands in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan merely shook her head. \"There goes my hot bath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stepped back to Gray\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNasser joined them. \"So it is time to discuss this cure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:18 p.m. Washington, D.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From what you just told me,\" Dr. Malcolm Jennings said, \"Gray has nothing to offer the Guild. Nothing of real value.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter listened quietly, letting the man run through his thought processes. He had summoned Jennings, the head of Sigma\u0027s research-and-development department, up to his office to get his input. Luckily, Jennings had already been on his way up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the details in Marco\u0027s story,\" Jennings said, pacing in front of Gray\u0027s desk, \"Polo and a handful of others were protected against the Judas Strain by consuming blood and sweetmeat, a delicacy derived from the thymus gland. And according to the story, the blood and gland were harvested out of another man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Basically cannibalism.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or as Gray had read into the text—and I believe he\u0027s correct—it could represent a crude form of vaccination. The thymus gland is a major source of white blood cells, the body\u0027s cellular defense against disease. And the blood is a major way antibodies against infections are distributed. By consuming such tissue, you could theoretically confer the equivalent of an immunization.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter agreed. \"That\u0027s what Gray believes protected Polo\u0027s companions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But such a revelation is meaningless,\" Jennings argued. \"It offers no real cure. Where did the blood and gland come from? Not from one of the sick. You\u0027d just get infected. There is a missing piece of this puzzle. For such a cure to work, you\u0027d need to harvest cells and antibodies from someone cured, someone who survived the Judas Strain. It\u0027s just circuitous logic. It takes a cure to find a cure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter sighed. \"And you can\u0027t think of anything in the story that might offer some elaboration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor slowly shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Painter feared, Gray was running a dangerous bluff. Amen Nasser was not a fool. The bastard would also recognize the lack of any real answer. All Gray\u0027s bluff could hope to achieve was to buy time. And with the trail gone cold after the raid on the butcher shop, it seemed a wasted effort, a needless risk. Painter had hoped Jennings might have some new insight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no such luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter resigned himself. \"So it seems Marco\u0027s story leads to a dead end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not necessarily.\" Jennings waited a breath. \"Director, there is something else I wanted to discuss. It was why I was headed up here. It may even relate to this topic. In fact, if you have an extra minute, perhaps you\u0027d better see this for yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter truly didn\u0027t have that extra minute. He stared at the pile of papers in front of him, a plethora of reports. Down the hall, Monk\u0027s wife, Kat, had taken over minding the satellite recon of the Indonesian islands. With her background in the intelligence services, Kat had proved skilled at enlisting foreign aid and orchestrating cross-satellite platform surveys. But still, hampered by the local storm, they\u0027d had no success locating the cruise ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxious and short-wired, Painter wanted to get back down there himself. But he trusted Jennings not to waste his time with trivialities. \"What do you want me to see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennings waved to one of the office\u0027s plasma wall monitors. \"I\u0027d like to conference with Richard Graff in Australia. He\u0027s expecting my call, if you\u0027re willing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Graff?\" Painter asked. \"The researcher who had been working with Monk at Christmas Island?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Dr. Graff who had radioed a tanker passing Christmas Island and had alerted the world about the hijacking of the cruise ship. The oceanogra-pher was currently sequestered and quarantined in Perth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve read his debriefing with Australian authorities?\" Jennings asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there is something odd that the researcher has discovered since then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter waved to the monitor. \"Okay. Show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennings came around his desk and quickly established a live conference feed. \"Here we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitor went dark, flickered, then a jittery image of the scientist appeared. Dr. Graff wore blue hospital scrubs and his arm was in a sling. He blinked behind his glasses at Painter and Jennings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntroductions were made—though Jennings passed themselves off as researchers associated with the Smithsonian Institution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you demonstrate what you found?\" Jennings asked. \"What you showed me earlier? I think my colleague should see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 have the specimen waiting right here.\" Graff slipped offscreen. The camera angle widened and shifted to reveal a white conference table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff reappeared, carrying a large red object in one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a crab?\" Painter asked, sitting straighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Geocarcoidea natalis, \"Jennings explained. \"The Christmas Island red land crab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen, Graff nodded and settled the crab to the tabletop. Its large pincer claws were rubber-banded closed. \"The little bugger—or rather a horde of them—helped save my life back on the island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurious, Painter stood up and approached the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff put the crab on the table and released it. It immediately scrabbled across the surface, aiming in a determined straight line. Graff hurried around to the table\u0027s far side to catch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter shook his head. \"1 don\u0027t understand. What are you trying to show me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff explained. \"Dr. Kokkalis and I found it strange that these crabs were not killed off by the toxic exposure, but their behavior certainly was affected. They were attacking and tearing each other apart. So I had hoped to study the behavior to see if it offered any insight into the toxicity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile narrating, Graff had settled the crab twice more to the table, but no matter where he placed it, no matter which way he faced the creature, the determined crustacean would turn and make a beeline, hitting the same corner of the table before almost toppling off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe demonstrated it a few more times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff explained his supposition. \"The Christmas Island land crab has a finely attuned nervous system that guides its annual migration pattern. Most crustaceans do. But the toxic exposure seems to have rewired the crab\u0027s nervous system, turned it into the equivalent of a fixed compass. The crab always crawls in the same direction, the same compass heading.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraff collected his crab and deposited it in a tank. \"Once things calm down over at the island,\" he finished, \"I\u0027d like to test other crabs to see if they are similarly rewired to the same setting. It\u0027s a fascinating study. I would be happy to write up that grant proposal you mentioned earlier, Dr. Jennings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It certainly is an intriguing anomaly, Dr. Graff,\" Jennings said. \"My colleague and I will consult and get back to you. I appreciate your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call was disconnected, and the screen went blank. But Jennings continued typing at Painter\u0027s computer station. A new image appeared on the plasma screen, fed from the computer, a globe of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I heard about this anomaly,\" Jennings said, \"I went ahead and collated Dr. Graff\u0027s data and tracked the crab\u0027s trajectory.\" A dotted line appeared encircling the globe. \"I didn\u0027t think my results proved anything until you sent down the update from Commander Pierce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe globe spun and zoomed large on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter leaned in close. The view swelled with the image of Southeast Asia. The dotted line traversed Indonesia, spanned the Gulf of Thailand, and ran straight across Cambodia. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-58.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
