Is it Joe? The EPs are hoping we lead them to the well. He looked blankly at the open wiring before him. Then why set off a tracer now? To test our alertness? The obvious time for a signal will be when we\u0027re sitting on top of the well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange vibration inside his head distracted Sparrow. He was startled to discover he\u0027d been grinding his teeth. When we\u0027re sitting on the well! God help me! How will I prevent it? I can\u0027t remain awake the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the last one,\" said Garcia. He indicated a tube which Sparrow had automatically placed in the balance scales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow shuddered, drew himself back to the present. \"Put it back,\" he said. Garcia complied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow looked at Bonnett. \"Les, start checking the spares in E-stores.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" said Bonnett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow spoke to Garcia: \"Stay on watch here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia nodded. \"Are you going to rest, Skipper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow shook his head from side to side. \"No. No, I have to go back to the shack and help Ram --\" He stopped, glanced at Garcia. \"We\u0027ve engaged the enemy and come through.\" Sparrow stepped to the door leading aft. \"I\u0027m going to help Johnny check out the tubes in the shack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about that?\" Garcia indicated the tube Bonnett had left in the tray of his tool box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow returned, picked up the tube, went back to the door, examining the tube. \"We\u0027ll have a look. Maybe it\u0027ll tell us something.\" He glanced at Garcia. \"You be thinking about how we can contact base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was gone through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia clenched his fists, turned to face the master board. His gaze fell on the sonoran chart and its marker: a red insect creeping across vastness. Where? Where\u0027s the well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey looked up from his instruments as Sparrow entered. \"Anything new, Skipper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Les found this.\" Sparrow placed the tube on the felt padding of Ramsey\u0027s bench. \"It\u0027s five ounces over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey looked at the tube without touching it. \"Has it occurred to you that thing could be set to explode on tampering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of the old Salem sea captains used to attend their own funerals before embarking,\" said Sparrow. \"Figuratively, I\u0027m in the same frame of mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I mean,\" said Ramsey. \"A half ounce of nitrox could get us both. Maybe you\u0027d better leave me alone with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow frowned, shrugged. He thumbed his chest mike: \"Joe, Les -- hear this. This tube may be booby-trapped. If anything happens to Johnny and me, you two drop the tow and head for home. That\u0027s an order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnny! thought Ramsey. He called me Johnny! And then he remembered: We\u0027ve met the enemy. The old magic is dead. Enter the new magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll want a record of this,\" said Sparrow. He took a camera from a drawer, racked it above the bench, focused it. \"Okay,\" he said. \"You\u0027re the expert on these gadgets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey spoke without looking up from the tube: \"A half hour of just looking at this thing, studying all the angles, could mean the difference between success and failure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re we looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t really know. Something different. Something that hits a sour note.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow bent over the bench, grabbed a handhold as the Ram\u0027s deck slanted to the upflow of an undersea current. Ramsey steadied the tube with one hand, brought up folds of the felt padding to keep the tube from rolling. The amber light of the temperature-gadget indicator on the board ahead of them flashed off, on, off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey switched on the thermo repeater above the light: thirty-four degrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow nodded at the repeater. \"The Arctic bottom drift. It\u0027s full of food. There\u0027ll be a sonic curtain of sea life above us.\" He smiled. \"We can breathe a bit easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey shook his head. \"Not with that thing to solve.\" He stared at the tube on the bench. \"If you were going to trigger that to explode, how would you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A tiny wire maybe. Break it and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" said Ramsey. \"A better way would be to set a trigger keyed to pressure change -- if the vacuum breaks . . .\" He straightened. \"First some infra and X pictures. Then we\u0027ll rig a vacuum jar with remote controls, handle the tube in the vacuum. After that we\u0027ll break the seal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow touched the tube with one long finger of his left hand. \"Looks like standard heavy-pressure glass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand something,\" said Ramsey. He spoke as he worked, setting up the portable infra camera on the bench. \"Why did this thing start when it did? That wasn\u0027t smart. The clever thing would\u0027ve been to wait until we reached the well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My idea exactly,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey focused the camera. \"How much longer until we reach it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe casual way of the question caught Sparrow off balance. He looked up to the shack-room sonoran chart, started to say, \"Well, it\u0027s on the flank of --\" He froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey made an exposure, turned the tube to a new angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s too casual, thought Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were saying.\" Ramsey spoke without looking up from the tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Ramsey, a subtug\u0027s destination is known only to its commander until the immediate area of that destination is reached.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey straightened. \"That\u0027s a stupid order. If something happened to you we couldn\u0027t go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you suggesting I should confide our destination in you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey hesitated, thought: I already know it. What would happen if I indicated that to Sparrow? That\u0027d confirm his opinion that I\u0027m Security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skipper, I asked you a civil question. Phrased a bit loosely, perhaps. What I want to know is how much longer until we reach Novaya Zemlya?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow held himself in rigid control, thinking: Security? A spy trying to draw me out with a clever guess? He said, \"I don\u0027t see where it\u0027s your concern how long it takes us to get anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey returned his attention to the tube. Is he convinced that I\u0027m a Security officer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could ask him for the exact coordinates, thought Sparrow. But would it prove anything if he doesn\u0027t know them? Or if he does know them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey set up a bell jar and vacuum pump, the tube resting on the black mastic sealer inside the jar. He removed the jar, arranged a small remote-control console, replaced the jar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow watched carefully, still undecided about Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is going to be slow,\" said Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord in heaven, if I only knew! thought Sparrow. Is he a spy? How can I tell? He doesn\u0027t really act like one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey locked a stool in place before the bench, sat down. \"Slow and easy,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow studied him. It could be a clever act. I\u0027ll get busy checking the shack tubes, watch him. He said, \"I\u0027ll start checking out your tubes.\" He removed a cover plate at the left, found scales, began removing tubes, weighing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes ticked away -- an hour, two hours . . . two hours and forty minutes. Inside the bell jar, the parts of the tube were laid out in rows. Sparrow long since had finished his job, was watching the work at the bench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No booby trap,\" said Ramsey. He activated a magnet arm inside the jar, lifted a grid section. \"And I still don\u0027t see how they rigged this thing to go off. This looks like standard stuff.\" He rotated the part on the magnet. \"There\u0027s nothing arranged to fuse with an overload. Nothing extra at all except that micro-vibrator and its capacitor power source.\" He replaced the grid section. \"Our boys are going to want to see that.\" He picked up a cathode segment, turned it over, set it down. \"No trigger. How was it done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow looked to the camera which had been capturing every movement of the examination, turned back to Ramsey. \"We have another problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" Ramsey straightened, rubbed the small of his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow slid off his stool. \"How\u0027re we going to get word of this back to base? If the EPs get us, the things we\u0027ve discovered are lost. But I have an iron-clad order against breaking radio silence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey stretched his back. \"Do you trust me, Skipper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could stop himself, Sparrow said, \"No.\" He frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey grinned. \"I\u0027m still the one with the solution to your problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put the whole story onto a squirt repeater and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Squirt repeater?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey bit his lip, coughed. Damn! Another BuPsych-Security secret. It had slipped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never heard of a squirt repeater,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s something new in . . . uh . . . electronics. You code a message onto ultra-stable slow tape, then speed up the tape. You set the message to repeat -- over and over -- a little squirt of sound. It\u0027s recorded at the receiver end, slowed for playback and translation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s still breaking radio silence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey shook his head. \"Not if the message is broadcast by a little set in a floater rigged to start transmitting long after we\u0027ve gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow\u0027s jaw fell. He snapped his mouth shut. Then: \"Could you rig it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey looked around him. \"We have all the essentials right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow said, \"I\u0027ll send Garcia in to help you.\" Ramsey said, \"I won\u0027t need any help with --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll help you anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Ramsey grinned. \"That\u0027s right. You don\u0027t trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of himself, Sparrow grinned back at the amusement in Ramsey\u0027s face; then wiped the grin from his features and from his thoughts. His brows drew together. Is this all an act on Ramsey\u0027s part? he wondered. Amuse me. Throw me off guard. It could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey glanced at the wall chrono. \"My watch.\" He indicated the parts in the bell jar. \"This\u0027ll keep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stand your watch,\" said Sparrow. He thumbed his chest mike. \"Joe, come to the shack. Johnny\u0027s figured out how to get a message to home base. I want you to help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This shouldn\u0027t take more than a couple of hours,\" said Ramsey. \"It\u0027s really a simple rig. I\u0027ll report in as soon as we\u0027ve finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow pursed his lips in thought, stared solemnly at Ramsey. \"There\u0027s something else. I\u0027m instituting a new watch procedure: two men on duty at all times, never to leave actual sight of each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey\u0027s eyes widened. \"There are only four of us, Skipper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be rough,\" said Sparrow. \"Well stagger the watches, change the second man in mid-watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" said Ramsey. \"It\u0027ll be more than rough. There are only four of us. Isolated. Under your plan, well obviously be watching each other. When you watch another man it tends to make you suspicious. Suspicion sets up a paranoiac situation where --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your reluctance to accept an order for the general safety is being noted and will be entered in the log,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey\u0027s face took on a look of watchful remoteness. He thought: Take it easy. This is the paranoiac leaning that Obe mentioned. He said, \"Efficiency will suffer if we\u0027re --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m still the captain of this vessel,\" said Sparrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Captain,\" said Ramsey. He made the title sound faintly reproachful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSparrow\u0027s lips thinned. He whirled, left the shack, hurried aft to his quarters, bolted the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down on his bunk, swung the folding desk into position. The faint whispering of the induction drive resonated through the wall behind him. The Ram had an uncertain, shifting motion; the bottom turbulence of the Arctic Current.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought: We\u0027ve a spy aboard. It\u0027s obvious someone activated that spy beam. I wish I\u0027d had Joe checking Ramsey when he opened that tube. He says there was no internal trigger system in the thing, but he could\u0027ve hidden something from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a recess in his desk, Sparrow removed his private log, opened it to a clean page, smoothed the log flat. He took his pen and, in a neat cramped hand, wrote the date, then: \"This date Ensign John Ramsey made objection to a Security procedure designed to . . .\" He paused, remembering that he\u0027d ordered Garcia to the shack. He thumbed the switch on his chest mike: \"Joe, are you in the shack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia\u0027s voice came out of the wall speaker. \"Righto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just checking,\" said Sparrow. \"Would you have a look at that spy beam, see if there\u0027s anything about it we may have missed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Righto, Skipper. Been doing just that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all,\" said Sparrow. He turned back to his log.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the shack, Garcia looked up from the bell jar. \"You\u0027re dead right, Johnny-O. No trigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that thing look like to you?\" asked Ramsey. \"Only one thing it could be,\" said Garcia. \"A relay amplifier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey nodded. \"Right. The actual signal\u0027s coming from someplace else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027d have to be close,\" said Garcia. \"Just giving you a free-hand estimated-type guess, I\u0027d say within ten feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey rubbed the back of his neck. \"What\u0027re you wearing a phone for?\" asked Garcia. He nodded toward the monitor phone in Ramsey\u0027s left ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monitor on the seismo,\" said Ramsey. \"If another spy beam goes off --\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dragon-in-the-sea/page-10.html","bookId":2676,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:59 AM"}
