Weren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope she isn’t going to run off,” the twin said, casting his brother a look I couldn’t decode and probably didn’t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not often that I’m with such beautiful company.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I seriously doubt that,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter replied dryly, and I had to agree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twin smiled. “But still…not beautiful company like her.” He didn’t elaborate on what that meant as he extended a hand. “My name is ridiculously unpronounceable, like Hunter’s real name, but most call me Sin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hunter’s not your real name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Sin’s eyes went wide. “She didn’t know?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Serena, there is so much I could tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe muscle in Hunter’s cheek went crazy. “That is the only name I answer to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze dropped to Sin’s still outstretched hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuman manners dictated that I take his offer, but I had to force my hand toward his. When his fingers wrapped around mine, a small charge passed between us. Out of the corner of my eyes, I saw Hunter move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother let go, his fingers gliding over my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin turned to his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So this is why you’ve been too busy to call, email, or even write?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter now stood off to the side of me and folded his arms across his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I haven’t wanted to get in contact with you. And right now, I’m really not feeling up to this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ouch.” Sin didn’t look affected at all. He sat on the edge of the couch, stretching out long legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze flickered between the two of us before finally leveling on his brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look a little pale, Hunter. Have you been taking care of yourself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEating well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of feeling like I was being visually molested by Sin, I so knew what he was referencing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter’s spine stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s enough, Sin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled as he glanced at me. “My brother is a prickly bastard, isn’t he? It’s all about the diet, I keep telling him. If he… fed better, he’d be in a better mood. What do they say about food?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are what you eat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suggested, brows rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah! Yes.” Sin clapped his hands down on his thighs. “You are what you eat, Hunter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter unfolded his arms slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin arched a brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you heard from Lore at all? I can’t seem to… find him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lore?” I asked before I could stop myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lore is our brother,” Sin replied. “We’re triplets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I only have one brother that I claim.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure everyone here can guess which brother that isn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep, I had a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the silence that followed, something passed between the two brothers. I didn’t know what, but I had the distinct feeling that they were seconds away from ripping into each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin’s smile didn’t slip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps we should continue this conversation outside? It’s such a lovely day for a walk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like it was about to start raining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter nodded curtly. “I agree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth brothers headed toward the door, but Hunter stopped, sending me a long look that promised trouble later. I wasn’t concerned with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I wondered if either of them would return from their “walk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside in the damp morning air and among the ancient trees, I glared at the back of my brother’s head. Of all the moments for Sin to decide to show up, it had to be now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin tipped his head back and laughed. “That’s a pretty little piece of ass you got there. Are you sharing—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snapped my brother’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like that—two hands on either side of the head and then twist, crack, crackle, pop, and all that jazz. Sin hit the ground, reduced to nothing more than a twitching heap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the few blissful seconds of silence, I leaned against the tree, and while I waited, I tried to remember the exact number of times I’d broken Sin’s neck. Twenty or more? Definitely more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin’s body began to blur and darken as it lost all shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark essence swirled over the ground, rising up. Thick tendrils of smoke spread out, reaching the lower branches. As they came into contact, the leaves withered to a lifeless brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShow-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hazy smoke receded, revealing my brother’s true form for a moment. As Sin turned, the liquidlike movement hid the predator beneath the grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Sin slipped into his human skin. “What. The.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. Hunter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t help myself whenever I’m around you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like a habit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, break the fucking habit, because that hurts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus.” Sin took a step back, straightening his shirt. “If you weren’t my brother…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d what? Annoy me to death?” I pushed off the tree, getting right up in his face. “Or do you think you can actually take me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin laughed. “Do you think you can take me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t feed on Luxen anymore. You are weak. I could kick your ass clear across this godforsaken planet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, is that what you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s what I know. You’ve become nothing but the DOD’s little bitch boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoing their favors while the Luxen continue to thrive! Is that why that woman’s in your cabin? I bet it does have something to do with them. The DOD says jump and what does Hunter say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted halfway, laughing under my breath, and then whirled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing Sin by the neck, I flipped him over. His heavy body hit the tree with such force several branches fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flew into Sin’s face, digging my fingers deep into his throat. “Hunter says kiss my ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin held up his hands, choking out a laugh. “Oh, so Hunter has fed recently, hasn’t he? I doubt that female could give you that kind of power. If so, can I have a taste—just a little, and while I’m at it, can I fuck her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slammed Sin’s head back against the tree hard enough to crack a skull, but my goddamn brother just laughed. “You never knew when to shut up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you never had the balls to do what’s right,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin spat back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting go, I took a step back before I did something I regretted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were times when I wanted to kill my brother— this was one of them—but Sin was my family. We shared the same blood, the same history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It has nothing to do with balls,” I said. “Our sister is dead because of this war —no, don’t you fucking look away from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sin did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShooting forward, I grasped his chin, forcing Sin to look at me. “Our sister is dead. Lore almost died because of a war our ancestors fought—a war that no one will win, especially not here, not on this planet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will win.” Rage filled Sin’s eyes. “We will pay them back tenfold for what they did to our people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, you do that.” I let him go. “You and every other Arum out there that wants to avenge their fallen ancestors are going to get yourselves killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe some other planet, but here, with the humans, you’ll lose, because they will support the Luxen— they already are. They will follow right behind them, right to their deaths. And in the meantime, they’ll help the Luxen exterminate every one of us. So screw me that I’m not drinking that bullshit Kool-Aid anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgust filled Sin’s expression. “How dare you turn your back on us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This has nothing to do with us, Sin. This has to do with our family. I’m not going to bury another sibling for a cause they had no part in!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we do have a part in it, Hunter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were created to do what we are trying to do. Born and raised to destroy the Luxen. We’re the only thing that can stop them from dominating another world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat part was true, but everything else was full of so much shit that I needed a damn shovel. “So what do you think we should do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet the Luxen be? Just let it all go?” My brother’s lip curled in disgust. “Hell, soon you’ll think it’s okay to mix the two races.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was just being stupid. “I’m not saying that we should hold hands and sing Kumbay-fucking-ya with them. I’m not saying they should even be hands off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what are you saying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m saying move on. Let it go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked. “Like you and Lore have. Where is Lore by the way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t want anything to do with you, Sin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin turned his cheek, pressing his lips together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I know what the problem is with you two. I think you both are scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m too old to be goaded into that shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and Lore,” Sin continued, swaggering up to me. “Fucking pussies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirked. “Rather be fucking pussies…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Funny. You tell Lore he can’t hide from me forever and, just like you, he needs to face his duty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger rippled over me so deep and so hot that it was hard to hold my human form. “It’s not my duty or his to fight a war we don’t even believe in.” I paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take care of yourself, but get lost. I really don’t have the time for this shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSin’s eyes darkened until they were nothing but pitch-black pupils. “Sooner or later, you’re going to need to get back into the game, brother. And if anything or anyone is preventing you from making the right decision, I will personally, happily, remove that obstacle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you threatening me or what is mine?” Whoa, wait. Did I just say mine?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck it. “Sin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother’s gaze slid beyond me to the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are some obstacles I’ll have a hell of a lot more fun removing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Sin slinked off, I had traveled the heavily wooded area around the community in my true form for hours, until night had fallen, making sure Sin had left the region. He hadn’t left immediately. Oh fuck no, the bastard lingered, testing me. He’d kept circling back near the cabin, near Serena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat in the fuckadeefuck had I meant by that? Mine? I stamped a claim on her after coming within seconds of killing her last night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmooth. That wasn’t even the most fucked-up part. It was the fact that it felt right. Like not taking the shit back kind of right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeird. I knew I needed to stay away from her, but I didn’t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also knew I wouldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps I just needed to get her out of my system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScratch that itch and what not. I just needed to do it without killing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I returned to the cabin, I found Serena waiting on the couch. She jumped to her feet when she spotted me in the doorway. “Okay. Before you start yelling at me, I just want to say that I thought you were dead. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-24.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
