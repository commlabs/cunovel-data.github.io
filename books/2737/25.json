People heal better when they’re in their loved ones’ arms. The baby will love it, won’t you, you adorable little baby?” she coos stupidly down at my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBiting back a laugh, I shove her away, but she’s right, I’m pretty sure the baby will love it. Already I feel invigorated, and I don’t really think the baby has been having fun with me in my current sorry state. I am in love with a complicated man, and he makes me feel complicated feelings. I have run it over in my head a thousand times, and I don’t give a rat’s ass if he doesn’t want me there. I am going to go see my man. Period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think?” I ask Melanie as I adjust my shoulder-length blond wig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awesome. You look cheapish. Now let me paint you.” She smears a makeup cake on me while the prospect of seeing him makes my heart wham excitedly into my rib cage. “Mel, my pores are drowning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tut-tut! Hush! Now me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eye myself in the mirror as she does her own face. “Okay, I look like a prostitute. They’re going to ask us how much we charge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ding-dong, we have to make you not look like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you still look hotter! You’re a hot grandma—why can’t I be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I’m the one who can still walk, and you’re the one in the chair.” She pushes me closer to the mirror and we look at ourselves in our floral dresses. Mel added a little cashmere sweater to hers and a flower to her gray-and-white wig, while my blond wig has an Alice-in-Wonderland black headband holding the hair in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look completely unlike me, and if I added the big glasses we got, I would look even doubly less like me, but they’re so big and disturbing to wear, I tuck them into my dress pocket as we head out to the elevator. “I don’t want to distract him, all right? Remy can’t see that I’m there. He might get angry. I don’t even know what he’ll do—he’s too unpredictable. And we’ve never really fought without breaking up before, Mel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My darling chicken, judging by the roses he’s sent, he wants to make up. And don’t you worry! I will have you back here in an instant, and in the meantime we’re getting you out of this GODDAMNED ROOM! Woo-hoo!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY MINUTES LATER we discover that the Underground is not a handicap-friendly place. We learned this when Mel tried to get me out of the cab, then into the chair, then into the nightclub, down the elevator, and into the Underground. She’s huffing and puffing and telling me she doesn’t look all that cool anymore, “thanks to you, pregnant chick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d be laughing over how ridiculous she looks trying to get people to let us pass, but as we enter the crowded arena, it feels a little bit like coming home, and the mingled feelings of happiness and frustration over not being invited collide in me in a complicated little combo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is where I met him. Where I lost my heart in one breath. Where he fucked my name. Where he kissed my lips. Where he took the ring by storm, before he took me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter about a thousand “excuse me, sorry, coming through” notices, Melanie finally draws me up to our seats. I had to buy tickets with my own card and I splurged, so I got us front-row seats, although not exactly center. They’re good, and I’ll be able to devour every inch of my Riptide from up close. He’s not anxious to talk to me? Not anxious to see me? I’m dying for a mere glimpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember to look the part of an older woman, Mel,” I whisper as the first fighters of the evening start pounding each other’s faces in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That woman keeps following us,” Melanie says worriedly and points behind us, but I can’t even turn. “She’s like a she-male. A little scary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan the area for Pete and see him, and right next to him, in the seat I usually occupy, is my sister Nora, grinning and flirting with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow, Nora got Pete to get her a ticket?” Melanie says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know why, but seeing someone, anyone, even my sister, in my seat, sparks a thousand snakes of jealousy awake in me, and I am angry all over again. Not angry. Furious all over again over Remington telling me I couldn’t come here. Bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the ring is vacated and I think I see Riley starting to walk over to take his place near the corner of the ring, and my pulse skyrockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The last time he came to this arena, he gave us a record knockout and chased after one of our very own. . . .” The voice through the speakers flares, and the women scream and my heart just heats as I remember the way he came after me. “You know who I’m talking about. The MAN you are HERE to SEE! Say hello to the one, the only, Remington Tate, youuuuuuur Riiiptiiiiide!!!!!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie holds her breath, then murmurs, “Ohmifuckinggod, I see him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pulse has shot up to the ceiling as I strain to see a flash of red, trotting toward the ring, but I can’t see anything from this stupid chair. “I can’t see him!” And god, I hate that everyone can see him but me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, he’s coming to the ring! Some chicks are coming over, but he’s pushing through. He’s a god, Brooke. Oh my god . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I see him at last, and my heart literally stops and my stomach immediately constricts with emotion. I love him I hate him I love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe comes into my line of vision, a flash of red, and swings up into the ring, so lithe and muscled, so sleek and agile. The lights shine down on him as he gets rid of his red robe, and suddenly he’s there. So masculine and raw. Every woman’s fantasy and my real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will never forget the way he looks in his boxing attire, every muscle of his ripped torso hard and cut, tanned and glistening. I will never forget the way he smiles for his crowd. I. Am. Dying. He looks amazing. Perfect. Radiating male strength and vitality. Like he’s been on a fucking beach and I’ve been in hell. It even feels like all the lights above rush down to kiss his suntanned skin. His rock-hard arms spread out, muscles taut as he starts slowly turning around. The arena almost trembles under my wheels—the screams are deafening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck them over, Riptide!” people scream behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then fuck me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dimples flash for them, his eyes glint for them. He looks so blatantly happy I want to hit him. In fact, I want to go up there and crush his mouth with mine while I hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brooke, I feel like such a bad friend that I lust over your man, but please tell me you understand!” Melanie says anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groan in disgust at myself. I have been abandoned, and here I am, chasing after him like some groupie. Lusting after him because he is mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMINE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now, laaaadies and gentlemen, we welcome the Mother of All Monsters, Hector Hex, Herculeeeeeees!” the announcer cries, and Melanie mutters, “Hooooly shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment the Mother of Monsters takes the ring, I swear I almost see the floor caving in with his weight. I’ve never seen this one before, but he looks even bigger than Butcher, and the knot in my stomach tightens tenfold. The new fighter looks like some sort of Paul Bunyan–enormous giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What galaxy did that piece of meat come from?” Melanie asks, as perturbed as I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy taps boxing gloves with him, then he draws back and flexes his arm muscles, and I watch the tattoos between his shoulder and biceps ripple. And all my body ripples in remembrance of how his feels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey go center. My heart hammers inside me as the Mother of All Monsters slams Remington’s ribs, and Remington comes back with a triple punch that is so fast and so powerful, it knocks the guy back three steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brooke, ohmigod!” Melanie says. “OH. MY. GOD!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant comes back with a swing that strikes Remy straight in the gut. I hear the sound of the punch and wince, but suddenly I hear the sounds of the way Remington hits back. Fast and hard. PAM PAM POOM! The giant falls on his ass. Remington circles the ring as he waits for him to get up, sinuous, graceful, my powerful blue-eyed lion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll my body remembers the way that lion moves over me. In me. The way his hips push with perfect precision. The way his hands coast all over me. Squeeze me. Tease me. The way his tongue rasps against me, tastes me, licks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster slowly gets up and shakes his head, as if he’s confused, and before he can get in another punch, Remington hooks him with his right and knocks him back down—splat on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie jumps and screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“YES!! YES! REMY, YOU’RE THE KING OF THE FUCKING JUNGLE!” she screams. And he turns with that smile, and I freeze when he spots us. He’s smiling indulgently at us, his fans, facing in our direction, when suddenly his stance changes—and his body seems to reengage. His dimples are still in place, but his eyes narrow just slightly as he surveys us, like a predator in hunting mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom drops out of my world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think he recognized your voice, you idiot!” I hiss under my breath, tugging Mel’s skirt so that she sits back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’s not looking at Mel. Oh, no. Remy is staring at me. Feet braced apart, his chest heaves as he suddenly lasers in on me. Me and only me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blue eyes bore into me, curious and questioning, and I am suddenly excruciatingly aware of everything I am wearing. The kohl around my eyes, the ridiculous red lipstick, the plastered-on makeup . . . I pray, quietly and fervently, that it’s enough to shield me from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expel a breath when his eyes slide to my right, to Melanie, and she adjusts her wig and breathes, “Shit on a fucking stick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if I thought I was free and clear, I completely, completely, underestimated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me again, and then, slowly, he shakes his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart clenches so hard I think my chest will have some permanent interior damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drags a hand through his hair and restlessly paces around for a moment; then he lifts his head again, and when his eyes sear into me and he shakes his head again, this time with a sudden flash of his beautiful dimples, I think I come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElectricity courses through me as his eyes darken with heat, his lips curl sensually, full of that male knowledge of his that I, contrary to what any of his fans say, I am his number one fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows exactly who I am. I can see chastising amusement in his eyes and can almost hear him say . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou little shit, I know who you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fucking see you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to rip off this stupid costume, and just run up to him and climb him like a tree. Grab that hard jaw in my hands and kiss his mouth and drown him with my kisses and all the love I have for him that’s been drowning me for weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe curls his fingers at his sides when another fighter is announced, and as he takes the ring, Remy keeps looking at me, clenching and unclenching his fists, and the heat in his gaze, I can feel it burn in every part of my being, down to my toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bell rings, and Remington winks at me, a wink that makes the crowd roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelanie squeaks and squeezes my hand. “Tell me again how much he doesn’t want you, you dopehead!” She points at herself. “This girl right here is horny on your fucking behalf! Ohmigod! He’s completely doing you in his head!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-real-2/page-25.html","bookId":2737,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM"}
