But they created the monster, didn’t they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bratty little liars!” Angela exclaimed as Jenna revved the motor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, bratty, yes. Little, no,” Jenna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They wouldn’t have dared try anything!” Angela said, her eyes flashing. “Or, if they had tried it, they would have been surprised. We’ve had some pretty good training.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, so have they—on the football field!” Jenna said with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not armed. And neither am I…but still, we’re Federal agents,” Angela reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I was thinking that last night when the kid came at me in the cemetery. I’m glad I realized he was a little punk. Still, maybe it was a good thing I’m not armed—what if I had panicked and shot the kid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t have….” Angela assured her. “So, where now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I’d park the car and we’d see what was going on in the center of it all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela groaned. “The men are going for tarot card readings. You’re not going to make me get one, too, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I thought we’d see how Will is doing with his street entertainment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they drove back to her uncle’s house and she parked the car, Jenna noted that Jamie wasn’t back yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder where he went. School has been out for a while, and he went in early,” Jenna said to Angela. “Call him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was relieved when Jamie answered the phone right away. “You’ll not believe this, lass, but I’ve got myself a new patient!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Jenna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um. And his name is Martin Keller.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The kid from the graveyard last night!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The same. Apparently, his mother was deeply concerned about the fact that he came home in his underwear last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna laughed. “Well, have you learned anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah! Patient confidentiality, I’m afraid. Suffice it that I tell you that a kid in his situation would be truly sorry about a little fiasco like you experienced last night. I think the fact that he’d have to see me would definitely make one such child repentant! I’ll see you all later then. I’ve just slipped out between meetings with…a patient…and the talk I must now have with that patient’s mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go, uncle!” Jenna said, and hung up. She repeated the conversation to Angela, who smiled. “Well, it is interesting to listen to the mouths of babes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what Rebecca Nurse told me this morning. It’s the kids we have to get to—and I’m not going to feel guilty trying to question children, because it’s the adults who have gotten to them!” Jenna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked down to the pedestrian way. Once again, Haunted Happenings was in full swing. Stilt walkers in various costumes were posing for pictures and teasing the young and old alike. A troupe of performers was putting on a pirate skit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown toward the center they saw Will, resplendent in a sweeping velvet cape and top hat, and with a group of children sitting before him as he made multicolored light leap from a crystal ball and then dart about over their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is a master of light and illusion!” Angela said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And knowing the difference between the real and the illusion,” Jenna added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Will saw the two of them watching him, he didn’t miss a beat in his trick as he motioned for them to stay. Jenna nodded, and they waited. He completed his act with a final sizzle of light in vibrant colors above the crystal ball, and then he bowed to the applause and promised he’d be back in a minute, when he’d present them with a little bit of the old “Trinidadian” fantasy, magic and illusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd before them dispersed. Will swept off his hat and cape and hurried toward the two of them. “Wine bar right there—let’s slip in. I could do with a nice Cabernet!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe establishment was as crowded as the rest of the area, but Will had apparently formed a bond with the young woman at the hostess stand and they were quickly brought to a small, intimate booth in the back. They were served quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have news? Or you just wanted a glass of wine?” Jenna teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two things,” Will said. “Not fifteen minutes ago, I saw the head of that church old Abraham Smith attended. Goodman Wilson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? How did you know it was him?” Jenna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, ye of little faith!” Will said in mock horror. “Jake. You’d asked Jake to delve into things. He pulled up everything you asked for, and then some, gave us all a nice thick dossier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, the churchman was here, in the middle of all this?” Jenna asked, surprised. “No liquor, no dancing, no singing…wouldn’t that include no bobbing for apples?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill shrugged. “Maybe it doesn’t relate to young children. He came and he looked around for a long while. Finally, he approached a group of children who had apparently come down as a school group.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?” Angela asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He bent down to talk to one of the little girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he say?” Jenna demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know, I couldn’t hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” Jenna said, sitting back in disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, but it brings us to the second thing I have to tell you,” Will said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So tell us!” Angela said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, one of the mothers recognized Goodman Wilson, too. She came over like a bat out of hell, and grabbed the little girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess no one likes an unusual church,” Angela said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did hear what the woman said to him,” Will said. He lifted a hand before either of them could prod him. “She told him to get away from the children, that he had created Malachi Smith and caused everyone to die, and that his church was pure evil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he do?” Angela asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He just stood very straight and spoke to her calmly. He said that God loved everyone, and that Jesus taught us all to seek peace and to turn the other cheek. Then he walked away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that was it?” Jenna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it was it as far as Goodman Wilson was concerned.” He smiled, waiting this time for one of them to ask him what else had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will, damn it,” Jenna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, okay—another mother came running up to the pretty blonde woman. She set a hand on her shoulder and said, ‘Cindy! Cindy, please, please, don’t let all this upset you so much.’ And then the blonde—Cindy Yates, I figure, started crying, and she said, ‘It’s that man. It’s that awful man. He was trying to get near the children, and he creates killers. I wouldn’t be surprised if the wretched old bastard had helped Malachi Smith do all those killings.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are booked. Well, Madam Sam is booked. She’s the best, I’m afraid,” the ring-nosed girl at the counter told Sam and Jackson without much conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, please, see if there isn’t something,” Sam begged, leaning on the counter and flashing her his best smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled uncertainly in return. “Well…I don’t think I can get you both in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You go. I can try again tomorrow,” Jackson said, letting out a feigned sigh of complete disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I mean, really. I should have her on a break when her current client comes out, but you ask so nicely…I can slip you in,” the girl said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is really good of you. Thank you, thank you,” Sam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and walked toward the back. Sam followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just wait here. When the curtain opens, you can go on in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam waited as told. In a few minutes, a twentysomething-year-old heavy-metal rocker type man with jelled black hair, head-to-toe tattoos, earrings, lip ring and giant lobe rings came out looking as if he had just reached nirvana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam walked on in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Madam Sam” was something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reeked overt sexuality; in fact, he assumed that a good portion of her “clientele” had to be pubescent males. Her breasts nearly heaved out of her peasant blouse. Her eyes were ringed darker than a raccoon’s, and her boa constrictor seemed pleasantly entrenched with its head centered in her cleavage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam sat down in front of her. She studied him for a moment and smiled. It was the kind of smile that made him imagine she might have a forked tongue of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Sam, too,” he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me your palm,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did so. She let out a soft sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it? What’s wrong?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I see here that your life is…about to change drastically. You’ve enjoyed the adoration and admiration of friends and strangers alike…but, ah! There’s just a twist and jiggle in the lifeline. You’re about to do something that will make you the laughingstock of millions!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked into his eyes. He smiled. “I’m flattered. You know who I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you know who I am. Now just ask your questions. I saw your girlfriend yesterday. You’re going to ask the same questions, and I’m going to give you the same answers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. He wondered if he would have corrected her about Jenna if he’d been the one to come in the day before. He doubted it. He’d known then what he wanted; he just hadn’t known if he’d get it or not. He wasn’t at all sure that one night constituted a relationship, but he knew that he was sure praying like hell for a second night like the one before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I’m not going to ask you questions. I just wanted to meet you. I’d been by to see Andy Yates, and he said that I’d be impressed. I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now I’m flattered,” she said. “So—you no longer think that I’ve gone crazy and run amok and gone about town killing people?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-evil-inside-krewe-of-hunters-4/page-34.html","bookId":2278,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:33 PM"}
