{"id":15885,"no":2,"title":"TRANSLATOR\u0027S NOTE","content":"The author himself explains the precise connexion of the present work with the other three volumes of the Philosophy of the Spirit, to which it now forms the conclusion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I had not contemplated translating this treatise, when engaged upon the others, for the reason that it was not in existence in its present form, and an external parallel to its position as the last, the late comer of the four masterpieces, is to be found in the fact of its publication by another firm than that which produced the preceding volumes. This diversity in unity will, I am convinced, by no means act as a bar to the dissemination of the original thought contained in its pages, none of which will, I trust, escape the diligent reader through the close meshes of the translation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The volume is similar in format to the Logic, the Philosophy of the Practical, and the ?sthetic. The last is now out of print, but will reappear translated by me from the definitive fourth Italian edition, greatly exceeding in bulk the previous editions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The present translation is from the second Italian edition, published in 1919. In this the author made some slight verbal corrections and a few small additions. I have, as always, followed the text with the closest respect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.
