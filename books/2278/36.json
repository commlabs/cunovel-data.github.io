He didn’t let her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No more case tonight,” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth found hers and his hand was on her clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt his fingers on her bare skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna wasn’t usually a dreamer. And of all nights for her to dream, it shouldn’t have been that night, while she lay curled against Sam’s naked flesh, held in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she did dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was standing on the walkway to the Lexington House. The dormered windows stared at her like giant dark eyes. The wind had picked up, and she could feel an icy salt chill to it. As she stood there, despite the wind, a mist of fog seemed to settle and grow darker and darker, silver mist at first, and then gray…and darker gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house itself…could hold evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi Smith seemed so filled with light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi wasn’t there. Someone else was. Something that had come, or something that had remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to go into the house. The answers were there, somewhere, in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started up the path. A figure began to form in the mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was that of a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old, worn woman who still had eyes of gentle watery blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca Nurse. Gentle, pious. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to stop her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe specter of Rebecca Nurse held her hand up. “No,” she said. “No—for the lies will rip you apart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How will I know the lies, if I don’t find the truth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The children…they have fits. They listen to what they hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna started to open her mouth to ask the specter more; she wasn’t able to do so. The dark eyes of the house suddenly seemed to explode, and liquid spilled from the dormered eyes, and then the eaves, and the door frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiquid rushing out to encompass her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the liquid was blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam awoke with a strange sense of comfort, especially considering the fact that he was the kind to wake with every detail of his current case lined up in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, of course, he realized he was draped in silky female flesh, and the thought was enough to achieve instant arousal. But he kept himself still, not wanting to wake her. He watched the sunset color of her hair splay over her shoulder and curl down her back; he felt the fall of her leg over his own and saw that her eyes remained closed, her breathing deep and even. He was tempted to pull her closer, as he had in the night when she’d suddenly wakened and felt like ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nothing of course; she’d smiled and assured him that she woke easily, especially in old houses where things creaked and moaned and always seemed to go bump in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d told her that he knew how to make her forget bumps and creaks in the night, though he wasn’t sure at all about moans, which, of course, had made her moan and laugh. But she’d been glad to accept his kiss and roll into his arms and forget whatever had plagued her in the wonder of new love or sexual fascination or whatever she had found in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the second hand on the beside clock ticking, and he remained still, and for the life of him, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d remained with a woman overnight, or brought her home and thought about breakfast in the morning. His last partner had been in South Beach, a bikini-clad blonde he’d met in one of the hotel clubs that brought the dancing out to the sand on Miami Beach. No thoughts of the future on either side. She was a bonds attorney from Ohio on vacation. And when she had propositioned him, she had assured him, “Half the women and all of the men are here just looking to get laid. Hey, it’s like breathing, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike breathing…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a way, yes, it was like breathing. But he felt something of awe that Jenna was there now, that the morning light was trickling in, catching the red of her hair and making it seem that a warm and surreal glow emanated from her and encompassed her. And he wondered what it would be like to wake every morning feeling like that, knowing the life and breath and vibrant beauty of such a woman beside him. So, high-powered, cutthroat Boston attorney meets Federal ghost buster/civil-servant, willing to put her life on the line for others, and working hard with a team of ghost busters/civil-servants who seem to have formed a working bond that extended into the kind of friendship that would bring them all to one another’s aid, and still have enough left over for those others they ran into along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mom and dad would have loved that the girl they had known had become the woman now beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was something he shouldn’t mention. He wouldn’t want her thinking he’d brought her home again so that the ghosts of his family might approve!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced; he still wasn’t sure about ghosts. He knew that Jenna and the Krewe of Hunters seemed to have something—an ability to see beyond what was obvious. But he still wondered what tricks the mind could play, and if there wasn’t something in the psyche that triggered a memory, or if they had all somehow tapped into that vast percentage of the brain that scientists knew humankind had yet to figure out how to utilize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stirred against him. Her eyes opened, as green as an endless field, and when she smiled at him, he forgot all thought. He didn’t whisper a word; he kissed her, and he made love to her, and she made love in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, he thought, if you didn’t breathe, you died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna saw John Alden’s car as they drove up and parked on the sidewalk outside Lexington House. She looked again at the way the house stood, just up on its little rise, and she thought of the dream that had plagued her in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of the fall days in New England that warned of the approaching winter. The sky was gray and overcast, and even on the rise before the Lexington House, they could feel the chill breeze that ripped the coastline of Massachusetts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of how she often shook her head at the Puritans who had come to Massachusetts, seeking religious freedom but refusing to grant it to others. She thought of the people who had allowed the witchcraft scare to take root, and then she reminded herself that it had been a different time—in Europe, thousands upon thousands had been hanged or burned at the stake for doctrinal differences between versions of one religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself thinking of those Pilgrims who had come and died in the first harsh winter, and that perhaps they’d needed to be stubborn and rigid stock to have ever made their home in the wilds of the new colony, where the wind was as rugged as granite rocks and as brutal as the winter’s ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLexington House stood there as it had for centuries, weathered and worn and holding the secrets not so much of humanity and the past, but of the madness that could enter any man’s mind when he was brought to it—or when the feral instinct of the animal that remained in man brought about those emotions that were far from fine: fear, greed, envy, hatred and anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam looked at her, frowning. “You’re sure you want to go in again? I can just show the place to Jackson and Angela.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go in again,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. She loved the way he looked at her. The first day, his eyes had been filled with so much mockery. Now they showed concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to go in again,” she amended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened as if it were a great, greedy maw, ready to suck them in. John Alden walked out onto the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you coming in, or what?” he called out to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crossed the street to the lawn and walked up the steps. Sam made the introductions, and John Alden peered at Angela and Jackson suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Angela turned on the charm, pumping John’s hand and telling him how grateful they were to be allowed to assist Sam, and whatever John might have felt about any intrusion, he apparently decided to let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glad you made it before we brought the cleaning crew in.” He winced apologetically. “Even here, even in fall, we’ve got to get ’em in when there’s this much blood, or the pests come on into the house, and the rats multiply and head on out to the whole neighborhood. We’ve got to move on a real cleanup. We’ve had the crime lab out. Prosecution has seen the place and defense has seen the place. Anyway, come on in, I can give you about a half an hour. Watch where you step, and what you touch.” He looked at Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stepped into the house, entering the foyer together. Jenna found herself drawn back to the parlor and held back when Jackson and Angela started upstairs with John. Sam stood in the hallway, watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around the room and then closed her eyes for a moment. When she opened them, it seemed that an opaque quality had fallen over everything, as if she floated in a soaring motion back, and looked on from a distance. She was there, and she wasn’t there. She was watching from a strange distance that couldn’t be tallied by space but by time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman moved about the room. Her hair was brown and graying and tucked back in a severe knot at her nape. She dusted and straightened up. She was doing so when a young man came to the door. He leaned against the door frame, looking in. His face was lean and well shaped; his eyes were dark and should have been appealing, but they had a hollow and bitter look to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman didn’t look up. “Soup in the kitchen, though you’re not deserving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother, I hope not,” the young man said. He was in a long, straight coat, vest and suspenders. The woman was in a long, flowered gown with a high neck. “Who the hell is deserving of week-old soup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a lazy, no-good lie-about,” the woman said. “And the soup is fine. Fine for a lad who grew to be worthless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like my sister? My sister, who dresses in twenty-year-old clothing, mends and darns socks and grows old since no man of substance will have her?” he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman looked at him. “You’re a greedy one, as well as a worthless one. Would that I’d never had such ingrates fall from my womb!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would that you never had,” he agreed. He straightened where he stood. His hands had been behind his back. He drew them forward, displaying the ax he held and hefted as he spoke. “Would that we’d never lived in this godforsaken house. Would that we’d had actual warmth in winter, that Father had allowed fires to burn, or that his heart had been open to more than a passion for hoarding at the expense of all else. Would that I’d not spent my days in the attic, imagining the insanity of Eli Lexington hacking his family to little bits and pieces.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-evil-inside-krewe-of-hunters-4/page-36.html","bookId":2278,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:33 PM"}
