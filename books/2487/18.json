Hard to spot on the dark carpet—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt buzzed, it flew. So fast it vanished from my sight. I clamped my lips shut, slapped my hand over my mouth for good measure. The thing landed on my left cheek and without thinking I brought up my other hand and swatted it like a mosquito.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain. An acidic burn, an iron from the fire, jammed into the soft skin under my eye. I suppressed a scream, brought my hand away from my face and found it bloody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stab of agony in my cheek became a bright, broad ache that seemed to radiate down to my toes. A pain so big my mind couldn’t wrap itself around it, mixed with a weird, buzzing itch that comes specifically with tearing flesh, the feel of whole nerve endings torn from their roots and tossed aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tasted the copper flow of blood in my mouth, felt something moving over there . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOH SON OF A MOTHERFUCK THE FUCKING SOY SAUCE IS DIGGING A FUCKING HOLE INTO MY FUCKING FACE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell flat on the floor, thrashing and rolling like a seizure. I forgot where I was, who I was, everything in my mind vaporized by a hydrogen bomb of panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOH THIS HURTS THIS HURTS THIS HURTS I CAN FEEL THE THING CRAWLING ACROSS MY TEETH NOW OH SHIIIIIIITTTT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face and shirt were wet and sticky with blood. I felt the second intruder crawl across my tongue and down my throat, felt my stomach wrench with disgust. I heard footsteps just outside the door now, felt relieved, knew I would throw myself at Officer Freeman and beg him to take me to the emergency room, to pump my stomach, to bring in an exorcist, to call in the Air Force to bomb this whole town into radioactive dust and bury it under sixty feet of concrete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, calm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost Zen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI again felt that sensation from the police station, the radiating energy pulsing from the chest out like that first swallow of hot, spiked coffee while standing outside in the dead of winter. The soy sauce high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorknob began to turn. Morgan was coming. Hell, Morgan was here. I wanted to run, to duck, to act. Frustrating. The body is slow, so slow—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, I was outside my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so easy for me, I almost laughed. Why hadn’t I caught on before? I had a full 1.78 seconds before the detective would step through the door. The only reason we would normally perceive that span as being a short amount of time is because the wet mechanism of our bodies simply can’t accomplish very much in that span. But a supercomputer can do over a trillion mathematical equations in one second. To that machine, one second is a lifetime, an eternity. Speed up how much thinking you can do in two seconds and two seconds becomes two minutes, or two hours or two trillion years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.74 seconds until confrontation time now, my body and the body of my nemesis frozen in the moment, on opposite sides of the door, he with his hand on the knob, me on hands and knees in suspended agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. I needed a plan. I took a moment to mentally step back, to assess my situation. Think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are standing on the thin, cool crust of a gigantic ball of molten rock hurtling through frozen space at 496,105 miles an hour. There are 62,284,523,196,522,717, 995,422,922,727,752,433,961,225,994,352,284,523,196,571,657,791,521,592, 192,954,221,592,175,243,396,122,599,435,291,541,293,739,852,734,657,229 subatomic particles in the universe, each set into outward motion at the moment of the Big Bang. Thus, whether or not you move your right arm now, or nod your head, or choose to eat Fruity Pebbles or Corn Flakes next Thursday morning, was all decided at the moment the universe crashed into existence seventeen billion years ago because of the motion and trajectory of those particles at the first millisecond of physical existence. Thus it is physically impossible for you to deviate—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never finished this thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was no longer in the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSun. Sand. A desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around, saw nothing of interest except brown and brown and brown, spanning from horizon to horizon. God’s sandbox. What now? I thought of John’s ramblings his first hours on the sauce, saying he kept falling out of the time stream, everything overlapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw movement at my feet. A beetle, trundling along in the sand. I figured this might mean something, so I watched it, followed it as it inched along the desert floor. This went on for approximately two hours, the bug heading steadily in one direction. I had begun to form a theory that this beetle was some kind of Indian-vision spirit guide meant to lead me to my destiny—then it stopped. It stayed in one spot for about half an hour, then turned around and began crawling back the other direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a blink, I was somewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chain-link fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown, dead grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople around me, in rags like refugees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was getting ridiculous. I stood there for a moment, baffled. I remembered John again and was determined to keep my head, to hang on until the stuff wore off. I looked down and saw I was holding a fork, my hand stained with a gray dust, like ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little girl approached me. She was deformed, filthy, a good chunk of her face missing. One eye. She studied me, then ran up, kneed me in the groin and wrenched the fork from my hand. She ran off with it, and when I looked up—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndustrial sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMachines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a large building, very clean, and a man stood in front of me wearing a blue uniform, watching a small computer screen on what had to be an assembly line. To my left I saw a massive red sign that said NO SMOKING OR OPEN FLAME ON THE PRODUCTION FLOOR, with a cartoon explosion underneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped forward, noticed the guy had one of those Far Side flip calendars next to him. It was badly out of date, the current page a couple of years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to stop this, somehow. I felt like I was a swimmer, getting tossed downstream by white-water rapids. I knew somehow that if I didn’t get ahold of myself, I would drift like this, forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot expecting to get a response, I said, “Uh, hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy stirred, turned. For just a moment I thought I saw his eyes meet mine, but then his gaze swept around the room, seeing nothing. The man apparently decided he had imagined it and turned back to his monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was full of people at various machines. It was obvious no one could see me. I was here, but I was not here. I looked down and, sure enough, could not see my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet, I knew, were still in a trailer in Undisclosed, on a Saturday afternoon. I focused all my concentration on getting back there, to that spot, to that time, to my body. And in a blink, I was back in the trailer, on the floor. Pain in my face, stench of shit on my pant legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed a sigh of relief, tried to remember what I had been doing, when Morgan Freeman stepped through the door and stopped cold at the sight of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. I suck at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up, climbed awkwardly to my feet with my hand on my bloody face, my pants stinking of Robert Marley’s feces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detective looked me over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had two red plastic gasoline cans with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s gonna burn this place down, I realized with perfect clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he’s gonna burn me with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgan sat the gas cans at his feet, then lit a cigarette. He smoked in silence for a moment, looking off into space as if he had suddenly forgotten I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” I began, figuring I would remind him, “I suppose you’re wondering why I’m here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head slightly. “Same as everybody. You’re trying to figure out what in the name of Elvis is going on. Everybody ’cept me. Me, I don’t even wanna know no more. I bet you’re wondering what I’m doing with these here gas cans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think I know. And I don’t think Robert’s landlord would approve at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied my bleeding face, then reached into his pocket and handed me a handkerchief. I pressed it to my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. I, uh, fell. On a . . . drill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You believe in Hell, Mr. Wong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive seconds of confused silence, then, “Uh, yeah. I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” he asked. “Why do you believe in Hell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because it’s the opposite of what I want to believe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly, as if this answer seemed to satisfy him. He picked up one gas can, unscrewed the cap, and started splashing the orange liquid around the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him for a moment, then took a tentative step toward the door. In a blur of movement Morgan turned, whipped his hand out of his jacket. A revolver was now aimed right at my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You leavin’ already?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind was still buzzing and suddenly I saw a flash from Morgan’s memory, something too bizarre to grasp. It was a scene from this morning, here at this very trailer. Blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd screaming. All that screaming. What the hell did you see here, Morgan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I had another vision, of walls erupting in flame around me. I put my hands up in surrender and he nodded down toward the other gas can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “Help me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be glad to. But first I want you to tell me what happened to John. You know, the other guy you were interrogating?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I figured he was with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me? Didn’t he, you know, die?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure did. He was in the interview room and Mike Dunlow was askin’ him the same questions I was askin’ you. And your guy was muttering responses like he’s half asleep. He keeps sayin’ we gotta let you and him go, that you got to get to Vegas, else it’s the end of the world—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLas Vegas again. What the fuck is in Vegas?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—So finally Dunlow says to him, ‘Look, we got dead or missing kids here and we’re gonna find out what we need to know, so you’re stayin’ in this room until I’m satisfied or you die of old age.’ Your boy, when he hears that, he falls over dead. Just like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, that sounds like John.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now he’s gone. Got a call from the hospital, it’s just an empty bed where he was. They figured he skipped out on payin’ the bill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That also sounds like John.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the gas can and removed the cap. Morgan put his gun away. I soaked the couch. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/john-dies-at-the-end-john-dies-at-the-end-1/page-18.html","bookId":2487,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:24 PM"}
