On all sides, the soldiers moved like old men and women, fighting to raise tarps and flies, roll out bedding, pausing to rest between tasks. Weapons were slowly drawn, the day’s damage repaired with oiled whetstones, but the act was almost mindless: gestures of instinct observed by dull, sullen eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then out from the wagons came the children, in ones and twos, into the midst of the soldiers. They came not to beg or plead, but simply to sit, watching over the soldiers as they slept. Or suffered with staring eyes. Or, in the case of some, quietly died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Sinter observed this as she sat leaning against the wheel of the wagon they’d been guarding. The tremulous arrival of a child into every knot of soldiers seemed to have a strange effect upon them. Arguments fell away, glaring eyes faded, resentments sank down. The sleepless rolled on to their sides and surrendered to weariness. Pain was swallowed back and those who sat weeping without tears eventually settled into silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat gift was this? She did not understand. And when a soldier awoke in the closing of dusk, and found curled at his or her side a small, still form, cool and pale in the dying light, she’d seen how the squad then gathered to set shards of crystal over the lifeless child, raising a glittering mound. And the soldiers would then cut fetishes free from their belts and harnesses – the bones they’d carried since Aren – and set them upon the pathetic heaps of rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They’re killing us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked over at her sister, who sat against the back wheel, her splinted leg stretched out. ‘Who is it this time, Kisswhere?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They come and share the last moments. Ours. Theirs. It’s not fair, what they bring.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinter’s eyes narrowed on Kisswhere. You’ve gone away, sister. Will you ever come back? ‘I don’t know what they bring,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You wouldn’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dull awakening of anger, which then drained away. ‘Why do you say that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKisswhere bared her teeth, the back of her head resting between two spokes, her eyes closed. ‘What you always had, Sinter. What I never had. That’s why you can’t see it. Can’t recognize it. It’d be like seeing into your own soul, and that’s something nobody can do. Oh, they say they can. Talk about revelation, or truth. All that shit. But inside us, something stays hidden. For ever.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There’s nothing hiding inside me, Kisswhere.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But those children – sitting, watching, lying close – it hurts you to see them, doesn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinter looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You fool,’ Kisswhere sighed. ‘They bring dignity . Same as you. Same as the Adjunct herself – why do you think so many of us hate her? Hate the sight of her? She shows us everything we don’t want to be reminded of, because there’s nothing harder for most of us to find than dignity. Nothing. So, they show us how you can die with dignity – they show us by dying themselves, and by letting us die while being watched over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Adjunct said unwitnessed . These children don’t agree.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s all pointless anyway .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKisswhere went on, ‘Did you think this would be easy? Did you think our feet wouldn’t start to drag? We’ve walked across half a world to get here. We stopped being an army long ago – and no, I don’t know what we are now. I don’t think there’s a person in this world who’d be able to give us a name.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re not going to make it,’ Sinter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinter looked across at her sister. Their eyes briefly locked. Just past Kisswhere, Corporal Rim sat hunched over, rubbing oil into the stump of his right arm. He made no sign of listening, but she knew he was. Same for Honey, lying shrouded under stained linen to keep the sun from her eyes. ‘So you don’t care, Kisswhere. You never did.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Surviving this ain’t the point, Sinter. It stopped being the point some time ago.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Right,’ she snapped. ‘So enlighten me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You already know. You said it yourself – we’re not going to make it. And those children, they come among us, like homunculi. Made up of everything we surrendered in our lives – all that dignity, and integrity, and truth – all of it, and look at them – starved down to bones and not much else. We ain’t been too good with the best in us, sister, have we?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf tears had been possible, Sinter would have wept them. Instead, she sank down on to the hard ground. ‘You should’ve run,’ she said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-251.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
