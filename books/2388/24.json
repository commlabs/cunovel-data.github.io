It felt like Jordan was going to the moon. “What are you going to do there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Live an amazing life.” Jordan said wistfully, twisting a cloth napkin that had been set on the table in her hands. “It’s incredible there, Em—beautiful beaches, an amazing culture, and you can live like a king on nothing. I was thinking of teaching English to make money. And I want you to come with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily sat back in the plushy booth. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think about it!” Jordan grabbed Emily’s hands across the table, almost knocking over a glass of water. “We’d live on the beach. You’d get to swim in the ocean every day. We could travel, have amazing adventures, and you’d get to escape everything here that you hate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA kid Emily didn’t recognize passed by them to use the ATM, and Emily pressed her lips together until he finished. Then she looked at Jordan plaintively. “But what if I wanted to see my family? Wouldn’t a plane ticket be really expensive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You couldn’t see your family ever again. The authorities might figure out we escaped together—you’d be considered an accessory for hiding me. If you came back to the States, you could be arrested, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words hit Emily like a punch to the stomach. Never see her family again? Never live in America again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, what did she have in the States that she really treasured? A family who hated her? A college future she wasn’t even excited about? Good friends, yes, but they’d probably jump at the chance to get out of town, too. And there was Violet, of course, but the Bakers were the best parents she could ask for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Emily left, she’d never have to worry about getting arrested for Tabitha’s murder. She’d never have to worry about A coming after her, and she’d never be haunted by Ali’s ghost—or any other ghosts of Rosewood past again. Her family would probably celebrate her disappearance. It wouldn’t even register on Isaac’s radar. UNC would find a new swimmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Jordan’s huge, hopeful eyes, her parted lips, and the adorable dimple next to her eyebrow. She had found so much in one person, and letting her go seemed like a terrible mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd could she really afford to make another one of those?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHANNA’S SLUMBER PARTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C’mon, people, two more reps!” the Jillian Michaels impersonator yelled as she stood in front of the small workout room, raising two pale-blue dumbbells over her head. “Do it even though it hurts! Feel the burn!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s arms felt like rubber, but she lifted the dumbbells as high as she could anyway, letting out a grunt. When she looked at herself in the mirror, she was making a constipated, old-woman grimace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she dropped the weights to the floor and sighed. “Give yourself a round of applause!” the instructor whooped. A few people burst into tepid clapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna collapsed onto her mat. It was Saturday afternoon, and she’d been in the gym for two hours now—before taking the 7-Day Shred class, she’d pounded on the treadmill for thirty minutes, then tried to lose herself for another twenty on the StairMaster. But none of it had helped her forget about Naomi, or A, or Naomi as A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the class headed for the door, and Hanna draped a towel over her shoulders and followed. But when she saw Naomi’s shining face in the window, she backtracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey there, superstar!” Naomi said brightly, pushing into the room. She was dressed in gray terry-cloth shorts, a white tank top, and New Balance sneakers. “You vanished so early this morning! Have you been here this whole time? You should’ve told me you were coming to the gym—I would’ve joined you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, it was a last-minute thing,” Hanna said, avoiding Naomi’s gaze, which felt far too intrusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi linked her arm through Hanna’s. “I was just talking to the Pilates instructor—she sounds really awesome. Maybe we could sign up for a joint session tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, sure.” Hanna fiddled with her towel, unnerved by how close Naomi was standing to her. A vision of Gayle’s dead body on the driveway flashed through her mind. Naomi did that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi placed her hands on her hips. “Are you pissed at me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not,” Hanna bleated, trying to sound innocent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you’re acting weird,” Naomi said, hurt evident in her voice. “You’re treating me like I have barf in my hair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna mustered a carefree shrug. “I’m just tired.” Then she gestured toward the fountain, mumbled how she was dying for a drink, and made a beeline for the faucet. She knows everything, a voice inside her head roared. Everything she told you was a lie. She’s not happy her cousin was in the crash—she’s furious, and she’s out for blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was finished drinking, Naomi was waiting. “Can we at least rehearse for the talent show this afternoon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna felt trapped. Thankfully, at that very moment, her cell phone chimed. It was only an e-mail from Shopbop.com about summer must-haves, but Naomi didn’t know that. “Mike wants to meet me—he says it’s an emergency. Bummer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi looked suspicious. “Do you still want to be my partner for the talent show?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course!” Hanna lied, afraid of what Naomi might do if she said no. She shot her an I’m-sorry-I’m-so-busy smile. “We’ll catch up soon, okay?” And then, ducking her head, she darted for the stairwell door and scrambled to the floor her room was on—she was desperate for a change of clothes. She feared Naomi would follow her, but she didn’t appear on the landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna unlocked her door and rushed inside. Even though it had only been a few hours since she’d been there, the room didn’t seem like hers any longer. Naomi’s suitcase was in a completely different place now. Different clothes were on her bed, and the chair had been moved to the window. Hanna peeked around for Naomi’s laptop, but it was nowhere to be seen. She’d probably never leave it unattended again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe collapsed onto her bed for a moment, all at once feeling as tired as she’d pretended to be at the gym. Her head sank into the cool, soft pillow. Her aching limbs relaxed into the cushy mattress. It felt so good to stretch out after so many hours of exercise. The white noise of the fan was lulling and soothing. I’ll just close my eyes for a minute, she thought to herself, her breathing slowing. And then, darkness surrounded her like a heavy blanket, cloaking everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she opened her eyes again, she was sitting in an unfamiliar BMW. A pine tree air freshener spun from the rearview mirror. The radio was set to a hip-hop station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked and looked out the window. It was pouring outside. Tall buildings surrounded her, and a neon sign for South Street Steaks flashed in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe passenger door opened, and a figure flopped into the passenger seat. “You really don’t have to do this, Olivia,” a familiar voice slurred. “I’m totally fine to drive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna blinked hard. It was Madison. Her blond hair was mussed, her face was flushed, and she was wearing the same striped T-shirt she’d worn that night at the bar. Hanna looked around again. This was that night at the bar. The air felt like summer. Madison’s breath smelled thickly of booze. Hanna had a salty margarita taste in her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she had an epiphany. Was she getting a do-over of that night? Could she change fate? Could she get out of the car, hail Madison a cab, and send her home another way, staying out of this mess completely? Then Naomi would never have anything against them. She would never become A. This nightmare wouldn’t be happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she tried to pull the door handle to leave, her fingers wouldn’t respond. And then, unwittingly, she felt her hand twist the key in the ignition and rev the car’s engine. Before she knew it, she was pulling into traffic. Stop! she told herself, but her foot continued to press the gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get on 76 West,” Madison mumbled, pointing to the sign above them. Hanna tried to steer the car in another direction, but it was useless. She found herself merging onto the highway, just as she had the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe focused on the road, which was barely visible through the rain. “Stay on 76 until 202,” Madison instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were the directions to get to Rosewood. “Where do you live, exactly?” Hanna asked, even though she now knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison giggled. “You’re going to hate me, but I don’t exactly remember. My parents just bought a new house, like, last week, and I keep forgetting the address. But I think I can get us there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn oncoming car sent up a plume of water against the windshield. Pull over! she told herself. Wait at least until this rain stops! But, frustratingly, she kept driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison directed Hanna to Reeds Lane. Hanna’s heart thudded as she navigated the curves, dreading the moment that was about to come. And then, there it was: A car appeared out of nowhere, veering straight into her lane. She screamed and cut the wheel. Madison let out a strange urp sound, and her head banged against the seat. The tires skidded on the wet road, and before Hanna knew it, the car had slid down the embankment. She hit the brakes hard, and the wheels locked and the back end fishtailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help!” she screamed. A huge oak approached in the windshield. She tried to turn away from it, but it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a deafening crunch, and then a symphony of shattering glass. Hanna shielded her face and felt the airbag deploy. The seatbelt cut hard against her shoulder and waist, and then everything stopped. When she opened her eyes, the radio was still playing. The engine still hummed. A tree branch poked through the windshield. Glass had shattered everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna looked to her right. Madison’s head was tilted at a strange angle. A thin ribbon of blood flowed out of her nose. When Hanna looked down into the footwell, she screamed. Madison had no legs. She was only a torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Madison?” Hanna whispered shakily. She shook Madison’s shoulder. “Madison?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Madison’s eyes popped open. Hanna recoiled. The girl’s eyes were clear and lucid, and she stared unflinchingly at Hanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your name isn’t Olivia,” she said in a haunted voice. “It’s Hanna Marin. I know everything about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s eyes boggled. She pushed the airbag out of the way and tried to scramble out of the car, but Madison caught her arm before she could. When she turned back, it wasn’t Madison’s face staring back at her. It was Ali’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Hanna!” The corners of Ali’s lips stretched wide into a smile. “Miss me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna shot up in bed, breathing hard. She was in the calm, quiet stateroom on the boat. The covers had been thrown back, and she was clutching a pillow with her trembling fingers. She pinched the bridge of her nose and tried to erase Ali’s face from her thoughts, but her smile was burned in her brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaomi was sitting on her own bed, looking curiously at Hanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna jumped. “H-how long have you been sitting there?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burned-pretty-little-liars-12/page-24.html","bookId":2388,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM"}
