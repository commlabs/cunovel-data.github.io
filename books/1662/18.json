The front of his sweater was stained and moist looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, Blake leaned in and placed a quick, dry kiss on my lips. “I’ll call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, wondering how one person could single-handedly ruin everything within a minute. It was a talent. With a wave, Blake was gone, and I was alone with Daemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ready?” Daemon called, holding open the passenger door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stalked over to the car and climbed in, slamming the door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” He frowned from outside the car. “Don’t take your anger out on Dolly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You named your car Dolly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon jogged around the front of the car and slid in. The moment he closed the door behind him, I twisted in my seat and punched him in the arm. “You are such a jerk! I know you did the glass and plate thing. That was so wrong!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his hands, laughing. “What? It was funny. The look on Bo’s face was priceless. And the kiss he gave you? What was that? I’ve seen dolphins give hotter kisses than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His name is Blake!” I punched his leg this time. “And you know it! I can’t believe you acted like that. And he doesn’t kiss like a dolphin!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From what I’ve seen, he does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t see the last time we kissed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter died off. Uh oh. He turned to me slowly. “You’ve kissed him before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s none of your business.” My cheeks flushed, giving me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger sparked in his magnetic eyes. “I don’t like him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped at Daemon. “You don’t even know him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t need to know him to see that there’s something…off about him.” He turned the key and the engine rumbled to life. “I don’t think you should be hanging out with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, this is rich, Daemon. Whatever.” Staring straight ahead, I hugged my elbows and shivered. I was so angry my head was two seconds from spinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you cold? Where’s your jacket?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like jackets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did they do something terrible and unforgiveable to you, too?” He turned on the automatic temperature setting. Warm air blasted out of the vents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I find them…cumbersome.” I sighed loudly. “What was so freaking imperative that you had to go stalker-mode and find me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t stalking you.” He sounded offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, you weren’t? Did you use your alien GPS system to find me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yeah, sort of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Argh! This is so wrong.” I seriously doubted Blake would be calling me again. Not that I blamed him. If I were him, I wouldn’t be. Not when a psychotic alien was shadowing me. “So what’s the deal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon waited until we pulled onto the highway. “Matthew has called a meeting of the minds, and you should be there. It has to do with the DOD. Something’s happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got back to his house before the rest of them showed up, and I was trying to keep calm as I settled into the recliner in the corner. Daemon wasn’t panicking, but he didn’t know what was going on yet. Outside, several car doors slammed shut. I wrapped my arms around my waist, and Daemon moved to my side, sitting on the arm of my chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh and the Thompson boys were the first to come in. Adam smiled at us before sitting next to Dee. She offered him the bag of popcorn she’d been scarfing and he dug in. Andrew took one look in my direction and rolled his eyes. “Anyone have a clue why she’s here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loathed Andrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She needs to be here,” Mr. Garrison said, closing the door behind him. He moved to the center of the living room, all eyes on him. Outside of school, he always dressed down in jeans. “I want to keep this little get-together short.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh smoothed a hand over her purple tights. “The DOD knows about her, right? We’re all in trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath caught. I wasn’t mad at the scornful tone in her voice. A lot was at stake if the DOD found out about me, about them. “Do they, Mr. Garrison?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As far as I know, they don’t know about you,” he said. “The elders called a meeting tonight because of the increase in DOD presence here. It appears something has caught the DOD’s attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank back against the chair, relieved. But then it hit me. I may be off the hook, but they weren’t. I glanced around the room, not wanting to see any of them in trouble. Not even Andrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam stared at a buttery piece of popcorn. “Well, what did they see? No one’s done anything wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee sat the bag of popcorn aside. “What’s the deal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew’s ultra-bright blue gaze circled the room. “One of their satellites picked up the light show from Halloween weekend, and they’ve been out to the field, using some sort of machine that picks up on residual energy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon scoffed. “The only thing they’re going to find is a burned patch of ground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They know we can manipulate light for self-defense, so from what I’ve gathered, that’s not what caught their attention.” Mr. Garrison glanced at Daemon, frowning. “It’s the fact that the energy was so strong it disrupted a satellite’s signal and they weren’t able to snap any pictures of the event. Nothing like that has ever happened before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon kept his expression blank. “I guess I’m just that awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam laughed under his breath. “You’re so powerful you’re disrupting signals now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Disrupted only the signal?” Mr. Garrison barked a short laugh. “It destroyed the satellite—a satellite designed to track high-frequency light and energy. It zeroed in on Petersburg, and the event destroyed the satellite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said, I’m that awesome.” Daemon’s smile was smug, but I was filling with anxious energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” Andrew murmured. Respect gleamed in his eyes. “That’s pretty awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As awesome as that is, the DOD is very curious. The elders believe they will be here a while, monitoring things. That they’ve been here.” He glanced at his wristwatch. “It’s imperative that everyone is on their best behavior.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do the other Luxen have to say about this?” Dee asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They aren’t too concerned at this point. And they have no reason to be,” Matthew said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because it was Daemon who caused such a disruptive burst of energy and not them,” Ash said, and then she gasped. “Does the DOD suspect we have more abilities?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think they want to know how it’s possible that he was able to do something like that.” Matthew studied Daemon. “The elders told them there was a fight between our kind. No one implicated you, Daemon, but they already know you’re strong. You can be expecting a visit from them soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, but fear spiked in me. It hadn’t been Daemon who’d taken out Baruck, so how could he explain what happened? And would the DOD guess the Luxen were far more powerful than they realized, capable of almost anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf so, my friends—and Daemon—were in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katy, it’s very important that you’re careful when hanging around the Blacks,” Mr. Garrison continued. “We don’t want the DOD suspecting that you know anything you shouldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Speak for yourself,” Andrew muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a look, but Daemon responded before I could. “Andrew, I’m going to knock the—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Andrew exclaimed. “I’m just telling the truth. I don’t have to like her because you’re infatuated with the stupid human. None—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon was across the room in a flash. Fully enveloped in intense reddish-white light, he snatched Andrew up and slammed him into the wall with such force the pictures around them rattled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daemon!” I shrieked, rising to my feet at the same time Mr. Garrison shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh jumped from her chair, gasping. “What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing her snack, Dee sighed and sat back. “Here we go. Popcorn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam took a handful. “Honestly, Andrew needs his ass kicked. The DOD being here isn’t Katy’s fault. She has just as much to lose as we do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sister whirled on him. “So you’re taking her side now? A human’s?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t about sides,” I said, keeping an eye on the boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth were in full Luxen mode. So was Matthew. Nothing but a male-shaped form of intense bluish light, he grabbed Daemon and yanked him off Andrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh glared at me for a long moment. “None of this would be happening if you hadn’t shown up here. You would’ve never gotten the original trace on you. The Arum would’ve never seen you, and this whole messed-up chain of events would’ve never happened!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, shut up, Ash.” Dee threw a handful of popcorn at her. “Seriously. Katy risked her life to make sure the Arum didn’t know where we lived.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s great and dandy,” Ash snapped back. “But Daemon wouldn’t have gone all Rambo on the Arum if his precious human wasn’t in danger every five seconds. This is her fault.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not his precious human!” I took a deep breath. “I’m just his…his friend. And that’s what friends do. They protect each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down. “Well, it’s what human friends do, at least.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And it’s what the Luxen do,” Adam said, staring at his sister. “Some just forget that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a disgusted sigh, she spun around and headed for the door. “I’ll wait outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching her go, I wondered if she’d find a reason to blame me for everything, even those gaudy purple tights of hers. But in a way, this situation was my fault. It had been my bizarro output of energy that had drawn the DOD here. My chest ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Garrison finally broke the boys apart. Andrew flickered into his human form, eyes narrowed on a still-iridescent Daemon. “Dude, that was just wrong. Knock me around all you want, but I’m not going to be okay with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Andrew,” Mr. Garrison warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” He backed off, though. “Do you really think she can hold her own against the DOD if they question her? Because of how close she is to Dee and you, they will ask her questions. And you, Daemon, are you planning to do a repeat of your brother? Wanna die for her, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s light flared brighter, and I knew he was going to charge Andrew again. This was ridiculous. Without thinking, I shot across the room and wrapped my fingers around his glowing wrist. It was strange to touch him like this. Warmth and electricity shot up my arm. The back of my neck tingled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was a low blow,” I said to Andrew, because someone needed to. “He doesn’t even deserve your ass kicking, Daemon.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-18.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
