After school she did the laundry, mopped the floor, dusted, and assisted with dinner. Her life became a dreadful, tedious routine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was eager to help her mother, hoping for a word of praise. It never came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother was too preoccupied with the boarders to pay any attention to her daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kelly was very young, a kind boarder had read to her the story Alice\u0027s Adventures in Wonderland, and Kelly was fascinated by the way Alice escaped into a magic rabbit hole. That\u0027s what I need, Kelly thought, a way to escape. I can\u0027t spend the rest of my days scrubbing toilets and mopping floors and cleaning up after messy strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd one day Kelly found her magic rabbit hole. It was her imagination, which would take her anywhere she wanted to go. She rewrote her life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a father, and her mother and father were the same color. They never got angry and yelled at her. They all lived in a beautiful home. Her mother and father loved her. Her mother and father loved her. Her mother and father loved her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN KELLY WAS fourteen, her mother married one of the boarders, a bartender named Dan Berke, a surly, middle-aged man who was negative about everything. Kelly could do nothing to please him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dinner is lousy? \"That dress is the wrong color for you? \"The shade in the bedroom is still broken. I told you to fix it? \"You haven\u0027t finished cleaning the bathrooms? Kelly\u0027s stepfather had a drinking problem. The wall between Kelly\u0027s bedroom and her mother and stepfather\u0027s bedroom was thin, and night after night, Kelly could hear the sounds of blows and screams. In the morning, Ethel would appear wearing heavy makeup that failed to cover bruises and black eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly was devastated. We should get out of here, she thought. My mother and I love each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, when Kelly was half asleep, she heard loud voices from the next room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you get rid of the kid before she was born?\" \"I tried to, Dan. It didn\u0027t work.\" Kelly felt as though she had been kicked in the gut. Her mother had never wanted her. No one wanted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKELLY FOUND ANOTHER escape from the unending dreariness of her life: the world of books. She became an insatiable reader and spent as much of her spare time as she could at the public library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the week, there was never any money left for Kelly, so she got a job as a babysitter, envying the happy families she would never have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAT SEVENTEEN, KELLY was developing into the beauty her mother had once been. The boys at school began asking her for dates. She was repelled. She turned them all down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturdays, when there was no school and Kelly\u0027s chores were finished, she would hurry to the public library and spend the afternoon reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa Marie Houston, the librarian, was an intelligent, sympathetic woman with a quiet, friendly manner and whose clothes were as unpretentious as her personality. Seeing Kelly in the library so often, Mrs. Houston became curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day she said, \"It\u0027s nice to see a young person enjoying reading so much. You spend a lot of time here.\" It was the opening gambit of a friendship. As the weeks went by, Kelly poured out her fears and hopes and dreams to the librarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like to do with your life, Kelly?\" \"Be a teacher.\" \"I think you\u0027d make a wonderful teacher. That\u0027s the most rewarding profession in the world.\" Kelly started to speak, then stopped. She was remembering a breakfast conversation with her mother and stepfather a week earlier. Kelly had said, I need to go to college. I want to be a teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA teacher? Berke had laughed. That\u0027s a dumb-ass idea. Teachers make zip. Do you hear me? Zip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can make more sweeping floors. Anyway, your old lady and I don\u0027t have money to send you to college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027ve been offered a scholarship andSo what? You\u0027ll spend four years wasting your time. Forget it. With your looks, you could probably peddle your ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly had left the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she said to Mrs. Houston, \"There\u0027s a problem. They won\u0027t let me go to college.\" Her voice was choked. \"I\u0027ll spend the rest of my life doing what I\u0027m doing!\" \"Of course you won\u0027t.\" Mrs. Houston\u0027s tone was firm. \"How old are you?\" \"In three months I\u0027ll be eighteen.\" \"You\u0027ll soon be old enough to make your own decisions. You\u0027re a beautiful young woman, Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you know that?\" \"No. Not really.\" How can I tell her that I feel like a freak? I don\u0027t feel beautiful. \"I hate my life, Mrs. Houston. I don\u0027t want to be like?I want to get away from this town. I want something different, and I\u0027ll never have it.\" She was trying hard to control her emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll never have a chance to do something, to be somebody.\" \"Kelly-\" \"I never should have read all those books.\" Her voice was bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" \"Because they\u0027re filled with lies. All those beautiful people and glamorous places and magic? Kelly shook her head. \"There is no magic.\" Mrs. Houston studied her a moment. It was obvious that Kelly\u0027s sense of self-worth had been badly damaged. \"Kelly, there is magic, but you have to be the magician. You have to make the magic happen.\" \u0027Really?\" Kelly\u0027s tone was cynical. \"How do I do that?\" \u0027First, you have to know what your dreams are. Yours are to have an exciting life, filled with interesting people and glamorous places. The next time you come in here, I\u0027ll show you how to make your dreams come true.\" Liar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE WEEK AFTER Kelly graduated, she returned to the library. Mrs. Houston said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly, do you remember what I said about making your own magic?\" Kelly said skeptically, \"Yes.\" Mrs. Houston reached behind her desk and pulled out a handful of magazines:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCOSMOgirl, Seventeen, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Essence, Allure?She handed them to Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly looked at them. \"What am I supposed to do with these?\" \"Have you ever thought of becoming a model?\" \"No.\" \"Look at these magazines. Then tell me if they give you any ideas that might bring magic into your life.\" She means well, Kelly thought, but she doesn\u0027t understand. \"Thank you, Mrs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHouston, I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll start looking for a job next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKELLY TOOK THE magazines back to the boardinghouse and shoved them into a corner and forgot about them. She spent the evening doing her chores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Kelly started to get into bed that night, exhausted, she remembered the magazines Mrs. Houston had given her. She picked up a few out of curiosity and started to skim through them. It was another world. The models were beautifully dressed, with handsome, elegant men at their sides, in London and Paris and exotic places all over the world. Kelly felt a sudden sense of yearning. She hastily put on a robe and walked down the hall to the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied herself in the mirror. She supposed that perhaps she was attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone always told her she was. Even if it\u0027s true, I have no experience. She thought about her future life in Philadelphia and looked in the mirror again. Everyone has to start somewhere. You have to be the magician?make the magic happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEARLY THE NEXT morning, Kelly was in the library to see Mrs. Houston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Houston looked up, surprised to see Kelly in the library so early. \"Good morning, Kelly. Have you had a chance to look at the magazines?\" \"Yes.\" Kelly took a deep breath. \"I would like to try being a model. The problem is that I have no idea where to start.\" Mrs. Houston smiled. \"I do. I looked in the New York telephone directory. You said you wanted to leave this town?\" Mrs. Houston took a typed sheet of paper from her purse and handed it to Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a list of the top dozen modeling agencies in Manhattan, with their addresses and telephone numbers.\" She squeezed Kelly\u0027s hand. \"Start at the top.\" Kelly was stunned. \"I-I don\u0027t know how to thank-\" \"I\u0027ll tell you how. Let me see your photograph in these magazines.\" At dinner that evening, Kelly said, \"I\u0027ve decided that I\u0027m going to be a model.\" Her stepfather grunted. \"That\u0027s your stupidest idea yet. What the hell\u0027s the matter with you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll models are whores.\" Kelly\u0027s mother sighed. \"Kelly, don\u0027t make my mistake. I had false dreams, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027ll kill you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re black and poor. You\u0027re not going anywhere.\" That was the moment Kelly made her decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAT FIVE O\u0027CLOCK the following morning, Kelly took a packed suitcase from under her bed and headed for the bus station. In her purse was two hundred dollars that she had earned babysitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bus ride to Manhattan took two hours, and Kelly spent that time fantasizing about her future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to become a professional model. \"Kelly Hackworth\" did not sound professional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll just use my first name. She said it in her mind over and over. And this is our top model, Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHE CHECKED INTO a cheap motel, and at nine o\u0027clock, Kelly walked in the front door of the modeling agency at the top of the list Mrs. Houston had given her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly had no makeup on and was wearing a wrinkled dress, because she had no way to iron her clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one at the reception desk in the lobby. She approached a man sitting in an office, busily writing at a desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man grunted something without looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly hesitated. \"I wondered if you needed a model.\" \"No,\" the man muttered, \"we\u0027re not hiring.\" Kelly sighed. \"Thank you, anyway.\" She turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man glanced up, and his expression changed. \"Wait! Wait a minute. Come back here.\" He had jumped to his feet. \"My God. Where did you come from?\" Kelly looked at him, puzzled. \"Philadelphia.\" \"I mean-never mind. Have you ever modeled before?\" \"No.\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter. You\u0027ll learn it here, on the job.\" Kelly\u0027s throat was suddenly dry. \"Does that mean I\u0027m-I\u0027m going to be a model?\" He grinned. \"I\u0027ll say. We have clients who will go crazy when they see you.\" She could hardly believe it. This was one of the biggest modeling agencies in the business and they\"My name is Bill Lerner. I run this agency. What\u0027s your name?\" This was the moment Kelly had been dreaming of. This was the first time she was going to use her new, one-word professional name. Lerner was staring at her. \"Don\u0027t you know your name?\" Kelly drew herself up to her full height and said confidently, \"Of course I do. Kelly Hackworth.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-9.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
