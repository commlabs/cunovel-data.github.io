Mark Miller is a lot smarter than Benjamin Nushmutt, he thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they chose up teams for kickball, he was always the first one picked. Mark Miller is a better kicker than Benjamin Nushmutt, he realized.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The girls in the class liked him too. Mark Miller is better looking than Benjamin Nushmutt, he decided.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 55\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But unfortunately, he knew he had to tell Mrs. Jewls his real name. He sighed, then slowly raised his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls gave him a tambourine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had been so busy thinking about his problem, he hadn\u0027t noticed that Mrs. Jewls was passing out musical instruments. She had just asked, \"Who would like the tambourine?\" So when he raised his hand, she gave it to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who would like the triangle?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joe raised his hand, and Mrs. Jewls gave it to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why is it called a triangle?\" asked Joe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe because it\u0027s shaped like a triangle,\" suggested John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, that can\u0027t be it,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Then the tambourine would have to be called a circle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe it was invented by a person named Joe Triangle,\" said Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s probably it,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She held up the next instrument. It was a glockenspiel. \"Who would like the glockenspiel?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sharie raised her hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nobody asked why it was called a glockenspiel. It was obvious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls gave the bells to Stephen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why are they called bells?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nobody knew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 56\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy got the bongo drums. Todd got the bass drum. Jenny snared the snare drum. And Leslie got the kettledrum.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they banged on them, it hurt everybody else\u0027s eardrums.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls gave one cymbal to Calvin and the other cymbal to Bebe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D. J. got the gong. The three Erics got kazoos.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls shouted, \"Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The children all played their instruments. They shook, rattled, rocked, and rolled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy bonged her bongos. D. J. gonged his gong. Sharie glockened her glockenspiel. Stephen jingled his bells. Calvin and Bebe slapped their cymbals together. And Joe\u0027s triangle went ting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But something didn\u0027t sound right.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s wrong, Mark?\" Mrs. Jewls shouted over the music. \"Why aren\u0027t you playing the tambourine?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My name\u0027s not Mark,\" said Benjamin. \"It\u0027s Benjamin Nushmutt. I\u0027m sorry for not telling you before.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"I can\u0027t hear you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My name isn\u0027t Mark!\" he said. \"It\u0027s Benjamin.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louder!\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So everyone played louder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd bashed his bass drum. Leslie cooked on her kettledrum. Calvin and Bebe crashed their cymbals together. And Joe\u0027s triangle went ting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 57\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My name is Benjamin!\" shouted Benjamin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls put her hand to her ear. \"Louder!\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So everyone played louder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. kabonged his gong. Joy chongoed her bongos. Paul splacked his castanets. Jenny spaghettied her snare drum. Calvin and Bebe wammered their cymbals. And Joe\u0027s triangle went ting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My name\u0027s Benjamin Nushmutt,\" hollered Benjamin Nushmutt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louder!\" yelled Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So everyone played louder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The three Erics screamed into their kazoos. Calvin and Bebe ran to opposite sides of the room with their cymbals, then charged toward each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly the door flew open, and a man entered. Benjamin had never seen him before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The whole class became very quiet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was Mr. Kidswatter, the principal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Calvin and Bebe screeched to a halt just in time. Their cymbals were less than an inch apart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is something the matter, Mr. Kidswatter?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Several teachers have complained about your music,\" said Mr. Kidswatter. \"Their students are having trouble hearing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I understand,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good,\" said Mr. Kidswatter.
