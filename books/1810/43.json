Naked. With no one and nothing to disturb us for four blissful hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate pushes her plate back and wipes her mouth elegantly with her napkin. Then she regards me thoughtfully. “I’ve been wondering about something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you wondering?” I’m surprised that my voice is actually level. Considering the crotch of my pants is now painfully snug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember the night we met—at REM?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean forward in my chair and run my finger up and down her bare arm. “Every provocative detail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe likes my answer. She smiles. “What do you think would’ve happened if I had gone home with you that night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force my gaze up from Kate’s impressive rack to meet her eyes. “I would’ve done exactly what I said—given the word pleasure a whole new meaning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what about afterward?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is one of those tricky hypothetical questions women love to pose—just to screw with a guy’s head. “What if you had met my sister first?” “Would you have respected me if I f**ked you on the first date?” “If you could go back in time, would you still marry me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContrary to popular belief, there’s definitely a right way and a wrong way to answer. Unfortunately for men, the honest answer is usually the wrong one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut because I’ve sworn to never lie to Kate again—and because she’ll know if I am frigging lying—I go with the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Afterward, I would’ve paid your cab fare and gone on my own merry, sexually satisfied way home.” I wink. “And I would’ve ranked our night as the best of my life. So far.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t frown, exactly, but the potential is there. Disappointment settles in her brown eyes, and the edges of her smile fall just a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it? So you don’t think we’d be together right now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up her hand and hold it in mine, looking it over before kissing each of her fingertips. “I didn’t say that. Like those of most geniuses, my epiphanies take a little time to settle in. I would’ve spent most of Sunday reminiscing—but by Sunday night, I would’ve started figuring out how to find you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like that, the pre-frown vanishes. “You would’ve wanted seconds?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seconds, thirds, fourths . . . and when I found you at my office on Monday? You can bet your ass my couch would’ve been scandalized much sooner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate leans forward, purposely teasing me with a bird’s-eye view of her cle**age. “What about your rule—Drew Evans doesn’t ride the same roller coaster twice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI enjoy the scenery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve proven beyond a reasonable doubt that when it comes to you, my rules were always meant to be broken. If you were the coaster in question, I would’ve bought the whole f**king amusement park and ridden you until I couldn’t see straight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s free hand slides up my thigh, inching close to the holy land. Her voice is teasing. Playful. “Are you flirting with me, Mr. Evans?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you have to ask, I’m obviously out of practice.” I up my game. “Take your panties off. Right here, right now. Then give them to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow’s that for flirting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand stops its exploration. “I’m afraid I can’t do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t sound shy or shocked. So I know her refusal isn’t because she doesn’t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lewd lightbulb goes on above my head. “You’re not wearing any, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate looks into my eyes. And sexily pops the p as she says, “Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly my finger rises toward the waiter. “Check, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waiter quickly brings the check, and I throw a handful of bills down on the table. In a rush, I stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate giggles. “They’re going to think you’re unhappy about the food, Drew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI help her out of her seat and lower my mouth to her ear. “I don’t give a shit what they think. If I don’t get you out of here right now, I’m going to lay you down on this table and give the other customers a show they’ll never forget.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at my face daringly. “And I’d let you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOblivious of the stares of the patrons and staff, Kate wraps her arms around my neck and kisses me. When her demanding tongue strokes mine, the sensation goes straight to my balls. With my arm around her lower back, I say, “You got all dolled up—I thought you wanted a night out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drew, I haven’t come in six weeks. The only thing I want is your c**k so deep inside me, I can taste it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t actually remember leaving the restaurant after that. Kate’s awesomely dirty revelation must have fried my brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing I know, we’re on the sidewalk and I’m dragging her to the side of the building—to the narrow alley just wide enough to fit a Dumpster that faces the street. I have enough awareness to bring Kate to the far side of it—so we’re shielded from the view of cars and pedestrians. My eyes scan the path for intruders. Finding none, I devote all of my attention to Kate—to making up for all the screwless days she’s endured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand buries itself in her hair, gripping the soft strands, holding her head captive as I plunder her mouth with my tongue. She writhes and rubs against me, pulling my shirt free of my pants and working on my belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s times like this I wish God had made people more like octopuses—six extra hands would be convenient right about now. We’re ravenous for each other—tearing and pulling at annoying clothes, wanting to touch every erogenous zone at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt reminds me of the first time we kissed, that night in my office years ago. It feels the same as that night—I’d wanted Kate, fantasized about her for weeks then too. The difference now is, I know precisely what I’ve been f**king missing. So I’m even hungrier for her, bordering on totally out of control. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tied-tangled-4/page-43.html","bookId":1810,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:39 PM"}
