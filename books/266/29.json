{"id":8071,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 27","content":"0600 Hours, August 29, 2552 (Military Calendar) /Epsilon Eridani System, UNSC Military Reservation01478-B, planet ReachThe firing range was uncharacteristically quiet. Normally, the air would be filled with noise—the sharp,staccato crackle of automatic-weapons fire; the urgent yells of soldiers practicing combat operations;and the barked, curse-laden orders of drill instructors. John frowned as he guided the Warthog to thesecurity checkpoint.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The silence on the combat range was somehow unsettling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Even more unsettling were the extra security personnel; today, there were three times the normal numberof MPs patrolling the gate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John parked the Warthog and was approached by a trio of MPs. “State your business here, sir,” the leadMP demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Without a word, John handed over his papers—orders direct from the top brass. The MP visiblystiffened. “Sir, my apologies. Dr. Halsey and the others are waiting for you at the P and R area.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The guard saluted, and waved the gate open.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On survey maps, the combat training range was listed as “UNSC Military Reservation 01478-B.” Thesoldiers who trained there had a different name for it—“Painland.” John knew the facility well; a greatdeal of the Spartans’ early training had taken place there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The range was divided into three areas: a live-fire obstacle course; a target practice range; and the P\u0026amp;R—“Prep and Recovery” area—which more often than not doubled as an emergency first-aid station.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John had spent plenty of time in the aid station during his training.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief walked briskly to the prefabricated structure. Another pair of MPs, MA5B assaultrifles at the ready, double-checked his credentials before they admitted him to the building.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ah, here at last,” said an unfamiliar voice. “Let’s go, son, on the double, if you please.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John paused; the speaker was an older man, at least in his sixties, in the coveralls and lab coat of a ship’sdoctor. No rank insignia, though, John thought with a twinge of concern. For a moment, the image of hisfellow Spartans—very young, and clubbing, kicking, and beating un-uniformed instructors intounconsciousness flashed into his memory with crystal clarity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who are you, sir?” he asked, his voice cautious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m a Captain in the UNSC Navy, son,” the man said with a thin-lipped smile, “and I’ve no time forspit and polish today. Let’s go.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Captain—and new orders. Good. “Yes, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Captain in the lab coat escorted him into the P\u0026amp;R’s medical bay. “Undress, please,” the man said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John quickly disrobed, then stacked his neatly folded uniform on a nearby gurney. The Captain steppedbehind him and began to swab John’s neck and the back of his head with a foul-smelling liquid. Theliquid felt ice-cold on his skin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A moment later, Dr. Halsey entered. “This will just take a moment, Master Chief. We’re going toupgrade a few components in your standard-issue neural interface. Lie back and remain still, please.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief did as she said. A technician sprayed a topical anesthetic on his neck. The skin tingled,then went cold and numb. The Master Chief felt layers of skin incised, and then a series of distinctclicking sounds that echoed through his skull. There was a brief laser pulse and another spray. He sawsparks, felt the room spin, then a sense of vertigo. His vision blurred; he blinked rapidly and it quicklyreturned to normal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good . . . the procedure is complete,” Dr. Halsey said. “Please follow me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Captain handed the Master Chief a paper gown. He slipped it on and followed the doctor outside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A field command dome had been assembled on the range. Its white fabric walls rippled in the breeze.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ten MPs stood around the structure, assault rifles in hand. The Master Chief noted these weren’t regularMarines. They wore the gold comet insignia of Special Forces Orbital drop Shock Troopers—“Helljumpers.” Tough and iron-disciplined. A flash of memory: the blood of troops—just like these—soaking into the mat of a boxing ring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John felt his adrenaline spike as soon as he saw the soldiers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey approached the MP at the entrance and presented her credentials. They accepted them andscanned her retina and voiceprint, then did the same to the Master Chief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once they confirmed his identify, they immediately saluted—which was technically unnecessary, as theMaster Chief was out of uniform.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did them the courtesy of returning their salute.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The soldiers kept looking around, scanning the field, as if they were expecting something to happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John’s discomfort grew—not much spooked an Orbital drop Shock Trooper.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey led the Master Chief inside. In the center of the dome stood an empty suit of MJOLNIRarmor, suspended between two pillars on a raised platform. The Master Chief knew it was not his suit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His, after years of use, had dents and scratches in the alloy plates and the once iridescent green finishhad dulled to a worn olive brown.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This suit was spotless and its surface possessed a subtle metallic sheen. He noted the armor plates wereslightly thicker, and the black underlayers had a more convoluted weave of components. The fusionpack was half again as large, and tiny luminous slits glowed near the articulation points.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This is the real MJOLNIR,” Dr. Halsey whispered to him. “What you have been using was only afraction of what the armor should be. This—” She turned to the Master Chief. “—is everything I hadalways dreamed it could be. Please put the suit on.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief stripped the paper gown off and—with the help of a pair of technicians—donned thearmor components.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey averted her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Although the armor’s components were bulkier and heavier than his old suit, once assembled andactivated, they felt light as air. The armor was a perfect fit. The biolayer warmed and adhered to his skin,then cooled as the temperature difference between the suit and his skin equalized.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We’ve made hundreds of minor technical improvements,” she said. “I’ll have the specifications sent toyou later. Two of those changes, however, are rather serious modifications to the system. It may take . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e some getting used to.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey’s brow furrowed. John had never seen her worried before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “First,” she told him, “we have replicated, and I might add, improved upon the energy shield theCovenant Jackals have been using against us to great effect.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This armor had shields? The Master Chief had known that ONI research had been working on adaptingCovenant technology; Spartans had standing orders to capture Covenant machines wherever they could.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The researchers and engineers had announced some breakthroughs in artificial gravity—some UNSCships were already undergoing trials with the grav systems.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fact that the MJOLNIR armor possessed shields was a stunning breakthrough. For years, there hadbeen no luck back-engineering Covenant shield tech. Most in the scientific community had given uphope of ever cracking it. Maybe that’s why Dr. Halsey was worried. Maybe they hadn’t worked out allthe bugs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey nodded to the technicians. “Let’s begin.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The techs turned to a series of instrument panels. One, a slightly younger man, donned a COM headset.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Okay, Master Chief.”The tech’s voice crackled through John’s helmet speakers.“There’s an activationicon in your heads-up display. There is also a manual control switch located at position twelve in yourhelmet.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He chinned the control. Nothing happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Wait a moment, please, sir. We have to give the suit an activation charge. After that, it can acceptregenerative power from the fusion pack. Stand on the platform and be absolutely still.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stepped onto the platform that had held the MJOLNIR armor. The pillars flickered on and glowed abrilliant yellow. The pillars started to spin slowly around the base of the platform.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief felt a static charge tingling in his extremities. The glow intensified and his helmet’sblast shield automatically dimmed. The charge in the air intensified; his skin crawled with ionization. Hesmelled ozone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the spinning slowed and the light dimmed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Reset the activation button now, Master Chief.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The air around the Master Chief popped—as if it jumped away from the MJOLNIR armor. There wasnone of the shimmer that normal Covenant shields had. Was it working?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He ran his hand over his arm and encountered resistance a centimeter from the surface of the armor. Itwas working.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How many times had he and his teammates had to find ways to slip past a Jackal’s shield? He’d have torethink his tactics. Rethink everything.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It provides full coverage—”Dr. Halsey’s voice piped through the speakers.“—and dissipates energyfar more efficiently than the Covenant shields the Spartans have recovered, though the shield isconcentrated on your arms, head, legs, chest, and back. The energy field tapers down to a hair under amillimeter so you don’t lose the ability to hold or manipulate items with your hands.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The lead technician activated another control, and new data scrawled across John’s display.“There’s asegmented bar in the upper corner of your HUD,”the technician said,“right next to your biomonitor andammunition indicators. It indicates the charge level of your shield. Don’t let it completely dissipate;when it’s gone, the armor starts taking the hits.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief slipped off the platform. He skidded—then came to a halt. His movements felt oiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His contact with the floor felt tentative.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You can adjust the bottom of your boot emitters as well as the emitters inside your gloves to increasetraction. In normal use, you will want to set these to the minimal level—just be aware your defenses willbe diminished in those locations.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Understood.” He adjusted the field strengths. “In zero-gee environment I should increase those sectionsto full strength, correct?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is correct,”Dr. Halsey said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How much damage can they take before the system is breached?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is what you will learn here today, Master Chief. I think you’ll find that we have several challengesin store for you to see how much punishment the suit can take.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He nodded. He was ready for the challenge. After weeks spent traveling in Slipspace, he was longoverdue for a workout.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John slid back his helmet visor and turned to face Dr. Halsey. “You said there weretwo major systemimprovements, Doctor?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She nodded and smiled. “Yes, of course. ” She reached into her lab coat and withdrew a clear cube. “Idoubt you’ve ever seen one of these before. It is the memory-processor core of an AI.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Like Déjà?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, like your former teacher. But this AI is slightly different. I’d like to introduce you to Cortana.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief looked around the tent. He saw no computer interface or holographic projectors. Hecocked an eyebrow at Dr. Halsey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There is a new layer sandwiched between the reactive circuits and the inner biolayers of your armor,”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey explained. “It is a weave of additional memory-processor super-conductor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The same material as an AI’s core.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” Dr. Halsey replied. “An accurate analysis. Your armor will carry Cortana. The MJOLNIR systemhas the nearly the same capacity as a ship-borne AI system. Cortana will interface between you and thesuit and provide tactical and strategic information for you in the field.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m not sure I understand.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Cortana has been programmed with every ONI computer insurgency routine,” Dr. Halsey told him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And she has a talent for modifying them on the fly. She has our best Covenant-language-translationsoftware as well. Her primary purpose is to infiltrate their computer and communications systems. Shewill intercept and decode point-to-point Covenant transmissions and give you updated intelligence in thefield.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Intel support in an operation where there had been no reconnaissance. The Master Chief liked that. Itwould level the playing field significantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This AI is the computer specialist we’ll be taking onto the Covenant ship,” the Master Chief said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes . . . and more. Her presence will allow you to utilize the suit more effectively.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John had a sudden flash—AIs handled a great deal of point defense during Naval operations. “Can shecontrol the MJOLNIR armor?” He wasn’t sure he liked that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No. Cortana resides in the interface between your mind and the suit, Master Chief. You will find yourreaction time greatly improved. She will be translating the impulses in your motor cortex directly intomotion—she can’t make you send those impulses.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This AI,” he said, “will beinside my mind?” That must have been what that “upgrade” to his standardissueUNSC computer interface had been for.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is the question, isn’t it?” Halsey replied. “I can’t answer that, Master Chief. Not scientifically.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m not sure I understand, Doctor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What is the mind, really? Intuition, reason, emotion—we acknowledge they exist, but we still don’tknow what makes the human mindwork .” She paused, searching for the right words. “We model AIs onhuman neural networks—on electrical signals in the brain—because we just know that the human brainworks . . . but not how, or why. Cortana resides ‘between’ your mind and the suit, interpreting theelectrochemical messages in your brain and transferring them to the suit via your neural implant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So, for lack of a better term, yes, Cortana will be ‘inside’ your mind.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ma’am, my priority will be to complete this mission. This AI—Cortana—may have conflictingdirectives.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There is no need to worry, Master Chief. Cortana has the same mission parameters as you do. She willdo anything necessary to make sure that your mission is accomplished. Even if that means sacrificingherself—or you—to accomplish it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief exhaled, relieved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now, please kneel down. It’s time to insert her memory-processor matrix into the socket at the base ofyour neck.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief knelt. There was a hissing noise, a pop, and then cold liquid poured into the MasterChief’s mind; a spike of pain jammed into his forehead, then faded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not a lot of room in here,” a smooth female voice said. “Hello, Master Chief.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did this AI have a rank? Certainly, she was not a civilian—or a fellow soldier. Should he treat her likeany other piece of UNSC-issued equipment? Then again, he treated his equipment with the respect itdeserved. He made sure every gun and knife was cleaned and inspected after every mission.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was unsettling . . . he could hear Cortana’s voice through his helmet speakers, but it also felt like shewas speaking inside his head. “Hello, Cortana.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hmm . . . I’m detecting a high degree of cerebral cortex activity. You’re not the muscle-boundautomatons the press makes you out to be.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Automaton?” the Master Chief whispered. “Interesting choice of words for an artificial intelligence.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey watched the Master Chief with great interest. “You must forgive Cortana, Master Chief. Sheis somewhat high-spirited. You may have to allow for behavioral quirks.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, ma’am.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I think we should begin the test straightaway. There’s no better way for the two of you to getacquainted than in simulated combat.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No one said anything about combat,” Cortana said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The ONI brass have arranged a test for you and the new MJOLNIR system,” Dr. Halsey said. “Thereare some that believe you two are not up to our proposed mission.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ma’am!” The Master Chief snapped to attention. “I’m up for it, ma’am!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I know you are, Master Chief. Others . . . require proof.” She looked around at the shadows cast by theMarines outside the fabric walls of the command dome. “You hardly need a reminder to be prepared foranything . . . but stay on your guard, just the same.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey’s voice dropped to a whisper. “I think some of the ONI brass would prefer to see you fail thistest, Master Chief. And they may have arranged to make sure you do—regardless of your performance.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I won’t fail, Doctor.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her forehead wrinkled with worry lines, but then they quickly disappeared. “I know you won’t.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She stepped back, and dropped her conspiratorial whisper. “Master Chief, you are ordered to count toten after I leave. After that, make your way to the obstacle course. At the far end is a bell. Your goal willbe to ring it.” She paused, then added, “You are authorized to neutralize any threats in order to achievethis objective.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Affirmative,” the Master Chief said. Enough uncertainty—now he had an objective, and rules ofengagement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Be careful, Master Chief,” Dr. Halsey said quietly. She gestured at the pair of technicians to follow her,then turned and walked out of the tent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief didn’t understand why Dr. Halsey thought he was in real danger—he didn’t have tounderstand the reason. All he needed to know was that danger was present.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He knew how to handle danger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Uploading combat protocols now,” Cortana said. “Initiating electronic detection algorithms. Boostingneural interface performance to eighty-five percent. I’m ready when you are, Master Chief.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief heard metallic clacks around the tent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Analyzing sound pattern,” Cortana said. “Database match.Identified as—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “As someone cycling the bolt of an MA5B assault rifle. I know. Standard-issue weapons for Orbitaldrop Shock Troopers.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Since you’re ‘in the know,’ Master Chief,” Cortana quipped. “I assume you have a plan.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John snapped his helmet visor back down and sealed the armor’s environment system. “Yes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Presumably your plan doesn’t involve getting shot . . . ?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So, what’s the plan?” Cortana sounded worried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m going to finish counting to ten.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John heard Cortana sigh in frustration. John shook his head in puzzlement. He’d never encountered a socalledsmart AI before. Cortana sounded . . . like a human.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Worse, she sounded like acivilian . This was going to take a lot of getting used to.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shadows moved along the wall of the tent—motion from outside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a snag in this mission and he hadn’t even reached the obstacle course. He would have toengage his fellow soldiers. He pushed aside any questions about why. He had his orders and he wouldfollow them. He had dealt with ODSTs before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three soldiers entered the tent, moving in slow motion—black-armored figures, helmets snug over theirfaces, crouched low, and their rifles leveled. Two took flanking positions. The one in the middle openedfire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ten.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief blurred into motion. He dove from the activation platform and—before the soldierscould adjust their aim—landed in their midst. He rolled to his feet right next to the soldier who firedfirst, and grabbed the man’s rifle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John brutally yanked the weapon away from the soldier. There was a loud cracking sound as the man’sshoulder dislocated. The wounded trooper stumbled forward, off balance. John spun the rifle andslammed the butt of the weapon into the soldier’s side. The man exhaled explosively as his ribs cracked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He grunted, and fell unceremoniously to the floor, unconscious.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John spun to face the left-flank gunner, assault rifle leveled at the man’s head instantly. He had the manin his sights, but he still had time—the soldier was not quite in position. To John’s enhanced senses,amped up by Cortana and the neural interface, the rifleman seemed to be moving in slow motion. Tooslow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief lashed out with the rifle butt again. The trooper’s head snapped back from the sudden,powerful blow. He flipped head over tail and slammed into the ground. John sized the man’s conditionup with a practiced eye: shock, concussion, fractured vertebrae.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gunner number two was out of the fight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The remaining gunner completed his turn and opened fire. A three-round burst ricocheted off theMJOLNIR armor’s energy shield. The shield’s recharge bar flickered a hairbreadth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before the soldier could react, the Master Chief sidestepped and slammed his own rifle down—hard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The trooper screamed as his leg gave out. A jagged spoke of bone burst through the wounded man’sfatigues. The Master chief finished him with a rifle butt to his helmeted head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John checked the condition of the rifle, and—satisfied that it was in working order—began to pull ammoclips from the fallen soldiers’ belt pouches. The lead soldier also carried a razor-edged combat knife;John grabbed it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You could have killed them,” Cortana said. “Why didn’t you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My orders gave me permission to ‘neutralize’ threats,” he replied. “They aren’t threats anymore.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Semantics,” Cortana replied. She sounded amused. “I can’t argue with the results, though—” She brokeoff, suddenly. “New targets. Seven contacts on the motion tracker,” Cortana reported. “We’resurrounded.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Seven more soldiers. The Master Chief could open fire now and kill them all. Under any othercircumstances, he would have removed such threats. But their MA5Bs were no immediate danger tohim . . . and the UNSC could use every soldier to fight the Covenant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He strode to the center pole of the tent, and with a yank, he pulled it free. As the roof fluttered down, heslashed a slit in the tent fabric and shoved through.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He faced three Marines; they fired—the Master Chief deftly jumped to one side. He sprang toward themand lashed out with the steel pole, swiped out their legs. He heard bones crack—followed by screams ofpain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief turned as the tent finished collapsing. The remaining four men could see him now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One reached for a grenade on his belt. The other three tracked him with their assault rifles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief threw the pole like a javelin at the man with the grenade. It impacted in his sternumand he fell with awhoopf.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The grenade, minus the pin, however, dropped to the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief moved and kicked the grenade. It arced over the parking lot and detonated in a cloudof smoke and shrapnel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The three remaining Marines opened fire—spraying bullets in a full-auto fusillade. Bullets pinged offthe Master Chief’s shield.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The shield status indicator blinked and dropped with each bullet impact—the sustained weapons fire wasdraining the shield precipitously. John tucked and rolled, narrowly avoiding an incoming burst ofautomatic-weapons fire, then sprang at the nearest Marine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John launched an openhanded strike at the man’s chest. The Marine’s ribs caved in and he droppedwithout a sound, blood flowing from his mouth. John spun, brought his rifle up, and fired twice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The second soldier screamed and dropped his rifle as the bullets tore through each knee. John kicked thediscarded rifle, bending the barrel and rendering the weapon useless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The last man stood frozen in place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief didn’t give the man time to recover; he grabbed his rifle, ripped off his bandolier ofgrenades, then punched his helmet. The Marine dropped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mission time plus twenty-two seconds,” Cortana remarked. “Although, technically, you started to moveforty milliseconds before you were ordered to.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll keep that in mind.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief slung the assault rifle and bandolier of grenades over his shoulder and ran for theshadows of the barracks. He slipped under the raised buildings and belly-crawled toward the obstaclecourse. No need to make himself a target for snipers . . . although it would be an interesting test to seewhat caliber of bullet these shields could deflect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No. That kind of thinking was dangerous. The shield was useful, but under combined fire it droppedvery quickly. He was tough . . . not invincible.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He emerged at the beginning to the obstacle course. The first part was a run over ten acres of jaggedgravel. Sometimes raw recruits had to take off their boots before they crossed. Other than the pain—itwas the easiest part of the course.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief started toward the gravel yard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Wait,” Cortana said. “I’m picking up far infrared signals on your thermal sensors. An encryptedsequence . . . decoding . . . yes, there. It’s an activation signal for a Lotus mine. They’ve mined the field,Master Chief.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief froze. He’d used Lotus mines before and knew the damage they could inflict. Theshaped charges ripped though the armor plate of a tank like it was no thicker than an orange peel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This would slow him down considerably.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not crossing the obstacle course was no option. He had his orders. He wouldn’t cheat and go around. Hehad to prove that he and Cortana were up for this test.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Any ideas?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I thought you’d never ask,” Cortana replied. “Find the position of one mine, and I can estimate therough position of the others based on the standard randomization procedure used by UNSC engineers.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Understood.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief grabbed a grenade, pulled the pin, counted to three, and lobbed it into the middle ofthe field. It bounced and exploded—sending a shock wave through the ground—tripping two of theLotus mines. Twin plumes of gravel and dust shot into the air. The detonation shook his teeth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He wondered if the armor’s shields could have survived that. He didn’t want to find out while he wasstill inside the thing. He boosted the field strength on the bottom of his boots to full.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cortana overlaid a grid on his heads-up display. Lines flickered as she ran through the possiblepermutations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Got a match!” she said. Two dozen red circles appeared on his display. “That’s ninety-three percentaccurate. The best I can do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There are never any guarantees,” the Master Chief replied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stepped onto the gravel, taking short, deliberate steps. With the shields activated on the bottoms ofhis boots, it felt like he was skating on greased ice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He kept his head down, picking his way between red dots on his display.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If Cortana was wrong, he probably wouldn’t even know it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief saw the gravel had ended. He looked up. He had made it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thank you, Cortana. Well done.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re welcome . . .” Her voice trailed off. “Picking up scrambled radio frequencies on the D band.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Encrypted orders from this facility to Fairchild Airfield. They’re using personal codewords, too—so Ican’t tell what they’re up to. Whatever it is, I don’t like it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Keep your ears open.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I always do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He ran to the next section of the obstacle course: the razor field. Here, recruits had to crawl in the mudunder razor wire as their instructors fired live rounds over them. A lot of soldiers discovered whetherthey had the guts to deal with bullets zinging a centimeter over their heads.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Along either side of the course there was something new: three 30mm chain-guns mounted on tripods.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Weapons emplacements are targeting us, Chief!” Cortana announced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief wasn’t about to wait and see if those chain-guns had a minimum-depth setting. He hadno intention of crawling across the field and letting the chain-guns’ rapid rate of fire chip away at hisshields.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The chain-guns clicked and started to turn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sprinted to the nearest tripod-mounted gun. He opened fire with his assault fire, shot the lines thatpowered the servos—then spun the chain-gun around to face the others.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He crouched behind the blast shield and unloaded on the adjacent gun. Chain-guns were notoriouslyhard to aim; they were best known for their ability to fill the air with gunfire. Cortana adjusted histargeting reticle to sync up with the chain-gun. With her help, he hit the adjacent weapon emplacements.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John guided a stream of fire into the guns’ ammo packs. Moments later, in a cloud of fire and smoke, theguns fell silent . . . then toppled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief ducked, primed a grenade, and hurled it at the closest of the remaining automatedweapons. The grenade sailed through the air—then detonated just above the autogun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Chain-gun destroyed,” Cortana reported.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two more grenades and the automated guns were out of commission. He noted that his shields haddropped by a quarter. He watched the status bar refill. He hadn’t even known he had taken hits. That wassloppy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You seem to have the situation under control,” Cortana said, “I’m going to spend a few cycles andcheck something out.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Permission granted,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I didn’t ask, Master Chief,” she replied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cool liquid presence in his mind withdrew. The Master Chief felt empty somehow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He ran through the razor fields, snapping through steel wire as if it were rotten string.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cortana’s coolness once again flooded his thoughts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I just accessed SATCOM,” she said. “I’m using one of their satellites so I can get a better look atwhat’s happening down here. There’s a SkyHawk jump jet from Fairchild Field inbound.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stopped. The automatic cannons were one thing—could the armor withstand against air power likethat? The SkyHawk had a quartet of 50mm cannons that made the chain-guns look like peashooters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They also had Scorpion missiles—designed to take out tanks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Answer: he couldn’t do a thing against it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief ran. He had to find cover. He sprinted to the next section of the course: the Pillars ofLoki.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a forest of ten-meter-tall poles spaced at random intervals. Typically, the poles had booby trapsstrung on, under, and between them—stun grades, sharpened sticks . . . anything the instructors coulddream up. The idea was to teach recruits to move slowly and keep their eyes open.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief had no time to search for the traps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He climbed up the first pole and balanced on top. He leaped to the next pole, teetered, regained hisbalance—then jumped to the next. His reflexes had to be perfect; he was landing a half ton of man andarmor on a wooden pole ten centimeters in diameter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Motion tracking is picking up an incoming target at extreme range,” Cortana warned. “Velocity profilematches the SkyHawk, Chief.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned—almost lost his balance and had to shift back and forth to keep from falling. There was a doton the horizon, and the faint rumble of thunder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the blink of an eye, the dot had wings and the Master Chief’s thermal sensors picked up a plume ofjetwash. In seconds, the SkyHawk closed—then opened fire with its 50mm cannons.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He jumped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The wooden poles splintered into pulp. They were mowed down like so many blades of grass.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief rolled, ducked, and flattened himself on the earth. He caught a smattering of roundsand his shield bar drooped to half. Those rounds would have penetrated his old suit instantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cortana said, “I calculate we have eleven seconds before the SkyHawk can execute a maximum gee turnand make another pass.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief got up and ran through the shattered remains of the poles. Napalm and sonic grenadespopped around him, but he moved so fast he left the worst of the damage in his wake.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “They won’t use their cannons next time,” he said. “They didn’t take us out—they’ll try the missiles.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Perhaps,” Cortana suggested, “we should leave the course. Find better cover.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” he said. “We’re going to win . . . by their rules.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The last leg of the course was a sprint across an open field. In the distance, the Master Chief saw the bellon a tripod.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He glanced over his shoulder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The SkyHawk was back and starting its run straight toward him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Even with his augmented speed, even with the MJOLNIR armor—he’d never make it to the bell in time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He’d never make it alive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned to face the incoming jet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll need your help, Cortana,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Anything,” she whispered. The Master Chief heard nervousness in the AI’s voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Calculate the inbound velocity of a Scorpion missile. Factor in my reaction time and the jet’s inboundspeed and distance at launch, and tell me the instant I need to move to sidestep and deflect it with myleft arm.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cortana paused a heartbeat. “Calculation done. You did say ‘deflect’?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Scorpion missiles have motion-tracking sensors and proximity detonators. I can’t outrun it. And itwon’t miss. That leaves us very few options.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The SkyHawk dove.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Get ready,” Cortana said. “I hope you know what you’re doing.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Me, too.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Smoke appeared from the jet’s left wingtip and fire and exhaust erupted as a missile streaked toward him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief saw the missile’s track back and forth, zeroing in on his coordinates. A shrill tone inhis helmet warbled—the missile had a guidance lock on him. He chinned a control and the sound diedout. The missile was fast. Faster than he was ten times over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now!” Cortana said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They moved together. He shifted his muscles and the MJOLNIR—augmented by his link to Cortana—moved faster than he’d ever moved before. His leg tensed and pushed him aside; his left arm came upand crossed his chest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The head of the missile was the only thing he saw. The air grew still and thickened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He continued to move his hand, palm open in a slapping motion—as fast as he could will his flesh toaccelerate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The tip of the Scorpion missile passed a centimeter from his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He reached out—fingertips brushed the metal casing——and slapped it aside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The SkyHawk jet screamed over his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Scorpion missile detonated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Pressure slammed though his body. The Master Chief flew six meters, spinning end over end, andlanded flat on his back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He blinked, and saw nothing but blackness. Was he dead? Had he lost?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The shield status bar in his heads-up display pulsed weakly. It was completely drained—then it blinkedred and slowly started to refill. Blood was spattered across the inside of his helmet and he tasted copper.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stood, his muscles screaming in protest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Run!” Cortana said. “Before they come back for a look.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief got up and ran. As he passed the spot where he had stood to face down the missile, hesaw a two-meter-deep crater.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He could feel his Achilles tendon tear, but he didn’t slow. He crossed the half-kilometer stretch inseventeen seconds flat and skidded to halt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief grabbed the bell’s cord and rang it three times. The pure tone was the most glorioussound he had ever heard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Over the COM channel Dr. Halsey’s voice broke:“Test concluded. Call off your men, Colonel Ackerson!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We’ve won. Well done, Master Chief. Magnificent! Stay there; I’m sending out a recovery team.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, ma’am,” he replied, panting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief scanned the sky for the SkyHawk—nothing. It had gone. He knelt and let blood dripfrom his nose and mouth. He looked down at the bell—and laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He knew that stainless-steel dented shape. It was the same one he had rung that first day of boot. Theday Chief Mendez had taught him about teamwork.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Thank you, Cortana,” he finally said. “I couldn’t have done it without you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re welcome, Master Chief,” she replied. Then, her voice full of mischief, she added: “And no, youcouldn’t have done it without me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Today he had learned about a new kind of teamwork with Cortana. Dr. Halsey had given him a greatgift. She had given him a weapon with which to destroy the Covenant.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/975/29440.html","bookId":266,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:12:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:12:52 AM"}
