Ng pulls his van off the access road, into a little nook that is partly concealed between an old red-brick power station and a stack of rusted-out shipping containers. He gets it turned around so it\u0027s pointed out of here, kind of like he is expecting to leave rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s money in the storage compartment in front of you,\" Ng says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eY.T. opens the glove compartment, as anyone else would call it, and finds a thick bundle of worn-out, dirty, trillion-dollar bills.
