Tripp called at nine every night. It was the only way I kept myself sane. Listening to him tell me about what she was doing, what she was saying, and even what she was wearing was the only way I held on to my last shreds of sanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment Tripp\u0027s name lit up the screen I answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how is she?\" I didn\u0027t care about small talk. I had decided not to find Tripp and break all the limbs from his body when he\u0027d called me the first time and promised to keep me updated on Della. He said she needed time to deal with things and I needed to give her that. I was trying like hell but I wanted to go to her. Every time he told me which city they were in, I fought the need to jump on a plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was quiet today. Didn\u0027t talk much and couldn\u0027t wait to get rid of me. She\u0027s depressed but this is just another stage for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Memphis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you checked into a hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. She\u0027s in the room. I\u0027m out, giving her some space tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving her space? Alone, in a strange city? \"What the fuck are you thinking? You can\u0027t leave her alone! If she\u0027s been quiet she may be closing in on herself. You can\u0027t leave her alone. She\u0027ll need someone to bring her back. She can\u0027t---\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woods! Calm down, man. Calm down.\" Tripp\u0027s voice was commanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t be alone,\" I said again as emotion lodged in my throat. I hated to think of her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She needs to be alone. She needs to cry. She needs to decide if giving you this freedom she thinks you need is going to be possible. Her leaving is all about you, Woods. She didn\u0027t want to leave you. I\u0027ve told you that already. She loves you so much that she left to give you the life she thinks you want. One where you don\u0027t have to deal with her shit. So, now that she\u0027s done that, she has to live with it. Give her time. She\u0027ll come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had set my beer down and stood up. Gripping the railing, I closed my eyes and fought back the pain. I just wanted her. Just Della. Any way I could have her, I wanted her. I wasn\u0027t ever going to be all right. I didn\u0027t want her to be alone. I wanted someone to hold her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold her for me. Hold her tight. Don\u0027t let her be lonely. Don\u0027t let her hurt. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will do what she allows me to do. But my arms aren\u0027t the ones she wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck,\" I growled as sharp pains wrapped around my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give her more time,\" Tripp said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took several long, steadying breaths. He had to get back to her. He couldn\u0027t leave her alone like this. \"When we hang up, go back to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTripp sighed. \"Fine. But I had plans tonight. There\u0027s a hot little bartender giving me the eye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you need more money?\" I asked him. I had been depositing money into his account since he had called the first night. I wanted her in nice hotels and I wanted her to eat well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s going to notice soon that we aren\u0027t running out of money. I keep waiting for her to bring up the fact that we stay in the nicest part of each town and eat in high-end restaurants instead of fast-food chains. She\u0027s not an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m holding on by a damn thread. Your phone calls and the fact I know she\u0027s in nice hotels and eating good food is the only fucking thing keeping me sane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to see if I can convince her to go back to my place in South Carolina with me. I have a nice place there. It\u0027s safe and I have a job I can go back to. I can get her a job, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just wanted her to come home. \"Whatever you need to do. But she stays safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m keeping her safe. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You took her from me,\" I reminded him. I couldn\u0027t thank him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked me to. I\u0027m her friend, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She needs me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, dude. Right now, she needs to find the strength inside herself. The strength she doesn\u0027t think is there. Once she realizes that she isn\u0027t a burden, she\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has to,\" I said, then ended the call before Tripp heard the pain in my voice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-19.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
