I\u0027ll call you if he calls me, and you do the same. I mean, I\u0027m sitting tight here and that\u0027s cool, but I wish I knew what was going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You up for anything? You want me to drive you anywhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have asked me sooner. I just got back from Williamsburg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t mean Williamsbridge, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean Williamsburg in Brooklyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Cause the Williamsbridge neighborhood\u0027s just the other side of the Bronx River Parkway, though I can\u0027t think why you\u0027d want to go there. And neither could you, obviously, because you didn\u0027t. Why Williamsburg, and what did you do, take the Williamsburg Bridge? They been fixing that thing forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I took the L train.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have called me. You know what I think I\u0027ll do? I think I\u0027ll put Mick\u0027s car back in the garage before my twenty bucks runs out and it gets swiped by the kid I hired to watch it. But I\u0027m serious, you want a ride, gimme a call. There\u0027s always a car I can take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep it in mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And keep in touch,\" he said. \"What happened the other night…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you were there, weren\u0027t you? Stay close, Matt. We got to watch each other\u0027s back, next little while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught TJ in his room and met him at the Starbucks on Broadway and Eighty-seventh. He was already there when I arrived, sitting at a table with an iced mochaccino, wearing black jeans and a black shirt with a pink necktie an inch wide, all topped off with a Raiders warm-up jacket and a black beret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had to stop and change clothes,\" he said, \"an\u0027 I still beat you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re greased lightning,\" I said. \"What did you change out of that was less appropriate than what you\u0027ve got on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think this here\u0027s appropriate? For where we goin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s as appropriate as that sad old zip-up jacket of yours. What I had on earlier was camo pants and my flak jacket, and that was very appropriate for where I was at, but not for Mother Blue\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flushing. See a girl I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you mean, \u0027Oh\u0027? I was on the clock, Brock. I was gettin\u0027 the job done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girl\u0027s got a black daddy, Vietnamese mama. Her face tends to break out. Wasn\u0027t for that, she could be a model. Girl is seriously fine lookin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vietnamese…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got it. She had a brother was in Born To Kill, an\u0027 she used to know all those dudes. Guy who shot up the bar Sunday was Nguyen Tran Bao. Very violent cat, what she said, but we already knew that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"He seemed like such a nice quiet boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did his robbery and assault bit at Attica, an\u0027 when he came back he wasn\u0027t exactly rehabilitated. Matter of fact, he was hangin\u0027 out with a white dude he got to know upstate, and the general impression was the two of them was doin\u0027 bad things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A white dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very white, and what you call moon-faced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bomb thrower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I was thinkin\u0027, Lincoln.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she happen to know his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Only way she knew what Goo been up to since prison is she made some phone calls. She pretty much lost touch with BTK when she moved out of Chinatown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goo? Is that what they call Nguyen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I call him, \u0027cause it a whole lot easier to say. Anyway, I be callin\u0027 her tomorrow, see if she found anybody could come up with a name to go with his face. Even if she can\u0027t, we got Goo\u0027s full name an\u0027 we know where he went to college.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe the dean will give us a transcript of his record,\" I said. \"You did good work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just part of the service,\" he said, and lowered his head and sucked up the rest of his mochaccino. \"Now what? We gonna hear some old people\u0027s music?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group on the small stage was a quartet, an alto sax and a rhythm section, and they were as white as I was and almost as white as Danny Boy. They all wore black suit jackets and white dress shirts and faded jeans, and I somehow knew they were European, though I\u0027m not sure how I could tell. Their haircuts, maybe, or something in their faces. They finished the set and the audience, about three-quarters black, was generous with its applause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were Polish, Danny Boy told me. \"I have this mental picture,\" he said. \"This kid\u0027s sitting in his mother\u0027s kitchen in Warsaw, listening to this tinny little radio. And it\u0027s Bird and Dizzy playing \u0027Night in Tunisia,\u0027 and the kid\u0027s foot starts tapping, and right then and there he knows what he wants to do with his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess that\u0027s how it happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows how it happens? But I have to say they can play.\" He glanced across the table at TJ. \"But I suppose you\u0027re more a fan of rap and hip-hop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mostly,\" TJ said, \"Ah likes to go down by de river an\u0027 sing dem good ol\u0027 Negro spirituals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny Boy\u0027s eyes brightened. \"Matthew,\" he said, \"this young man will go far. Unless, of course, someone shoots him.\" He helped himself to a little vodka. \"I made some inquiries. The person who caused that unpleasantness in the Chinese restaurant the other night is a disillusioned and bitterly disappointed young man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems he got half his money in advance,\" he said, \"upon acceptance of the assignment, with the balance due on completion. As far as he\u0027s concerned, he completed the job. He went where he was told to go and did what he was supposed to do. How was he to know there were two gentlemen in the restaurant fitting the same description? There was in fact only one such gentleman to be seen when he entered, and he dealt with the man accordingly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they don\u0027t want to pay him the rest of his money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not only that, but they\u0027ve had the effrontery to ask for a refund of their initial payment. Not, I shouldn\u0027t think, with any realistic expectation of receiving it, but as a sort of counter to his demand for payment in full.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTJ nodded. \"Somebody ask you for money, you turn around an\u0027 ask him for money. An\u0027 maybe he go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That seems the theory,\" Danny Boy said. \"I think they should have paid the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep him from runnin\u0027 his mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. But they didn\u0027t and he did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do they owe him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two thousand dollars,\" Danny Boy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two thousand still owing? Out of four?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess you ain\u0027t worth much,\" TJ said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get what you pay for,\" Danny Boy said. He took a sheet of paper from his wallet, put on reading glasses and squinted through them. \"Chilton Purvis,\" he read. \"My guess is they call him Chili, but maybe not. He\u0027s living at 117 Tapscott, third floor rear. I never heard of Tapscott Street myself, but it\u0027s supposed to be in Brooklyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is,\" I said. \"Right around where Crown Heights butts up against Brownsville.\" His eyebrows rose, and I said I\u0027d worked there years ago. \"Not in the same precinct, but close enough. I don\u0027t remember a thing about Tapscott Street specifically, and I suppose it\u0027s changed since then anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What hasn\u0027t? A lot of Haitians in the area these days, and Guyanese, and folks from Ghana and Senegal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All looking to make a better life for themselves,\" TJ said, \"in this land of opportunity for all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s afraid the police are coming for him,\" Danny Boy said, \"or that his employers will show up to seal his lips with a bullet. So he stays in his room all the time. Except when he gets the urge to party and smoke crack and run his mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose he could pick up the two thou he\u0027s got coming just by fingering the man who stiffed him. You think he\u0027d go for that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d be a fool not to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We already know he a fool,\" TJ said. \"Killin\u0027 folks for chump change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll want to show him a sketch,\" I said. \"But first let me show you, Danny Boy.\" I opened the envelope, got out one of the copies of Ray\u0027s drawing of the slugger. He studied it through his reading glasses, then took them off and held it at arm\u0027s length.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nasty,\" he decided, \"and not too bright.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And nobody you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately not, but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if he and I have friends in common. May I keep this, Matthew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can let you have a couple of extras,\" I said. I counted out three or four for him, and passed one to TJ, who was edging over for a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know him,\" he said without hesitation. \"Who the other dude?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What other dude?\" Danny Boy wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI produced the second sketch. \"Just an exercise,\" I said, and explained how Ray Galindez had drawn it to clear my mind. But it hadn\u0027t worked, I said, in that I\u0027d still been unable to summon up the face of the second mugger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny Boy looked at the second sketch, shook his head, passed it back. TJ said, \"I\u0027s seen him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Round the neighborhood. Can\u0027t say where or when, but he got one of those faces sticks in your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must be it,\" I said. \"I caught a glimpse of him last week in Grogan\u0027s, and I thought he looked familiar, and it\u0027s probably because I\u0027d seen him the same as you did. And you\u0027re right, he\u0027s definitely got one of those faces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All those strong features,\" Danny Boy said, \"and you don\u0027t expect to find them all on the same face, do you? That nose shouldn\u0027t go with that mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave TJ a sketch of the slugger and folded one and tucked it in my wallet. As an afterthought I added a copy of the second sketch as well. I put everything else back in the padded mailing envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at my watch, and Danny Boy said, \"The band\u0027ll be back in a couple of minutes. You want to catch the next set?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking I might go over to Brooklyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To see our friend? You might find him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if not I could wait for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep you company,\" TJ said. \"He ain\u0027t in, you can tell me stories to pass the time, an\u0027 I can pretend I ain\u0027t heard \u0027em before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Past your bedtime,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need someone to watch your back, Jack, \u0027specially when you\u0027s the wrong skin tone for the neighborhood. An\u0027 if you\u0027s to brace this dude Chili, you got to know two\u0027s better than one.\" At the concern in my face, he said, \"Hey, I\u0027ll be safe. You armed and dangerous, man. You\u0027ll protect me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just stay away from parked cars,\" Danny Boy said, and we both stared at him. \"Oh, from when I was a kid,\" he said. \"I told you about my list, right? Well, when I was growing up there were always a few kids every year who got run over by cars, and the cops sent someone around every spring and every fall to tell the schoolkids about traffic safety. You ever pull that detail, Matthew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was spared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027d be this slide show, and an explanation of how each victim bought it. \u0027Mary Louise, age seven. Ran from between parked cars.\u0027 And half the time or more, that was it, running out from between parked cars. Because the motorist didn\u0027t see you coming.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-27.html","bookId":2332,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:35 AM"}
