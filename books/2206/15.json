I wasn\u0027t much impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The word \u0027limbo\u0027 is a mortal term used by some religions to express the concept of the Akasha, something most people have difficulty understanding,\" the small boy next to me said as we walked down a rocky hillside. He waved his hand at the sparse landscape around us. \"The Akasha is more than limbo. It is a place few visit, and from which even fewer return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? What sorts of things do people have to do to get sent here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy\u0027s face gave away no emotion. \"The Akasha is a place of punishment, Portia Harding. The ultimate place of punishment. To my memory, the sovereign has granted respite from its confines to only three people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only three in that many millions of years?\" I shivered. \"Right, so note to self - don\u0027t do anything to piss the mare off enough to be sent here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be a very wise policy to follow. If you would walk this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI obligingly followed him as he carefully picked a way through a rocky stretch that led to a faint path. \"The last thing I remember before I found myself here was you saying I had to die. Are you implying that I\u0027m dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tipped his head to the side for a moment, then continued walking. \"Do you feel dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I feel annoyed.\" Ahead of us, in a shallow valley, a large outcropping of rock jutted out of the earth. The wind whipped around us, cutting through my clothing and stinging my flesh with tiny little whips of pain. \"And cold. What are we doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the site of your trial. As you implied, it is difficult for the layperson to weigh the purity of someone\u0027s being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumbled over a clod of earth, quickly regaining my balance, but looking warily at the rocky outcropping as we slowly wound our way through the deserted valley floor toward it. \"So you decided on a trial by endurance, is that it? If I make it to those rocks there in one piece, I pass the trial?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my complete surprise, the boy nodded his head. \"Yes. That\u0027s it exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid a few feet down a graveled slope, my arms cartwheeling as I struggled to maintain my balance. \"You\u0027re kidding!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, indeed I\u0027m not.\" He stopped next to a spiky, stunted, leafless shrub, and nodded toward the outcropping. \"I can take you no further. The rest of this trial you must conduct on your own. The circle of Akasha there is your goal. Good luck, Portia Harding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unspoken words, \"You\u0027re going to need it,\" hung in the air, but I ignored them as I eyeballed the rocks approximately three hundred feet away. I decided a little mental support was in order, and reached out my mind to Theo. I\u0027m not so proud I can\u0027t admit that I\u0027m a bit frightened by this. They can\u0027t do anything to permanently harm me, can they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind was all the answer I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo? Are you there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words evaporated into nothing. It was as if he didn\u0027t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t I talk to Theo?\" I asked the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to know that I was referring to our mental form of communication. \"Such a thing is not possible in the Akasha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lovely. So, I just walk there? That\u0027s all I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Once you reach the circle of Akasha, the trial will be over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll be sent back to the Court?\" Something wasn\u0027t right here. It couldn\u0027t be this easy. Could it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That depends on you,\" he said enigmatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to ask him a question or five, but decided that stalling would do nothing but give me a case of exposure in this horrible cold. I rubbed my hands on my arms briskly, nodded, and took four steps forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the depths of the circle of stone, three shapes emerged. They were black and curiously flat as their silhouettes stood starkly against the white stones. At the sight of them, my feet stopped moving, and I found myself suddenly drenched in a cold sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...who are they?\" I asked over my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy smiled, his eyes sad. \"Hashmallim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHashmallim. The word struck a chord of dread deep inside of me. Theo had spoken of them as being a danger to Sarah and me, and now I was expected to walk right up to a couple of them and...do what? Talk to them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do they want? Why are they there? Am I supposed to do something with them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must walk to the center of the circle of Akasha,\" the boy repeated. \"The trial will be over if you do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed down a thick lump of fear. \"I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s an alternative to this trial?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There never is,\" I muttered to myself, taking a deep breath as I tried to calm my frazzled nerves. A quick glance overhead confused me - where was my friendly little cloud that rained down destruction on those who angered me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Gift has no power here,\" the boy answered, just as if I had asked the question out loud. \"I should add that there is a time limit to this trial. You have exactly two minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to protest, but the sight of those three black figures standing next to the rocks dried up the complaint I was about to make. Dread and horror, sickening in their intensity, washed over me. It took some doing, but I managed to get my feet moving again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s reason this through,\" I told myself, my eyes fixed on the three still figures as I slowly approached them, my steps lagging noticeably as the seconds ticked by. \"Given the premise that virtues exist, we must conclude that other people have passed these trials, thus they can\u0027t be lethal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only mortals must pass the trials,\" the boy called after me. \"Immortals simply apply, and are interviewed for the positions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not helping!\" I yelled back, my thoughts sour as I forced myself to take another step. The sense of dread increased with each footstep, swamping me with the knowledge that I was doomed, Theo was doomed, everyone I ever knew or loved was doomed. I wanted to sit down on the rocky ground and sob myself into insensitivity, that certain was I that it was all for nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get a grip, Portia,\" I lectured myself, fighting with the bile that wanted to rise as I watched the three black figures getting closer. What I thought were three people standing in silhouette turned out to be partly correct - they were people-shaped silhouettes...but nothing more. They weren\u0027t people standing in shadow. They weren\u0027t darkened versions of people, with vaguely discernable features. No, the Hashmallim were just inky black voids, as if they were two-dimensional representations of people. They were all the more frightening for the impossibility of their appearance. \"There are approximately twenty steps left. You can do it one step at a time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another six steps forward, then froze into place at the sure knowledge that I was going to my death. \"No,\" I told myself, fighting down the mass of emotions that roiled inside me. \"This can\u0027t be lethal. It\u0027s just an illusion, like so many other things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe things I\u0027d believed to be illusions had turned out to be real, my mind argued with me, so why should this be any different?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time is passing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead of me, the rocks with their three horrible figures loomed before me. The best offense is defense, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not so bad,\" I yelled at the three presences. I wrapped my arms around my waist and made myself take several steps forward. \"You may think you can frighten me to death, but I\u0027m tougher than I look! So you can put that in your big, scary pipes and smoke it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rocks loomed above me as I approached with dragging footsteps. I panted with the effort to keep from vomiting, my brain shrieking warnings about self-preservation. I ignored them, taking another couple of steps forward until just a few yards separated the rocks and the Hashmallim from me. They were vague, black shapes now, shifting in opacity and shape, occasional glimpses of haunted, pale faces flickering into view before melting into nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to run as far away as possible. I wanted to cry and curl up into a fetal ball. I wanted it all to go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted Theo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hashmallim seemed to block the path through the stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I do now?\" I yelled to the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Simply go through them to the center.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Simple, my ass,\" I grumbled to myself, desperately trying to keep my feet pointed toward the horrors in front of me. \"There\u0027s nothing simple about this. I doubt if the word exists around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another step forward. The nearest Hashmallim seemed to swell up, looming over me, drenching me in fear, loathing, terror, and a hundred other emotions that had me seriously wishing for death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may have neglected to mention that only the pure of being can pass by the Hashmallim,\" the boy called to me, his voice thin and reedy on the increasing wind. \"Those who are not pure...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet sanity, he couldn\u0027t have mentioned that earlier?\" I took a deep breath, my body racked with trembling so great that my teeth chattered as I yelled back, \"What happens to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do not leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thousand and one sins flashed before my eyes, things I\u0027d done in my life of which I was not proud, starting with a favorite toy I refused to share with a childhood friend, and ending with the loss of Theo\u0027s soul. Was I now being called to account for them? The thought of remaining in that place for eternity was almost enough to bring me to my knees, but just as I was convinced I couldn\u0027t do it, that I couldn\u0027t pass by the three Hashmallim, an image of Theo came to my mind. Theo laughing at a silly joke, Theo\u0027s face tight with passion as he found his release, Theo sleepy and adorable and so endearing it made tears prick behind my eyes. If I failed, I\u0027d never see him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo loved me. I knew he did; I felt it in the soft touches of his mind against mine. And what was more, at that moment I knew with the certainty that I knew the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin limit was 5 x 1019 electron volts that I loved Theo with every molecule in my body. Surely I couldn\u0027t love someone so deeply, so completely, so absolutely without having some redeeming qualities?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my chin and stiffened my back, holding my gaze firm on the nearest Hashmallim as I took the hardest step forward I\u0027d ever taken. \"I am not a bad person. I have done some things in my life that I regret, but I am not evil. I don\u0027t abuse animals or children. I don\u0027t steal, try not to lie, and only kill really nasty bugs that are attempting to sting me. In a world divided into shades of good and bad, I am a good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hashmallim didn\u0027t move as I forced my legs to move, closing my eyes as I brushed up against the edge of one of them. I fought to hold onto the knowledge that I was myself, a person with flaws and errors in judgment, but fundamentally good at heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground slipped out from under my feet, and I felt myself falling. I opened my eyes to stare unbelievingly at the grassy lawn of the Petitioner\u0027s Park as it zoomed up to meet me. The stone benches, the people standing around watching, Theo crouching on the ground over an inert body - they all rushed up to me until I realized I was actually plummeting down to the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aieeeeeeeee,\" I screamed, my arms and legs flailing wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo leaped back from the body on the ground as it disappeared, looking up toward me. I had a moment to see stark astonishment on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catch me!\" I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaped forward, his arms out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit the ground a foot away from him, my fall somewhat broken by the soft lawn. It wasn\u0027t so soft that it cushioned me entirely, though. I lay facedown, spitting out bits of lawn, my head spinning, my chest aching, all the air having been slammed out of my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Portia! Salus invenitur! Tell me you\u0027re all right!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my head to glare at him, spitting out another mouthful of grass. \"Exactly what part of \u0027catch me\u0027 wasn\u0027t clear to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Woman, you will be the death of me yet,\" he said, pulling me up to an embrace that would have broken the ribs of a lesser woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to be the death of you?\" I looked pointedly at the Portia-shaped faint indentation made on the lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, his lips twitching as he hugged me again. I thought I\u0027d lost you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not so easy to do in, I said, kissing him back when his lips found mine. Ow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow badly are you hurt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI doubt it\u0027s anything major. I wouldn\u0027t want to ravish you on the spot if it was, would I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled in my mind. The desire is mutual, you know. What happened to you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran into a couple Hashmallim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would appear you have passed the fifth trial,\" Disin said as Theo helped me to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brushed off bits of grass and dirt, straightening up slowly. Other than an ache in my chest and knees where I\u0027d struck the ground, I seemed to be relatively unharmed, which was amazing considering the fall I\u0027d taken. \"So I gather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was small of me, I know, but I found satisfaction in the fact that Disin looked nonplussed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This result is not what we anticipated,\" she continued. \"We will discuss the ramifications.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three mare leaned together. Around us, the crowd was oddly hushed, the expressions on most of the faces present making it clear that few people had expected me to pass the fifth trial. I took satisfaction in their surprise, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did the Hashmallim do to you?\" Theo asked, brushing a strand of grass from my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Other than almost scaring the pee right out of me? Nothing. Oh, there was the fact that they returned me to the Court a good forty feet above the ground, but that point pales in relation to the fact that I didn\u0027t die from the drop. Why wasn\u0027t I more seriously injured? I\u0027m not immortal yet, am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in so many words. You bear the gift of a virtue, though, so that makes you more or less an immortal candidate. You have a bit more stamina than you had before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to bicker about that,\" I said, pressing carefully on my ribs. Already the pain was diminishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have come to a decision,\" Disin said, gesturing toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took Theo\u0027s hand, my fingers twining through his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Child, come forward.\" Irina, the white-haired mare, nodded at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisin had her mouth open, as if she was about to speak, but she snapped her teeth closed at Irina\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo and I walked to the old woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are too tall. Sit.\" She waved a hand gnarled by arthritis toward the grass at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe knelt before her. She took Theo\u0027s face in both her hands, peering intently into his eyes. I felt a jolt of surprise in him at her examination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is it? I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could answer, Irina nodded at Theo and released his face, only to take my chin in a surprisingly strong grip. She tilted my head back so she could look deep into my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of her gaze on mine shook me to my toenails. If was as if she was seeing everything I was, stripping away all the layers of societal mores and pretenses, of protective layers, exposing my true core to her faded eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Child, you are lost,\" she said, still examining me. I felt like a squirming beetle pinned to a board. \"Your path is hidden. You have much to do to find it, but I believe you will. You will be released to do just that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrina released my chin, using both hands on her cane to push herself to her feet. I wobbled forward for a moment, almost dizzy with the relief of having the soul-stripping ended. Theo grabbed my arm, and pulled me up to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two mare stood as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is decided that the mortal known as Portia Harding will be released,\" Disin said in a loud voice, her eyes cold as she turned to me. \"The Hashmallim have deemed your being pure, thus you will not be held. Your behavior in this place, however, is beyond tolerance. You are hereby banned from the Court of Divine Blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred whispered comments rippled the air behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank them, Theo ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your generosity,\" I said, trying hard to keep any trace of the sarcasm I felt from lacing my words. I turned to leave, but Disin stopped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may have passed the fifth trial, Portia Harding, but you have not satisfied us that you do not have some involvement in the death of the virtue named Hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t...\" I shook my head, confused. \"I don\u0027t understand. Doesn\u0027t passing the test prove I have a pure heart? How can I have a pure heart and have murdered Hope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisin\u0027s lips tightened. \"Even purity is subjective to interpretation. What we call a heartless murder, you may truly believe is for the better good. Thus, it is entirely possible that in your mind your heart is pure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you did not kill Hope, the onus is upon you to prove who did,\" Disin interrupted. \"Should you fail to do so by the new moon, you will be stripped of the Gift given to you, and banished from the Court forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen\u0027s the new moon? I asked Theo, more than a little stunned by the mare\u0027s demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure. A week, I think. Perhaps two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike we don\u0027t have enough to do, now we have to figure out what happened to Hope?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m afraid we\u0027re not going to have much of a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a physicist, not a detective,\" I told Disin. \"Don\u0027t you people have some sort of a police force that would be better suited to investigate her death? Aren\u0027t those Hashmallim guys your security people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you are not responsible for her death, then you are in the best position to determine who did cause it,\" Disin said dismissively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I have no experience finding murderers - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You summoned Hope and accepted her position. With that goes responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like screaming.
