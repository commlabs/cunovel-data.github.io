The circular driveway of her father’s new house, a six-bedroom redbrick McMansion in Chesterbridge, two towns away from Rosewood, was edged with a few fledgling saplings, tethered by feeble-looking ropes. White Grecian columns supported the porch, a large fountain in the front yard burbled peacefully, and rows of perfectly manicured shrubs that looked like upside-down ice cream cones lined either side of the front entrance. Such a grand abode seemed excessive for three people—her father, his new wife, Isabel, and Isabel’s daughter, Kate—but it did seem like a fitting house for a man who was running for United States senator. Mr. Marin’s campaign had kicked off a few weeks ago, and he had a great shot at winning. Unless, of course, A spilled Hanna’s secret about Tabitha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna rang the doorbell, and Isabel whipped the door open almost immediately. She was dressed in a Tiffany-blue cashmere sweater, a black pencil skirt, and sensible low heels. The perfect dowdy wife of a senator-to-be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Hanna.” The pinched look on Isabel’s face said that she didn’t quite approve of Hanna’s boho Anthropologie dress and gray suede boots. “Everyone’s in Tom’s office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna swished down the hall, which was adorned with silver-framed photos of Isabel and her father’s wedding last summer. She scowled at the picture of herself dressed in the ugliest bridesmaid gown Isabel could have selected: a mint-green, floor-sweeping number that made Hanna’s hips look huge and her skin look sickly. She turned the frame around so that it faced the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father and his campaign staff were sitting around the walnut desk in his office. Her stepsister, Kate, was perched on a Victorian sofa, fiddling with her iPhone. Mr. Marin’s eyes lit up when he saw Hanna. “There she is!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna smiled. A few weeks ago, when his campaign consultants told him that she’d tested well with the voting public, she’d suddenly become her dad’s favorite daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsabel slipped into the room after Hanna and shut the French doors. “This is why I called you here.” Mr. Marin pushed a series of flyers and website screen grabs across the table. The pages said things like The Truth About Tom Marin and Don’t Believe the Lies and Not a Man You Can Trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These are all paid for by Tucker Wilkinson’s committee,” Mr. Marin explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna clucked her tongue. Tucker Wilkinson was her father’s biggest rival for the party nomination. He’d served as state senator for years and had oodles of campaign funds and tons of friends in high places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scootched forward to look at his photo. Tucker Wilkinson was a tall, handsome, dark-haired man who looked vaguely like Hugh Jackman. He had that slightly unnerving, ultra-white politician smile, the kind that tried so hard to say Trust me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam, a senior staff member who had droopy eyes and a penchant for wearing bow ties, shook his head. “I heard Wilkinson bribed a Harvard admissions officer to let in his oldest son, even though he had a two-point-oh GPA.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent, who managed Mr. Marin’s website, stuffed a piece of Trident gum in his mouth before saying, “He does everything he can to dig up the skeletons in everyone’s closets during campaigns, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Luckily, he hasn’t found anything on us.” Mr. Marin looked around at his staff. “And he won’t—unless there’s something I need to know. What Jeremiah did was a shock. I don’t want to be blindsided again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna flinched at the mention of Jeremiah, her father’s aide who’d recently been dismissed for stealing $10,000 from the campaign’s petty cash fund. The thing was, Jeremiah hadn’t stolen the money . . . Hanna had. But she’d had to. It was the only way to keep Patrick quiet about the photos he’d taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKate’s phone chimed. She read the screen and giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kate?” Mr. Marin sounded impatient. “Maybe you could put that away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry.” Kate turned the iPhone facedown and glanced pointedly at Hanna. “Sean just texted me the funniest thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna bristled inside, but she tried not to let it show. Kate had recently started dating Sean Ackard, Hanna’s ex. Hanna didn’t miss Sean in the slightest, but it did hurt that he’d chosen to date the girl she hated most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Marin stacked the printouts in a neat pile. “So. Is there anything anyone would like to come clean with?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s insides churned. Would Wilkinson’s people find out about Tabitha? She glanced out the window. A car rolled slowly down the road. She squinted toward the silhouetted trees that served as a barrier between her dad’s property and the neighbor’s. For a split second, it looked like a shadow darted between the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone beeped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna pulled it out of the bag and hit the SILENT button, but then, glancing around to make sure her dad wasn’t looking, she peeked at the screen. When she saw the garbled letters and numbers of the return center, a cold, rigid feeling seeped into her bones. She pressed READ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would Daddy say if he knew his new favorite daughter was a thief? —A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna tried her hardest to keep a composed look on her face. Who could be doing this to her? How did A know where Hanna was right this second? She glanced at Kate—she had been fiddling on her own phone seconds ago. Kate gave her an annoyed glare back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut her eyes and rifled through the other possibilities of who New A might be. At first, Real Ali had made so much sense. She must have somehow survived the fire and the fall from the crow’s nest and come back to haunt them. But now that Hanna knew the girl they’d killed was Tabitha, she realized how crazy it was to think Ali had made it out of the Poconos house. But who else had they hurt? Who had seen what had happened in Jamaica, and the mess Hanna had made with Patrick, and God knows what else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hanna?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna looked up dazedly. Everyone was standing and leaving the room. Her father stood over her, a concerned look on his face. “Are you okay? You look kind of . . . pale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna glanced out the French doors. Kate and Isabel wandered off toward the kitchen. The other staff members had vanished. “Actually, do you have a second?” Hanna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna cleared her throat. She could never tell her dad about Tabitha, but there was one thing she could come clean about before A confessed for her. “Well, you know how you said we should come to you about skeletons in our closets?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crease formed on Mr. Marin’s brow. “Yes . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, there’s something I need to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna turned away from her father and let the whole story spill out. About Patrick. How sure she’d been that he really believed in her. How he’d leered at her when he’d showed her the incriminating photos. “I was so afraid he was really going to post them online,” she said, her eyes trained on a bunch of rolled-up campaign posters in the corner. “I was afraid he was going to ruin you. So I took the money from the safe. I didn’t know what else to do. I didn’t want to destroy your campaign.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she finished, there was a punishingly long silence. Mr. Marin’s cell phone beeped, but he didn’t move to check it. Hanna didn’t dare look at him. She felt filled with shame and hatred. This was even worse than the time Their Ali had caught Hanna vomiting at her dad’s house in Annapolis after a massive binge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, the pain was just too much. She let out a pathetic puppy-whimper of a sob. Her shoulders shook silently. After a moment, she heard him sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” He placed his hands on her shoulders. “Hanna. Don’t cry. It’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it’s not,” Hanna blubbered. “I ruined everything. And now you hate me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Again?” Mr. Marin drew back, frowning. “I never hated you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna sniffed loudly and raised her eyes to him. Yeah, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father stroked his chin. “I mean, I’m surprised. And a little shocked. But it was very brave to admit something you aren’t proud of. Only, why would you go to some stranger’s apartment to have photos taken in the first place? And why didn’t you come to me when this was happening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna hung her head. “I didn’t want to upset you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dad looked imploringly at her. “But I could have done something. I could have stopped this. You should know you can come to me with your problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna inadvertently laughed. “Actually, Dad, I can’t,” she blurted. “I haven’t been able to for years.” Her father flinched, and Hanna’s whole body sagged. “Sorry. That came out wrong. What I meant to say was . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his hand to cut her off, looking defensive. “I think you did mean it. But I’ve tried with you, Hanna. Don’t forget you didn’t want to speak to me for years, either. How do you think I felt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna widened her eyes. For a long time, when her dad lived in Annapolis, she hadn’t taken his calls, pretending she was busy. Really, she didn’t want to hear about Kate and how wonderful she was compared to chubby, ugly, fat Hanna. It was something they’d never really talked about. Hanna hadn’t realized her dad had even noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Hanna mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m sorry, too,” her father said gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis made tears spill down Hanna’s cheeks even faster. After a moment, her father pulled her close, running his fingers up and down Hanna’s arm. Finally, she wiped her eyes and looked up at her dad. “Do you want me to call Jeremiah? I could beg him to come back. Come clean about what I did.” She could only imagine the satisfied smirk on Jeremiah’s face when she told him that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Marin shook his head. “Actually, Jeremiah is working for Tucker Wilkinson now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna gaped. “You’re kidding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish I was. I guess we really couldn’t trust him.” Mr. Marin grabbed a TOM MARIN FOR SENATOR printed notepad from his desk. “I want you to give me any information you’ve got on this Patrick guy. Emails, phone numbers, anything you can think of. What he did to you is sick, Hanna. We need to find him and make him pay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna scrolled through her phone and gave him Patrick’s details. “What about the money I stole? Do you want me to pay you back somehow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Marin twirled the pen between his fingers. “Just work extra hard on the campaign for me. I was going to mention this to you after the meeting anyway—we need to figure out ways to capture the youth vote. Kate’s already on board. What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you have a paid staff to do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I do. But I want you girls to be involved, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna pressed her tongue into her cheek. The last thing she wanted was to be on a committee with perfect Kate, but there was no way she could say no to her dad—not now. “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t figure out how to reach young people,” Mr. Marin said. “I assumed that you two would have some insight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna thought for a moment. “Do you have a Twitter account?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ruthless-pretty-little-liars-10/page-6.html","bookId":2386,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:22:41 AM"}
