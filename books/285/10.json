Was the mysterious stranger the thief, and had he robbed the bank and transferred the tin box to Luke? It might be so, but, as this happened more than a fortnight since, it would have been strange in that case that the box had not been missed sooner at the bank. Luke longed to have Miss Sprague go, that he might confer with his mother on this subject. He had been told to keep the possession of the box secret, and therefore he didn\u0027t wish to reveal the fact that he had it unless it should prove to be necessary.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Were any traces of the robber discovered?\" he added.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not that I heard of; but I pity the thief, whoever he is,\" remarked Melinda. \"When he\u0027s found out he will go to jail, without any doubt.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can\u0027t understand, for my part, how an outside party could open the safe,\" said Mrs. Larkin. \"It seems very mysterious.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s many things we can\u0027t understand,\" said Melinda, shaking her head sagely. \"All crimes are mysterious.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope they\u0027ll find out who took the bonds,\" said the widow. \"Did they belong to the bank?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, they belonged to a gentleman in Cavendish, who kept them in the bank, thinking they would be safer than in his own house.

The more she thought of it, the more she believed the missing box was the one of which she had caught a glimpse of in Mrs. Larkin\u0027s trunk. True, Luke and the widow had not betrayed that confusion and embarrassment which might have been anticipated when the theft was announced, but she had noticed the look exchanged between them, and she was sure it meant something. Above all, her curiosity was aroused to learn how it happened that a woman as poor as the Widow Larkin should have a tin box in her trunk, the contents of which might be presumed to be valuable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t like to get Luke and his mother into trouble,\" Melinda said to herself, \"but I think it my duty to tell all I know.
