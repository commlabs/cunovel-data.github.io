In I, Robot, Asimov chronicles the development of the robot through a series of interlinked stories: from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future--a future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eHere are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-read robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world--all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asmiov\u0027s trademark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/i-robot-robot-0-1.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/i-robot-robot-0-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:57 AM"}
