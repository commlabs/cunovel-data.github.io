Behind me Lauren Hynde lingers by the door and Chloe says something like \"The limo\u0027s waiting on the street\" and I nod okay and move sullenly into our bedroom, making sure Chloe catches the scowl I hurl at Baxter while he continues deseeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my closet: white jeans, leather belts, leather bomber jacket, black cowboy boots, a couple of black wool crepe suits, a dozen white shirts, a black turtleneck, crumpled silk pajamas, a high-class\u0026nbsp; p**n o movie I\u0027ve watched hundreds of times starring people who look just like us. I\u0027m pretending to go through stuff until Chloe walks in seconds after I\u0027ve crouched down inspecting a pair of sandals I bought in Barcelona at a Banana Republic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the story?\" I finally ask. \"Where\u0027s my three-snap blazer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\" she asks back, tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t he a head in a Mr. Jenkins ad, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you he was coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think that antifashion look costs?\" I ask. \"Two thousand bucks? Three thousand bucks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget about it, Victor.\" She\u0027s searching for a pair of sunglasses to wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Far out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor,\" she starts. \"What are you looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hair gel.\" I walk away from the closet and brush by her into the bathroom where I start gelling my hair, slicking it back. My beeper goes off and I ignore it. When it goes off again I wash my hands and find out it\u0027s Alison and I\u0027m wondering how everything got so f**ked up, but checking out my profile calms me down and I take a few deep breaths, complete a couple of seconds of some deep-sea visualization and then: ready to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The tux looks nice,\" Chloe says, standing in the bathroom door, watching me. \"Who was that?\" Pause. \"On the beeper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone at the club.\" I just stand there and then I look at my watch and then move back to the bed where I rummage through the Comme des Garcons bag so the clothes can go to Chloe\u0027s dry cleaners. Absently I find the hat Lauren gave me, all scrunched up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" I hear Chloe ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops, wrong hat,\" I say, tossing it back in the bag, a Bullwinkle impression that used to make her laugh but now she doesn\u0027t get and she\u0027s not really looking at the hat but thinking other thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really want things to work out,\" Chloe says hesitantly. \"Between us,\" she clarifies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m mad about you.\" I shrug. \"You\u0027re mad about me.\" I shrug again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do this, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m happy for you, Victor,\" she says, strained, just standing there in front of me, exhausted. \"I\u0027m really happy for you about tonight.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-72.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
