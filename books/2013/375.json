Beasts. The sky and the stars! None of this is an illusion!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A trapped memory-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Bonecaster, you are wrong.’ He struggled to hold back his anger, and spun to face Onrack. ‘I see your heart, Onrack the Broken. I know, you will stand with me-in the time that comes. You will!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Rud Elalle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you believe!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnrack was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHostille Rator’s laugh was a soft, bitter rasp. ‘It is this, Rud Elalle. Onrack of the Logros T’lan Imass chooses to fight at your side, chooses to fight for these Bentract, because he cannot abide the thought of returning to what he once was, and so he would rather die here. And death is what Onrack the Broken anticipates-indeed, what he now yearns for.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull studied his friend, and saw on Onrack’s firelit face the veracity of Hostille Rator’s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tiste Edur did not hesitate. ‘Onrack will not stand alone,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTil’aras Benok faced Trull. ‘You surrender your life, Edur, to defend an illusion?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That, Bonecaster, is what we mortals delight in doing. You bind yourself to a clan, to a tribe, to a nation or an empire, but to give force to the illusion of a common bond, you must feed its opposite-that all those not of your clan, or tribe, or empire, do not share that bond. I have seen Onrack the Broken, a T’lan Imass. And now I have seen him, mortal once again. To the joy and the life in the eyes of my friend, I will fight all those who deem him their enemy. For the bond between us is one of friendship, and that, Ti’laras Benok, is not an illusion.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHostille Rator asked Onrack, ‘In your mercy, as you have now found it alive once more in your soul, will you now reject Trull Sengar of the Tiste Edur?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the warrior bowed his head and said, ‘I cannot.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then, Onrack the Broken, your soul shall never find peace.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrull felt as if he had been punched in the chest. It was all very well to make his bold claims, in ferocious sincerity that could only come of true friendship. It was yet another thing to discover the price it demanded in the soul of the one he called friend. ‘Onrack,’ he whispered in sudden anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this moment would not await all that might have been said, all that needed to be said, for Hostille Rator had turned to face his Bonecasters, and whatever silent communication passed among these three was quick, decisive, for the clan chief swung round and walked towards Ulshun Pral. Whereupon he fell to one knee and bowed his head. ‘We are humbled, Ulshun Pral. We are shamed by these two strangers. You are the Bentract. As were we, once, long ago. We now choose to remember. We now choose to fight in your name. In our deaths there will be naught but honour, this we vow.’ He then rose and faced Rud Elalle. ‘Soletaken, will you accept us as your soldiers?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soldiers? No. As friends, as Bentract, yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three T’lan bowed to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this passed in a blur before Trull Sengar’s eyes. Since Onrack the Broken’s admission, it seemed as if Trull’s entire world had, with grinding, stone-crushing irresistibility, turned on some vast, unimagined axis-yet he was drawn round again by a hand on his shoulder, and Onrack, now standing before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There is no need,’ the Imass warrior said. ‘I know something even Rud Elalle does not, and I tell you this, Trull Sengar, there is no need. Not for grief. Nor regret. My friend, listen to me. This world will not die.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Trull found no will within him to challenge that assertion, to drive doubt into his friend’s earnest gaze. After a moment, then, he simply sighed and nodded. ‘So be it, Onrack.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And, if we are careful,’ Onrack continued, ‘neither shall we.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As you say, friend.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty paces away in the darkness, Hedge turned to Quick Ben and hissed, ‘What do you make of all that, wizard?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben shrugged. ‘Seems the confrontation has been averted, if Hostille Rator’s kneeling before Ulshun Pral didn’t involve picking up a dropped fang or something.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A dropped-what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never mind. That’s not the point at all, anyway. But I now know I am right in one thing and don’t ask me how I know. I just do. Suspicion into certainty.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-375.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
