He put his face to her hair and inhaled, recalling the night before and growing harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the doubts assailed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d taken a young woman, innocent and impressionable before she met him, and he\u0027d bent her over and spread her and driven into her hard. And he knew he\u0027d do it again -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to ask me if you hurt me,\" she said in a languid voice, reading his mind. He was just about to speak when she took his erection in her hand. \"You\u0027re going to ask me if I was embarrassed.\" She stroked him. \"You didn\u0027t hurt me.\" She guided him into her. \"I\u0027m not embarrassed.\" She wriggled her hips until she was better placed, then slowly moved down on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was doing this? After last night? Though he was sure he was still dreaming, he met her and entered deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped, then sighed contentedly. \"See? None the worse for your wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dinna embarrass you at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps at first, but certainly not toward the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then maybe I\u0027m no\u0027 wicked enough for you?\" He nipped her ear and she laughed. He felt it. \"I\u0027m an old man with no more tricks in my bag?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, he wrapped his arms tight around her, clasping her to him, and turned on his back. \"Courtland?\" she cried, when she lay atop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spread his knees, locking her legs wide outside of them and set his hands all over her breasts and belly. She moaned when he dug his heels down to thrust up into her while his fingers flicked and played. He took her like this until she arched her back off his body, driving herself nearly down to the hilt, and when she melted on him, he spent hot within her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward he returned her to her front and reluctantly withdrew from the warmth of her body. He brushed her hair to the side and ran his thumbs along her slim shoulders until she slept again, then murmured in her ear, \"Anna, my heart is full.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose and dragged on his trousers to return to his room. When he glanced back at her before shutting the door, she turned to her back, treating him to a view of her delectable breasts, and he groaned, knowing he wouldn\u0027t even make it till the afternoon before having her once more. He\u0027d bring her breakfast and see if he could tempt her. He grinned. She was always as tempted as he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his room, he washed and dressed and found himself whistling. He wasn\u0027t a whistler. He shrugged, then stomped down the stairs, but when he was halfway down, his face fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother always looked furious, but this time markedly so, his scar whitening. Bloody hell. He gave Court one look and turned for the study. Court swore under his breath and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have heard some of the situation,\" he began as soon as Court shut the door. \"How long do you intend to stay like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her brother will come soon,\" he hedged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then you\u0027ll let her go with him? Even though you\u0027ve slept with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh told you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d said nothing. Our mother is no\u0027 the only one getting reports from this house. I\u0027d heard and then your face told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course Ethan knew. Ethan knew everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Castilian has been asking the servants what a peculiar Gaelic phrase means.\" He skewered Court with a look. \"Her pronunciation is extraordinary, I\u0027m told. She couldn\u0027t have just heard it once in passing and then repeated the sounds so perfectly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, she could. She could mimic Ethan cold within five seconds of meeting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bound her to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\" The words had just seemed to flow from him. There was no stopping them. And yes, he\u0027d told her that more than once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she was innocent and of good family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" he said, putting his shoulders back. He refused to be ashamed of what he\u0027d done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn amused expression of disbelief. \"You actually think you\u0027re going to marry the lass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, brother, do you hate her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt narrowed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a leather satchel by the desk, Ethan withdrew a weighty tome and tossed it onto the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeabhar nan S¨´il-radharc. The Book of Fates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt scrambled back, never taking his eyes from it as every muscle in his body instantly went rigid with tension. The cover glimmered like the scales of a fish and showed none the worse for wear from all the times his forefathers had sought to destroy it. Court\u0027s stomach clenched, then roiled. The only marking the book had accepted was blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not as thick as it could have been - more pages could\u0027ve been added. But they knew it ended where it did because there were to be no more direct descendants to have their fates foretold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must hate her. You\u0027ve put her in a situation where she can marry you or be ruined. Of course, she had better choose ruined. Much better than death and torment at worst, or at best a financially strapped mercenary who canna give her children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you bring that here?\" He looked around wildly, not believing Anna was in the same house as this cursed thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I might need to refresh your memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt didn\u0027t bother to disguise his fury. He could kill Ethan for this. \"As if I\u0027d ever forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have. And you\u0027ve apparently forgotten what happened to the last woman engaged to one of us. Specifically me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is no\u0027 like that, Ethan. I feel that this is different - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do.\" He exhaled and gave Court a rare look of pity. \"You want it so badly you\u0027ll do anything to convince yourself it is, but all you\u0027re doing is hurting her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt was shaking his head, watching in misery as Ethan opened it to the last page. Their page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good on you, Court. Why wait for \u0027death and torment\u0027 when you can meet it head-on? A career killing for money, seducing innocents...By the time you\u0027re my age, you\u0027ll have bypassed the deeds I\u0027ve done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat rocked him. Ethan was not a kind man. He\u0027d always made the detestable things Court did seem petty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange,\" Ethan mused, \"I feel no different than I did when I was still the most evil MacCarrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt ignored his grim humor. \"And what if her brother never comes? You have all the answers - what should I do then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know Hugh and I can find her a place of safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can keep her safe. I will go down there and destroy every Rechazado to protect her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you still have to let her go. If you will no\u0027, you\u0027ll prove you doona care for her enough. If you truly did, you would never even chance her life. Look at Hugh - he refuses to be near Jane, but you think to marry yours.\" Ethan slammed the cover shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a last revolted look at the book, Court stormed from the room, passing Hugh on the way out. \"Watch Anna. And doona let him or that bloody book get near her.\" Outside he scarcely noticed the people on the street darting out of his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out for a spell.\" That was Hugh\u0027s cryptic answer when she\u0027d asked where Court was. When she\u0027d asked two hours ago. She didn\u0027t like it when he went out, could imagine far too many scenarios where he got ambushed, where he was outnumbered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paced the foyer, not caring that the servants gave her queer glances. They would anyway, since they all knew she was being bedded by MacCarrick daily, sometimes hourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he strode in the door from the drizzle outside, shaking his soaked hair like a wolf. He must have been walking outdoors the entire time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been? I was worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bleakness in his eyes that wasn\u0027t there before. \"What\u0027s happened?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. I just missed you and you didn\u0027t say good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hands on her shoulders, absently rubbing her neck with his thumbs. She knew it was an unconscious gesture. \"I was reminded of something today,\" he said, his words halting. He seemed to realize he touched her, because he looked surprised and cast his hands down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" she asked, becoming alarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve realized things about us, about the way...about the way I feel, and I never want to hurt you. I am going back to - \" He fell silent and tensed visibly, then turned back to the door, his body rigid and protective in front of her. His hand went behind him under his coat and rested on a pistol she hadn\u0027t known was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the front doors flew open, and MacCarrick relaxed the hand on his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aleix?\" He was well! He was here! She ran to hug him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Aleix demanded as he took her shoulders to study her. \"Are you unhurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m very well,\" she assured him. Seeming convinced of her well-being, his attention focused on MacCarrick. Aleix looked as though he\u0027d kill him. \"Now, Aleix, let me explain - \" A figure drew Annal¨ªa\u0027s gaze. She turned back to the door, gaping. \"Olivia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Aleix charged MacCarrick, who met him, the two like animals after each other\u0027s throats as they fell into vases, pummeling each other. Oh, God, she didn\u0027t want either one hurt!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You filthy Scot,\" her brother bellowed. \"You put me in Pascal\u0027s prison, then you take my sister? You are about to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait, Court put Aleix in prison?...He\u0027d said he didn\u0027t. He\u0027d said he never attacked them - \"Oh!\" She put her hand over her mouth. He never said he hadn\u0027t fought against Aleix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" Everyone froze. Annal¨ªa slowly peered over her shoulder to find a man - an older version of Court, but for the twisting scar running down his face. This must be Ethan. If possible he was more menacing than Courtland and Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh strode in. Annal¨ªa heard Olivia mutter in Spanish, \"Terrifying, petrifying, and horrifying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Court, I doona care who you\u0027re fighting or why,\" Ethan said. \"Do it outside the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt gave him a grim nod, then looked at Aleix. Aleix turned for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the sound of the fight ensued, she and Olivia started after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop. Now,\" Ethan said to them, his voice low and threatening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped and noticed Olivia did as well as they both turned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we can\u0027t let this happen,\" Olivia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll kill each other!\" Annal¨ªa cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they won\u0027t.\" When Ethan spoke she felt compelled to believe him. She relaxed marginally until he added, \"Court will undoubtedly thrash him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth gasped. Annal¨ªa\u0027s hand went to her forehead. Olivia scanned the room, no doubt for a weapon, the little witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is no one pulling for my brother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnal¨ªa could have sworn that this amused Ethan, not that you could tell by the granite expression on his face. Maybe the skin around his eyes wasn\u0027t as tight. His jaw not so clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she and Olivia said in unison, then glared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I canna wait to have these dynamics explained to me. Shall I tear Court off your beloved...?\" He trailed off, expecting them to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aleix! His name is Aleix, and he\u0027s my brother. And yes, you should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my fianc¨¦ and you should, but not because he needs you to,\" Olivia quickly added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, indeed he doesn\u0027t,\" Annal¨ªa sniffed. A split second later: \"Fianc¨¦?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she restrained herself from clawing the witch\u0027s eyes out, the older MacCarrick walked outside, in a leisurely stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes later, both men returned behind him, wet from the drizzle. Aleix\u0027s nose and lip bled, and both his eye and cheek were swelling. MacCarrick had no such marks, but then he was a professional killer....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in the carriage, Annal¨ªa,\" Aleix said between breaths. \"I\u0027m taking you away from here.\" To MacCarrick, he said, \"When I get her safe, I\u0027ll come back to finish this. Make your peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she didn\u0027t move, Aleix took her hand. She pulled it free to march in front of MacCarrick. \"Please tell me you didn\u0027t put my brother in Pascal\u0027s jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze was locked on hers. \"I canna do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you never tell me? You said you didn\u0027t attack them. And I believed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long pause, he grated, \"They - attacked - us,\" every word as though pulled from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Aleix said from behind them. \"You jailed us. You kept us from killing Pascal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jailed, aye. No\u0027 killed,\" MacCarrick bit out. \"You brought us farmers and ranchers. It would have been a slaughter.\" She knew he didn\u0027t often give explanations for his actions and was surprised that he would do it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were closing in on Pascal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were closing in on the Rechazados protecting Pascal. Putting you in jail saved your lives. Ask Pascal\u0027s daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith obvious reluctance, Olivia said, \"It\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAleix gave him a disgusted look. \"I would rather have risked it than have my people suffering.\" He offered Annal¨ªa his hand again. \"Come with me before he decides to ransom you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for MacCarrick to interrupt him. To argue with him. He did nothing, just stood watching her. Her heart hammered so loud she wondered if everyone could hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Annal¨ªa,\" Aleix told her in Catalan. \"Leave your things and come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacCarrick had sworn he would get her to her brother. His task was complete. And though she\u0027d thought they had made a commitment to each other, he\u0027d never asked her to marry him and they\u0027d never talked of the future. You\u0027re mine, he\u0027d said like a vow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, he\u0027d done the same twisting of the truth that he\u0027d done concerning the fight with her brother. You\u0027re mine. For a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoulders back, she walked to him. \"You said you\u0027d get me safely to my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you nothing else to say?\" When he stood silent, she said, \"Then thank you.\" Don\u0027t cry, don\u0027t cry! She offered her hand. \"I appreciate your...help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t take her hand. He didn\u0027t take it and use it to draw her against his solid chest as he told everyone else to go to hell. Her heart hurt as though she\u0027d been stabbed. His brothers stood near him with silent, icy demeanors. Their understood ruthlessness and will highlighted those same aspects in Courtland. She\u0027d never had a chance with him. A man couldn\u0027t change his nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d worried about the decision she would have to make, but it had never been about her choice. He would let her go, and she was about to burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" she murmured as she turned for her brother. \"I\u0027m ready.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-31.html","bookId":2644,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM"}
