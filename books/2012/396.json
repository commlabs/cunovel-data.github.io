He watched the crimson sheets rolling across the land, watched them roll ever closer – and then with yet another roar, the rain slammed down upon the T’lan Imass, driving them to their knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHead bowed beneath the deluge, Onos T’oolan gasped. One breath. Another. And his eyes, fixed now upon the hands on his knees, slowly widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the withered skin softened, thickened. As muscles expanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother terrible gasp of breath, deep into aching lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his kin, sudden cries. Of shock. Of wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are remade. By the blood of a slain god, we are reborn .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he lifted his gaze, to look upon the Kolansii ranks, fast closing on their position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis … this was ill-timed .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood of a slain god rained from the sky. In torrents, cascading down from the ruptured, now shapeless clouds. The air filled with the terrible roar of those thick drops, falling heavy as molten lead. The armies fighting near the highest level of the isthmus were staggered by the downpour. The vast shelf of ice, ever rising towards the pinnacle of the Spire, now streamed crimson in growing torrents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBowed beneath the onslaught, Sister Reverence staggered towards the altar stone. Through the carmine haze she could see the Crippled God’s heart – no longer a withered, knotted thing of stone – now pulsing, now surging with life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sorcerous chains still held it bound to the altar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis – this changes nothing. My soldiers shall hold. I still have their souls in my hands. I have the chains of their fallen comrades, their slain souls – all feeding my power. At the foot of the stairs, they shall make a human wall. And I will take this unexpected power and make of it a gift. I will feed this blood into the soul of Akhrast Korvalain .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew up against the altar stone, slowly straightened, and held her face to the sky, to feel that hot blood streaming down. And then, laughing, she opened her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake me young again. Banish this bent body. Make all that is outside as beautiful as that which was ever inside. Make me whole and make me perfect. The blood of a god! See me drink deep!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if the heavens had been struck a mortal wound. Kalyth cried out, in shock, in dread horror, as the deluge descended upon the land – to all sides, devouring every vista, as if swallowing up the entire world. The blood – on her face, on her hands – felt like fire, but did not burn. She saw the heavy drops pounding into the lifeless earth, saw the soil blacken, watched as streams of thick mud slumped down the hillsides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could barely draw breath. ‘Gunth Mach! What – what will come of this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Destriant, I cannot give answer. Immortal rituals unravel. Ancient power melts … dissolves. But what do these things mean? What is resolved? No one can say. A god has died, Destriant, and that death tastes bitter and it fills me with sorrow .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth saw how the K’Chain Che’Malle, momentarily stunned, now resumed their assault upon the highest defences of the Kolansii. She saw the defenders rise to meet the Ve’Gath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA god dies. And the fighting simply goes on, and we add to the rain with blood of our own. I am seeing the history of the world – here, before me. I am seeing it all, age upon age. All so … useless .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was low laughter behind her, cutting through the dull roar, and Kalyth turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinn had stripped naked, and now she was painted in blood. ‘The Pure has made a shining fist,’ she said. ‘To block the ascent. The lizards cannot break it – their oils are fouled with exhaustion.’ Her eyes lifted to Kalyth. ‘Tell them to disengage. Order them to retreat.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Imass reeled back. The Kolansii heavy infantry pushed forward, over Imass corpses. With shields and armour they weathered blows from stone weapons. With iron sword, axe and spear, they tore apart unprotected flesh, and on all sides the rain of blood – cooled now, lifeless – hammered down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriven past the remains of the village, the Imass forces contracted, unable to hold the enemy back. Pincers swept out to either side, seeking to encircle the increasingly crowded, disorganized warriors. Onos Toolan sought to hold the centre in the front line – he alone remembered what it was to defend his own body – now so vulnerable, so frail. His kin had … forgotten. They attacked unmindful of protecting themselves, and so they died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReborn, only to live but moments. The anguish of this threatened to tear the First Sword apart. But he was only one man, as mortal as his brothers and sisters now, and it was only a matter of time before— \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-396.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
