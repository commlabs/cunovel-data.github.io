Zero and Kampa both did the same thing, they held onto the grenades with a finger through the ring. As soon as the Alien appeared, they would throw the grenades at it. He remembered that he said he’d never give up on any comrades. He definitely heard Xiaoyi’s cry for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround the corner, three Aliens were ripping into Xiaoyi. He was still not dead. His whole body was twitching. The Aliens’ strength was so powerful. Their tongues would touch him lightly and his body would be ripped apart like paper. Zheng could only take a last look of those despairing eyes before Xiaoyi’s head was crushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother Alien turned around to look at Zheng. It extended it’s tongue out, saliva dripping on the ground. Then it screamed at Zheng. The scream woke him up from the shock. He looked at Xiaoyi again, no, the pieces of his body, before he turned around and ran back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Run! Shit! There are three Aliens!”, He yelled as he ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero and Kampa threw their grenades then ran back. Jie, Xuan, and Shuai followed behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan was running at the back near Zheng, but her speed just wasn’t fast enough, the explosion was likely to affect her. Zheng picked her up when he ran by. When the explosion wave came, they both got knocked to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng forcibly turned his body around right before he reached the ground, taking the impact while Lan landed on him. She looked at him in surprise then smiled. “You’re a nice guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng’s mind went blank for a moment then yelled, “What’re you talking about, hurry and run!” Then he was going to push Lan off him to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan gripped on his shirt collars tightly. “My enhancements are low, my running speed definitely can’t keep up. Carry me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time, Jie and the other four were out of sight already. Zheng didn’t have time to say anything else. The explosion could only delay the Aliens for so long. If they don’t start to run, they would just die here. He gritted his teeth, picked Lan up and started sprinting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng’s physical body was strong, and he could barely feel the weight of a person. After running through a few halls, he realized that he’d gotten lost. He was just running as fast as he could without any time to think, but having gone so far without encountering Jie and the others, Zheng got separated from the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gritted his teeth and continued on. Another hundred meters went by until he saw a steel door on the side. He carried Lan inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the doors on this spacecraft had automatic sensors and would open when a person gets near. They easily got into the room. Then Lan jumped out from his arms. She pressed some buttons next to the door then it closed. The light on top of the door turned red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan exhaled, then patted her chest. “That was scary, I couldn’t even move my hands and feet. The Aliens were more disgusting and scary than in the movie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng was staring at her, her breasts were actually really big. He couldn’t feel it when he was running, but now that he thought about carrying her, and her breasts pressed onto his chest, he immediately looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan sensed what happened then blushed. “I knew it, this door could be closed. Otherwise if anyone can enter your bedroom, then there would be no privacy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng coughed to calm himself down. Then he thought about Xiaoyi’s face. Even though Xiaoyi looked common, and a little weak, he was a kind hearted kid. He laughed a lot during training and said his biggest dream was to get enough power through enhancements then go back to school and teach those bullies a lesson, but now he was…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“F*ck! I said I won’t give up on any comrades! Yet I got scared and ran!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng got more and more angry. He kept punching on things. Bang! A steel bar the thickness of an arm got bent. He and Lan looked at it with their eyes wide open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan ran over immediately. This room wasn’t big, other than bed made of steel, there were some simple furniture and a TV. That steel bar was from the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wah. When did you get so strong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan touched the bar then looked at his fist. It wasn’t even scratched. She said with surprise, “Is your fist made of steel? That was powerful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng was surprised also. He then tried and punched at another steel bar with full strength this time. The whole bar broke in half and the bed knocked to the ground. He looked at his fist in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not possible, I never won against Jie in close combat unless I used Qi. If I had this kind of strength I could have knocked him out in one punch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan touched her forehead. “Perhaps you held back, not consciously, but because you obtained such strength you subconsciously held back. And it’s not only strength, there isn’t even a scratch. Your skin is tougher than steel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng tighten his fist, then a thought came to mind. “Say how destructive would it be if I throw this steel bar with all my strength and while using Qi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan looked at the bar that was broken in half and smiled. “Why don’t you try it now? If the results are good… hehe, if you do then I won’t tell Lori you peeked at my chest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng kept his mouth shut. He was too familiar with Lan’s expression and tone. During his past ten years, he had seen a few women give him that expression. He knew the best choice was to stay silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and grabbed the broken bar. Sure enough, his strength had gotten to this level. He had never had the chance to test it in God’s room. He broke the bar off the bed with just a hand. That screeching sound of bending metal was so harsh yet at the same time gave them a sense of safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng took a deep breath, directed his Qi all over the body, then he gave a loud shout and threw the bar. With a shattering sound, the bar penetrated the steel wall. This bar was over half a meter long, with only a few centimetres of it left outside the wall, while the rest was inserted into the wall. The power of this throw was enormous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng and Lan were shocked at the result. They stared at each other for quite a while, then turned around simultaneously… to the rest of the bars on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since we’ve forgotten to exchange for heavy firearms, then we will use this primitive weapon to crush them!”, Zheng muttered. Lan was laughing by the side, her breasts jiggling as she laughed. Zheng couldn’t help but peek at it. She seemed to have noticed and blushed a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps this was the only thing enjoyable now, Zheng thought as he peeked. Yet when he remembered those three huge monsters of nightmares, he felt a sense of despair, and a bit of stubbornness of refusing to accept fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Live, no matter how hopeless the situation is… I must live!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-2-chapter-1-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-2-chapter-2-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-2-chapter-1-3","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
