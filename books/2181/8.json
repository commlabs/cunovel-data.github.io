{"id":99829,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a moment of total, frozen disbelief. Then Dervish grabs a sword from the wall and pushes past Meera. I follow close behind. I try to pull the sword I\u0027d thrown earlier out of the door but it\u0027s stuck tight. While Meera hurries to get a weapon of her own, I step into the corridor after Dervish, working on a spell, not sure if it will work-there\u0027s so little magic in the air to draw on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear panting. It comes from the far end of the corridor. Something growls and something else yaps angrily in reply. No sight of them yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeera steps out behind us, swinging a mace. She\u0027s stuck a knife in her belt. No trace of the gentle woman who was applying make-up only minutes ago. She\u0027s all warrior now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many?\" Dervish asks without looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least three. They entered through the kitchen. I\u0027d been snacking. I was just leaving, so I was able to jam the door and stall them. If they\u0027d burst in when I was at the table...\" She shakes her head, angry and scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the creatures sticks its head around the corner. It\u0027s recognisably human, but twisted out of normal shape. It has unnatural yellow eyes. Dark hair sprouts from its face and its teeth have lengthened into fangs. They look too large for its mouth-it must have great difficulty eating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt skulks into the corridor, growling. Long, sharp fingernails. More muscular than any human. Hunched over. Covered in stiff hair. Naked. A male. Another two creatures appear behind the first, a male and female. The second male is larger than the first, but follows his lead. His left eye is a gooey, scarred mess. Maybe that\u0027s why he\u0027s not the dominant one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the once-human beasts advance, I step ahead of Dervish and Meera. I try draining magic from the air, but there\u0027s virtually nothing to tap into. In my own time, these creatures would have been simple to deal with. Here, it\u0027s going to be difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lead werewolf snaps at the female. With a howl, she leaps. I unleash the spell as she jumps. It\u0027s a choking spell. If it doesn\u0027t work, I won\u0027t know much about it-she\u0027ll be on me in a second and I\u0027m defenceless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe werewolf lands about a metre ahead of me, but instead of pouncing and finishing me off, she rolls aside, whining, the cords of her throat thickening, cutting off her supply of air. Score one for Bec!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weaker male attacks on all fours. No time for a choking spell. I bark a few quick words and the creature\u0027s fingers grab at each other. He roars with surprise and tries ripping them apart. I mutter the spell again, holding them in place. It\u0027s more of a trick than a real spell. It will immobilise the werewolf for less than a minute, then he\u0027ll break free and I\u0027ll have to think of something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0027s the dominant male to deal with first. He\u0027s more cunning than the others and makes his move while I\u0027m dealing with the one-eyed beast. He barrels across the floor, howling dreadfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can react, Dervish and Meera cut ahead of me. Meera lashes out at the werewolf with her mace, swinging the spiked ball expertly, landing a blow to the beast\u0027s right shoulder. Dervish jabs at him with the sword, piercing the creature\u0027s stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither blow is fatal but the werewolf screams with pain and surprise, and falls back a few steps. He roars at the others, summoning them. The female\u0027s throat has cleared-she\u0027s back on her feet, and although her cheeks are puffed out, she looks ready for business. Morrigan\u0027s milk! In the old days that spell would have been the end of her. Curse this modern world of weak magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t get past,\" Dervish says calmly. \"Back up. They were human once. If we\u0027re lucky, the protective spells of the study will halt them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if they don\u0027t?\" Meera asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fight like a demon,\" he chuckles bleakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shuffle back through the open door of the study. As soon as we\u0027re in, I dart to the nearest wall and grab an axe-the swords here are mostly too big for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the werewolves howls. The female leaps into the study, fangs flashing, ready to tear us to pieces. But as soon as she crosses the threshold she screeches, clasps her hands to the sides of her head, doubles over and vomits. She looks up hatefully and reaches for Meera, then screams and vomits again. She rolls out. The males roar at her but she roars back more forcefully than either of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It worked,\" Dervish notes dully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stronger male approaches the doorway. He sniffs at the jamb suspiciously and leans through. His nostrils flare and the pupils of his eyes widen. He leaps back before he gets sick. Dervish strides forward and slams the door shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they doing here?\" Meera pants. \"Where did they come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No time for questions,\" Dervish murmurs, stroking his beard with the tip of his sword. \"There are probably others with them, demons or mages. They might break the spells and free the way for the werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creatures are scratching at the door, their howls muted by the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The window,\" Dervish says. \"There are handholds down the wall. We can get out that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Handholds?\" Meera asks dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me paranoid,\" Dervish says, \"but I always like to have an escape route.\" He crosses to the window and jerks hard on the strings of the blinds, yanking them all the way up. As he leans forward to unlatch the window, I get a sudden sense of danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down!\" I scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish doesn\u0027t pause, which is the only thing that saves him. Because as he throws himself flat in response to my cry, the glass above his head shatters from the gunfire of several rifles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeera curses and ducks low. The bullets strike the wall and shelves, ripping up many of Dervish\u0027s rare books, knocking weapons from their holders. A few ricochet into his computer and laptop, which explode in showers of sparks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m lying face down, shivering. This is my first experience of modern warfare. I find the guns more repulsive than demons. I can accept the evil ways of otherworldly beasts who know nothing except chaos and destruction. But to think that humans created such violent, vicious weapons...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Meera screams as the gunfire stops. \"Who\u0027s out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t introduce themselves,\" Dervish quips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s sitting with his back to the wall, beneath the shattered glass of the window. He has the look of a man studying a difficult crossword puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re trapped,\" I snap. Meera and Dervish look at me. Meera\u0027s afraid, Dervish curious. \"Do we fight the werewolves or the people with guns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The werewolves would appear to be the preferable option,\" Dervish says. \"We can\u0027t fight the crew outside-we\u0027d be shot to ribbons in no time. But whoever set this up will have thought of that. I doubt we\u0027ll have a clear run if we get past the werewolves-which is a pretty sizeable if.\" He gets to his knees and grins. \"How about we fight neither of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Meera growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A paranoid person has one escape route, easy to spot if your foe has a keen eye. But a real paranoia freak always has a second, less obvious way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two desks in the study, Dervish\u0027s main workstation and a second, smaller table for the spillover. He crawls to that, wincing when he cuts his hands and knees on shards of glass. He reaches it and stands, having checked to make sure no snipers can see him. \"Help me with this,\" he grunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeera and I aren\u0027t sure what his plan is, but we both shuffle to his side and push as he directs. The desk slides away more smoothly than I would have thought, given the thick carpet which covers the floor. Dervish stoops, grabs a chunk of the carpet and tugs hard. A square patch rips loose. Beneath lies a trapdoor with a round handle. Dervish takes hold and pulls. A crawlway beneath the floor is revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where does it lead?\" Meera asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are a couple of exits,\" Dervish explains. \"It runs to the rear of the house. There\u0027s a window. We can drop to the ground if nobody\u0027s outside. If that way\u0027s blocked, a panel opens on to one of the corridors beneath us, so we can sneak through the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we survive, remind me to give you a giant, slobbery kiss,\" Meera says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a deal,\" he grins and slides his legs into the hole. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-s-shadow-the-demonata-7/page-8.html","bookId":2181,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM"}
