I can’t believe you did this.” I smiled at my mom and dad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you surprised, sweetheart?” my mom asked with a big smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Surprised isn’t the word for it, Mom. Wow. Thank you both so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my mom and dad hugged me and my mom gave me twenty-two birthday kisses, Peyton walked up to me and held out her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Happy birthday, Collin,” she said as she kissed both my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Peyton. Where’s Henry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s on his way. He got held up with a patient. I don’t think I need to ask how you’re doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a deep breath. “I’m hanging in there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry for Hailey’s behavior, but I want you to know that my feelings for you will never change. I love you very much and nothing my daughter does will change that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too, Peyton. Thank you.” I smiled. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m in need of a scotch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked away and to the bar where the bartender poured me a scotch. As I took a sip, I heard a voice behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you’re having a happy birthday, Collin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Denny, it’s good to see you. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m okay, son. But let’s not talk about me. The question of the evening is how are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t help but smile because I felt a lecture coming on. I remembered growing up and listening to him lecture my dad all the time. He had a certain tone in his voice that he used right before the lecture. He wasn’t looking well and I knew my dad was overly worried about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m doing okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come with me and let’s go sit down,” he said as he put his arm around me and led me to the couch where no one was sitting. “Your dad is worried about you and, frankly, so am I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay, Uncle Denny. I’m fine. There’s no need to worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? Because you’re boozing it up and having sex with women all over the state.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Denny, keep it down,” I said as I looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled loudly. “You sure are your father’s son. One day, my boy. One day, she’ll sweep you off your feet. And trust me, it won’t be Hailey. She was never ‘the one’ anyway and someday, you’ll finally realize that. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go talk to your mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and left me sitting there, speechless. I could guarantee I had the same look on my face that my dad always did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Collin. It’s time to blow out your birthday candles.” My mom smiled she led me into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone gathered around, sang “Happy Birthday,” and clapped as I blew out twenty-two glowing candles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you make a wish, son?” my dad asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I did.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was celebrating my birthday on the outside, but on the inside, I was a broken man with a void so deep that any emotion or feeling would get lost and never be found. After I cut the first piece of cake, I handed the knife to my mom and walked over to the bar to fill up on scotch for the night. I just needed to feel numb this last time. Tomorrow would be different. But for tonight, I needed to forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree Months Later...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my birthday and some serious thought, I decided to tone it down a bit. When I say that, I meant that I was more careful about what I was doing. I didn’t get as drunk on weeknights anymore because I was solely focused on Black Enterprises and my job. But I sure as hell made up for it on the weekends. I partied starting at six o’clock Friday night until eight p.m. Sunday. I went to clubs, friends’ parties, and had a lot of sex. I hated to admit that I also broke some hearts. These women knew it was for one night only, so it wasn’t my fault or problem if they couldn’t understand that. As far as my parents were concerned, I was starting to turn my life around and becoming a more responsible adult. But I couldn’t fool Julia. She knew me all too well and there were some nights I spent down in her and Jake’s apartment because I didn’t want my parents to see how drunk I was. Overall, I was having fun. I was finally starting to get over Hailey because the more women I slept with and then left afterwards was working for me. I had the best of both worlds, an amazing job and many women at my side any time I snapped my fingers. I didn’t need to be tied down in a relationship. My heart was healing and, for the first time since Hailey left, I felt good. My new motto in life: No tied-down relationships make for a happy man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, Diana. Is he in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, he is, Collin.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I sent a text to Jacob last night and he didn’t text me back. Is he okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s fine. He had a friend over last night and they were playing video games. He probably just forgot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. I’m glad the little guy is making new friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. It’s really helped since I was able to put him in that private school. Thanks to you and your father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t mention it.” I winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door and saw my dad turned around in his chair, staring out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Dad. Is everything okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around and looked at me. “Yeah, son. Everything’s fine. I was just thinking about Denny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So does that mean you’ve hired a new driver?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, son, I have. You know him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do?” I asked in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. I’ve hired Ralph from the transportation department.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t help but burst into laughter. “You mean Ralphie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad gave me a stern look. “Yes, and don’t call him that. He’s a very good employee and has been for many years. I think he’ll do fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “If you say so. He’s no Denny, that’s for sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There will never be another Denny,” my dad said as he turned back around and stared out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, Daddy. Good morning, little brother,” Julia said as she walked into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning, sis. Wow. You look bigger than yesterday!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lightly jabbed me in the shoulder. “Jake and I are going for the ultrasound today and want to know if you and Mom want to come with us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad’s eyes, which were just filled with sadness a few moments ago, lit up when Julia asked him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-13.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
