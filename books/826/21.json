{"id":18601,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. THE GOOD SAMARITAN.","content":"Man is but a whimsical animal at best, for there is no life but what may some day act in discord with its theory.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Patience Allerby occupied a very peculiar position, and knew that she did so, much to her perplexity. Ever since her lapse from virtue she had lived a self-denying existence as an expiation for her sin, and she had cause to be satisfied with the past twenty years of her life, seeing that she had done nothing wrong all the time. True, living in almost monastic existence, she had no temptations to fight against, and the absence of temptation rendered it comparatively easy to lead a virtuous life. Not being tempted she lived an ascetic life, being absolutely certain that she was strong enough to withstand any temptation, however powerful. Vain hope, for now the devil in the person of her old betrayer assaulted her on her weakest side. Had he tried to make her rob her master or return to her old life of sin, he would have failed dismally, but an appeal through her motherhood was perilous to her strength, and Beaumont knew this when he used her love for Reginald as a weapon against her. In spite of her prayers, her tears, her comforting texts, she knew that if Beaumont wished her to commit any crime to benefit her son she would do so in defiance of her religious belief, however strong.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e God alone knew the night of anguish this woman passed, wrestling with the subtle temptation placed before her in such an attractive shape. Those old saints, who, according to pious legends, fought with the visible powers of evil, had no such terrible enemies to cope with, in contrast to a soul racked with doubt fighting against spiritual promptings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In vain this poor soul, who wished to do right, closed her ears to the infernal whisperings of evil spirits, in vain she read with frenzied ardour the terrible prophecies of Isaiah or the comforting promises of the Gospels, in vain she knelt weeping bitterly before the crucifix, praying to be guarded from falling into sin. It was all useless. Either spiritual weapons had lost their efficacy, or her intense maternal passion blunted her sense of religious duty, and after a terrible struggle with her invisible enemies, which left her completely prostrate, she began to calmly consider Beaumont\u0027s scheme. From that moment she was lost; for, on reviewing the whole matter she began to pacify her conscience with arguments concerning the rectitude of the affair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She would be doing no wrong to anyone--nay, she would be conferring a benefit on Una, seeing that by her marriage with Reginald she would be put in possession of the property at once, whereas should the will be carried out strictly she would have to wait everlastingly for the appearance of a non-existing person. Suppose she agreed to Beaumont\u0027s plan, and said Fanny Blake and the squire were the parents of her son, he would become rich and honoured, bearing a renowned name and no longer be an unknown waif, heavily handicapped in the battle of life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the other hand he would learn the shame of his birth, and that would cast an everlasting shadow on his young spirit. What wealth--what position could compensate in his own eyes for the moral stigma thus cast upon him. He might succeed to the property, marry Una, and thus do no harm to anyone, still, if he became a father, how deeply would he feel for the sins of his parents being visited on his offspring. No, she could not place him in such a position; better for him to remain unknown and obscure, with a full belief in his honourable birth, than go through life haunted by the spectre of an intolerable disgrace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While thus hesitating between these two views of the case, a sudden idea came to her, which inclined her to refuse to help Beaumont and let the boy make his own life, ignorant of the stain on his name. The squire, in spite of his miserly habits, had a kind heart. She would ask him to give Reginald fifty or a hundred pounds to help him, then the lad could go to London and make a position by his vocal talents. Thus, he would benefit in no way through money unjustly obtained, and Una, being in possession of the property, he could marry her and enjoy it just the same as if the scheme were carried out. Yes, it would be the best way; he would at least never know who or what he was, and she would thus assist him in life without committing a crime. The more she thought of the plan the better she liked it, and falling on her knees in the dark she thanked God long and fervently for the solution he had shown her of the difficulty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Next morning she proceeded to carry her ideas into effect, for after Miss Cassy and Una had paid their usual morning visit, she found herself alone with the squire and in a position to make her request.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Garsworth was lying in bed, propped up by pillows, and looked very feeble indeed, so that Patience saw the end could not be far off, in spite of Nestley\u0027s care and attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After his recovery from his debauch, Nestley had felt bitter shame at his fall, but having lost his self-respect by thus reverting to his old ways, he tried to drown remorse by drinking, and alcohol was rapidly regaining all its old influence over him. Still he did not let it interfere with his attendance on the Squire, and if the old man saw that Nestley\u0027s hand was shaky, and his eyes becoming bleared, he said nothing, and the unhappy young man performed his duties in a mechanical way, drinking deeply whenever an opportunity offered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nestley, looking haggard and unsteady after his drinking of the previous night, had just left the room, leaving Patience alone with the Squire, when the old man spoke sharply:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Patience, what is the matter with the doctor?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Drink!\" she answered laconically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Drink!\" repeated the Squire, raising himself on his elbow. \"Nonsense, woman, you must be mistaken, he drinks neither wine nor spirits.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He never did until a week ago,\" answered Patience coolly, \"he used to be a total abstainer, but now--well, you can see for yourself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The long connection that had existed between this strange couple as master and servant, had developed between them a certain amount of familiarity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I remember,\" said Garsworth musingly, \"that in my last incarnation, I drank ale very much--it was in the reign of Elizabeth, and we drank confusion to the King of Spain--it resulted in confusion to myself. If I had not been a drunkard, I would not have been a pauper; it\u0027s a pity this young man should follow the same downward path.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s his own fault,\" replied Patience in a stony manner, \"he ought to stop when he finds it does him harm.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No doubt,\" returned the old man acidly, \"but did you ever know a man deny himself anything if it did him harm?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You did.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, because I had an object to gain. The life I led in Town was very pleasant, but it would have left me a pauper for my next incarnation.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was no use trying to argue the old man out of his delusion, so Patience said nothing, but stood beside him in grim silence with folded arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll enjoy myself when I\u0027m born again,\" pursued Garsworth exultingly. \"I will have plenty of money and a new body. I will have youth once again. Oh, youth! youth! how short are your golden hours. Young men never know the treasure they possess in youth, and waste it in idleness and folly; there\u0027s that child you brought up, Reginald Blake----\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I did not bring him up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, well,\" rejoined Garsworth testily. \"You know what I mean, you were his nurse--but he has youth, good looks, health and talents--why doesn\u0027t he go to London with such advantages, instead of wasting his life in a dull village?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s got no money,\" retorted Patience icily; \"all you mention go for nothing without money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No doubt, no doubt,\" muttered Garsworth, his eyes gleaming; \"money is a necessity--still he has talents, I hear.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What can talents do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Everything; a clever brain commands the world.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I dare say,\" retorted Patience ironically, \"if it gets money to give it a start. Master Reginald has it in him to make a great name by his voice, but he needs help--the help of money--who will give him that help?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She eyed the old man keenly as she spoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, who indeed?\" he replied carelessly, \"who indeed?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why not yourself?\" said the housekeeper eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I?\" he ejaculated in surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, you,\" she retorted vehemently. \"I was as you say the nurse of that boy. I have loved him far more than his dead parents ever did; they left him to me, and I stood in his mother\u0027s place: it is my dearest wish that he should succeed--with money he can do so. I have served you long and faithfully and asked no favour, but now that you have mentioned his name, I ask this first and last favour of you, give him money and help him to succeed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think I\u0027m mad?\" cried the old man shrilly. \"Why should I help him? What is he to me? I have gathered all my wealth by years of self-denial. I want to enjoy it in my next existence, not squander it in this by helping a pauper.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And yet you talk of the golden hours of youth,\" she replied bitterly. \"It\u0027s easy saying, but hard doing. What is a hundred pounds to you?--a drop in the ocean. What is it to him?--everything.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can\u0027t part with my money,\" he said doggedly, turning his face away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her voice took a tender tone as she pleaded for her son.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He has no claim upon you, I know, but think of his youth, his talents, wasted in this dull village. You say you will remember in your next body what you have done in this; for years you have never done a kind action to a human being, do one now by helping this lad, and your next existence will be none the worse for having helped an unknown man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The old man made no reply, but was clearly moved by her argument.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And again,\" said Patience, still in the same anxious voice, \"with your help he will make a position in the world. What position will you occupy? with all your money, you may be born a prince or a ploughboy--you do not know--but in whatever station you are born, his influence, his friendship, may be a help to you, and it will be all the more precious when you know it is your work.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The woman\u0027s voice died away in a soft manner, and she anxiously watched the old man\u0027s wrinkled face to see if he would do what she asked. Evidently her words appealed either to his selfishness or good nature, for, turning towards her, a smile spread over his crabbed face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll do it, Patience,\" he said quickly. \"I\u0027ll do it--perhaps he will be of help to me in my next life--get me my cheque book, and I\u0027ll write a cheque for fifty pounds--no more--no more. I can\u0027t afford it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fifty is no use--say one hundred,\" she urged eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, well! one hundred,\" he said peevishly, \"it\u0027s a large sum, still it may do good to me. I\u0027ll write a letter with it, and tell him he must do what I ask in my next life. Will he do that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes! Yes!\" she replied impatiently, in nowise affronted by his selfish motives. \"He is not the man to forget a kind action.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t thank me,\" he said angrily, as she went over to the escritoire and got his cheque book. \"Grasping! ungrateful!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not ungrateful,\" she retorted, bringing the pen and ink to him with the cheque book, and a block of blotting paper to write on, \"but I do thank you. I was never one for lip service.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bah! women are all alike,\" he said viciously, sitting up in bed, and seizing the pen. \"Go and bring me some letter paper and an envelope.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She did so, and returned to his bedside by the time he had written the cheque.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve post-dated this cheque,\" he said cunningly, \"because I won\u0027t send it to him till just before I die.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you mean by post-dated?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is the twelfth,\" he replied, smoothing out the letter paper, \"I have dated it the thirtieth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do you know you\u0027ll die then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know if I will, you fool,\" he retorted angrily, \"but I think so--if I don\u0027t I\u0027ll write another cheque.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, and change your mind.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No--no--a promise is a promise--if he helps me in the future I\u0027ll help him now--be quiet, you cat, I want to write.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She remained silent, and very slowly and painfully the old man wrote a letter, then he directed the envelope to Reginald Blake at the Vicarage and placed the letter and cheque therein. After doing this he closed the letter and told her to bring sealing-wax and his seal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What for?\" she asked, going over to his desk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because I\u0027m not going to let anyone but himself see what I have written--you needn\u0027t be afraid--I will do what I say, look at the cheque, you fool.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She had brought a candle to the bedside so that he could melt the wax for the seal, and as he held the cheque out to her she read it in the dim light.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s all right,\" she said with a sigh of relief, \"I thank you very much.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You needn\u0027t,\" he retorted cynically, sealing the letter with the Garsworth arms. \"I do it for my own sake not his; now put this letter in the desk and let me see you do it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He handed her his keys, so taking them and the letter over to the desk, she deposited it in the place indicated by his lean, outstretched finger, and having locked it safely up, blew out the candle and brought the keys back to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Squire placed them under his pillow, then lay down again with a sigh of exhaustion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There, I\u0027ve done what you asked,\" he said in a dull voice, \"now go away. I\u0027ll sleep a little.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Patience carefully tucked all the clothes round him and then left the room with a look of triumph on her face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Basil Beaumont,\" she said when she was outside the door. \"I think I can laugh at you and your threats about my son.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1864/53962.html","bookId":826,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 9:54:52 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 9:54:52 AM"}
