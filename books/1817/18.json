You can do whatever you want, but I’m going to tell you about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a light laugh and gave me a strange look. “And what makes you think that I want to know anything about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter if you do or don’t. I’m going to tell you anyway.” I smiled. “I live in New York City and I work for my dad at Black Enterprises. He’s grooming me to take over his company when he retires. I have a sister whom I adore and she’s going to have a baby; a boy, in fact. I graduated from Columbia with a degree in business and I have a lot of friends. Friends who I count on for support when things aren’t going right in my life. I party too much; something that I’m changing, and at those parties, I tend to drink too much. But you already knew that when you tripped over me last night.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you telling me all this? And for the record, you tripped me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You should’ve been paying attention to where you were walking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was looking up at the stars because I love them and they soothe me. You shouldn’t have drank so much that you passed out on the beach.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touché, Amelia. Touché.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away, but with a smile. I was responsible for her smile and I felt good about that. I bumped my shoulder against hers and she bumped me back. “Fine, Mr. Black. Come to my house tomorrow morning at nine o’clock and bring me coffee and breakfast. We can sit and talk some more. I’m leaving the day after tomorrow,” she said as she got up and began walking towards her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you leaving to?” I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Home,” she yelled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And where’s home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“New York.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched her walk up the beach. I didn’t want her to leave, but I’d have to settle for seeing her tomorrow morning. I got up, picked up the blanket and the sundae cups, and headed back up to the house. Now I’d have to explain to my parents who she was and how I met her. If I lied about it, they’ll eventually find out, so I better just tell them the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back already?” my dad asked as I walked in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Amelia had to get home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does she live around here?” my mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Down the street. Corner house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm. Nobody’s been living in that house for the last two years. The people who owned it bought it, moved some stuff in, and then they hadn’t been back. Are you sure that’s where she lives?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what she said, Dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to tell us how the two of you met and when?” My mom smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there it was. I knew it wouldn’t take long. “Do you really want to know the truth, Mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I want the truth, Collin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not going to like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spill it. Now!” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, but you can’t get mad at me,” I said as I raised my hands. “Aiden and I went to a new club last night. I drank too much, passed out on the beach, and Amelia found me and brought me in the house and up to bed. Okay, she didn’t find me; she tripped over me and then, today, at the grocery store, I hit her, by accident, with my cart. So I invited her to dinner as a thank you and an apology.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom looked at my dad and smiled. “I already love her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s something about that story that sounds familiar.” My dad smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you like her?” my mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think she’s a nice girl. She isn’t interested in relationships or friendships.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm, sounds familiar,” my dad said as he raised his eyebrow at my mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at him and that was enough for him to lean over and kiss her. A kiss that turned into a make-out session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to bed. I’ll see you in the morning,” I said as I rolled my eyes and went up to my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, I was up bright and early. I didn’t get much sleep because I couldn’t stop thinking about Amelia all night. Damn it. What the hell is going on? I walked downstairs and saw my dad sitting outside on the patio, drinking coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning, Dad. You’re up early.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, son. I’m always up early. Your mom is still sleeping. I think I wore her out last night.” He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad, seriously. I really think you say this stuff on purpose,” I said as I sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled before taking a sip of his coffee. “You really like Amelia, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t really know her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter. I could tell the moment we walked in last night that you were different, and then when you came back from the beach, you seemed really happy. I haven’t seen that look from you in a very long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared straight ahead as I contemplated whether or not to tell him how I was feeling. “There’s something about her, Dad. Something that affects me in a really good way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at me and smiled. “I know that feeling. You do whatever it takes to get her if you really like her. If you need my help, just ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Dad. But I don’t think stalking her will accomplish much.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, it worked for me.” He winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up from the chair and put my hand on his shoulder. “I have to go and grab breakfast and coffee for her. I’ll talk to you later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have fun, son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove up the driveway and threw the Range Rover in park. I grabbed the large brown bag and the two coffees I bought at the café about a mile away. Before I even made it to the porch, Amelia opened the door. God, she looked amazing and my heart started to beat a little faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re on time.” She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m always on time.” I smiled back as I handed her the brown bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walked into her house, I was shocked by all the boxes that sat around; sealed and marked. There was no furniture downstairs except for the kitchen table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, it’s like an obstacle course in here. Don’t mind the mess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, it’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask her what was going on, but I was afraid she’d tell me off. I set our coffees down on the table and sat in the chair while she opened the bag. She looked at me and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got a lot of stuff in this bag.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-18.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
