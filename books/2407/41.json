He didn\u0027t tell them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" Connor said, \"otherwise, there wouldn\u0027t be five Japanese nationals asking to inspect the wreck of a Ferrari in the middle of the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they\u0027re still looking for the tape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Or evidence of the tape. They may not even know how many are missing, at this point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find the tape,\" Connor said. \"Because it matters. People are dying for that tape. If we can find the original...\" He shook his head. \"It\u0027ll put Ishiguro in deep shit. Which is just where he belongs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled up in front of my apartment building. As Elaine had said, all the reporters were gone. The street was quiet. Dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still want to go with you,\" I said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor shook his head. \"I\u0027m on extended leave,\" he said. \"You\u0027re not. You\u0027ve got your pension to think of. And you don\u0027t want to know exactly what I am going to do tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can guess,\" I said. \"You\u0027re going to retrace Eddie\u0027s steps from last night. Eddie left his house and went to stay with the redhead. Maybe he went somewhere else, too - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Connor said. \"Let\u0027s not waste more time, kōhai. I have some contacts and some people I can lean on. Leave it at that. If you need me, you can call me on the car phone. But don\u0027t call unless you have to. Because I\u0027ll be busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, kōhai. Out of the car. Spend a nice night with your kid. You did a good job, but your job is finished now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sayonara,\" Connor said, with an ironic wave. And he drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy! Daddy!\" She ran toward me, arms outstretched. \"Pick me up, Daddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked her up. \"Hi, Shelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy, can I watch Sleeping Beauty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Have you had dinner yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She ate two hot dogs and an ice cream cone,\" Elaine said. She was washing dishes in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez,\" I said. \"I thought we were going to stop feeding her junk food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s all she would eat,\" Elaine said. She was irritable. It was the end of a long day with a two-year-old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy, can I watch Sleeping Beauty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute, Shelly, I\u0027m talking to Elaine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried that soup,\" Elaine said, \"but she wouldn\u0027t touch it. She wanted a hot dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy, can I watch Disney channel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michelle,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine said, \"So I thought it was better that she eat something. I think she was thrown off. You know, the reporters and everything. All the excitement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy? Can I? Sleeping Beauty?\" She was squirming in my arms. Patting my face to get my attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Shel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Daddy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put her down. She ran into the living room and turned on the TV, pushing the remote without hesitation. \"I think she watches too much television.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all do,\" Elaine said, shrugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went into the living room and plugged in the cassette. I fast-forwarded to the credits, then let it run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this part,\" she said impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I fast-forwarded to the beginning of the action. Pages turning in a book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This part, this part,\" she said, tugging at my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let the tape run at normal speed. Michelle sat in the chair and started sucking her thumb. She pulled her thumb out of her mouth and patted the seat beside her. \"Here, Daddy,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted me to sit with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. I looked at the room. It was a mess. Her crayons and coloring books were scattered over the floor. And the large Tinkertoy windmill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me clean up,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll be right here, with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe popped her thumb back in her mouth, and turned to the screen. Her attention was total.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleaned up the crayons and put them back in the cardboard box. I folded up her coloring books and set them on the shelf. I was suddenly tired and sat down for a minute on the floor next to Michelle. On the screen, three fairies, red, green, and blue, were flying into the throne room of the castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Merryweather,\" Michelle said, pointing. \"She\u0027s the blue one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the kitchen, Elaine said, \"Can I fix you a sandwich, Lieutenant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d be great,\" I said. I found I just wanted to sit there and be with my daughter. I wanted to forget everything, at least for a while. I was grateful that Connor had dropped me off. I sat and watched the TV dumbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine brought in a salami sandwich with lettuce and mustard. I was hungry. Elaine looked at the TV, shook her head, and went back into the kitchen. I ate my sandwich, and Michelle insisted on a few bites. She likes salami. I worry about the additives in it, but I guess it\u0027s no worse than hot dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I had the sandwich, I felt a little better. I got up to finish cleaning up the room. I picked up the Tinkertoy windmill and started taking it apart, putting the sticks back into the cardboard tube. Michelle said, \"No this, no this!\" in a pained voice. I thought she didn\u0027t want me to take apart the windmill, but that wasn\u0027t it at all. She was cupping her hands over her eyes. She didn\u0027t like to see Maleficent, the bad witch. I fast-forwarded past the witch, and she relaxed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dismantled the Tinkertoy windmill and put everything back into the tube container. I put the metal cap on the tube and set it on the lowest shelf of the bookcase. That was where it always went. I like to keep the toys low, so Michelle can get to them herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tube fell off the shelf, onto the carpet. I picked it up again. There was something on the shelf. A small gray rectangle. I knew at once what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an eight-millimeter video cassette, with Japanese writing on the label.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine said, \"Lieutenant? Do you need anything else?\" She had her coat on; she was ready to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on a minute,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the phone, and called the switchboard downtown. I asked them to connect me to Connor in my car. I waited impatiently. Elaine looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just another minute, Elaine,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the TV, the prince was singing a duet with Sleeping Beauty while birds chirped. Michelle was sucking her thumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operator said, \"I\u0027m sorry, there is no answer from the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"Do you have a forwarding number for Captain Connor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause. \"He\u0027s not on our active roster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. But did he leave a number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have anything, Lieutenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute.\" She put me on hold. I swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine stood in the front hallway. She was waiting to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operator came back on. \"Lieutenant? Captain Ellis says that Captain Connor has gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was here a while ago, but he\u0027s gone now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean he was downtown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but he\u0027s gone now. I don\u0027t have a number for him. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up. What the hell was Connor doing downtown?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine was still standing in the front hallway. \"Lieutenant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Just a minute, Elaine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant, I have a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said, just a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started pacing. I didn\u0027t know what to do. I was suddenly overwhelmed with fear. They had killed Eddie for the tape. They wouldn\u0027t hesitate to kill anybody else. I looked at my daughter, watching television with her thumb in her mouth. I said to Elaine, \"Where\u0027s your car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the garage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Look. I want you to take Michelle and I want you to go - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang. I grabbed it, hoping it was Connor. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moshi moshi. Connor-san desu ka?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not here,\" I said. As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I cursed myself. But it was too late, the damage was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good, Lieutenant,\" the voice said, heavily accented. \"You have what we want, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I don\u0027t know what you are talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you do, Lieutenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear a faint hiss on the line. The call was coming from a car phone. They could be anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could be right outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Who is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I heard only a dial tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine said, \"What is it, Lieutenant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was running to the window. I saw three cars double-parked in the street below. Five men getting out of them, dark silhouettes in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to stay calm. \"Elaine,\" I said. \"I want you to take Michelle, and both of you go into my bedroom. Get under the bed. I want you to stay under there and be very quiet, no matter what happens. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Daddy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it now, Elaine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Daddy! I want to watch Sleeping Beauty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can watch it later.\" I had taken out my gun and was checking the clip. Elaine\u0027s eyes were wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took Michelle. \"Come on, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichelle squirmed in her arms, protesting. \"No, Daddy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michelle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went silent, shocked at my tone. Elaine carried her into the bedroom. I loaded another clip, and put it in my jacket pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned off the lights in the bedroom, and in Michelle\u0027s room. I looked at her crib, and the covers with little elephants sewn into it. I turned off the lights in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back into the living room. The TV was still playing. The wicked witch was instructing her raven to find Sleeping Beauty. \"You are my last hope, my pet, do not fail me,\" she said to the bird. The bird flew away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed low. I moved toward the door. The phone rang again. I crawled back to answer it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kōhai.\" It was Connor\u0027s voice. I heard the static hiss of the car phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the tape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I have the tape. Where are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, get here. Right away. And call for backup! Jesus!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a sound on the landing, outside my door. A soft sound, like footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up the phone. I was sweating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Connor was at the airport, he was twenty minutes away from me. Maybe more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to have to handle this on my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the door, listening intently. But I didn\u0027t hear anything else on the landing outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the bedroom, I heard my daughter say, \"I want Sleeping Beauty. I want Daddy,\" I heard Elaine whispering to her. Michelle whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant,\" the heavily accented voice said, \"there is no need for backups.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrist, they were listening to the car phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We want no harm, Lieutenant. We want only one thing. Will you be so kind, to bring the tape out to us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have the tape,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You can have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. It will be better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I was on my own. I was thinking fast. My sole idea was: Get them away from here. Get them away from my daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not here,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock at the front door. Quick, insistent rapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel events closing in around me. Things were happening too fast. I was crouched down on the floor, with the phone pulled down from the table above. Trying to stay below the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knock came again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said into the phone, \"You can have the tape. But first call off your boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say again, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrist, a fucking language problem!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call your men away. Get them out in the street. I want to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant, we must have tape!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll give it to you.\" While I talked, I kept my eyes on the door. I saw the knob turning. Someone was trying to open the front door. Slowly, quietly. Then the knob was released. Something white slid under the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA business card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant, please cooperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawled forward and picked up the card. It said: Jonathan Connor, Captain, Los Angeles Police Department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I heard a whisper from the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kōhai.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it was a trick. Connor said he was at the airport, so it had to be a trick -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps I can be of assistance, kōhai.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were the words he had used before, at the start of the case. I was confused to hear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the fucking door, kōhai.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Connor. I reached up and opened the door. He slipped into the room, bent over. He was dragging something blue: a Kevlar vest. I said, \"I thought you were - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, and whispered, \"Knew they must be here. Had to be. I\u0027ve been waiting in the car in the alley behind the house. How many are there in front?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think, five. Maybe more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe accented voice on the phone said, \"Lieutenant? You are there? Lieutenant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the receiver away from my ear so Connor could listen while I talked. \"I\u0027m here,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the TV, there was a loud witch\u0027s cackle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lieutenant, I hear something with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just Sleeping Beauty,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?

I slid out of my coat as I spoke into the phone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-41.html","bookId":2407,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM"}
