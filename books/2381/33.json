Her pale skin glowed in the darkness. “What, is it a secret? Am I not good enough to know or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not,” Spencer squeaked. “It’s just…I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rolled to a red light. Spencer looked back and forth, then slowly pressed the Hummer’s UNLOCK button. As she curled her fingers around the door handle, Mona grabbed her other wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” Mona’s eyes glowed in the traffic light’s red glare. Her head swiveled from Spencer’s phone back to Spencer’s panicked face. Spencer could see the realization flooding over Mona—it was like watching black and white turn to color in The Wizard of Oz. Mona’s expression went from confusion to shock to…glee. She pressed the car door’s LOCK button again. When the light turned green, she gunned the engine and made a stomach-churning left through the intersection and veered off onto a bumpy, two-lane country road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer watched as the odometer climbed from fifty to sixty to seventy. She clutched her door handle tightly. “Where are we going?” she asked in a small, terrified voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona glanced at Spencer sideways, a sinister smile pasted on her face. “You were never one for patience.” She winked and blew Spencer a kiss. “But this time you’ll just have to wait and see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e35\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE CHASE IS ON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Hanna had arrived at the party in a limo and Emily’s mother had driven her, their only vehicle option was Aria’s clunky, unpredictable Subaru. Aria led the others through the parking lot, her green suede flats slapping against the pavement. She manually unlocked the door and threw herself into the driver’s seat. Hanna sat in the front passenger seat, and Emily pushed aside all of Aria’s books, empty coffee cups, spare clothes, skeins of yarn, and a pair of stacked-heel boots, and climbed into the back. Aria had her cell phone wedged between her chin and her shoulder—she’d called Wilden to see if Spencer and Mona had shown up at the police station. But after the eighth unanswered ring, she hung up in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wilden isn’t at his desk,” she said. “And he’s not answering his cell, either.” They were quiet for a moment, all lost in their own thoughts. How could Mona be A? Aria thought. How could Mona know so much about us? Aria went over everything Mona had done to her—threatened her with that Wicked Queen doll, sent Sean the pictures that got Ezra arrested, sent Ella the letter that splintered her family apart. Mona had hit Hanna with a car, outed Emily to the school, and made them think that Spencer had killed Ali. Mona had had a hand in Toby Cavanaugh’s death…and maybe Ali’s, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna was staring straight ahead, her eyes wide and unblinking, as if she was possessed. Aria touched her hand. “Are you sure about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna nodded fitfully. “Yes.” Her face was pale and her lips looked dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think it was a good idea that we texted Spencer?” Emily asked, checking her phone for the billionth time. “She hasn’t written back again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe they’re in the police station now,” Aria answered, trying to stay calm. “Maybe Spencer turned off her phone. And maybe that’s why Wilden isn’t answering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria looked at Hanna. There was a big, glistening tear rolling down her cheek, past her bruises and her stitches. “It’s my fault if Spencer is hurt,” Hanna whispered. “I should have remembered sooner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s absolutely not your fault,” Aria said sternly. “You can’t control when you remember things.” She placed a hand on Hanna’s arm, but Hanna wrenched it away, using her hands to cover her face. Aria had no idea how to console her. What must that feel like, to realize that your best friend was also your worst enemy? Hanna’s best friend had tried to kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Emily gasped too. “That picture,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What picture?” Aria asked, starting the car and speeding out of the lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That…that picture Spencer showed us of Ali and Ian. The one with the writing on it? I knew I’d seen it before. Now I know where.” Emily let out a laugh of disbelief. “I was in the yearbook room a couple days ago. And there were these pictures of the insides of people’s bags. That’s where I saw that picture.” She raised her eyes, looking around at the others. “In Mona’s bag. But I only saw Ali’s arm. The pink sleeve was frayed and had a tiny rip.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police station was only a mile or so away, right next to Hooters. It was amazing that Aria and Mike had been there just hours before. When they pulled into the lot, all three of them leaned forward over the dash. “Shit.” There were eight squad cars in the parking lot, and that was it. “They’re not here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calm down.” Aria turned off the car’s headlights. They all jumped out quickly, sprinting for the police station entrance. The fluorescent light inside was greenish and harsh. Several cops stopped and stared at them, their mouths hanging open. The little green waiting benches were all empty except for a few random pamphlets about what you should do if you were the victim of a car theft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilden appeared from around a corner, his cell phone in one hand, a mug of coffee in another. When he saw Hanna and Emily in their party dresses with their masks dangling from their wrists, and Aria in her Rosewood Day uniform with a big bruise on her head, he squinted in confusion. “Hi, girls,” he said slowly. “What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to help us,” Aria said. “Spencer is in trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilden stepped forward, gesturing for them to sit on the benches. “How so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The texts we’ve been getting,” Aria explained. “What I was telling you about earlier today. We know who they’re from.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilden stood up, alarmed. “You do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Mona Vanderwaal,” Hanna said, her voice breaking into a sob. “That’s what I remembered. It’s my best frickin’ friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mona…Vanderwaal?” Wilden’s eyes traveled from one girl to another. “The girl who planned your party?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spencer Hastings is in the car with Mona now,” Emily said. “They were supposed to be coming here—Spencer had something to tell you. But then I sent her a text, warning her about Mona…and now we don’t know where they are. Spencer’s phone is shut off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you tried to reach Mona?” Wilden asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna stared at the linoleum floor. Off in the police bullpen, a phone rang, and then another. “I did. She didn’t pick up either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Wilden’s cell phone lit up in his hand. Aria caught a glimpse of the number in the preview screen. “That’s Spencer!” she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilden flipped it open but didn’t say hello. He pressed the speakerphone button, then looked around at the girls, a finger to his lips. Shhh, he mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria and her old best friends crowded around the little phone. At first, there was only white noise. Then they heard Spencer’s voice. It sounded far away. “I always thought Swedesford Road was so pretty,” she said. “So many trees, especially in this secluded part of town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria and Emily exchanged a confused glance. And then, Aria understood—she’d seen this once in a TV show she’d watched with her brother. Mona must have figured it out—and Spencer must have managed to secretly call Wilden to give him clues about where Mona was taking her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So…why are we turning down Brainard Road?” Spencer asked very loudly and brightly. “This isn’t the way to the police station.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Duh, Spencer,” they heard Mona say back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilden flipped open his pad and wrote down Brainard Road. A few other cops had gathered around them. Emily quietly explained what was going on, and one of the cops brought out a large, foldout map of Rosewood, highlighting the intersection of Swedesford and Brainard with a yellow marker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we going to the stream?” Spencer’s voice rang out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” Mona singsonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s eyes widened. The Morrell Stream was more of a gushing river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just love the stream,” Spencer said loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was a gasp and a shriek. They heard a few bumping noises, a squeal of tires, the dissonant tone of a bunch of phone buttons being pressed at once…and then nothing. Wilden’s cell phone screen blinked. Call Lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria sneaked a look at the others. Hanna had her head buried in her hands. Emily looked like she was going to faint. Wilden stood up, put his phone back in its holster, and pulled his car keys out of his pocket. “We’ll try all the stream entrances in that area.” He pointed to a big burly cop sitting behind a desk. “See if you can do a GPS trace on this phone call.” Then he turned and headed for his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” Aria said, running after him. Wilden turned. “We’re coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilden’s shoulders dropped. “This isn’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re coming,” Hanna said behind Aria, her voice strong and steely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilden raised one shoulder and sighed. He gestured to the back of the squad car. “Fine. Get in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e36\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAN OFFER SPENCER CAN’T REFUSE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona grabbed Spencer’s phone out of her hands, hit END, and tossed it out the window, all without changing the Hummer’s speed. She then made an abrupt U-turn, backtracked down bumpy, narrow Brainard Road, and got on the highway heading south. They drove for about five miles and got off the exit near the Bill Beach burn clinic. More horse farms and housing developments flew past, and the road devolved into woods. It wasn’t until they swept by the old, dilapidated Quaker church that Spencer realized where they were really going—the Floating Man Quarry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer used to play in the big lake at the base of Floating Man Quarry. Kids used to cliff-dive off the upper rocks, but last year, during a drought-filled summer, a public-school boy had dived off the rocks and died, making Floating Man’s name seem eerie and prophetic. These days, there were rumors that the boy’s ghost lived at the quarry’s perimeter, guarding the lake. Spencer had even heard whispers that the Rosewood Stalker had his lair here. She glanced at Mona, feeling a shiver run up her spine. She had a feeling the Rosewood Stalker was driving this Hummer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer had her fingernails pressed so deeply into the center armrest that she was certain they would leave permanent marks. Calling Wilden and giving her location had been her only plan, and now she was completely trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona glanced at Spencer out of the corner of her eye. “So, I guess Hanna remembered, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s nod was barely perceptible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She shouldn’t have remembered,” Mona chanted. “She knew remembering would put all of you in danger. Just like Aria shouldn’t have told the cops. I sent her to Hooters as a test to see if she’d really listen to my warnings—the Hooters is so close to the police station, after all. The cops are always there—so it would be tempting to tell them everything. And obviously, she did.” Mona threw her hands up in the air. “Why do you girls continue to do such stupid things?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unbelievable-pretty-little-liars-4/page-33.html","bookId":2381,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:08 AM"}
