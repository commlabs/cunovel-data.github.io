She could see as much in his now cold eyes, his now hardened face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter that he expect nothing, yes. So that, should 1 fail… But she could not finish that thought, not with every word to follow so brightly painted in her mind-with cowardice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear Sengar set out, leaving her behind. She saw, as she followed, that he no longer held on to his sword. Indeed, he suddenly seemed looser, more relaxed, than she had ever seen him before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not, at that moment, understand the significance of such a transformation. In a warrior. In a warrior who knew how to kill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps he had always known where this journey would end. Perhaps that seemingly accidental visit the first time had been anything but, and Udinaas had been shown where his every decision in the interval would take him, as inevitable as the tide. And now, at last, here he had washed up, detritus in the silt-laden water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill I soon be dining on ranag calf? 1 think not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body of the female Imass was a piteous thing. Desiccated, limbs drawn up as tendons contracted. The wild masses of her hair had grown like roots from a dead tree, the nails of her stubby fingers like flattened talons the hue of tortoiseshell. The smudged garnets that were her eyes had sunk deep within their sockets, yet still seemed to stare balefully at the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, the Bonecaster. The witch who gave her soul to staunch the wound. So noble, this failed, useless sacrifice. No, woman, for you 1 will not weep. You should have found another way. You should have stayed alive, among your tribe, guiding them out from their dark cave of blissful ignorance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The world beyond dies,’ said Clip, sounding very nearly pleased by the prospect. Rings sang out on the ends of the chain. One silver, one gold, spinning in blurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin eyed his fellow Tiste Andii. ‘Clip, you remain blind to… necessity.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint, derisive smile. ‘Hardly, O White Crow. Hardly.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe albino warrior then turned to fix his uncanny red-rimmed eyes upon Udinaas. ‘Is she still with us?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKettle’s hand, tightened in the ex-slave’s, and it was all he could do to squeeze back in reassurance. ‘She gauged our location moments ago,’ Udinaas replied, earning a hiss from Clip. ‘But now, no.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin faced the gate. ‘She prepares for us, then. On the other side.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas shrugged. ‘I imagine so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac stirred and asked, ‘Does that mean she holds the Finnest? Silchas? Udinaas?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Silchas Ruin shook his head. ‘No. That would not have been tolerated. Not by her sisters. Not by the powerful ascendants who saw it fashioned in the first place-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then why aren’t they here?’ Seren demanded. ‘What makes you think they’ll accept your possessing it, Silchas Ruin, when they will not stand for Menandore’s owning it-we are speaking of Menandore, aren’t we?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas snorted. ‘Left no stone unturned in my brain, did you, Acquitor?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas did not reply to her questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ex-slave glanced over at Fear Sengar, and saw a warrior about to go into battle. Yes, we are that close, aren’t we? Oh, Fear Sengar, I do not hate you. In fact, I probably even like you. 1 may mock the honour you possess. I may scorn this path you’ve chosen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I scorned this Bonecaster’s, and yes, Edur, for entirely the same reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause 1 cannot follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUdinaas gently disengaged his hand from Kettle’s, then lifted free the Imass spear strapped to his back. He walked over to Seren Pedac. Set the weapon into her hands, ignoring her raised brows, the confusion sliding into her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Acquitor, if you will seek to aid Fear Sengar-and 1 believe you will-then your need is greater than mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, 1 intend to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin drew his two swords, thrust them both point-first into the ground. And then began tightening the various buckles and straps on his armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, no point in rushing in unprepared, is there? You will need to move quickly, Silchas Ruin, won’t you? Very quickly indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found his mouth was dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDry as this pathetic corpse at his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac gripped his arm. ‘Udinaas,’ she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his arm free. ‘Do what you must, Acquitor.’ Our great quest, our years of one foot in front of the other, it all draws now to a close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo hail the blood. Salute the inevitability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd who, when all is done, will wade out of this crimson tide?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRud Elalle, my son, how 1 fear for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree specks in the sky above the hills to the south. The one named Hedge now half turned and squinted at Ulshun Pral, then said, ‘Best withdraw to the cave. Stay close to Onrack the Broken. And Trull Sengar.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-411.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
