There was a part of me that felt bad about not giving blood for the experiments. After all, I knew what they were doing was useful. If there was a way to protect Moroi from becoming Strigoi, then that could theoretically be applied to humans too. That could revolutionize the way the Alchemists operated. People like that creepy guy Liam being held at the bunker would no longer be a threat. He could be \"sterilized\" and released, with no fear of him falling prey to the corruption of Strigoi. I knew also that Sonya and the others were running into walls with their research. They couldn\u0027t find any reason for what had made Lee impervious to turning Strigoi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, despite the worthiness of the cause, I still felt staunchly opposed to giving up my own blood. I really was afraid that doing so would subject me to more and more experiments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I just couldn\u0027t face that. There was nothing special about me. I hadn\u0027t undergone a massive transformation via spirit. Lee and I hadn\u0027t had anything in common. I was the same as any other human, any other Alchemist. I just apparently had bad tasting blood, which was fine by me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about the charm spell,\" Ms. Terwilliger said one afternoon. It was a few days after Clarence\u0027s, and I was still mulling over those events even while ostensibly doing work in her independent study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up from the book in front of me. \"Which variant? The charisma one or the meta one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sitting at her desk and smiled at me. \"For someone so against all of this, you certainly learn well. The meta one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been a recent spell I\u0027d had to learn. It was fresh in my mind, but I made sure to sigh heavily and let her know in a passive aggressive way how inconvenient this was for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It allows the caster to have short-term control of someone. The caster has to create a physical amulet that he or she wears...\" I frowned as I considered that part of the spell. \"And then recite a short incantation on the person being controlled.\" Ms. Terwilliger pushed her glasses up her nose. \"Why the hesitation?\" She noticed every slip. I didn\u0027t want to engage in this, but she was my teacher, and this was part of my assignment so long as I was stuck in this miserable session. \"It doesn\u0027t make sense. Well, none of it makes sense, of course. But logically, I\u0027d think you need something tangible to use on the vict - subject. Maybe they\u0027d have to wear an amulet. Or drink something. It\u0027s hard for me to believe the caster is the only one who needs enhancement. I feel like they would need to connect with the subject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You touched on the key word,\" she said. \"\u0027Enhancement.\u0027 The amulet enhances the spell caster\u0027s will, as does the incantation. If that\u0027s been done correctly - and the caster is advanced and strong enough - that\u0027ll push the power of command on to the subject. Perhaps it doesn\u0027t seem tangible, but the mind is a powerful tool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Power of command,\" I muttered. Without thinking about it, I made the Alchemist sign against evil. \"That doesn\u0027t seem right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it any different from the kind of compulsion your vampire friends do?\" I froze. Ms. Terwilliger had long since admitted to knowing about the world of Moroi and Strigoi, but it was still a topic I avoided with her. My tattoo\u0027s magic wouldn\u0027t stop me from discussing the vampire world with those who knew about it, but I didn\u0027t want to accidentally reveal any details about my specific mission with Jill. Nonetheless, her words were startling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis spell was very much like compulsion, very much like what I\u0027d seen Sonya do to soothe Clarence. Vampires could simply wield it unaided. This spell required a physical component, but Ms. Terwilliger had told me that was normal for humans. She said magic was inborn for Moroi but that we had to wrest it from the world. To me, that just seemed like more reason why humans had no business dabbling in such affairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What they do isn\u0027t right either,\" I said, in a rare acknowledgment of the Moroi with her. I didn\u0027t like that the abilities I found so twisted and wrong were allegedly within human reach too. \"No one should have that kind of power over another.\" Her lips quirked. \"You\u0027re very haughty about something you have no experience with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t always need experience. I\u0027ve never killed anyone, but I know murder is wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t discount these spells. They could be a useful defense,\" she said with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps it depends on who\u0027s using it - much like a gun or other weapon.\" I grimaced. \"I don\u0027t really like guns either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you may find magical means to be a better option.\" She made a small, graceful motion with her hands, and a clay pot on the windowsill suddenly exploded. Sharp fragments fell to the floor. I jumped out of my desk and backed up a few feet. Was that something she\u0027d been able to do this whole time? It had seemed effortless. What kind of damage could she do if she really tried? She smiled. \"See? Very efficient.\" Efficient and simple, as easy as a vampire wielding elemental magic with a thought. After all the painstaking spells I\u0027d seen in these books, I was stunned to see such \"easy\" magic. It kicked what Ms. Terwilliger had been advocating up to a whole new - and dangerous - level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy whole body tensed as I waited for some other horrific act, but judging from the serene look on her face, that was the only show of power she had in mind - for now. Feeling a little foolish at my reaction, I sat back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and chose my words carefully, keeping my anger - and fear - pushed down. It wouldn\u0027t do to have an outburst in front of a teacher. \"Ma\u0027am, why do you keep doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Terwilliger tilted her head like a bird. \"Doing what, dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This.\" I jabbed the book in front of me. \"Why do you keep making me work on this against my will? I hate this, and you know it. I don\u0027t want anything to do with it! Why do you want me to learn it at all? What do you get out of it? Is there some witch club where you get a finder\u0027s fee if you bring in a new recruit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat quirky smile of hers returned. \"We prefer the term coven, not witch club. Though that does have a nice ring. But, to answer your question, I don\u0027t get anything out of it - at least, not in the way you\u0027re thinking. My coven can always use strong members, and you have the potential for greatness. It\u0027s bigger than that, however. Your perennial argument is that it\u0027s wrong for humans to have this kind of power, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" I said through gritted teeth. I\u0027d made that argument a million times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s absolutely true - for some humans. You worry this power will be abused?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re right. It happens all the time, which is why we need good, moral people who can counter those who would use the magic for selfish and nefarious reasons.\" The bell rang, freeing me. I stood up and gathered my things together. \"Sorry, Ms. Terwilliger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m flattered that you think I\u0027m such an upstanding person, but I\u0027m already caught up in one epic battle of good versus evil. I don\u0027t need another.\" I left our session feeling both troubled and angry and hoped the next two months of this semester would speed by. If this Alchemist mission continued into next year, then creative writing or some other elective would become a very viable choice for my schedule. It was a shame too because I\u0027d really loved Ms. Terwilliger when I first met her. She was brilliant and knew her subject area - history, not magic - and had encouraged me in that. If she\u0027d shown the same enthusiasm for teaching me history as she did magic, we wouldn\u0027t have ended up in this mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dinners were usually spent with Julia and Kristin or \"the family.\" Tonight was a family night. I found Eddie and Angeline already at a table when I entered East\u0027s cafeteria, and as usual, he seemed grateful for my presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, why not?\" Angeline was saying as I sat down with my tray. It was Chinese food night, and she held chopsticks, which seemed like a bad idea. I\u0027d tried to teach her how to use them once, with no luck. She\u0027d gotten angry and stabbed an eggroll so hard that the sticks had broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just... well, it\u0027s not my thing,\" Eddie said, clearly groping for an answer to whatever her question was about. \"I\u0027m not going at all. With anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jill will be there with Micah,\" pointed out Angeline slyly. \"Won\u0027t you need to come keep an eye on her since it\u0027s not at the school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie\u0027s answer was a pained look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" I finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Halloween Dance,\" said Angeline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was news to me. \"There\u0027s a Halloween Dance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie dragged himself from his misery to give me a surprised look. \"How do you not know? There are signs everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stirred around my steamed vegetables. \"They must not be anywhere I\u0027ve been.\" Eddie gestured with his fork to something behind me. Turning, I looked back toward the food line I\u0027d just been in. There, hanging above it on the wall, was an enormous banner that read HALLOWEEN DANCE. It listed the date and time and was decorated with badly drawn pumpkins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you memorize entire books but miss something like that?\" asked Angeline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Sydney\u0027s brain only records \u0027useful\u0027 information,\" Eddie said with a smile. I didn\u0027t deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think Eddie should go?\" pushed Angeline. \"He needs to watch out for Jill. And if he goes, we might as well go together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie shot me a desperate look, and I tried to find him a way out of this. \"Well, yeah, of course he\u0027ll go... especially if it\u0027s off-site.\" The banner mentioned some venue I\u0027d never heard of. We\u0027d seen no sign of the Moroi who were after Jill, but an unknown place presented new dangers. Inspiration hit. \"But that\u0027s the thing. He\u0027ll be on-duty. He\u0027ll spend the whole time checking the place out, watching for mysterious people. It\u0027d be a waste for him to, uh, go with you. You probably wouldn\u0027t have much fun. Better to go with someone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I should be protecting Jill too,\" she argued. \"Isn\u0027t that why I\u0027m here? I need to learn what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, yeah,\" he said, obviously trapped by her logic. \"You\u0027ll have to go with me in order to look after her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngeline brightened. \"Really? Then we can go together!\" Eddie\u0027s look of pain returned. \"No. We\u0027re going together. Not together.\" Angeline didn\u0027t seem to be fazed by the nuances. \"I\u0027ve never been to a dance,\" she admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I mean, back home, we have them all the time. But I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll be like the ones here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I agreed with. I\u0027d seen the types of social events the Keepers had. They involved raucous music and dancing around bonfires, along with some kind of toxic homemade alcohol that probably even Adrian wouldn\u0027t touch. The Keepers also didn\u0027t think a social event was a success if at least one fight didn\u0027t break out. It was actually kind of amazing that Angeline hadn\u0027t gotten into one yet here at Amberwood. I should have counted myself lucky that her only transgressions were dress code violations and talking back to teachers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not,\" I said neutrally. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never been to a dance either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to this one, aren\u0027t you?\" asked Eddie. \"With Brody?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brayden. And I don\u0027t know. We haven\u0027t even had our second date. I don\u0027t want things to move too fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Eddie said. \"Because there\u0027s no bigger sign of commitment than a Halloween dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to get him back by suggesting maybe he and Angeline should go together after all when Jill and Micah joined us. Both were laughing and had a hard time settling down to explain what was so funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Janna Hall finished a men\u0027s suit in sewing club tonight,\" said Jill between giggles. Once again, I felt a rush of joy at seeing her so happy. \"Miss Yamani said it\u0027s the only guy\u0027s outfit she\u0027s seen in there in five years. Of course, Janna needed a model, and there\u0027s only one guy in there...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah attempted a tormented look but was quickly smiling again. \"Yeah, yeah. I did the manly thing and stepped up. That suit was awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw,\" said Jill. \"It wasn\u0027t that awful - okay, it really was. Janna didn\u0027t try to go by any size guidelines, so the pants were huge. Like, tents. And since she didn\u0027t make any belt loops, he had to hold it all up with a sash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which barely held when they made me do a runway walk,\" said Micah, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill gave him a playful nudge. \"Everyone probably would\u0027ve loved if it hadn\u0027t held.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remind me to never ever sign up for an all-girls club again,\" said Micah. \"Next semester, I\u0027m taking something like shop or karate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t do it again? Not even for me?\" Jill managed a look that was amazingly both pouty and alluring. That, I realized, was more effective than any charm spell or compulsion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah groaned. \"I\u0027m helpless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t consider myself particularly sentimental - and still disapproved of their timid romance -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut even I smiled at their antics. At least, I did until I caught sight of Eddie\u0027s face. He wasn\u0027t giving away much, to be fair. Maybe hanging around Dimitri had provided some tips on the guardian poker face. But Eddie wasn\u0027t Dimitri yet, and I could see the faintest signs of pain and longing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did he do this to himself? He\u0027d refused to tell Jill how he felt. He took the noble stance that he was her protector and nothing more. Some part of me could understand that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I couldn\u0027t understand was why he kept torturing himself by endorsing her going out with his roommate, of all people. Even with his hang-up over Micah and Mason, Eddie was forcing himself to constantly watch the girl he wanted with someone else. I had no relatable experience, but it had to be agonizing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie caught my eye and gave a small shake of his head. Let it go, he seemed to be saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t worry about me. I\u0027ll be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngeline soon piped in with more talk about the dance, interrogating Jill and Micah about whether they\u0027d be going. She also brought up her plans to go \"with\" Eddie. That pulled him out of his melancholy mood, and although I knew she annoyed him, I wondered if that was better than continually being tormented by Jill and Micah\u0027s relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the conversation came to a halt - as did Eddie\u0027s problem - when Micah frowned and pointed out what the rest of us had missed. \"Why would you go to the dance together?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAren\u0027t you guys cousins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie, Jill, and I froze. Another cover story mess-up. I couldn\u0027t believe this had now slipped past me twice. I should have mentioned this as soon as Angeline brought up the dance. In the school\u0027s eyes, we were all related.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" asked Angeline, missing the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie cleared his throat. \"Um, third cousins. But still. We\u0027re not really going together. It\u0027s more of a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat effectively killed the topic, and he couldn\u0027t help smiling triumphantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrayden picked me up immediately after school the next day so that we could make the windmill tour on time. Ms. Terwilliger had even let me go a few minutes early, after promising I\u0027d get her a cappuccino on our way back to Amberwood. I was excited to see Brayden and the tour, yet as I got into his car, I felt a brief pang of doubt. Did I have any business doing these sorts of fun, personal activities? Especially now that the cover story had slipped a couple of times. Maybe I was spending too much time on me and not enough on the mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrayden had lots to tell me about the debate competition he\u0027d attended over the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe analyzed some of the more difficult topics he\u0027d come across and laughed at the easy ones that had stumped the opposing team. I\u0027d feared dating for years but was again pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to talk to him. It was a lot like the Shakespearean outing: an endless source of topics that we both knew lots about. It was the rest of the experience that still left me unsettled - the \"date\" stuff. The dating books I\u0027d read since our last outing mostly advised on when to have sex, which was completely useless since I had yet to figure out holding hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant windmills were pretty impressive. They didn\u0027t have the sleek beauty of cars that I loved, but I felt the same awe at the engineering they represented. Some of the windmills were over a hundred feet tall, with blades half the size of a football field. Moments like these made me marvel at human ingenuity. Who needed magic when we could create these kinds of wonders?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur tour guide was a cheery girl in her mid-twenties who clearly loved her job and all that wind energy represented. She knew all sorts of trivia about it - but not quite enough to satisfy Brayden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you address the energy inefficiency that comes from the turbines needing wind speeds that fall into such a narrow range?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen: \"What\u0027s your response to studies showing that simply improving the filters in the conversion of fossil fuels would result in less carbon dioxide emissions than this sort of energy production?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd later: \"Can wind power really be treated as a viable option when - after considering the cost of construction and other maintenance - consumers end up paying more than they would for traditional forms of electricity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t be certain, but I think our guide wrapped up the tour early. She encouraged some of the other tourists to come back anytime but said nothing as Brayden and I walked past her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That woman was sadly uninformed,\" he told me, once we were back on the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knew plenty about the windmills and their facility,\" I pointed out. \"I\u0027m guessing the latest controversies just don\u0027t get brought up much on these tours. Or,\" I paused, smiling,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"how to deal with, um, forceful tourists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was forceful?\" he asked, seeming legitimately surprised. He had gotten so caught up in his ideas that he didn\u0027t even realize it. It was endearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to laugh. \"You came on strong, that\u0027s all. I don\u0027t think they were prepared for someone like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They should be. Wind power\u0027s got promise, true, but for now, there are all sorts of expenses and efficiency problems that need to be addressed. It\u0027s useless otherwise.\" I sat there for several moments, trying to decide how best I should respond. None of the advice I\u0027d gotten from the books or my friends really prepared me for how to handle discussions about alternative energy sources. One of the books - one I\u0027d chosen not to finish - had a decidedly male-centric view that said women should always make men feel important on dates. I suspected that Kristin and Julia\u0027s advice right now would have been to laugh and toss my hair - and not let the discussion progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I just couldn\u0027t do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrayden - who was a big advocate of safe driving - actually took his eyes off the road for a few seconds to stare at me. \"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from learning that he had a vast store of extensive and random knowledge like I did, I\u0027d also picked up on something else central to Brayden\u0027s personality. He didn\u0027t like to be wrong. This was no surprise. I didn\u0027t either, and we had a lot in common that way. And, from the way he\u0027d discussed school and even his debate competition, I\u0027d also deduced people never told him he was wrong - even if by chance he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it wasn\u0027t too late to do the hair-tossing thing. Instead, I just rushed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong. Maybe wind isn\u0027t as efficient as it could be, but the fact that it\u0027s even being developed is a vast improvement over the outdated, archaic energy sources our society\u0027s been dependent on. Expecting it to be as cost-efficient as something that\u0027s been around much, much longer is naive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t deny that the cost is worth the benefits. Climate change is increasingly becoming a problem, and wind\u0027s reduced carbon dioxide emissions could have a significant impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore - and most importantly - wind is renewable. It doesn\u0027t matter if other sources are cheap if they\u0027re going to run out on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to be progressive and look towards what\u0027s going to save us later. To focus strictly on what\u0027s cost-efficient now - while ignoring the consequences - is short-sighted and will ultimately lead to the downfall of the human race. Those who think otherwise are only perpetuating the problem, unless they can come up with other solutions. Most don\u0027t. They just complain. That\u0027s why you\u0027re wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused to catch my breath and then dared a glance at Brayden. He was watching the road, but his eyes were impossibly wide. I don\u0027t think he could have been more shocked if I\u0027d slapped him. Immediately, I berated myself for what I\u0027d said. Sydney, why didn\u0027t you just bat your eyelashes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brayden?\" I asked tentatively when almost a minute passed with no response. More stunned silence met me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, without warning, he pulled the car sharply off the highway and onto the shoulder. Dust and gravel kicked up around us. In that moment, I was absolutely certain he was going to demand I get out and walk back to Palm Springs. And we were still miles from the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he caught hold of my hands and leaned toward me. \"You,\" he said breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are amazing. Absolutely, positively, exquisitely amazing.\" And then he kissed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so surprised, I couldn\u0027t even move. My heart raced, but it was more from anxiety than anything else. Was I doing it right? I tried to relax into the kiss, letting my lips part slightly, but my body stayed rigid. Brayden didn\u0027t pull back in revulsion, so that was a good sign. I\u0027d never kissed anyone before and had been worrying a lot about what it\u0027d be like. The mechanics of it turned out not to be so difficult. When he did finally pull away, he was smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good sign, I guessed. I smiled back tentatively because I knew it was expected. Honestly, a secret part of me was a little disappointed. That was it? That\u0027s what the big deal was? It hadn\u0027t been terrible, but it hadn\u0027t sent me soaring to new heights either. It had been exactly what it seemed like, lips on lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a great sigh of happiness, he turned and began driving again. I could only watch him with wonder and confusion, unable to form any response. What had just happened? That was my first kiss?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spencer\u0027s, right?\" Brayden asked when we exited to downtown shortly thereafter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still so baffled by the kiss that it took me a moment to remember I\u0027d promised Ms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerwilliger a cappuccino. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust before we turned the corner toward the street Spencer\u0027s was on, Brayden suddenly made an unexpected stop at a florist shop. \"Be right back,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded wordlessly, and five minutes later, he returned and handed me a large bouquet of delicate, pale pink roses. \"Thank you?\" I said, making it more of a question. Now, in addition to the kiss and \"amazing\" declaration, I\u0027d somehow earned flowers too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not adequate,\" he admitted. \"In traditional floral symbolism, orange or red would have been more appropriate. But it was either these or some lavender ones, and you just don\u0027t seem like a purple person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I said, more firmly this time. As I breathed in the roses\u0027 sweet scent on the way to Spencer\u0027s, I realized that no one had ever given me flowers before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached the coffee shop soon thereafter. I got out of the car, and in a flash, Brayden was right by my side so that he could shut the door for me. We went inside, and I was almost relieved to see Trey working. His teasing would be a nice return to normality, seeing as my life had just detoured into Crazyland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrey didn\u0027t even notice us at first. He was speaking intently to someone on the other side of the counter, a guy a little older than us. The guy\u0027s tanned skin, black hair, and similar facial features tipped me off pretty quickly that he and Trey were related. Brayden and I waited discreetly behind the guy, and Trey finally looked up, an astonishingly grim expression on his face that was pretty out of character. He looked surprised when he saw us, but then seemed to relax a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melbourne, Cartwright. Here for a little post-windmill caffeine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I never drink caffeine after four,\" said Brayden. \"But Sydney needs something for her teacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" said Trey. \"The usual for you and Ms. T?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but make mine iced this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrey gave me a knowing look. \"Need to cool down a little, huh?\" I rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy ahead of us was still standing around, and Trey nodded toward him while grabbing two cups. \"This is my cousin Chris. Chris, this is Sydney and Brayden.\" This must have been Trey\u0027s \"perfect\" cousin. At a glance, I saw little that marked him as better than Trey, except maybe his height. Chris was pretty tall. Not Dimitri-tall, but still tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise, they both had similar good looks and an athletic build. Chris even had some of the same bruises and scrapes Trey often sported, making me wonder if there was a family connection to sports as well. Regardless, Chris hardly seemed like anyone Trey should be intimidated by, but then, I was biased by our friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you here from?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"San Francisco,\" said Chris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long are you in town?\" asked Brayden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris gave Brayden a wary look. \"Why do you want to know?\" Brayden looked surprised, and I didn\u0027t blame him. Before either of us could figure out the next move in the small-talk handbook, Trey hurried back over. \"Relax, C. They\u0027re just being nice. It\u0027s not like they work for some spy agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Brayden didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" said Chris, not actually sounding that sorry. That was a difference between the cousins, I realized. Trey would\u0027ve laughed off his mistake. He never actually would have made the mistake. There were definitely different levels of friendliness in this family. \"A couple weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Brayden nor I dared say anything after that, and mercifully, Chris chose that opportunity to leave, with a promise to call Trey later. When he was gone, Trey shook his head apologetically and set the completed coffees on the counter. I reached for my wallet, but Brayden waved me away and paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrey handed Brayden back his change. \"Next week\u0027s schedule\u0027s already up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is?\" Brayden glanced over at me. \"Mind if I go in the back room for a second? Figuratively, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" I said. As soon as he was gone, I turned frantically to Trey. \"I need your help.\" Trey\u0027s eyebrows rose. \"Words I never thought I\u0027d hear from you.\" That made two of us, but I was at a loss, and Trey was my only source of help right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brayden got me flowers,\" I declared. I wasn\u0027t going to mention the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, why\u0027d he do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he likes you, Melbourne. That\u0027s what guys do. They buy dinner and gifts, hoping that in return you\u0027ll - um, like them back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I argued with him,\" I hissed, glancing anxiously at the door Brayden had gone through. \"Like, just before he got me the flowers, I gave him this big lecture about how he was wrong about alternative sources of energy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, wait,\" said Trey. \"You told... you told Brayden Cartwright he was wrong?\" I nodded. \"So why\u0027d he react like he did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrey laughed, a big, full laugh that I was certain would draw Brayden back. \"People don\u0027t tell him he\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I figured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And girls especially don\u0027t tell him he\u0027s wrong. You\u0027re probably the only girl who\u0027s ever done it. You\u0027re probably the only girl smart enough to do it.\" I was getting impatient. \"I get that. So why the flowers? Why the compliments?\" Trey shook his head and looked like he was about to start laughing again. \"Melbourne, if you don\u0027t know, then I\u0027m not going to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too worried about Brayden returning to comment further on Trey\u0027s useless \"advice.\" Instead, I said, \"Is Chris the perfect cousin you were talking about?\" Trey\u0027s smirk faded. \"That\u0027s the one. Anything I can do, he can do better.\" I immediately regretted asking. Trey, like Adrian, was one of those people I didn\u0027t like seeing troubled. \"Well. He didn\u0027t seem so perfect to me. Probably I\u0027m biased from being around you all the time. You set the standard for perfection.\" That brought Trey\u0027s smile back. \"Sorry about his attitude. He\u0027s always been like that. Not the most charming branch of the Juarez family tree. That\u0027s me, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still smiling when Brayden returned, but when I cast a glance backward as I was leaving the coffee shop, Trey\u0027s expression had darkened again. His thoughts were turned inward, and I wished I knew how to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the drive back to Amberwood, Brayden said shyly, \"Well. Now I know my schedule for the next two weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s... good,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. \"So... I know when I can go out again. If, that is, I mean. If you want to go out again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would\u0027ve surprised me, if I wasn\u0027t already stumped by everything else that had happened today. Brayden wanted to go out with me again? Why? Girls especially don\u0027t tell him he\u0027s wrong. You\u0027re probably the only girl who\u0027s ever done it. You\u0027re probably the only girl smart enough to do it. More importantly, did I want to go out with him again? I glanced over at him and then down at the roses. I thought about his eyes when he\u0027d gazed at me in the stopped car. I realized then the odds of me ever finding a guy who thought Shakespeare and wind farms were fun were pretty infinitesimal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis narrowed his eyes in thought. \"Isn\u0027t there some kind of dance your school\u0027s having?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you want to go to that? People go to those, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I keep hearing. How\u0027d you know about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sign,\" he said. Then, as if on cue, he pulled into the driveway in front of my dorm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanging over the main door was a sign decorated with cobwebs and bats. GET YOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCARE ON AT THE HALLOWEEN DANCE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said. \"That sign.\" Eddie was right. I really did have selective data storage. \"I guess we can go. If you want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I mean, if you want to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence. We both laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" I said. \"I guess we\u0027re going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrayden leaned toward me, and I panicked until I saw that he was trying to get a better look at the sign. \"A week and a half away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough time to get costumes, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose. Although...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s when the next crazy thing happened. He held my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admit, I hadn\u0027t been expecting much, especially after my mixed reaction to the roadside kiss. Still, as he laid his hand over mine, I was surprised to feel that it was again just like...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewell, like touching someone\u0027s hand. I\u0027d at least thought there might be goose bumps or a little heart fluttering. My biggest emotional reaction was worry over what to do with my hand. Lace fingers? Squeeze his hand back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to go out sooner,\" he said. That hesitancy returned. \"If you want to.\" I looked down at our hands and tried to figure out how I felt. He had nice hands. Smooth, warm. I could get used to holding those hands. And of course, he smelled like coffee. Was that enough to build love on? Again, that uncertainty nagged me. What right did I have to any of this? I wasn\u0027t in Palm Springs for my own entertainment. There was no \"me\" in Alchemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, phonetically there was, but that wasn\u0027t the point. I knew my superiors wouldn\u0027t approve of any of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, when would I get this chance again? When would I ever get flowers? When would someone look at me with this kind of fervor? I decided to take the plunge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s go out again.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-golden-lily-bloodlines-2/page-7.html","bookId":2042,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:39:15 PM"}
