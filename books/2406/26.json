Go on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we’re supposed to set up a Big Store with no money,” Hamish said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And rob the Superior Bank of Manhattan with no time,” Angus finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then break into the U.S. Patent office to swap out the fake plans for the real plans…” Hamish said. “Or something like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat looked around the room. If she could have chosen any crew in the world, it would have been them, but she didn’t feel any peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right, Hamish, I don’t have any money,” Hale said. “But I have some things we can sell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir,” Marcus chimed in. “I have savings, which I will happily contribute to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Eddie’s fist banged against the table. “You think this is supposed to be easy? In my day we had to work for what we stole. We didn’t fly around on private jets. No one wrote us a check and bought us a Big Store. We made our own luck with our wits and our hands. Now, you two.” He pointed at the Bagshaws and shuffled toward the door. “You boys find me a Big Store. You find it fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But…” Angus started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie glared. “Go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, Angus and Hamish were up and out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie looked around at the rest of them. “Why are you sitting here? We have work to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 35\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, what do you think?” Angus squinted through the bright sun, staring up at the big abandoned building behind him. There were boards on the windows, a rough patch on the roof. Even in spring, the wind felt straight from the North Pole, and Kat shivered on the high bluff with the view of the icy Atlantic waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the place?” Gabrielle asked. “We’re supposed to believe a member of the Hale family has spent the last fifty years living…here?” She followed Kat through the front doors, past crumbling stairs and dirty windows, and didn’t try to hide her disgust. Birds nested in the rafters. A squirrel ran across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it cheap?” Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s free.” Angus gave a self-satisfied grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then it’s perfect,” Kat told him, and walked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Kat!” Hamish yelled from the second story. “Don’t worry about the lights. Dad had a…uh…supply of generators. We’ll have the whole place lit up by tonight.” He was running down the stairs, but then he hit a loose step, stumbled, and fell the rest of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll fix that,” Angus told Kat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good idea,” Gabrielle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat walked on through the empty foyer. “What was this place again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know exactly.” Angus shrugged. “The really old house of a really old rich dude, I guess. Felix found it. He ran the Monte Cristo here once. No one comes this far up the coast this early in the year, so we’ve got twenty square miles to ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Kat nodded her approval and headed down the hall, past someone carrying a massive stack of board games. “Is that Guido Romero?” Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngus shook his head. “Guido’s having a little Interpol situation, so we got Antonio.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Antonio!” Kat yelled, and she and Gabrielle and Angus walked on, past Uncle Ezra and Uncle Felix, who were engaged in a serious argument regarding a pair of fuzzy slippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do I want to know what that’s about?” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Angus said, then led them into a room equipped with an upright piano, three Ping-Pong tables, and a massive aquarium. Angus took them through a library, which had been recently outfitted with every textbook Uncle Marco had stolen from the Cornell Medical School in 1983. There was a commercial-grade kitchen being cleaned by the Bagshaws’ cousin Buster, a dining room being transformed into a parlor by the two DiMarcos who weren’t currently in jail, and two Hungarian sisters who owed Uncle Eddie a very large favor were arguing over the best way to apply bars to the exterior windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s upstairs?” Gabrielle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bedrooms,” Angus said. “We’ll try to keep them off-limits, but we’ll have one ready to go if we need it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverywhere they walked, Kat smelled fresh paint and new two-by-fours. There was the constant humming of drills and banging of hammers, and Kat imagined she was backstage on Broadway, but judging by the butterflies in her stomach, she wasn’t ready for the curtain to go up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we do something about the smell?” Gabrielle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re running fans twenty-four hours a day, and in the morning we’ll hit the whole place with that.” Angus pointed to a pile of cleaning supplies in the corner. “We’ll have it lemon-fresh by showtime, don’t you worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they ask for paperwork?” Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Charlie is forging it personally,” Angus said. “Should have it here by tonight. It’s a shame we couldn’t get him to bring it himself. We could have used the help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s Uncle Eddie’s identical twin, not his clone,” Kat reminded him. “The paperwork will be enough. I hope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were almost back to the front door, and Kat was almost satisfied, when Hamish yelled, “Fire in the hole!” from somewhere on the second floor. Lights flashed. The roof shook. A fairly large bird’s nest dislodged from the rafters and hit Gabrielle on the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it,” Gabrielle said. “I’m out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There may be a few kinks still,” Angus admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you be ready?” Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a problem, Kitty,” Angus said with a defiant nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Angus…” Kat said, the word a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time since Kat had known him, Angus grew serious. “We won’t let Hale down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, Kitty…” Angus ran a hand through his hair. Whatever he wanted to say was a struggle. “About ol’ Hale…I was thinking that after what happened at the gala, maybe Hamish and I could keep an eye on him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hale will be fine.” Kat tried to wave the worry away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will he?” Angus asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” she said, remembering that the biggest lies you tell are for yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat wasn’t surprised when she wasn’t able to fall asleep. There was the stress, of course. Gabrielle’s snoring never helped. But more than anything, Kat couldn’t turn off her mind. There were too many things that could go wrong, and they kept playing one after another on a perpetual loop through her mind, so finally she gave up and went downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thick railing was smooth beneath her hands, the rugs lush and soft beneath her bare feet. And Kat was content to creep through the big old house, just another ghost, right up until the point when she realized she wasn’t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some tea, miss?” Marcus said as soon as Kat stepped into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marcus, I didn’t know you were here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your uncle and I had a…cram session.” He struggled over the slang, but didn’t let it stop him. “I will be accompanying him in the morning. It is a very big day.” He reached for the kettle and brought two cups to the table. “Cream or sugar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have to wait on me, Marcus,” she told him. “Technically, this time, you’re the client.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled but didn’t agree. “If you’ll forgive me, miss, it is either work or worry. Work feels far more natural.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat found her favorite chair. “I know the feeling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus busied himself with the kettle and the cups. His hands shook a little in a way Kat had never seen before. He didn’t face her when he asked, “Can he do this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Eddie once pulled the Anastasia on a duke in Edinburgh. Trust me. If anyone can—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus shook his head. “Not your uncle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat read his eyes, the set of his jaw, and she knew that Marcus’s worries went far beyond his sister. She thought about the teenager who had gotten drunk and risked everything at the gala, the angry kid who had stormed into Garrett’s office without a plan. She’d tried to tell herself that Hale was fine—he was good. But then there were the flashes of sorrow and rage, and Kat knew that he wasn’t okay. He was just trying to con himself into thinking that he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never seen Hale like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I may, miss…” Marcus gestured to the seat beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, Marcus. Sit. Talk to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the seat, but never really rested there. His back stayed straight. His hands stayed folded. Marcus was a man clinging to honor and responsibility, to family pride and the satisfaction of doing something very few people in the world still did well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat totally knew the feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has Mr. Hale ever told you how I came to be in his employ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Kat laughed a little. “About a hundred times. I’m still waiting for the truth, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was the personal valet to Mr. Hale the Second. Marianne, of course, was a ladies’ maid for Mrs. Hale. The two of us had been in those roles for as long as we could remember. I didn’t know any other life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When young Mr. Hale was six years old, his parents decided to sail around the world. Two days after they left, the nanny resigned and the cook quit. His parents knew this, of course, and yet they stayed away for six months and they left that child alone with a gardener.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew a deep breath, then talked on. “When his grandmother heard, she sent me to the country house to find him, and then she asked if I would consider caring for the boy myself. And that was where I stayed until the day you came for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Technically, I didn’t come for him,” Kat said. “He’s just what I left with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I, for one, believe you got the better of that trade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and pushed in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marcus,” Kat said, stopping him at the door. “If we fail—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t care if we lose the company, miss. But I would care a great deal if we lost the boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat nodded and let him go. There was nothing else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 36\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy two o’clock the following afternoon, the cast members were in their places and the stage was finally set. Kat found herself on an overturned crate in a tiny upstairs room, sitting beside Simon and staring at the myriad of screens that covered the wall—the backstage of the con.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the trio of dark SUVs pulled down the winding lane, Kat saw them from the window. Uniformed drivers stepped out and reached for the rear passenger doors, and Kat said, “Okay, Simon. The Big Store is open for business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sooner had she said the words than the front doors swung open and an old man yelled, “Come in!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-scoundrels-heist-society-3/page-26.html","bookId":2406,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM"}
