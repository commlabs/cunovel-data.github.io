The odds against a man as wealthy as Alex Harrison being brought to Embarcadero County Hospital were enormous. And I\u0027m the one who saved his life, and he wants to show his gratitude, Mallory thought gleefully. He had asked a friend of his about the Harrisons. \"Rich doesn\u0027t even begin to cover it,\" his friend had said. \"He\u0027s a millionaire a dozen times over. And he has a great-looking daughter. She\u0027s been married three or four times. The last time to a count.\" \"Have you ever met the Harrisons?\" \"No. They don\u0027t mingle with the hoi polloi.\" On a Saturday morning, as Alex Harrison was being discharged from the hospital, he said, \"Ken, do you think I\u0027ll be in shape to give a dinner party a week from now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory nodded. \"If you don\u0027t overdo it, I don\u0027t see why not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex Harrison smiled. \"Fine. You\u0027re the guest of honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory felt a sudden thrill. The old man really meant what he said. \"Well ... thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren and I will expect you at seven-thirty next Saturday night.\" He gave Mallory an address on Nob, Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there,\" Mallory said. Will I ever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory had promised to take Kat to the theater that evening, but it would be easy to cancel. He had collected his winnings, and he enjoyed having sex with her. Several times a week they had managed to get together in one of the empty on-call rooms, or a deserted hospital room, or at her apartment or his. Her fires were banked a long time, Mallory thought happily, but when the explosion came - wow! Well, one of these days, it will be time to say arrivederci.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the day he was to have dinner with the Harrisons, Mallory telephoned Kat. \"Bad news, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the doctors is sick and they\u0027ve asked me to cover for him. I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to have to break our date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not want to let him know how disappointed she was, how much she needed to be with him. Kat said lightly, \"Oh well, that\u0027s the doctor business, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I\u0027ll make it up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to make anything up to me,\" she said warmly. \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ken, when are we going to talk about us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" He knew exactly what she meant. A commitment. They were all alike. They use their pussies for bait, hoping to hook a sucker into spending his life with them. Well, he was too smart for that. When the time came, he would regretfully bow out, as he had done a dozen times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat was saying, \"Don\u0027t you think we should set a date, Ken? I have a lot of plans to make.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure. We\u0027ll do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought maybe June. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t want to know what I think. If I play my cards right, there\u0027s going to be a wedding, but it won\u0027t be with you. \"We\u0027ll talk about it, baby. I really have to go now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Harrisons\u0027 home was a mansion out of a motion picture, situated on acres of manicured grounds. The house itself seemed to go on forever. There were two dozen guests, and in the huge drawing room a small orchestra was playing. When Mallory walked in, Lauren hurried over to greet him. She was wearing a silky clinging gown. She squeezed Mallory\u0027s hand, \"Welcome, guest of honor. I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I. How is your father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very much alive, thanks to you. You\u0027re quite a hero in this house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory smiled modestly. \"I only did my job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose that\u0027s what God says every day.\" She took his hand and began introducing him to the other guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guest list was blue-ribbon. The governor of California was there, the French ambassador, a justice of the Supreme Court, and a dozen assorted politicians, artists, and business tycoons. Mallory could feel the power in the room, and it thrilled him. This is where I belong, he thought. Right here, with these people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dinner was delicious and elegantly served. At the end of the evening, when the guests started to leave, Harrison said to Mallory, \"Don\u0027t rush off, Ken. I\u0027d like to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be delighted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarrison, Lauren, and Mallory sat in the library. Harrison was seated in a chair next to his daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I told you at the hospital that I thought you had a great future before you, I meant it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really appreciate your confidence, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be in private practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory laughed self-deprecatingly. \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not that easy, Mr. Harrison. It takes a long time to build up a practice, and I\u0027m ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ordinarily, yes. But you\u0027re not an ordinary man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After you finish your residency, Father wants to set you up in your own practice,\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Mallory was speechless. It was too easy. He felt as though he were living in some kind of wonderful dream. \"I ... I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a lot of very wealthy friends. I\u0027ve already spoken to some of them about you. I can promise you that you\u0027ll be swamped the minute you put up your shingle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy, lawyers put up shingles,\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever. In any case, I\u0027d like to finance you. Are you interested?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory was finding it difficult to breathe. \"Very much so. But I ... I don\u0027t know when I would be able to repay you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand. I\u0027m repaying you. You won\u0027t owe me anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren was looking at Mallory, her eyes warm. \"Please say yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d be stupid to say no, wouldn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Lauren said softly. \"And I\u0027m sure you\u0027re not stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his way home, Ken Mallory was in a state of euphoria. This is as good as it gets, he thought. But he was wrong. It got better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren telephoned him. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind mixing business with pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled to himself. \"Not at all. What did you have in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a charity ball next Saturday night. Would you like to take me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, baby, I\u0027m going to take you all right. \"I\u0027d love to.\" He was on duty Saturday night, but he would call in sick and they would have to find someone to take his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory was a man who believed in planning ahead, but what was happening to him now went beyond his wildest dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next few weeks he was swept up in Lauren\u0027s social circle, and life took on a dizzying pace. He would be out with Lauren dancing half the night, and stumble through his days at the hospital. There were mounting complaints about his work, but he didn\u0027t care. I\u0027ll be out of here soon, he told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of getting away from the dreary county hospital and having his own practice was exciting enough, but Lauren was the bonus that Lady Luck had given him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat was becoming a nuisance. Mallory had to keep finding pretexts to avoid seeing her. When she would press him, he would say, \"Darling, I\u0027m crazy about you ... of course I want to marry you, but right now, I ...\" and he would go into a litany of excuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lauren who suggested that the two of them spend a weekend at the family lodge at Big Sur. Mallory was elated. Everything is coming up roses, he thought. I\u0027m going to own the whole damned world!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lodge was spread across pine-covered hills, an enormous structure built of wood and tile and stone, overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It had a master bedroom, eight guest bedrooms, a spacious living room with a stone fireplace, an indoor swimming pool, and a large hot tub. Everything smelled of old money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they walked in, Lauren turned to Mallory and said, \"I let the servants go for the weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory grinned. \"Good thinking.\" He put his arms around Lauren and said softly, \"I\u0027m wild about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show me,\" Lauren said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spent the day in bed, and Lauren was almost as insatiable as Kat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wearing me out!\" Mallory laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I don\u0027t want you to be able to make love to anyone else.\" She sat up in bed. \"There is no one else, is there, Ken?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not,\" Mallory said sincerely. \"There\u0027s no one in the world for me but you. I\u0027m in love with you, Lauren.\" Now was the time to take the plunge, to wrap his whole future up in one neat package. It would be one thing to be a successful doctor in private practice. It would be something else to be Alex Harrison\u0027s son-in-law. \"I want to marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his breath, waiting for her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, darling,\" Lauren said. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the apartment, Kat was frantically trying to reach Mallory. She telephoned the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Dr. Hunter, Dr. Mallory is not on call, and doesn\u0027t answer his page.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t he leave word where he could be reached?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no record of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat replaced the receiver and turned to Paige. \"Something\u0027s happened to him, I know it. He would have called me by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kat, there could be a hundred reasons why you haven\u0027t heard from him. Perhaps he had to go out of town suddenly, or ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m sure there\u0027s some good excuse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat looked at the phone and willed it to ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mallory returned to San Francisco, he telephoned Kat at the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Hunter is off duty,\" the receptionist told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Mallory called the apartment. Kat was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, baby!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ken! Where have you been? I\u0027ve been worried about you. I tried everywhere to reach - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a family emergency,\" he said smoothly. \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t have a chance to call you. I had to go out of town. May I come over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know you may. I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re all right. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half an hour.\" He replaced the receiver and thought happily, The time has come, the walrus said, to speak of many things. Kat, baby, it was great fun, but it was just one of those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mallory arrived at the apartment, Kat threw her arms around him. \"I\u0027ve missed you!\" She could not tell him how desperately worried she had been. Men hated that kind of thing. She stood back. \"Darling, you look absolutely exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory sighed. \"I\u0027ve been up for the last twenty-four hours.\" That part is true, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat hugged him. \"Poor baby. Can I fix something for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m fine. All I really need is a good night\u0027s sleep. Let\u0027s sit down, Kat. We have to have a talk.\" He sat on the couch next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is anything wrong?\" Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory took a deep breath. \"Kat, I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about us lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"So have I. I have news for you. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, wait. Let me finish. Kat, I think we\u0027re rushing into things too fast. I ... I think I proposed too hastily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paled. \"What ... what are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m saying that I think we should postpone everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt as though the room were closing in on her. She was finding it difficult to breathe. \"Ken, we can\u0027t postpone anything. I\u0027m having your baby.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-30.html","bookId":2365,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM"}
