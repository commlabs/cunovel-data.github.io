There was blood on her face and he licked it off. “Smart move, sweet piece.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLois closed her eyes. They were naked, entwined in an ugly way on the lounger. She had blood on her face and throat and breasts. Blood streaked her thighs and buttocks. Her pale skin was splotched with the livid outlines of his open hand. Her nipples were torn and there were bite marks on her hips and stomach. Ruger had not taken much, just a taste here and there, drawing it out, making it last, loving the terror he tasted on her skin and the disgust he saw in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rape was bad enough, but Lois lived with Vic and he had never wanted anything she gave willingly. He had always taken it, enjoying the fight, the win. Hard and vicious use had become her life, and mostly the gin could blunt it. But Ruger was not Vic. By contrast Vic was almost kind. He was cruel and brutal, but he was a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Ruger did…what he forced her to do…was beyond anything Vic could do to her. The thought of Ruger turning those appetites on Mike was too horrible to even think about, and Lois’s soul collapsed in on itself. “No,” she kept saying, over and over again, a mantra against Ruger’s hungers. She lay still and they listened to Mike’s footsteps upstairs and then heard the front door. Above them the house settled into empty stillness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuger pushed Lois off him and she landed hard on palms and knees as he rose to stand over her. His skin was so white it was almost translucent and he stood above her, naked, indomitable, relentless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he said, “want to learn a new game?” But since she didn’t answer he showed her anyway. Now that the house was empty it didn’t matter that she screamed. And screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic stood in the doorway to the cellar and watched Ruger stand up and, without cleaning any of the blood from his skin, begin slowly pulling on his clothes. All the while Ruger smiled. Ruger picked up Lois’s robe and tossed it over her, the bulk of it covering her face and chest, leaving the rest of her exposed to Vic’s stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gun in Vic’s hand hung there, a dead and forgotten weight at the end of his arm, barrel pointing at the floor. Vic could have killed Ruger right then, shot him point-blank. The special loads in that gun would have snuffed Ruger out like a candle, yet the gun just hung there as Ruger tucked his penis into his pants and zipped up the fly. He took his time about it, too, staring at Vic, smiling with bloody lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t Ruger’s smile that hurt Vic so deeply. It wasn’t even that Ruger had broken his house rules, had taken what belonged to him. Had taken his wife. It wasn’t that as much as it was the steady, slow, very soft laughter that echoed in his brain. His laughter. Not Ruger’s. His.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Penance is a bitch,” Ruger said as he buttoned his shirt. He started to turn away and then paused, looking down at Lois. Then, glancing up at Vic as he did so Ruger sucked up a mouth full of bloody phlegm and spit on Lois.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still Vic did not, could not, lift that gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a new world, pal,” Ruger whispered with his graveyard voice, “and it must be a real kick in the nuts—especially after all these years and all you’ve done—to realize that you’re on the wrong end of the food chain.” Ruger tucked in his shirttails, then licked his fingers and used them to smooth back the hair from his widow’s peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Griswold is my god,” he said, and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike got to school early and managed to slip into the bathroom and clean himself up without being noticed. He drifted through the rest of the day in a kind of haze and at lunch sat with his friend Brandon and talked about comics. Mike could do that on autopilot. When Brandon shifted onto last night’s episode of Heroes, Mike just listened and nodded whenever he thought he should. He hadn’t seen the show last night and could not for the life of him remember what he had done. He knew that not knowing should bother him more than it did, but somehow he could not work up the energy to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing he did care about, one thing that wasn’t blunted by the apathetic glaze that seemed to be coated over everything in his mind, was his mom. He hadn’t liked the sound he heard in the cellar. He hadn’t liked that one bit, and even though he knew that she was supposed to be out—and that she never went down into Vic’s cellar willingly—that knowledge did little to ease that gnawing doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gotta make a call,” he said abruptly, standing. Brandon, caught in midsentence, just stared at him. “I’ll be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike turned and headed to the far side of the cafeteria where the pay phones were. No one much used them—everyone but Mike had a cell phone. He fitted some quarters into the slot and punched his home number. The phone rang six times and went straight to the answering machine. Mike slapped the receiver down, fed in more quarters, and dialed again. Maybe she just hadn’t gotten to the phone in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C’mon, Mom,” he breathed, “pick up….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the machine picked up. He hung up and leaned against the wall, staring across the cafeteria into nothingness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school he sped home on his bike, but as he was rounding the corner on his street he saw Vic walk through the side yard and into the front of the house. He was carrying a toolbox in one hand and under his other arm he had folded shutters. Mike slowed to a stop behind a parked SUV and watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic had a ladder against the front of the house and Mike saw that he’d already installed heavy slatted shutters on the porch windows and one of the upstairs master bedroom windows. He set the toolbox down and fished in it for a hammer, then climbed the ladder one-handed, the shutters still under his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVic was a very thorough craftsman. Mike knew that much about him, and he never did anything around the house that was slipshod. When he installed shelves for his DVD collection—mostly World War II movies and westerns—everything was precisely measured, perfectly cut, and as straight as an arrow. When something broke down, like the time the lawn mower crapped out, Vic worked on it with meticulous care and ever since the machine had never so much as sputtered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Mike was seeing now, however, was a completely different Vic Wingate. Standing on the ladder Vic pounded nails with sloppy force, brutalizing the wood around the nailheads. Mike looked at each shutter and not one of them hung completely straight. Mike could have done better himself and he barely knew which end of a hammer to hold. Vic’s love of tools had engendered in Mike a dislike of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, watching in perplexed concern, as Vic clumsied the shutters up and battered them into place. He had no idea what to make of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Vic finished, he just pulled the ladder down and let it fall onto the front lawn. Snatching up his toolbox, he stomped up the steps and jerked open the front door. “There! You happy now, you stupid bitch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose words rolled all the way down the street to where Mike hid. When Vic slammed the door the echo ricocheted off every house front on the block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike picked his bike up and turned it around and headed back toward Corn Hill and the Crow’s Nest. As he rode away Vic’s vicious words pounded in his head. Vic always called his mom horrible names, but there was something worse about this. It felt worse somehow; it felt meaner, if that was even possible for Vic. As he pedaled away he could feel a sinking dread for his mother’s safety forming in the pit of his stomach; but at the same time he felt a white-hot scalding rage building in his hands and behind his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he, or anyone else, had seen his eyes at that moment they would have been terribly afraid. All of the blue was gone, as was most of the white. What was left was a mingled cloud of black, like a storm cloud, veined with bloody flashes of red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are his vitals?” Weinstock asked as he entered Terry’s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Same,” said the nurse. “No change since this morning.” She recited the numbers. Nothing encouraging, but nothing discouraging. A gloomy status quo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeinstock went through a cursory examination, but there was nothing new to see, nothing to learn. Nothing to tell Sarah that would bring her out of the funk she’d been sliding into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a note on Terry’s chart. “Keep me posted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and the nurse left and Terry’s room settled back into stillness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for the tiny figure who stepped out of the shadows in the corner and walked up to the side of Terry’s bed. Mandy’s eyes were wet and her torn throat trembled with silent sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose onto her toes and stretched to kiss Terry on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a strangled little sound in her brother’s throat and he turned his head slowly from side to side—less a negating motion than one of an animal struggling to pull free from a leash. Mandy stepped back, looking scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fight it, Terry!” she said, but her voice was silent and Terry was deep, deep down in the dark of his mind where all he could hear was the roar of the beast. Mandy put her tiny bloodstained hands to her mouth and stood there, watching moment by moment as Terry lost his fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidmorning Sarah Wolfe came by to pick up Val. They wanted some time with each other and they both had a lot of things to handle in the aftermath of Little Halloween. Since Mark and Connie were not going to be buried right away, Val had to arrange a memorial service. Mark was well liked in the community and had been an influential businessman. There would be a lot of people who would want to pay their respects. Setting that up was going to take a lot of detail work, but Crow knew that detail work kept Val steady, so he kissed her good-bye, hugged Sarah, walked them to Sarah’s big Humvee Alpha, and watched as they headed into the stream of traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Crow’s Nest was slow that morning, which was good because Crow had a million things to do to stay on top of the Festival preparations. He called all of the hotels to make sure that the arrangements for the visiting celebrities were in place; then called half a dozen airports to check on bookings. He spent some time on the phone with BK, working through the details for the security measures he wanted to have in place for Halloween. BK had managed to round up a solid crew of bouncers, off-duty cops, and martial arts guys to work the gig and the ticket was going to cost the township—and the Wolfe family—a bundle. Crow didn’t sweat that…any additional disasters would cost everyone more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bad-moon-rising-pine-deep-3/page-31.html","bookId":2569,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:26 PM"}
