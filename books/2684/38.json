You\u0027re not stupid enough to fall for these cunts, and yet your pain is real ... I mean everybody knows that you really lost it over Meghan Reynolds ... That\u0027s not a secret, by the way.\" Rip grins and then his voice grows questioning. \"But there\u0027s something that\u0027s not tracking ... You\u0027re getting off and yet what\u0027s the problem?\" He turns to me again in the darkness as the limo glides onto Beverly Glen. \"Could it be that you actually get off on the fact that because of how you\u0027ve set things up they\u0027ll never love you back? And could it be that\" - he pauses, thinking this through - \"that you\u0027re so much crazier than any of us ever really knew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s it, Rip.\" I sigh, but I\u0027m shaking. \"That\u0027s probably it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone doesn\u0027t like you back and never will,\" Rip says. \"At least not in the way you want them to and yet you can still momentarily control them because of the things they want from you. It\u0027s quite a system you\u0027ve set up and maintained.\" He pauses. \"Romance.\" He sighs. \"Interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep staring at the iPhone even though I don\u0027t want to anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess the consolation is that she\u0027s not going to be beautiful forever,\" he says. \"But I\u0027d like to be with her before that happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you saying?\" I\u0027m asking, the fear pushing forward. \"What does any of this mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means so many things, Clay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to get out of here,\" I say. \"I want you to drop me off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRip says, \"It means she\u0027ll never love you.\" A pause. \"It means that everything\u0027s an illusion.\" And then Rip touches my arm. \"She\u0027s setting you up, cabron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offer the phone back to Rip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you already I don\u0027t view you as a threat,\" Rip says. \"You can keep doing whatever you want with her. I don\u0027t care because you\u0027re not really in the way.\" He considers something. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRip takes the phone from me and pockets it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Julian ... she likes him.\" Rip pauses. \"She\u0027s just using you. Maybe that\u0027s what gets you off. I don\u0027t know. Will she get what she wants? Probably not. I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t care. But Julian? For some reason that I can\u0027t fathom she really likes him. All you\u0027re doing is prolonging the situation. You\u0027re keeping this in play and she\u0027s following your lead because she thinks she\u0027s going to be in your movie. And because of this it\u0027s moving her closer to Julian.\" He pauses again. \"You don\u0027t even realize how afraid you should be, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he drops me off Rip says, \"Julian\u0027s disappeared.\" The limousine idles in the driveway of the Doheny Plaza. On the way down Beverly Glen and all across Sunset, Rip texted people back while \"The Boys of Summer\" kept repeating itself on the stereo. \"He\u0027s not at his place in Westwood. We don\u0027t know where he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he went to find Amanda,\" I say, staring out the tinted window at the empty valet stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shouldn\u0027t that be Rain\u0027s job?\" Rip asks, unfazed. \"Oh, I forgot. She has an audition this week, doesn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say. \"She does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t seem very worried about her roommate,\" Rip says. \"At least not as much as being in your little movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How worried should she be, Rip?\" I ask. \"Where\u0027s Amanda?\" And then I breathe in before asking, \"Do you know?\" I stop again. \"I mean, you were with her, too. After Rain left you for Kelly? I guess that\u0027s when it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Women aren\u0027t very bright,\" Rip says. \"Studies have been done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t see his face. I can only hear his voice, which is, I realize, how I want it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that about?\" I ask. \"Revenge? You thought Rain would care that you were f**king her roommate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s hiding,\" Rip says, ignoring me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, why don\u0027t you let it go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s hiding.\" Rip pauses. \"I thought maybe you\u0027d know where he is. I thought maybe you\u0027d tell me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-38.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
