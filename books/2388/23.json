She listened to the beginning bars of the Hawaiian hula sound they’d chosen for the talent show swell through the portable iPod speakers. After a moment, she counted off. “Five, six, seven, eight …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all waved their hands gracefully and started wiggling their hips. About thirty seconds in, Aria stopped and stared at the others. “We’re all making our hands go in different directions for that part,” she said. “We all need to swish to the right first, then the left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m doing the best I can, considering the fact that my ankle is killing me.” Spencer held up her left foot, which had an Ace bandage wrapped around it. She said she’d slipped in baby oil earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we talked about adding that waddling-like-a-duck move,” Aria said as she paused the song. “Does anyone remember exactly how to do it? Ali was definitely the best at it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so sick of Ali,” Emily mumbled angrily under her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer and Aria’s heads snapped up. “What was that, Em?” Aria asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” Emily said stiffly, smoothing down the grass skirt. One of the blades pierced her thigh, and she winced. “Does anyone else think these skirts suck?” she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer leaned against the railing, looking worried. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily sighed. “I just don’t feel in the mood to do this anymore. I mean, what’s the point?” She shoved her flip-flops back on her feet, keeping her eyes averted from her friends. “We’re being tortured by A. We’re practically wanted by the police. Don’t you think doing a talent show routine is a little ridiculous? How are we going to ride a Vespa in jail?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a nice diversion,” Spencer said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did something happen, Em?” Aria pressed. “Something with A? Something with that girl you saw on TV yesterday? Is she really on the ship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked away, biting her lip. She regretted that her friends had been there to witness her CNN Preppy Thief meltdown. She didn’t want to drag them into the scandal. “She got off the boat yesterday,” she lied—although, for all she knew, it was true. There had been no trace of Jordan when Emily got back to her room the day before, and she hadn’t heard from her since. “And let’s never talk about it again, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, awkward pause. “Okay,” Spencer said, concern in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” Emily said perfunctorily. But when she shut her eyes, all she could think about was that news broadcast. The Preppy Thief. Jordan being led to jail in an orange jumpsuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle had provided a hundred links with all the awful details. Jordan—or Katherine DeLong, or whatever her name was—didn’t come from a poor family, as she’d told Emily, but a very wealthy one from outside New York City. There were pictures of her at society events in Manhattan and debutante parties in the Hamptons. She’d been stealing boats, cars, planes—basically, anything she could get her hands on—for two years now, jet-setting across the world to attempt bigger and more daring heists. She had finally been arrested and thrown in jail near Philly a few months earlier, when she was caught driving her father’s law partner’s Ferrari. Now the FBI was after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe articles described her as a “con woman,” capable of convincing people of anything and everything just to get her way. Other reporters called her a “sociopath,” a “girl Houdini,” and “a miscreant with no respect for private property.” Apparently, Jordan didn’t steal the vehicles because she had any use for them—it was all for the thrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was crushing. Emily had felt reborn with Jordan. For a few blissful hours, there had been something good in her world again. But how could she have fallen for another liar? Did Jordan even like her at all, or was she exploiting Emily’s kindness and generosity to keep a low profile? What if Emily got in trouble just for associating with her? A knew about it, too—what if A told?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, she grabbed her bag from the ledge where she’d left it. “I’m going back to my room for a while. I’ll be ready for the performance tomorrow, though. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe padded toward the elevator, glancing over her shoulder just once. Aria and Spencer were whispering, probably trying to decide whether or not to follow her. She was glad when they didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one in the elevator for her ride to her floor, and the hallway to her room was empty. But when she saw a figure sitting at her door, she froze, her heart suddenly beating fast. It was Jordan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan glanced up at the same time. Her lips parted, and she started to stand. “Emily!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily turned around and walked the other way, the grass skirt scratching against her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emily!” Jordan called again, running after her. “Wait!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily kept going, saying nothing. “I know you’re mad,” Jordan blurted. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner. I tried, a few times, but … I just didn’t know how.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, now it’s all out in the open, isn’t it?” Emily said brusquely, pulling open the heavy door to the stairs. She had no idea where she was going. She just knew she had to go somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So that’s it?” Jordan’s voice cracked. “You’re just going to walk away from us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily pulled her bottom lip into her mouth and climbed the first set of stairs, the grass skirt swishing loudly against her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emily, please,” Jordan said. “You’re the best thing that’s happened to me in a long time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily paused mid-step. When she turned, Jordan’s face was stained with tears. Her pert nose was red-rimmed from crying, and her hands were worrying the hem of her T-shirt. A T-shirt, incidentally, she had borrowed from Emily’s closet—because Emily was so frickin’ nice and naive. The image of Jordan on TV flared in her mind. Walk away, a wounded voice inside her said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she also knew what Jordan meant. Something amazing had happened between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed hard. “You lied to me. I don’t know anything about you. I didn’t even know your real name!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. And I feel terrible about it. But it wasn’t because I wanted to hurt you. I wanted to protect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily ran her fingers over a crack on the wall. “Did you really escape from jail?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Jordan said in a quiet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why weren’t you wearing that orange jumpsuit when I first saw you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was in my regular clothes in the holding cell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And why did you pick the name Jordan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s my middle name.” Jordan stared at her feet. “And Richards is my mom’s maiden name. I’ve always liked them both better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you steal planes? Cars?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan lowered her eyes. “It was something my best friend dared me to do. We were in it together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily scoffed. “Your best friend made you steal a plane?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was that girl Mackenzie I started talking about. She dared me to steal bigger things, do more dangerous stuff, basically because she loved the power over me. She promised she’d love me back if I did, but it didn’t work that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily curled her toes. The story was awfully familiar—Ali had treated her like that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mackenzie was the one who turned me in, actually,” Jordan went on. “I told her I didn’t want to steal things anymore, that it was getting too crazy. So she called the cops on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily gasped. “Did she get in trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan shook her head. “Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? Didn’t she steal stuff, too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan’s lips twitched. “I didn’t tell the cops that.” She peeked at Emily sheepishly. “Really lame, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stared at the big number 6 painted on the wall next to the stairs. She’d covered for Ali, too. Hell, she’d even let her out of the Poconos house. “It’s not lame. But your relationship with your friend isn’t love. It’s not even friendship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Jordan said quietly. “But once I realized it, it was too late. Only now do I really know what love is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked up; the air felt electrically charged. Jordan was looking so deeply into Emily’s eyes that Emily felt a magnetic pull toward her. She thought about how Jordan had held her close on the glass-bottomed boat, accepting everything about her. And how she’d kissed Emily out in the open at the elevators. And how they could talk about anything, and how much they laughed, and how right kissing her felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked slowly back down the stairs until she was by Jordan’s side. When she slipped her hand into Jordan’s, it felt as though she’d come home. But then terror struck her. “What if someone else knows where you are?” She thought of A’s note. Cute! You can room together in jail!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan’s mouth made a line. “What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily swallowed hard. “What if someone recognizes you from the news … and tells?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve kept a really low profile,” Jordan insisted. “I don’t think anyone on this ship is on the lookout for me, anyway. You shouldn’t worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But …” Emily trailed off, thinking of all the things A could do with the information. “What are you going to do when this cruise ends and we’re back on land? They’re going to catch you—you can’t run forever. What will happen to us? Will I ever see you again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan pulled her close and rocked her back and forth. “Hey,” she said soothingly, rubbing a figure-eight pattern on Emily’s back. “Don’t worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I have to worry!” Emily cried. “You need a plan! You need to figure out a way to stay safe!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan smiled placidly. “Em, I do have a plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily blinked. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Jordan led her out of the stairwell, past the busy arcade, and into one of the lounges, which had big velvet booths and long aquariums lining the walls. Other than Jeremy, who was leaning against the bar, talking to one of the bartenders, they were the only people in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat down in a back booth near a glowing ATM machine. The second hand of the art deco clock on the wall made a full rotation before Jordan spoke again. “I’m never going back to the States,” she began. “You’re right—I’ll be arrested as soon as I set foot there. As long as I stay in another country, though, I’ll be safe. So when we dock in Bermuda, I’m getting on a plane. I was going to do it at our first stop in St. Martin, but then I met you, and I just … couldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s eyes widened. “Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thailand. I have it all worked out. There’s a fake passport waiting for me in Bermuda, along with a plane ticket.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burned-pretty-little-liars-12/page-23.html","bookId":2388,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM"}
