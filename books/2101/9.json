The glass brightened, and Jenny could see that two bare lightbulbs had gone on inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey illuminated a wizard, maybe two feet high and wearing a surprisingly mournful and pained expression. As Jenny watched, it began to move jerkily, like clockwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts eyes opened and shut, and its eyebrows lifted and fell. .Its lower lip seemed to be jointed and moved below a surprisingly fine and lifelike beard, as if it were mumbling to itself. Its face was ruddy plastic, with carmine lips and deep shadows under the eyes. Jenny could see layers of caked-up paint on the cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor thing, she thought. Absurd as it was, she felt sorry for the mechanical figure. It showed much finer workmanship than the barn dancers, but it was undeniably in a state of disrepair. Its paintbrush eyelashes were matted, its black velveteen robe dusted with red lint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange feeling was coming over Jenny. A squeezing in her chest. It was ridiculous to feel this way about an automaton. But it looked so pathetic-so trapped there in that box, in front of a stapled-on backdrop of shabby red velveteen... .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd something about the figure ... something about its face ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard held a chipped and peeling wand in one clenched fist. He raised the wand and struck it on the table in front of him-Jenny could see the indentation where he\u0027d done it many times before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes opened and shut, rolled around, moving back and forth. They didn\u0027t look at the wand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lower lip moved, showing white painted teeth, but there was no sound. He seemed to be talking to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was mesmerized by the wizard\u0027s jerky, almost violent movements-but she didn\u0027t know why, and she was getting more and more frightened. It\u0027s because he looks like one of those homeless guys at the shelter, she told herself. That\u0027s why he\u0027s familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. It was more than that. Something about the plastic face, a face frozen in an expression of ineffable sadness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass eyes rolled, staring straight out at Jenny. Dark as marbles, strangely tired, strangely kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really did know then, but it was such an impossible, intolerable concept that she pushed it away. Slam-dunked it back into her subconscious. Too insane to even think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a click at the bottom of the machine and saw that a card had appeared. She reached for it reflexively-then stopped for just an instant, again feeling as if her mind was shouting a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers closed on the card. She turned it over and stared at the writing on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she felt herself begin to faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cramped lines of type were faded but perfectly readable. Not a prediction or a personality chart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire card was covered with two words typed over and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP ME ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe letters swam in front of Jenny\u0027s eyes, merging into a scintillating black-and-white pattern. She couldn\u0027t control her trembling or the shuddering in her stomach. She couldn\u0027t feel her legs. And she couldn\u0027t scream-even though there was a screaming inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the floor bang her palms and rump as her legs gave way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened? Did it do something to you?\" The others were around her. Jenny could only look up at the glass, box, as her fingers tightened on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose tired dark eyes, oh, yes, they were familiar. But they didn\u0027t belong with a shabby velveteen robe and a long angel-hair beard. They belonged with a slight, stooped body, a cardigan sweater, and thinning white hair. And a smell of peppermint, because that was what he always carried in his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my grandfather,\" Jenny whispered. \"Oh, Dee, it\u0027s my grandfather, it\u0027s my grandfather. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee cut a glance at the box. When she looked back at Jenny, her face was composed. \"Okay, now, you take it easy. Lets get you some water here..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Jenny screamed. She was completely out of control. She hit Dee, beating at her feebly with her fists. \"Don\u0027t humor me\u0027. It\u0027s my grandfather in there -they\u0027ve done it to him. Oh, God!\" Tears were flying as she whipped her head. \"It\u0027s a joke, don\u0027t you see? He was a sorcerer-now he\u0027s a wizard. I thought he was dead-but this is so much worse-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee simply grabbed the flailing hands so Jenny couldn\u0027t do any harm. Jenny could see Michael\u0027s brown eyes, and Audrey\u0027s chestnut-colored ones, looking over Dee\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" she gasped, quieting. \"Look at the card. He wants help. He wants out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael picked up the card silently, showed it to Dee and Audrey. They all looked at the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard was still moving, staring straight ahead with his tragic expression, hitting the table with his wand. His hands were all in one piece, Jenny noticed with wild precision. She could see beads of paint in the slight grooves between the fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d thought the Shadow Men would eat him. That was what the hungry eyes in the closet had wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut whatever they\u0027d done with his body, his soul was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d put it in this-thing. Stuck it in a plastic body so that he could stand forever moving like clockwork when the machine was activated, endlessly banging his wand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian had said the Shadow Park had been created ten years ago, and for a special reason. It was ten years ago that her grandfather had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did it to punish him,\" she whispered. \"They put him here so he could never die-they trapped him the way he trapped them in the closet... .\" Her voice was rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael swallowed, looking sick. Dee\u0027s nostrils flared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a click and another card appeared in the slot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee reached for it, letting go of Jenny\u0027s hands. Jenny scrambled to her knees to see it over Dee\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOOK IN THE BLACK CABINET.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" Michael said. Jenny twisted. Behind her was a shiny black machine with a wide, darkened oval window. It looked relatively new, and a plaque read: speak to the spirits, ask any yes or no question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny knew the type of game. The window lit up and a skull nodded or shook its head to answer you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of icy cold swept over her, as cold as the water in the mine ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it, Michael,\" she whispered and held her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. He glanced uncertainly at Jenny, then put a coin in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass brightened. There wasn\u0027t a skull inside\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eilluminated from below with a ghastly blue light which clearly showed .there was nothing below either neck. At the sight of them, Audrey screamed thinly and Michael retched. Dee grabbed hold of Jenny hard enough to hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now do you believe me?\" Jenny said, her voice rising again. \"They\u0027re here, they\u0027re all here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael was pressing his hand to his mouth. Dee was holding on to Jenny. Audrey was still making a thin wheezing noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody answered Jenny, but in the cabinet the heads of Slug and P.C. bobbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue light shone on their chapped, loose-hanging lips. They looked unconscious-as if unseen hands were wagging them by the hair, making them nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou guys were so tough, Jenny thought, unable to look away from the cadaverous faces. Such bad boys. Breaking into my house, stealing the Game. Barging into the Shadow World uninvited. Now you\u0027re both here and you don\u0027t look so tough. And-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Summer,\" Jenny whimpered. \"If Summer-if Summer-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we find Summer like that- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a click. Dee snatched the card before Jenny could get to it. She read it, holding Jenny away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly Dee turned the card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOOK IN THE FUN HOUSE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least it\u0027s not another cabinet,\" Dee said. Michael said, \"You mean, you think it\u0027s about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-maybe. Or\"-Dee\u0027s face relaxed-\"it could be a clue for a doubloon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey shielded her eyes. \"I can\u0027t stand those things-make them stop,\" she said in a ragged voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heads were bobbing slowly up and down, nodding again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that\u0027s our answer,\" Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but which is it-Summer or a doubloon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care, I just want to get out of here,\" Audrey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t go,\" Jenny said to Dee. \"We can\u0027t leave him, we can\u0027t go anywhere.\" She pulled herself up using the wizard\u0027s cabinet as a support, and leaned a hand on it, looking into the glass. \"I have to help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny.\" Dee touched her elbow gently. \"There\u0027s nothing you can do for him.\" Then, as Jenny held on to the glass: \"All right, what are you going to do for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny didn\u0027t know. Stay here with him-if she could keep from screaming. Break the cabinet to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then what? Could she stand to hold the thing that was in there, cuddle it like a stiff, oversize doll? If she broke the doll, would it kill her grandfather? Or would he still be alive inside his pieces?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d rather be dead than be like this, she knew. But how did you kill something that wasn\u0027t alive, only trapped?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m so sorry,\" she whispered, pressing her hand to the glass. \"I\u0027m so sorry, I\u0027m so sorry....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her fault-he\u0027d gone in her place. Given\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Dee was right. Jenny couldn\u0027t do anything for him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands trailed down the glass. \"We\u0027ll go to the fun house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn their way out she turned back to face the wizard\u0027s cabinet, looked into the dark, staring eyes. \"I\u0027m coming back,\" she said. \"And when I do, I\u0027ll help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heads were bobbing in their case as she left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut into the night again. Jenny wished she had a map. Her memory for some parts of the park was sketchy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fun house is up near the very front,\" she said, \"so it\u0027s got to be somewhere that way.\" She pointed the way they\u0027d come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but more to the left. We can cut across there.\" Dee was more talkative than she had been since Audrey\u0027s accident, but her voice was still not quite itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed rest rooms, trees, a large refreshment stand. The Tilt-a-Whirl was dark; so was the Enterprise. And so, as they approached it, was the fun house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen an uncanny sound began. Two slow, rising notes, repeated over and over. Jenny recognized it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The foghorn on the ark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights were going on in the large boat, first outlining the roof, then illuminating the windows of the house on deck. Jenny could see animals in the windows: an elephant, an ostrich, a hippopotamus, and at the very top Father Noah, with an expression more like a leer than a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ark began to rock visibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like they\u0027ve got the welcome mat out,\" Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey entered through the whale\u0027s mouth, walking on the spongy pink tongue. Inside, the doors were slanted, exacerbating the rocking feeling. Jenny began to feel giddy immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t see much inside. Black lights made Audrey\u0027s white nylon jacket glow and Dee\u0027s eyes flash. We should have looked for controls, Jenny thought. There must be some way to turn on the lights in these places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she looked back, the door she\u0027d just come through was gone. Instead, there was a glass booth, with a human figure silhouetted inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer! Jenny\u0027s heart gave a terrible jolt. She took a step toward the booth, then stopped. She couldn\u0027t tell anything about the figure. She took another step, one hand out toward the glass. Oh, God, I don\u0027t want to see this... . A light in the booth went on. Wild laughter assaulted Jenny\u0027s ears. It was the sound of somebody going insane, and at first it frightened her so much that she couldn\u0027t take in what she was seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she focused on the figure. It was a hugely fat woman, bucktoothed, with freckles like birthmarks and scraggly hair. Her hands waved in front of her as she cackled and guffawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember that! Laughing-oh, what was her name? Laughing Lizzie. She used to be in the arcade, and she always scared me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny scanned the florid face, looking for something familiar in the emptv eves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould Summer-be in there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummer had been tiny, dimpled, with thistledown blond hair and dark blue eyes. She\u0027d been as light as a flower petal stirred by the wind. Could they have destroyed her body and put her in this bloated plastic thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe she was like P.C. and Slug. Maybe there was a table somewhere in here with a piece of Summer\u0027s old body on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jenny couldn\u0027t see anything she recognized in the fat woman\u0027s eyes. Nothing to make her want to look any closer, especially since the demented laughter was going on and on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the others. \"Let\u0027s keep moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stumbled through twisted corridors and across shifting floors. A blue Day-Glo hippo gaped at Jenny, a snake dropped from the ceiling in front of her. From all around came panting, growling, weird music-a cacophony of strange sounds. It made it hard for Jenny to hear even Dee and the others right next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was hard to examine the exhibits. Chain-link fencing was strung in front of many of them and had to be pulled away. Every figure that looked even vaguely human had to be studied, and anything that looked like gold had to be scrutinized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything in here looks suspicious,\" Michael said as they stared at a laughing man with three faces that rotated slowly on his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was most disconcerted by the mirrors. On the floor they mimicked endless drops, reflecting lights down into infinity. On the walls they confused her, duplicating her own wide green eyes, Audrey\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecopper hair, Michael\u0027s pale, set face. It reflected Dee\u0027s supple movements, making it seem as if there were dozens of camouflage jackets all going in different directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach always hated these mirrors, too, Jenny remembered, turning a sharp zigzag corner. Enough that Julian put them in the paper house as part of his nightmare. She suddenly realized that she hadn\u0027t thought about her cousin in quite a while. She\u0027d been too busy worrying over Tom-and over how to survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she did miss Zach. She missed his winter-gray eyes, and his sharp-featured face, and his dry intelligence. Even if Tom had been safe, she would have come to the Shadow World questing for Zach. \"Ugh,\" Dee said. \"What\u0027s this?\" They had come out of the mirror maze and were now in dark, windy corridors with very unsteady floorboards. There were displays every few feet-much like museum displays, except that Jenny had never seen this kind of thing in any museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Disgusting,\" Michael said under his breath. \"Replogle, disgusting ...\" Replogle was really the name of a map company, but Michael thought it made a much better adjective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was trying to cheer himself up. Because, Jenny thought, the displays really were gruesome. They were torture scenes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWax figures were set up as victims and torturers. Some of the equipment Jenny recognized. The rack. The Iron Maiden. The stocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd some of it was dreadfully and harrowingly unfamiliar. Boots with handles like the vise Tom\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efather had in his garage workshop. To break bones, Jenny supposed. Grotesque metal helmets with iron tongues that gagged the victim. Cages too small to stand or lie down in. Every kind of device to burn, or cut, or maim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was not here this afternoon,\" Audrey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault, I guess,\" Dee said after a moment. \"I went up to San Francisco once with my mom, and there was a place at Fisherman\u0027s Wharf-like a chamber of horrors, you know? It gave me nightmares for years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly she turned away from the nearest scene and leaned against the wall, head down. She was breathing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny peered through the darkness. \"Dee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Just give me a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you mumbling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s-it\u0027s, uh, this thing for when you get upset. I got it out of-\" She paused. \"Ancient Chinese manuscripts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what dialect?\" Audrey demanded. \"Mandarin? Cantonese?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, it was from a kung fu movie. But it works. It\u0027s pretty long, but the end goes \u0027I am as strong as I need to be. I am my only master.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am my only master,\" Jenny repeated. She liked that. Julian and his people might be the masters of this world, but not of her. No one was her master if she wouldn\u0027t let them be. \"Is it helping?\" she asked Dee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to faint or puke right this moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock tingled in Jenny\u0027s palms. The very idea of Dee fainting was so outrageous-so frightening-she couldn\u0027t cope with it. Dee was never that scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly maybe she was, especially when confronted with things that physical courage couldn\u0027t do anything about. The stuff around them here was history -and who could change that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna join Amnesty International if I ever get out of here,\" Dee muttered. \"I swear, I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother and I already belong,\" Audrey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Myers? thought Jenny, and Dee said, \"Your mom?\" Audrey\u0027s mother was a society matron, good at making finger sandwiches and arranging charity fashion shows. She and Dee didn\u0027t get along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe all that organization is good for something after all,\" Dee murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny still had a very bad feeling about the place. She wanted to hurry through it, to not see as much as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they couldn\u0027t. They had to check every figure, staring into faces the color of peach crayons, with teeth that were a little too shiny in the spotlights. The skin of the wax figures had an unreal inner glow, as if the outer layers were translucent and the color buried somewhere inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut none of the glassy eyes looked like Summer\u0027s. And nothing moved, although Jenny was in constant dread that an eyelid would flicker or a chest would rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they start coming to life, I\u0027ll go crazy, she thought almost with detachment. Just screaming, staring crazy. It would be a relief to go crazy at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny-\" Michael\u0027s voice was choked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blue,\" Michael said, and Jenny saw what he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was on a table. Above it, suspended by a rusty chain, was a huge wooden disk with bloody iron spikes. It was a little pool of china blue precisely the color of Summer\u0027s shirtdress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was inside the dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny that Jenny could remember that outfit so exactly. Summer had appeared on the doorstep wearing it the night of Tom\u0027s birthday party, looking fresh, sweet, and completely inappropriate, since it was freezing outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was lying on a table, encasing a body. Although the figure\u0027s face was turned away from Jenny, she could glimpse sandaled feet curled up at one end and soft light curls at the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny stood frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had happened too suddenly; she wasn\u0027t prepared. She\u0027d seen that dying in the Shadow World didn\u0027t mean you got buried and disappeared. She\u0027d known they were looking for Summer, however transformed, however defiled Summer might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since Michael\u0027s dream she\u0027d allowed herself thoughts that Summer might not be lost completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now that she was face to face with the possibility, she couldn\u0027t cope with it. She didn\u0027t want to go and look, didn\u0027t want to know. She glanced at the others, saw them standing paralyzed, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to look. You can take it. It\u0027s probably just a normal wax figure with nobody inside. And that\u0027s not blood on those spikes, it\u0027s red paint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew this was comnletelv irrational. She knew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003every well that it probably wasn\u0027t just a normal wax figure, and that there was no reason for the blood on the spikes to be anything but blood. After everything she\u0027d seen in the Shadow World, after what had happened to Slug and P.C. and her grandfather, she knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her mind needed to say something to get her legs going. To keep away the pictures of Summer\u0027s head falling off when Jenny took her by the shoulder, or of some Rosemary\u0027s Baby-type monster looking Up with crafty, glee-filled eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge log disk swung on its chain above the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can take it. I can take it. I\u0027m strong enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny inched closer. She could see the spun-sugar curls, just the color of Summer\u0027s hair, and the little hands lying folded like rose petals. She couldn\u0027t see the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe log swung, creaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith sudden inspiration Jenny thought, am my only master.p\u0026gt;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for the figure\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look out!\" Dee shouted. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-kill-the-forbidden-game-3/page-9.html","bookId":2101,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:09 PM"}
