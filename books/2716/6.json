I’m going to watch TV in bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz adjusts her dress. “I’m going to hang out with the bartender. Guess I can’t take him back to our room, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem. I’ll find somewhere to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Avoid the deck,” Hailey tells her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz winks. “Don’t wait up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s a master,” Hailey says, and gives Liz a small bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m the worst pupil ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why isn’t he here?” I wonder out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz yawns. “Because it’s nine A.M. Did we really have to get here this early? We’re the only ones at the pool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want him to disappear again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not like he has anywhere to go. He’s kind of boat-locked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as a vampire doesn’t get him and throw him overboard,” I say, and stretch my legs out in front of me. “Hailey is meeting us around eleven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think of her?” she asks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like her,” I say. “You?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s something off about her. I like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe she’s a vampire,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is not a vampire,” Liz says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s pale. Good sense of smell. She’s traveling alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s here with her mom,” Liz reminds me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So she says.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz closes her eyes and then opens them again. “I’m hungry. Wanna get something to eat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, no thanks. I’m still full from your midnight treat. Thanks for bringing me that snack from the bar, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alrighty, I’ll see you later.” She blows me a kiss and sashays off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t mind having a minute alone. The breeze is in my hair, the sky is bright blue—it’s a perfect day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could be better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJames. Seeing James could make this better. Yes, I know James Bond isn’t his real name, but I can call him whatever I like. I sigh and close my eyes. There are lots of other guys who could be my first. But there was something about James…. He’d be perfect. He’s the one! My first! Of course he doesn’t know this yet. He doesn’t even know my name yet. I don’t even know his name yet. In fact I hardly know anything about him except that he’s a student at Penn and he looks great in a tux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I know he’s perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy eleven Hailey has set up next to me. By twelve Liz is back with messy hair and a naughty smile on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what took you so long?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winks. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy two there’s still no James at this pool, and I decide I might as well look around the ship. “I wonder where he is,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he’s not going to come to me, I’m going to have to go to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyone wanna come stalk James with me?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely,” Liz says, slipping on her flip-flops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us hit the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s see,” Liz says. “There are three other pools on the boat. Which one will he be at?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s start at the top and work our way down,” Hailey suggests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe try the eleventh-floor pool first. Kiddie pool. No James.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At least I know he has no children,” I say. There you go—now I know three things about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe try the tenth-floor pool next. It’s the fitness pool. It’s long and rectangular, and there are a whole bunch of hard-core workout buffs swimming laps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo James. No sun either, since it has a roof. I flip my sunglasses to the top of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like this pool,” Hailey says, ogling the pumped-up guys hard at work. “Can we come back here later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Watching them is too tiring,” Liz says. “Next!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast pool—ninth floor. We step out of the elevator and—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmigod. “There he is!” I say, pointing. James! In the flesh! In the hot tub! Oh! Even though there’s a roof, he’s wearing aviator sunglasses, and he’s holding a beer and he’s just as gorgeous as I remember and he’s sitting next to a girl and—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl. Who is this girl and why is she stalking my man? I’m the only one who gets to stalk my man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl is giggling at something James is saying: a high, tinkling, annoying giggle, a giggle that makes me want to kill her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacations-from-hell/page-6.html","bookId":2716,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:20 AM"}
