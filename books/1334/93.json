Beneath it a hundred attendants nightly laying their heads. But long since, he had disbanded his damsels. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Springing from syren embrace—\"They shall sap and mine me no more\" he cried \"my destiny commands me.

Nothing less than bodily to remove Ohonoo to the center of the lagoon, in fulfillment of an old prophecy running thus— When a certain island shall stir from its foundations and stand in the middle of the still water, then shall the ruler of that island be ruler of all Mardi.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The task was hard, but how glorious the reward!

But my lord, this faith it is, that robs his days of peace; his nights of sweet unconsciousness. For holding himself foreordained to the dominion of the entire Archipelago, he upbraids the gods for laggards, and curses himself as deprived of his rights; nay, as having had wrested from him, what he never possessed. Discontent dwarfs his horizon till he spans it with his hand. \u0027Most miserable of demi-gods,\u0027 he cries, \u0027here am I cooped up in this insignificant islet, only one hundred leagues by fifty, when scores of broad empires own me not for their lord.\u0027 Yet Uhia himself is envied. \u0027Ah!\u0027 cries Karrolono, one of his chieftains, master of a snug little glen, \u0027Here am I cabined in this paltry cell among the mountains, when that great King Uhia is lord of the whole island, and every cubic mile of matter therein.\u0027 But this same Karrolono is envied. \u0027Hard, oh beggarly lot is mine,\u0027 cries Donno, one of his retainers. \u0027Here am I — fixed and screwed down to this paltry plantation, when my lord Karrolono owns the whole glen, ten long parasangs from cliff to sea.\u0027 But Donno too is envied. \u0027Alas, cursed fate!\u0027 cries his servitor Flavona. \u0027Here am I made to trudge, sweat, and labor all day, when Donno my master does nothing but command.\u0027 But others envy Flavona; and those who envy him are envied in turn; even down to poor bed- ridden Manta, who dying of want, groans forth, \u0027Abandoned wretch that I am! here I miserably perish, while so many beggars gad about and live!\u0027 But surely; none envy Manta! Yes; great Uhia himself. \u0027Ah!\u0027 cries the king. \u0027Here am I vexed and tormented by ambition; no peace night nor day; my temples chafed sore by this cursed crown that I — wear; while that ignoble wight Manta, gives up the ghost with none to molest him.\u0027\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In vain we wandered up and down in this isle, and peered into its innermost recesses: no Yillah was there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768/76433.html","bookId":1334,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 2:14:01 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 2:14:01 AM"}
