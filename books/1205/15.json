Impossible! Guitaut, go and order the marshal to attack the fort at once. The king proposes to lie tonight at Vayres.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But, madame,\" murmured Mazarin, \"it seems to me that the marshal\u0027s precaution—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And it seems to me,\" retorted Anne of Austria, \"that when the royal authority has been outraged, it cannot be avenged too swiftly. Go, Guitaut, and say to Monsieur de La Meilleraie that the queen\u0027s eye is upon him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dismissing Guitaut with a majestic gesture, the queen took her son by the hand and left the room; and, without looking to see if she was followed, ascended a staircase leading to a terrace. This terrace commanded a view of the surrounding country by means of vistas most artfully designed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The queen cast a rapid glance in every direction. Two hundred yards behind her was the Libourne road, with the hostelry of our friend Biscarros gleaming white in the sunlight. At her feet flowed the Dordogne, calm, swift, and majestic. At her right arose the fort of Vayres, silent as a ruin; the redoubts newly thrown up formed a circle around it. A few sentinels were pacing back and forth upon the gallery; five pieces of cannon showed their bronze necks and yawning mouths through the embrasures. At her left Monsieur de La Meilleraie was making his dispositions to camp for the night. The main body of the army had arrived and was drawn up in close order around the marshal\u0027s position.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Upon a hillock stood a man following attentively with his eyes every movement of besiegers and besieged; it was Cauvignac.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Guitaut crossed the river on the ferry-boat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The queen stood like a statue upon the terrace, with contracted brow, holding the hand of little Louis XIV., who gazed on the scene before him with an interest beyond his years, and from time to time said to his mother:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Madame, please let me mount my battle-horse, and go with Monsieur de La Meilleraie to punish these insolent fellows.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the queen\u0027s side was Mazarin, whose crafty, mocking features had assumed for the moment that cast of serious thought which they wore on great occasions only; and behind the queen and the minister were the maids of honor, who took pattern by their mistress\u0027s silence, and hardly dared exchange a few hurried words in undertones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In all this there was an appearance of peace and tranquillity; but it was the tranquillity of the mine, which a spark is soon to change into a destructive tempest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The eyes of all were fixed with special intentness upon Guitaut, for from him was to come the explosion which was awaited with such diverse emotions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The army likewise was in a state of painful suspense; and the messenger had no sooner stepped ashore upon the left bank of the Dordogne and been recognized than every eye was turned upon him. Monsieur de La Meilleraie, as soon as he caught sight of him, left the group of officers in the centre of which he was standing, and went to meet him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Guitaut and the marshal talked together for a few seconds. Although the river was quite wide at that point, and although the distance was considerable between the royal party and the two officers, it was not so great that the surprised expression upon the marshal\u0027s face could not be detected. It was evident that the order conveyed to him seemed ill-advised and unseasonable, and he looked doubtfully toward the group in which the queen could be distinguished. But Anne of Austria, who understood his thought, made so imperative a gesture with both head and hand that the marshal, who knew his imperious sovereign of old, bent his head in token of acquiescence, if not of approbation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Instantly, at a word from him, three or four captains, who exercised the functions of aides-de-camp of the present day, leaped into the saddle and galloped away in three or four different directions. Wherever they went the work of pitching the camp, which had just been begun, was at once broken off, and at the beat of the drums and the shrill call of the bugles, the soldiers let fall the armfuls of straw they were carrying, and the hammers with which they were driving in the tent-stakes. All ran to their weapons, which were stacked in due order; the grenadiers seized their muskets, the common soldiers their pikes, the artillerymen their various instruments; for a moment there was incredible confusion, caused by all these men running in all directions; but gradually order succeeded chaos, and every man was in his proper place,—the grenadiers in the centre, the king\u0027s household on the right, the artillery on the left; the drums and trumpets were silent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A single drum was heard behind the intrenchments; then it too ceased and deathlike silence prevailed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly an order was given in a clear, sharp tone. The queen was too far away to hear the words, but she saw the troops form instantly in columns; she drew her handkerchief and waved it, while the young king cried excitedly, stamping upon the ground: \"Forward! forward!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The army replied with a shout of \"Vive le roi!\" The artillery set off at a gallop, and took up its position upon a slight elevation, and the columns moved forward as the drums beat the charge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was not a siege in regular form, but a simple escalade. The intrenchments thrown up in haste by Richon were earthworks; there were no trenches to be opened therefore,—it was a matter of carrying them by assault. Every precaution had been taken by the energetic commandant of Vayres, and he had availed himself of every possible advantage in the lay of the land, with unusual science.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was clear that Richon had determined not to fire first under any circumstances, for again he waited for the provocation to come from the king\u0027s troops; but again, as on the former occasion, that terrible row of muskets, which had done such execution upon the king\u0027s household, was seen to be pointing down at them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the forward movement began, the six guns drawn up on the little hill were discharged, and the cannon-balls threw up showers of dirt on the crown of the ramparts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The response was not long delayed; the artillery within the intrenchments roared forth in its turn, ploughing broad furrows in the ranks of the royal army; but at the voice of the officers, these bleeding gaps disappeared; the lips of the wound opened for an instant, then closed again; the main column, which was momentarily shaken, moved forward once more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e While the cannon were being reloaded it was the turn of the musketry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Five minutes later, the great guns on both sides discharged their volleys again, with but a single report, like two tempests in fierce combat with each other, like two peals of thunder coming at the same instant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As it was perfectly calm, and a dense smoke hung over the battle-field, besiegers and besieged soon disappeared in a cloud, which was rent from time to time by the vivid flash of the artillery.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From time to time men could be seen coming out from the cloud in the rear of the royal army, dragging themselves along with difficulty, and leaving a bloody track behind them, until they fell exhausted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The number of wounded rapidly increased, and the roar of the musketry and artillery continued. The royal artillery, however, were firing irregularly and at random; for amid the dense smoke the gunners could not distinguish friends from foes. The gunners in the fort on the other hand had none but foes in front of them, and their fire was more constant and more deadly than ever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At last the royal artillery ceased firing altogether; it was evident that the assault had begun in good earnest, and that a hand-to-hand combat was in progress.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a moment of keenest anxiety on the part of the spectators, during which the smoke, the firing having greatly slackened, rose slowly into the air. The royal army was then seen to be falling back in disorder, leaving heaps of dead at the foot of the ramparts. A sort of breach had been made; a few palisades were torn away, leaving an opening; but that opening bristled with men and pikes and muskets, and amid those men, covered with blood, and yet as calm and cool as if he were a disinterested spectator of the tragedy in which he was playing so terrible a part, stood Richon, holding in his hand an axe all notched by the blows he had struck with it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some invisible power seemed to protect him, for he was constantly in the thickest of the firing, always in the front rank, always standing erect and with uncovered head, and yet no bullet had struck him, no pike had touched him; he was as invulnerable as he was impassive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thrice Maréchal de La Meilleraie in person led the royal troops to the assault; thrice the royal troops were beaten back before the eyes of the king and queen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Great tears rolled silently down the pale cheeks of the boy king; Anne of Austria wrung her hands and muttered:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh! that man! that man!
