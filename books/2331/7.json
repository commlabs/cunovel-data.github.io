My guess is you stayed around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And went after him,\" I said. \"But that was different. I knew who he was. I had a fair shot at getting him before he got me.\" I frowned at the memory. \"Even so, I came awfully close to getting myself killed. Elaine came even closer. She got stabbed, she had her spleen removed. She almost died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you say she left the country?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was another woman, a former girlfriend. Elaine\u0027s my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you didn\u0027t have any women in your life at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We weren\u0027t married then. We\u0027d known each other years previously. Motley brought us together again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Motley was the guy who wanted to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after she recovered-Elaine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elaine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After she recovered you resumed seeing each other, and now you\u0027re married. A good marriage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very good marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God,\" he said. \"Maybe if I stick around and see this thing through I\u0027ll wind up back in Connecticut with Barbara. But it\u0027s hard to imagine her without her spleen. It\u0027s the key element of her character.\" He took a drink. \"In the meantime, my friend, I\u0027ve got a law practice to run and a case to try. Tempting as it may be to fly off for a couple of weeks in Oslo or Brussels, I think I\u0027ll stick around and face the music. But that doesn\u0027t mean I want to get killed, nor do I think it makes much sense to leave the task of protecting me to the NYPD. I\u0027m safe here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In this apartment. The building has good security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think Will would have much trouble getting in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t the guy on the desk make you show ID? I told him to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I flashed a card at him,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t give him time to look at it, and he didn\u0027t insist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to speak to him about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t bother. You can\u0027t expect very much from the building personnel. The elevator\u0027s self-service. All anybody has to do is take out the doorman and he\u0027s in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take him out? You mean kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or just slip past him, which wouldn\u0027t be on the same level with getting into Fort Knox. If you want a good shot at getting through this alive, and if you won\u0027t leave town, you need bodyguards around the clock. That means three shifts a day, and I\u0027d recommend you employ two men per shift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you be one of those men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I don\u0027t like the work and I don\u0027t have the reflexes for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you supply bodyguards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not directly. I\u0027m a one-man operation. There are people I can call for backup, but not as many as you\u0027d need. What I can do is recommend a couple of agencies who can be counted on to furnish reliable operatives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took out my notebook, wrote down the names of two firms, along with a phone number for each and a person to ask for. I tore out the page and handed it to Whitfield. He read it, folded it, and tucked it in his breast pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No point in calling now,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll call first thing in the morning. If Will lets me live that long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve probably got a few days. He\u0027ll wait until the story runs, and until you\u0027ve had time to worry about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a real prick, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t suppose he\u0027s on the short list for the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this year, but then he\u0027s got a lot of competition. Ah, Jesus, you think your life\u0027s in order and then something like this comes at you from out of nowhere. Do you worry a lot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I worry a lot? I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems to me that I do. I worry about a stroke or a heart attack, I worry about prostate cancer. Sometimes I worry about having some bad gene that\u0027ll have me coming down with one of those rare diseases. I can\u0027t think of the word I want and I start to worry about early-onset Alzheimer\u0027s. You know something? It\u0027s a big fucking waste of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worrying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it. You never worry about the right thing. I never worried about this son of a bitch, I\u0027ll tell you that, and now he\u0027s got me on his list. Tell me what else I can do. Besides hiring guards. You must have a few ideas on the kind of routine I should follow, the precautions I ought to take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I was done suggesting ways he could increase the odds of his staying alive, he\u0027d made a pot of coffee and we were each working on our second cup. He talked about a current case of his, and I talked about a piece of work I\u0027d wrapped up a month previously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to know I appreciate all this,\" he said. \"I\u0027d tell you to send me a bill, but a man on Will\u0027s list ought to keep his accounts current. What do I owe you? I\u0027ll write you a check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly,\" he said. \"I dragged you out of your house in the middle of the night and got two solid hours\u0027 worth of your professional expertise. Go ahead and put a price on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a vested interest in your survival,\" I told him. \"If you stay alive, there\u0027s a chance you\u0027ll throw some work my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say you can count on it, but you still ought to get paid for tonight.\" He patted the pocket where he\u0027d put the slip I gave him. \"Will you get a referral fee from these guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It depends which one you call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only one of them\u0027ll pay you for a referral?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do a certain amount of per diem work for Reliable,\" I said, \"and Wally Donn pays me a commission on anything else I happen to steer their way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why\u0027d you put down the other agency as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they\u0027re good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll use Reliable,\" he said. \"That goes without saying. And I\u0027d still like to pay you for your time tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case, I\u0027ve got a better idea. I\u0027d like to hire you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To do what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To go after Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him all the reasons why it didn\u0027t make sense. Half the police force was already assigned to the case, and the cops had access to the available data and evidence along with the scientific apparatus to learn something from it. On top of that, they had the manpower to knock on every door and run down every lead and phone tip that came their way. All I could do was get in their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know all that,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I still want to hire you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? As a way of paying me for this evening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I want you on the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I think there\u0027s a chance you\u0027ll make a difference. The first time I hired you, you know, was on Ray Gruliow\u0027s recommendation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said you had a good mind and caught on fast. \u0027Give him the first sentence and he\u0027s got the whole page,\u0027 that\u0027s what he said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was being generous,\" I said. \"Sometimes I move my lips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so. He also said good things about your character and personal integrity. And he said something else, too. He said you were dogged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a nicer word than pigheaded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his eyes. \"You\u0027re a hard man to compliment, aren\u0027t you? Matt, offense is the best defense. That\u0027s true in the courtroom and it\u0027s true on the street. I don\u0027t know what the hell you can do that the cops can\u0027t, but the one thing I don\u0027t have to worry about these days is money, and if I can throw a little of it your way I can tell myself I\u0027m doing something to see that Will gets nailed before he nails me. Now why don\u0027t you just say you\u0027ll take the case so I can write you out a check?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See? You\u0027re stubborn, which may be part of the job description for what you do. But I\u0027m persuasive, which is very definitely part of my job description.\" He went over to the desk, got out his checkbook and wrote me a check, tore it out and handed it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A retainer,\" he said. \"Good enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amount was two thousand dollars. \"That\u0027s fine,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have anything else you\u0027re working?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at the moment,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do, but I\u0027ll start doing it in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll call Donn at Reliable and see about getting my body guarded. What a thing to have to do. Can I tell you something? Don\u0027t repeat this, but until this afternoon I sort of liked Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s say I had a grudging admiration for him. He was a kind of urban folk hero, wasn\u0027t he? Almost like Batman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Batman never killed anybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in the comic books. He does in the movies, but Hollywood\u0027ll fuck up anything, won\u0027t they? No, the real Batman never killed anybody. Listen to me, will you? \u0027The real Batman.\u0027 But when you grew up on the comic book that\u0027s how it seems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Christ\u0027s sake,\" he said, \"I\u0027m Adrian Whitfield, I\u0027m a fucking lawyer. That\u0027s all I am. I\u0027m not the Joker, I\u0027m not the Penguin, I\u0027m not the Riddler. What\u0027s Batman got against me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElaine was still up when I got home, watching a wildlife documentary on the Discovery channel. I joined her for the last ten minutes of it. During the credit crawl she made a face and switched off the set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have done that when you came in,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? I didn\u0027t mind watching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I have to learn,\" she said, \"is always to skip the last five minutes of those things, because it\u0027s always the same. You spend fifty-five minutes watching some really nice animal, and then they ruin the whole thing by telling you it\u0027s endangered and won\u0027t last out the century. They\u0027re so determined to leave you depressed you\u0027d think they had Prozac for a sponsor. How was Adrian Whitfield?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her a summary of the evening. \"Well, he\u0027s not depressed,\" she said. \"Bemused, it sounds like. \u0027Why me?\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Natural question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I\u0027d say. How much did you say the retainer was? Two thousand dollars? I\u0027m surprised you took it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cop training, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When somebody hands you money, you take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that. He wanted to pay me for my time, and when I turned him down he decided he wanted to hire me. We can use the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you can use the work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can, and maybe I\u0027ll be able to figure out something to do. I just hope it won\u0027t involve buying a computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TJ. He was on my case earlier. When did he leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half an hour after you did. I offered him the couch, but he didn\u0027t want to stay over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027What you think, I\u0027s got no place to sleep?\u0027 I wonder where he does sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a mystery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must live somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not everybody does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s homeless, do you? He changes his clothes regularly and he\u0027s clean about his person. I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t bed down in the park.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are a lot of ways to be homeless,\" I said, \"and they don\u0027t all involve sleeping on the subway and eating out of Dumpsters. I know a woman who drank her way out of a rent-controlled apartment. She moved her things to a storage locker in Chelsea. She pays something like eighty dollars a month for a cubicle eight feet square. That\u0027s where she keeps her stuff, and that\u0027s where she sleeps.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/even-the-wicked-matthew-scudder-13/page-7.html","bookId":2331,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:02 AM"}
