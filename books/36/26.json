Not because the dessert is no good. Not even because it’s no good for you. But simply because, wonderful as it was, you’ve had enough.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen you can drop your involvement with sex for that reason, you may want to do so. Then again, you may not. You may never decide that you’ve “had enough” and may always want this experience, in balance with the other experiences of your Beingness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s okay. That’s all right. The sexually active are no less qualified for enlightenment, no less spiritually evolved, than the sexually inactive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat enlightenment and evolution do cause you to drop is your addiction to sex, your deep need to have the experience, your compulsive behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo, too, your preoccupation with money, power, security, possessions, and other experiences of the body will vanish. Yet your genuine appreciation for them will not and should not. Appreciation for all of life is what honors the Process I have created. Disdain for life or any of its joys—even the most basic, physical ones—is disdain for Me, the Creator.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor when you call My creation unholy, what do you call Me? Yet when you call My creation sacred, you sanctify your experience of it, and Me as well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI tell you this: I have created nothing disdain-ful—and, as your Shakespeare said, nothing is “evil” lest thinking make it so.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis leads me to some other, final, questions about sex. Is any kind of sex between consenting adults okay?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI mean even “kinky” sex? Even loveless sex? Even gay sex?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFirst, let’s be once again clear that nothing is disap-proved of by God.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI do not sit here in judgment, calling one action Good and another Evil.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e(As you know, I have discussed this at some length in Book 1.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow—within the context of what serves you, or disserves you, on your Path of Evolution, only you can decide that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is a broad-based guideline, however, upon which most evolved souls have agreed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo action which causes hurt to another leads to rapid evolution.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is a second guideline as well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo action involving another may be taken without the other’s agreement and permission.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow let us consider the questions you’ve just asked within the context of these guidelines.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Kinky” sex? Well, if it hurts no one, and is done with everyone’s permission, what reason would anyone have to call it “wrong”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoveless sex? Sex for the “sake of sex” has been debated from the beginning of time. I often think whenever I hear this question that I’d like to go into a roomful of people someday and say, “Everybody here who’s never had sex outside of a relationship of deep, lasting, committed, abiding love, raise your hand.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet me just say this: Loveless anything is not the fastest way to the Goddess.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhether it’s loveless sex or loveless spaghetti and meat balls, if you’ve prepared the feast and are consum-ing it without love, you’re missing the most extraordi-nary part of the experience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIs it wrong to miss that? Here again, “wrong” may not be the operative word. “Disadvantageous” would be closer, given that you desire to evolve into a higher spiritual being as rapidly as you can.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGay sex? So many people want to say that I am against gay sexuality-or the acting out of it. Yet I make no judgment, on this or any other choice you make.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePeople want to make all kinds of value judg-ments—about everything—and I kind of spoil the party. I won’t join them in those judgments, which is espe-cially disconcerting to those who say that / originated them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI do observe this: There was once a time when people thought that marriage between people of differ-ing races was not only inadvisable, but against the law of God. (Amazingly, some people still think this.) They pointed to their Bible as their authority—even as they do for their authority on questions surrounding homo-sexuality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou mean it is okay for people of differing races to join together in marriage?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe question is absurd, but not nearly as absurd as some people’s certainty that the answer is “no”.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAre the questions on homosexuality equally absurd?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou decide. I have no judgment about that, or anything. I know you wish that I did. That would make your lives a lot easier. No decisions to make. No tough calls. Everything decided for you. Nothing to do but obey. Not much of a life, at least in terms of creativity or self-empowerment, but what the heck... no stress, either.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet me ask You some questions about sex and children. At what age is it appropriate to allow children to become aware of sexuality as a life experience?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eChildren are aware of themselves as sexual be-ings—which is to say, as human beings—from the outset of their lives. What many parents on your planet now do is try to discourage them from noticing that. If a baby’s hand goes to the “wrong place,” you move it away. If a tiny child begins to find moments of self-pleas-ure in its innocent delight with its own body, you react in horror, and pass that sense of horror on to your child. The child wonders, what did I do, what did I do? Mommy’s mad; what did I do?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith your race of beings, it has not been a question of when you introduce your offspring to sex, it has been a question of when you stop demanding that they deny their own identity as sexual beings. Somewhere be-tween the ages of 12 and 1 7 most of you give up the fight already and say, essentially (although naturally not with words—you don’t speak of these things), “Okay, now you can notice that you have sexual parts and sexual things to do with them.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet by this time the damage has been done. Your children have been shown for ten years or more that they are to be ashamed of those body parts. Some are not even told the proper name for them. They hear everything from “wee wee” to “your bottom” to words some of you must strain mightily to invent—all to avoid simply saying “penis” or “vagina.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHaving thus gotten very clear that all things having to do with those parts of the body are to be hidden, not spoken of, denied, your offspring then explode into puberty not knowing at all what to make of what’s going on with them. They’ve had no preparation at all. Of course, they then act miserable, responding to their newest and most urgent urges awkwardly, if not inap-propriately.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is not necessary, nor do I observe it as serving your offspring, far too many of whom enter their adult lives with sexual taboos, inhibitions, and “hang ups” to beat the band.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow in enlightened societies offspring are never discouraged, reprimanded, or “corrected” when they begin to find early delight in the nature of their very being. Nor is the sexuality of their parents—that is, the identity of their parents as sexual beings—particularly avoided or necessarily hidden. Naked bodies, whether of the parents or the children or their siblings, are seen and treated as being totally natural, totally wonderful, and totally okay—not as things of which to be ashamed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSexual functions are also seen and treated as totally natural, totally wonderful, and totally okay.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn some societies, parents couple in full view of their offspring—and what could give children a greater sense of the beauty and the wonder and the pure joy and the total okayness of the sexual expression of love than this? For parents are constantly modeling the “rightness” and wrongness” of all behaviors, and children pick up subtle and not-so-subtle signals from their parents about everything through what they see their parents thinking, saying, and doing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs noted earlier, you may call such societies “pagan” or “primitive,” yet it is observable that in such societies rape and crimes of passion are virtually nonexistent, prostitution is laughed at as being absurd, and sexual inhibitions and dysfunctions are unheard of.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhile such openness is not recommended just now for your own society (in all but the most extraordinary of settings it would no doubt be far too culturally stigmatizing), it is time that the so-called modern civili-zations on your planet do something to end the repres-sion, guilt, and shame which too often surrounds and characterizes the totality of your society’s sexual expres-sion and experience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSuggestions? Ideas?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStop teaching children from the very beginning of their lives that things having to do with the very natural functioning of their bodies are shameful and wrong. Discontinue demonstrating to your offspring that any-thing sexual is to be hidden. Allow your children to see and observe the romantic side of you. Let them see you hugging, touching, gently fondling—let them see that their parents love each other and that showing their love physically is something that is very natural and very wonderful. (It would surprise you to know in how many families such a simple lesson has never been taught.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen your children begin to embrace their own sexual feelings, curiosities and urges, cause them to connect this new and expanding experience of them-selves with an inner sense of joy and celebration, not guilt and shame.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd for heaven sake, stop hiding your bodies from your children. It’s okay if they see you swimming in the nude in a country water hole on a camping trip or in the backyard pool; don’t go into apoplexy should they catch a glimpse of you moving from the bedroom to the bathroom without a robe; end this frantic need to cover up, close off, shut down any opportunity, however innocent, for your child to be introduced to you as a being with your own sexual identity. Children think their parents are asexual because their parents have portrayed themselves that way. They then imagine that they must be this way, because all children emulate their parents. (Therapists will tell you that some grown-up offspring have, to this very day, the most difficult time imagining their parents actually “doing it,” which, of course, fills these offspring—now patients in the thera-pist’s office—with rage or guilt or shame, because they, naturally, desire to “do it,” and they can’t figure out what’s wrong with them.)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo talk about sex with your children, laugh about sex with your children, teach them and allow them and remind them and show them how to celebrate their sexuality. That is what you can do for your children. And you do this from the day they are born, with the first kiss, the first hug, the first touch they receive from you, and that they see you receiving from each other.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThank You. Thank You. I was so hoping that You’d bring some sanity to this subject. But one final question. When is it appropriate to specifically introduce or discuss or describe sexuality with your children?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey will tell you when that time has come. Each child will make it clear, unmistakably, if you are really watching and listening. It comes in increments, actually. It arrives incrementally. And you will know the age-ap-propriate way of dealing with the incremental arrival of your child’s sexuality if you are clear, if you are finished with your own “unfinished business” about all of this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow do we get to that place?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDo what it takes. Enroll in a seminar. See a therapist. join a group. Read a book. Meditate on it. Discover each other—most of all, discover each other as male and female again; discover, revisit, regain, reclaim your own sexuality. Celebrate that. Enjoy that. Own that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOwn your own joyful sexuality, and then you can allow and encourage your children to own theirs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAgain, thank You. Now, getting away from the considera-tion of children and moving back to the larger subject of human sexuality, I have to ask You one more question. And it may seem impertinent and it may seem flippant even, but I can’t let this dialogue end without asking it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, stop apologizing and just ask it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFine. Is there such a thing as “too much” sex?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo. Of course not. But there is such a thing as too much of a need for sex.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI suggest this:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEnjoy everything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNeed nothing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIncluding people?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIncluding people. Especially people.
