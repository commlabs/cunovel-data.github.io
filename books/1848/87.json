There was rosemary and thyme, but no raisins, or ginger paris, nor canel, oregano, or cloves to speak of. And I didn\u0027t see a nut in the place, except one poor, wizened chestnut! Nuts are such wonderful compliments to delicate sauces and delicious desserts—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mention of \"delicate sauces and delicious desserts,\" Aunt Elinor suddenly became the focus of undivided masculine attention. Only Arik remained disinterested, ostensibly preferring the joint of cold goose he was eating to rich sauces and desserts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" Royce invited her, his speculative gaze riveted on her with rapt fascination. \"What sorts of things would you have prepared—assuming you had the necessary ingredients, of course?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, let me think,\" she said, her forehead furrowed in a little frown. \"It\u0027s been decades since I presided over the kitchens in my own lovely castle, but—oh yes—there were baked meat pies with crusts so light and lovely they melted in the mouth; and—take for example that hen you are eating,\" she said to Sir Godfrey, warming to her new position of culinary expert. \"Instead of being cooked on a spit and served dried out and tough as canvas, which it is, it could have been simmered in half broth, half wine, with cloves, mace, fennel, and pepper, then laid upon a trencher so the juices made the bread ever so tasty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s so much one can do with fruits like apples, pears, and quince, but I\u0027d need honey and almond and dates for the glazes and, canel, too, but as I said, there\u0027s little to be found of any of that in the kitchens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce eyed her intently, his cold goose forgotten. \"Would you be able to find the things you need here at Claymore or perhaps at the village market?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much of it, one would suppose,\" Aunt Elinor promptly replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In that case,\" Royce said in the tone of one issuing a royal edict, \"the kitchens are now in your hands, and we will all look forward to excellent meals in future.\" Glancing toward Sir Albert Prisham, who was nearing the table, Royce arose and informed him, \"I\u0027ve just put the kitchens in the charge of Lady Elinor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thin steward\u0027s face was carefully blank, and he bowed politely, but the hand on the white cane clenched into a fist as he replied, \"As I said, food is of little importance to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it ought to be exceedingly important to you, Sir Albert,\" Lady Elinor informed him authoritatively, \"for you\u0027ve been eating all the wrong things. Turnips, fatty foods, and hard cheeses ought never to be eaten by those with gout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face hardened. \"I do not have gout, madam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will!\" Aunt Elinor predicted gaily as she, too, arose, all eagerness to begin foraging about in the gardens and woods for her ingredients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring her, Sir Albert said to his lord, \"If you are ready to begin our tour of the estate, we can leave at once.\" And when Royce nodded, he added coolly, \"I trust you will not find my stewardship lacking anywhere other than the kitchens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce gave him an odd, sharp look, then he smiled at Jennifer and pressed a polite kiss to her cheek, but in her ear he whispered, \"I suggest you have a long nap, for I intend to keep you awake all night again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny felt the warm flush stealing up her cheeks as Arik arose, obviously intending to remain at Royce\u0027s side during the inspection of the estate. Royce stopped him. \"Accompany Lady Elinor on her expeditions,\" he said, and then in an odd, meaningful voice he added, \"and see that nothing untoward happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArik\u0027s face froze at this flat command to play escort to an elderly lady. He stalked off, positively radiating resentment and offended dignity, while Lady Elinor trotted excitedly at his heels. \"We shall have a lovely time, dear boy,\" she said enthusiastically, \"although this project will take several days, not merely one, for we\u0027re sorely in need of ingredients for my medicinals and ointments, as well as spices for food. I shall require clove to comfort the sinews, and mace, of course! Mace prevents colic, you know, as well as body fluxes and laxes—and then there\u0027s nutmegs, which are very beneficial for the cold and a bad spleen. And I shall take special care of your diet in particular, for you aren\u0027t well, you know. You\u0027ve a melancholy disposition—I noticed that at once…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Eustace glanced around at the other knights, grinning wickedly. \"Lionel,\" he called loudly enough to be heard by the departing giant, \"would you say our Arik looks \u0027melancholy\u0027 just now? Or would \u0027piqued\u0027 be a better word?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Lionel paused in his chewing and studied Arik\u0027s rigid broad back, his eyes gleaming with amusement as he replied after a moment\u0027s thoughtful consideration, \"Arik is vexed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Godfrey leaned back to have a look for himself. \"Aggrieved,\" he concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colicky,\" Stefan Westmoreland added with a grin. In shared camaraderie, the men looked to Jennifer, inviting her to join in their fun, but she was spared the need to refuse because at that moment, Arik turned and blasted a dark look at his cohorts which could have pulverized rock and would easily have terrified most men. Unfortunately, it had the opposite effect on the knights, who returned his look and then burst into shouts of laughter, their mirth bouncing off the walls and echoing to the timbers, following Arik out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly young Gawin, who\u0027d arrived just in time to see Arik and Lady Elinor depart, spoke up in Arik\u0027s behalf. Glowering at the others as he seated himself at the table, he said, \" \u0027Tis no fit job for a knight—squiring an old woman about while she picks herbs and gathers nuts. \u0027Tis a job for a lady\u0027s maid, not a knight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLionel gave the boy a good-natured cuff. \" \u0027Tis thinking like that which leaves you forever in Lady Anne\u0027s bad graces, my boy. Were you to squire her about while she picks flowers, you\u0027d get further with the lady than you do by bristling up and trying to impress her with your manly glower—as you did last night.\" Turning to Jennifer, Sir Lionel said, \"This halfling prefers glowering to gallantry. He thinks it\u0027s more manly, you see. And while he glowers, Roderick dances pretty attendance upon Lady Anne and wins the fair maiden\u0027s heart. Would you care to enlighten him with a lady\u0027s point of view?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensitive to Gawin\u0027s youthful embarrassment, Jenny said, \"I cannot speak for Lady Anne, but I, for one, did not see anything to turn a lady\u0027s head in the person of Sir Roderick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGratitude flashed in Gawin\u0027s eyes before he turned a smug glance upon his fellows and then dug into his somewhat tasteless fare. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-87.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:11 PM"}
