The hospital welcomed Carlisle back with eager arms, not even bothering to conceal their delight that Esme had found life in L.A. so little to her liking. Thanks to the Calculus test I\u0027d missed while abroad, Alice and Edward were in better to shape to graduate than I was at the moment. Suddenly, college was a priority (college was still plan B, on the off chance that Edward\u0027s offer swayed me from the post-graduation Carlisle option). Many deadlines had passed me by, but Edward had a new stack of applications for me to fill out every day. He\u0027d already done the Harvard route, so it didn\u0027t bother him that, thanks to my procrastination, we might both end up at Peninsula Community College next year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie was not happy with me, or speaking to Edward. But at least Edward was allowed��during my designated visiting hours��inside the house again. I just wasn\u0027t allowed out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchool and work were the only exceptions, and the dreary, dull yellow walls of my classrooms had become oddly inviting to me of late. That had a lot to do with the person who sat in the desk beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward had resumed his schedule from the beginning of the year, which put him in most of my classes again. My behavior had been such last fall, after the Cullens\u0027 supposed move to L.A., that the seat beside me had never been filled. Even Mike, always eager to take any advantage, had kept a safe distance. With Edward back in place, it was almost as if the last eight months were just a disturbing nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost, but not quite. There was the house arrest situation, for one thing. And for another, before the fall, I hadn\u0027t been best friends with Jacob Black. So, of course, I hadn\u0027t missed him then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t at liberty to go to La Push, and Jacob wasn\u0027t coming to see me. He wouldn\u0027t even answer my phone calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made these calls mostly at night, after Edward had been kicked out��promptly at nine by a grimly gleeful Charlie��and before Edward snuck back through my window when Charlie was asleep. I chose that time to make my fruitless calls because I\u0027d noticed that Edward made a certain face every time I mentioned Jacob\u0027s name. Sort of disapproving and wary�� maybe even angry. I guessed that he had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esome reciprocal prejudice against the werewolves, though he wasn\u0027t as vocal as Jacob had been about the \"bloodsuckers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I didn\u0027t mention Jacob much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Edward near me, it was hard to think about unhappy things��even my former besi fnend, who was probably very unhappy right now, due to me. When I did think of Jake, I always felt guilty for not thinking of him more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fairy tale was back on. Prince returned, bad spell broken. I wasn\u0027t sure exactly what to do about the leftover, unresolved character. Where was his happily ever after?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeeks passed, and Jacob still wouldn\u0027t answer my calls. It started to become a constant worry. Like a dripping faucet in the back of my head that I couldn\u0027t shut off or ignore. Drip, drip, drip. Jacob, Jacob, Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, though I didn\u0027t mention Jacob much, sometimes my frustration and anxiety boiled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just plain rude!\" I vented one Saturday afternoon when Edward picked me up from work. Being angry about things was easier than feeling guilty. \"Downright insulting!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d varied my pattern, in hopes of a different response. I\u0027d called Jake from work this time, only to get an unhelpfulBilly.Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy said he didn\u0027t want to talk to me,\" I fumed, glaring at the rain oozing down the passenger window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That he was there, and wouldn\u0027t walk three steps to get to the phone! Usually Billy just says he\u0027s out or busy or sleeping or something. I mean, it\u0027s not like I didn\u0027t know he was lying to me, but at least it was a polite way to handle it. I guess Billy hates me now, too. It\u0027s not fair!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not you, Bella,\" Edward said quietly. \"Nobody hates you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feels that way,\" I muttered, folding my arms across my chest. It was no more than a stubborn gesture. There was no hole there now��I could barely remember the empty feeling anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob knows we\u0027re back, and I\u0027m sure that he\u0027s ascertained that I\u0027m with you,\" Edward said. \"He won\u0027t come anywhere near me. The enmity is rooted too deeply.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s stupid. He knows you\u0027re not�� like other vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s still good reason to keep a safe distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared blindly out the windshield, seeing only Jacob\u0027s face, set in the bitter mask I hated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, we are what we are,\" Edward said quietly. \"I can control myself, but I doubt he can. He\u0027s very young. It would most likely turn into a fight, and I don\u0027t know if I could stop it before I k��\" he broke off, and then quickly continued. \"Before I hurt him. You would be unhappy. I don\u0027t want that to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered what Jacob had said in the kitchen, hearing the words with perfect recall in his husky voice. I\u0027m not sure that I\u0027m even-tempered enough to handle that�� You probably wouldn\u0027t like it so much if I killed your friend. But he\u0027d been able to handle it, that time��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward Cullen,\" I whispered. \"Were you about to say \u0027killed him? Were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked away from me, staring into the rain. In front of us, the red light I hadn\u0027t noticed turned green\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand he started forward again, driving very slowly. Not his usual way of driving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would try�� very hard�� not to do that,\" Edward finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him with my mouth hanging open, but he continued to look straight ahead. We were paused at the corner stop sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, I remembered what had happened to Paris when Romeo came back. The stage directions were simple: They fight. Paris falls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was ridiculous. Impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said, and took a deep breath, shaking my head to dispel the words in my head. \"Nothing like that is ever going to happen, so there\u0027s no reason to worry about it. And you know Charlie\u0027s staring at the clock right now. You\u0027d better get me home before I get in more trouble for being late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned my face up toward him, to smile halfheartedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time I looked at his face, that impossibly perfect face, my heart pounded strong and healthy and very there in my chest. This time, the pounding raced ahead of its usual besotted pace. I recognized the expression on his statue-still face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re already in more trouble, Bella,\" he whispered through unmoving lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid closer, clutching his arm as I followed his gaze to see what he was seeing. I don\u0027t know what I expected��maybe Victoria standing in the middle of the street, her flaming red hair blowing in the wind, or a line of tall black cloaks�� or a pack of angry werewolves. But I didn\u0027t see anything at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath. \"Charlie��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad?\" I screeched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at me then, and his expression was calm enough to ease some of my panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie�� is probably not going to kill you, but he\u0027s thinking about it,\" he told me. He started to drive forward again, down my street, but he passed the house and parked by the edge of the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did I do?\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward glanced back at Charlie\u0027s house. I followed his gaze, and noticed for the first time what was parked in the driveway next to the cruiser. Shiny, bright red, impossible to miss. My motorcycle, flaunting itself in the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward had said that Charlie was ready to kill me, so he must know that��that it was mine. There was only one person who could be behind this treachery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I gasped. \"Why? Why would Jacob do this to me?\" The sting of betrayal washed through me. I had trusted Jacob implicitly��trusted him with every single secret I had. He was supposed to be my safe harbor��the person I could always rely on. Of course things were strained right now, but I didn\u0027t think any of the underlying foundation had changed. I didn\u0027t think that was changeable!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had I done to deserve this? Charlie was going to be so mad��and worse than that, he was going to be hurt and worried. Didn\u0027t he have enough to deal with already? I would have never imagined that Jake\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould be so petty and just plain mean. Tears sprang, smarting, into my eyes, but they were not tears of sadness. I had been betrayed. I was suddenly so angry that my head throbbed like it was going to explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he still here?\" I hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He\u0027s waiting for us there.\" Edward told me, nodding toward the slender path that divided the dark fringe of the forest in two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped out of the car, launching myself toward the trees with my hands already balled into fists for the first punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did Edward have to be so much faster than me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught me around the waist before I made the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go! I\u0027m going to murder him! Traitor!\" I shouted the epithet toward the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie will hear you,\" Edward warned me. \"And once he gets you inside, he may brick over the doorway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at the house instinctively, and it seemed like the glossy red bike was all I could see. I was seeing red. My head throbbed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just give me one round with Jacob, and then I\u0027ll deal with Charlie.\" I struggled futilely to break free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob Black wants to see me. That\u0027s why he\u0027s still here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped me cold��took the fight right out of me. My hands went limp. They fight; Paris falls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was furious, but not that furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More or less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much more?\" My voice shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward smoothed my hair back from my face. \"Don\u0027t worry, he\u0027s not here to fight me. He\u0027s acting as�� spokesperson for the pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward looked at the house again, then tightened his arm around my waist and pulled me toward the woods. \"We should hurry. Charlie\u0027s getting impatient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t have to go far; Jacob waited just a short ways up the path. He lounged against a mossy tree trunk as he waited, his face hard and bitter, exactly the way I knew it would be. He looked at me, and then at Edward. Jacob\u0027s mouth stretched into a humorless sneer, and he shrugged away from the tree. He stood on the balls of his bare feet, leaning slightly forward, with his trembling hands clenched into fists. He looked bigger than the last time I\u0027d seen him. Somehow, impossibly, he was still growing. He would tower over Edward, if they stood next to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Edward stopped as soon as we saw him, leaving a wide space between us and Jacob. Edward turned his body, shifting me so that I was behind him. I leaned around him to stare at Jacob��to accuse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim with my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have thought that seeing his resentful, cynical expression would only make me angrier. Instead, it reminded me of the last time I\u0027d seen him, with tears in his eyes. My fury weakened, faltered, as I stared at Jacob. It had been so long since I\u0027d seen him��I hated that our reunion had to be like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" Jacob said as a greeting, nodding once toward me without looking away from Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I whispered, trying to hide the sound of the lump in my throat. \"How could you do this to me, Jacob?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sneer vanished, but his face stayed hard and rigid. \"It\u0027s for the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that supposed to mean? Do you want Charlie to strangle me? Or did you want him to have a heart attack, like Harry? No matter how mad you are at me, how could you do this to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob winced, and his eyebrows pulled together, but he didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t want to hurt anyone��he just wanted to get you grounded, so that you wouldn\u0027t be allowed to spend time with me,\" Edward murmured, explaining the thoughts Jacob wouldn\u0027t say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s eyes sparked with hate as he glowered at Edward again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, Jake!\" I groaned. \"I\u0027m already grounded! Why do you think I haven\u0027t been down to La Push to kick your butt for avoiding my phone calls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s eyes flashed back to me, confused for the first time. \"That\u0027s why?\" he asked, and then locked his jaw, like he was sorry he\u0027d said anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thought I wouldn\u0027t let you, not Charlie,\" Edward explained again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that,\" Jacob snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob shuddered once, and then gritted his teeth as hard as his fists. \"Bella wasn\u0027t exaggerating about your�� abilities,\" he said through his teeth. \"So you must already know why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Edward agreed in a soft voice. \"But, before you begin, I need to say something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob waited, clenching and unclenching his hands as he tried to control the shivers rolling down his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Edward said, and his voice throbbed with the depth of his sincerity. \"I will never be able to tell you how grateful I am. I will owe you for the rest of my�� existence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob stared at him blankly, his shudders stilled by surprise. He exchanged a quick glance with me, but my face was just as mystified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For keeping Bella alive,\" Edward clarified, his voice rough and fervent. \"When I�� didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward��,\" I started to say, but he held one hand up, his eyes on Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding washed over Jacob\u0027s face before the hard mask returned. \"I didn\u0027t do it for your benefit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But that doesn\u0027t erase the gratitude I feel. I thought you should know. If there\u0027s ever anything in my power to do for you��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob raised one black brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward shook his head. \"That\u0027s not in my power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose, then?\" Jacob growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward looked down at me. \"Hers. I\u0027m a quick learner, Jacob Black, and I don\u0027t make the same mistake twice. I\u0027m here until she orders me away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was immersed momentarily in his golden gaze. It wasn\u0027t hard to understand what I\u0027d missed in the conversation. The only thing that Jacob would want from Edward would be his absence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never,\" I whispered, still locked in Edward\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob made a gagging sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unwillingly broke free from Edward\u0027s gaze to frown at Jacob. \"Was there something else you needed, Jacob? You wanted me in trouble��mission Accomplished. Charlie might just send me to military school. But that won\u0027t keep me away from Edward. There\u0027s nothing that can do that. What more do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob kept his eyes on Edward \"I just needed to remind your bloodsucking friends of a few key points in the treaty they agreed to. The treaty chat is the only thing stopping me from ripping his throat out right this minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t forgotten,\" Edward said at the same time that I demanded, \"What key points?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob still glowered at Edward, but he answered me. \"The treaty is quite specific. If any of them bite a human, the truce is over. Bite, not kill,\" he emphasized. Finally, he looked at me. His eyes were cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took me a second to grasp the distinction, and then my face was as cold as his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s none of your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell it��\" was all he managed to choke out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t expect my hasty words to bring on such a strong response. Despite the warning he\u0027d come to give, he must not have known. He must have thought the warning was just a precaution. He hadn\u0027t realized��or didn\u0027t want to believe��that I had already made my choice. That I was really intending to become a member of the Cullen family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy answer sent Jacob into near convulsions. He pressed his fists hard against his temples, closing his eyes tight and curling in on himself as he tried to control the spasms. His face turned sallow green under the russet skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake? You okay?\" I asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a half-step toward him, then Edward caught me and yanked me back behind his own body. \"Careful! He\u0027s not under control,\" he warned me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jacob was already somewhat himself again; only his arms were shaking now. He scowled at Edward with pure hate. \"Ugh. I would never hurt her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Edward or I missed the inflection, or the accusation it contained. A low hiss escaped Edward\u0027s lips. Jacob clenched his fists reflexively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"BELLA!\" Charlie\u0027s roar echoed from the direction of the house. \"YOU GET IN THIS HOUSE THIS INSTANT!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of us froze, listening to the silence that followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was the first to speak; my voice trembled. \"Crap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s furious expression faltered. \"I am sorry about that,\" he muttered. \"I had to do what I could��I had to try��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" The tremor in my voice ruined the sarcasm. I stared up the path, half-expecting Charlie to come barreling through the wet ferns like an enraged bull. I would be the red flag in that scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just one more thing,\" Edward said to me, and then he looked at Jacob. \"We\u0027ve found no trace of Victoria on our side of the line��have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew the answer as soon as Jacob thought it, but Jacob spoke the answer anyway. \"Trie last time was while Bella was�� away. We let her think she was slipping through��we were tightening the circle, getting ready to ambush her��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIce shot down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then she took off like a bat out of hell. Near as we can tell, she caught your little female\u0027s scent and bailed. She hasn\u0027t come near our lands since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward nodded. \"When she comes back, she\u0027s not your problem anymore. We\u0027ll��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She killed on our turf,\" Jacob hissed. \"She\u0027s ours!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No��,\" I began to protest both declarations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"BELLA! I SEE HIS CAR AND I KNOW YOU\u0027RE OUT THERE! IF YOU AREN\u0027T INSIDE THIS HOUSE IN ONE MINUTE�� !\" Charlie didn\u0027t bother to finish his threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Edward said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at Jacob, torn. Would I see him again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he whispered so low that I had to read his lips to understand. \u0027\"Bye, Bells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promised,\" I reminded him desperately. \"Still friends, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob shook his head slowly, and the lump in my throat nearly strangled me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how hard I\u0027ve tried to keep that promise, but�� I can\u0027t see how to keep trying. Not now��\" He struggled to keep his hard mask in place, but it wavered, and then disappeared. \"Miss you,\" he mouthed. One of his hands reached toward me, his fingers outstretched, like he wished they were long enough to cross the distance between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too,\" I choked out. My hand reached toward his across the wide space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike we were connected, the echo of his pain twisted inside me. His pain, my pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake��\" I took a step toward him. I wanted to wrap my arms around his waist and erase the expression of misery on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward pulled me back again, his arms restraining instead of defending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" I promised him, looking up to read his face with trust in my eyes. He would understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were unreadable, his face expressionless. Cold. \"No, it\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her go,\" Jacob snarled, furious again. \"She wants to!\" He took two long strides forward. A glint of anticipation flashed in his eyes. His chest seemed to swell as it shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward pushed me behind himself, wheeling to face Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Edward��!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ISABELLA SWAN!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on! Charlie\u0027s mad!\" My voice was panicked, but not because of Charlie now. \"Hurry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged on him and he relaxed a little. He pulled me back slowly, always keeping his eyes on Jacob as we retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob watched us with a dark scowl on his bitter face. The anticipation drained from his eyes, and then, just before the forest came between us, his face suddenly crumpled in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that last glimpse of his face would haunt me until I saw him smile again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right there I vowed that I would see him smile, and soon. I would find a way to keep my friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward kept his arm tight around my waist, holding me close. That was the only thing that held the tears inside my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had some serious problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy best friend counted me with his enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictoria was still on the loose, putting everyone I loved in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I didn\u0027t become a vampire soon, the Volturi would kill me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now it seemed that if I did, the Quileute werewolves would try to do the job themselves��along with trying to kill my future family. I didn\u0027t think they had any chance really, but would my best friend get himself killed in the attempt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery serious problems. So why did they all suddenly seem insignificant when we broke through the last of the trees and I caught sight of the expression on Charlie\u0027s purple face?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward squeezed me gently. \"I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew in a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was true. Edward was here, with his arms around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could face anything as long as that was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squared my shoulders and walked forward to meet my fate, with my destiny solidly at my side. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-26.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
