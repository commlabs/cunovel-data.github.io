{"id":66210,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\u003cp\u003eRoss nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Following delivery of the blow to the head, she\u0027s lifted up and placed on the bed. At this time, she\u0027s not bleeding much. No blood to speak of on the dressing table or rug. But now her killer picks up some instrument and stabs her in the stomach several times. You\u0027ll notice that the deepest wounds are all in the lower abdomen, which may have some sexual connotations for the killer. But that\u0027s just guessing on our part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss nodded but said nothing. She had decided the coroner\u0027s man was a creep; she wasn\u0027t going to tell him more than she had to. She moved closer to the body to examine the stab wounds. They were all small, puncture-like in appearance, with a good deal of skin tearing around the wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You find a weapon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" the doctor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think it was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. Nothing very sharp, but something strong - it took a lot of force to penetrate this way with a relatively blunt instrument.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another argument that it\u0027s a man,\" Anders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027d guess it was something metal, like a blunt letter opener, or a metal ruler, or a screwdriver. Something like that. But what\u0027s really interesting,\" the doctor went on, \"is this phenomenon here.\" He pointed to the girl\u0027s left arm, which was outstretched on the bed and mutilated badly by stab wounds. \"You see, he stabbed her in the stomach, and then stabbed her arm, moving out in a regular way, a succession of stabbings. Now, notice: when he\u0027s past the arm, he continues to stab. You can see the tears in the sheet and blanket. They continue out in a straight line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" the doctor said, \"in my book that\u0027s perseveration. Automatic continuation of pointless movement. Like he was some kind of machine that just kept going and going...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct,\" Ross said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We assume,\" the doctor said, \"that it represents some kind of trance state. But we don\u0027t know if it was organic or functional, natural or artificially induced. Since the girl let him into the apartment freely, this trance-like state developed only later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss realized that the coroner\u0027s man was showing off, and it irritated her. This was the wrong time to be playing Sherlock Holmes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnders handed her the metal dog tag. \"We were proceeding routinely with the investigation,\" he said, \"when we found this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss turned the tag over in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI HAVE AN IMPLANTED ATOMIC PACEMAKER. DIRECT PHYSICAL INJURY OR FIRE MAY RUPTURE THE CAPSULE AND RELEASE TOXIC MATERIALS. IN THE EVENT OF INJURY OR DEATH CALL NPS, (213) 652-1134.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was when we called you,\" Anders said. He watched her carefully. \"We\u0027ve leveled with you,\" he said. \"Now it\u0027s your turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name is Harry Benson,\" she said. \"He\u0027s thirty-four and he has psychomotor epilepsy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor snapped his fingers. \"I\u0027ll be damned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s psychomotor epilepsy?\" Anders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, a plainclothesman came in from the living room. \"We got a trace on the prints,\" he said. \"They\u0027re listed in the Defense data banks, of all places. This guy had classified clearance from 1968 to the present. His name\u0027s Harry Benson, lives in L.A.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clearance for what?\" Anders said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Computer work, probably,\" Ross said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" the plainclothesman said. \"Last three years, classified computer research.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnders was making notes. \"They have a blood type on him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Type AO is what\u0027s listed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss turned to the doctor. \"What do you have on the girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name\u0027s Doris Blankfurt, stage name Angela Black. Twenty-six years old, been in the building six weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does she do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dancer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnders said, \"Does that have some special meaning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a thing about dancers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s attracted to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Attracted and repelled,\" she said. \"It\u0027s rather complicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her curiously. Did he think she was putting him on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he has some kind of epilepsy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Psychomotor epilepsy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnders made notes. \"I\u0027m going to need some explanations,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a description, pictures- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can get you all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" -as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. All her earlier impulses to resist the police, to refuse to cooperate with them, had vanished. She kept staring at the girl\u0027s caved-in head. She could imagine the suddenness, the viciousness of the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at her watch. \"It\u0027s seven-thirty now,\" she said. \"I\u0027m going back to the hospital, but I\u0027m stopping at home to clean up and change. You can meet me there or at the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll meet you there,\" Anders said. \"I\u0027ll be finished here in about twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said, and gave him the address.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shower felt good, the hot water like stinging needles against her bare skin. She relaxed, breathed the steam, and closed her eyes. She had always liked showers, even though she knew it was the masculine pattern. Men took showers, women took baths. Dr. Ramos had mentioned that once. She thought it was bullshit. Patterns were made to be broken. She was an individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she\u0027d discovered that showers were used to treat schizophrenics. They were sometimes calmed by alternating hot and cold spray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now you think you\u0027re schizophrenic?\" Dr. Ramos had said, and laughed heartily. He didn\u0027t often laugh. Sometimes she tried to make him laugh, usually without success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned off the shower and climbed out, pulling a towel around her. She wiped the steam off the bathroom mirror and stared at her reflection. \"You look like hell,\" she said, and nodded. Her reflection nodded back. The shower had washed away her eye make-up, the only make-up she wore. Her eyes seemed small now, and weak with fatigue. What time was her hour with Dr. Ramos today? Was it today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat day was it, anyway? It took her a moment to remember that it was Friday. She hadn\u0027t slept for at least twenty-four hours, and she was having all the sleepless symptoms she\u0027d remembered as an intern. An acid gnawing in her stomach. A dull ache in her body. A kind of slow confusion of the mind. It was a terrible way to feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew how it would progress. In another four or five hours, she would begin to daydream about sleeping. She would imagine a bed, and the softness of the mattress as she lay on it. She would begin to dwell on the wonderful sensations that would accompany falling asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped they found Benson before long. The mirror had steamed over again. She opened the bathroom door to let cool air in, and wiped a clean space with her hand again. She was starting to apply fresh make-up when she heard the doorbell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be Anders. She had left the front door unlocked. \"It\u0027s open,\" she shouted, and then returned to her make-up. She did one eye, then paused before the second. \"If you want coffee, just boil water in the kitchen,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did her other eye, pulled the towel tighter around her, and leaned out toward the hallway. \"Find everything you need?\" she called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry Benson was standing in the hallway. \"Good morning, Dr. Ross,\" he said. His voice was pleasant. \"I hope I haven\u0027t come at an inconvenient time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was odd how frightened she felt. He held out his hand and she shook it, hardly conscious of the action. She was preoccupied with her own fear. Why was she afraid? She knew this man well; she had been alone with him many times before, and had never been afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surprise was part of it, the shock of finding him here. And the unprofessional setting: she was acutely aware of the towel, her still-damp bare legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me a minute,\" she said, \"and I\u0027ll get some clothes on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded politely and went back to the living room. She closed the bedroom door and sat down on the bed. She was breathing hard, as if she had run a great distance. Anxiety, she thought, but the label didn\u0027t really help. She remembered a patient who had finally shouted at her in frustration,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me I\u0027m depressed. I feel terrible!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the closet and pulled on a dress, hardly noticing which one it was. Then she went back into the bathroom to check her appearance. Stalling, she thought. This is not the time to stall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath and went outside to talk with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was standing in the middle of the living room, looking uncomfortable and confused. She saw the room freshly, through his eyes: a modern, sterile, hostile apartment. Modern furniture, black leather and chrome, hard lines; modern paintings on the walls; modern, glistening, machinelike, efficient, a totally hostile environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never would have thought this of you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not threatened by the same things, Harry.\" She kept her voice light. \"Do you want some coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was neatly dressed, in a jacket and tie, but his wig, the black wig, threw her off. Also his eyes: they were tired, distant - the eyes of a man near the breaking point of fatigue. She remembered how the rats had collapsed from excessive pleasurable stimulation. Eventually they lay spread-eagled on the floor of the cage, panting, too weak to crawl forward and press the shock lever one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you alone here?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small bruise on his left cheek, just below the eye. She looked at his bandages. They just barely showed, a bit of white between the bottom of his wig and the top of his collar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem tense.\" His voice sounded genuinely concerned. Probably he\u0027d just had a stimulation. She remembered how he had become sexually interested in her after the test stimulations, just before he was interfaced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No... I\u0027m not tense.\" She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a very nice smile,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at his clothes, looking for blood. The girl had been soaked; Benson must have been covered with blood, yet there was none on his clothes. Perhaps he\u0027d dressed after taking a second shower. After killing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she said, \"I\u0027m going to have some coffee.\" She went into the kitchen with a kind of relief. It was somehow easier to breathe in the kitchen, away from him. She put the kettle on the burner, turned on the gas, and stayed there a moment. She had to get control of herself. She had to get control of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe odd thing was that while she had been shocked to see him suddenly in her apartment, she was not really surprised that he had come. Some psychomotor epileptics feared their own violence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why hadn\u0027t he returned to the hospital?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went out to the living room. Benson was standing by the large windows, looking out over the city, which stretched away for miles in every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you angry with me?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angry? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I ran away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you run away, Harry?\" As she spoke, she felt her strength coming back, her control. She could handle this man. It was her job. She\u0027d been alone with men more dangerous than this. She remembered a six-month period at Cameron State Hospital, where she had worked with psychopaths and multiple murderers - charming, engaging, chilling men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Because.\" He smiled, and sat down in a chair. He wriggled around in it, then stood up, sitting down again on the sofa. \"All your furniture is so uncomfortable. How can you live in such an uncomfortable place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s uncomfortable.\" He stared at her, a faint challenge in the look. She wished again that they were not meeting here. This environment was too threatening, and Benson reacted to threats with attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find me, Harry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re surprised I knew where you lived?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was careful,\" he said. \"Before I went into the hospital, I found out where you lived, where Ellis lived, where McPherson lived. I found out where everybody lived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you expecting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t reply. Instead, he got up and walked to the windows, looked out over the city. \"They\u0027re searching for me out there,\" he said. \"Aren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they\u0027ll never find me. The city is too big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the kitchen, her kettle began to whistle. She excused herself and went in to make coffee. Her eyes scanned the counter, searching for something heavy. Perhaps she could hit him over the head. Ellis would never forgive her, but-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a picture on your wall,\" Benson called. \"A lot of numbers. Who did that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man named Johns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would a man draw numbers? Numbers are for machines.\" She stirred the instant coffee, poured in milk, went back out and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean it. And look at this. What is this supposed to mean?\" He tapped another picture with his knuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry, come and sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her for a moment, then came over and sat on the couch opposite her. He seemed tense, but a moment later smiled in a relaxed way. For an instant, his pupils dilated. Another stimulation, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was she going to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry,\" she said, \"what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he said, still relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You left the hospital...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I left the hospital wearing one of those white suits. I figured it all out. Angela picked me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then we went to my house. I was quite tense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why were you tense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you see, I know how this is all going to end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t sure what he was referring to. \"How is it going to end?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after we left my house, we went to her apartment, and we had some drinks, and we made love, and then I told her how it was going to end. That was when she got scared. She wanted to call the hospital, to tell them where I was...\" He stared off into space, momentarily confused. She didn\u0027t want to press the point. He had had a seizure and he would not remember killing the girl. His amnesia would be total and genuine. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-terminal-man/page-17.html","bookId":1705,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
