You no longer interest me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good, can I go now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’ Karos rose, tapping the sceptre onto one shoulder. ‘And I, alas, must needs escort you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good help is hard to keep alive these days.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stand up, Tehol Beddict.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man had some difficulty following that instruction, but the Invigilator waited, having learned to be patient with such things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Tehol fully straightened, however, a look of astonishment lit his features. ‘Why, it’s a two-headed insect! Going round and round!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To the door now,’ Karos said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s the challenge?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is pointless-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh now, really, Invigilator. You claim to be smarter than me, and I’m about to die-1 like puzzles. I design them, in fact. Very difficult puzzles.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You are lying. I know all the designers and you do not number among them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, all right. I designed just one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Too bad, then, you will be unable to offer it to me, for my momentary pleasure, since you are now returning to your cell.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s all right,’ Tehol replied. ‘It was more of a joke than a puzzle, anyway.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad grimaced, then waved Tehol towards the door with the sceptre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he slowly shuffled over, Tehol said, ‘I figured out the challenge, anyway. It’s to make the bug stop going round and round.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Invigilator blocked him with the sceptre. ‘I told you, there is no solution.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think there is. I think I know it, in fact. Tell you what, sir. I solve that puzzle there on your desk and you postpone my Drowning. Say, by forty years or so.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Agreed. Because you cannot.’ He watched Tehol Beddict walk like an old man over to the desk. Then lean over. ‘You cannot touch the insect!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course,’ Tehol replied. And leaned yet farther over, lowering his face towards the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad hurried forward to stand beside him. ‘Do not touch!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I won’t.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The tiles can be rearranged, but I assure you-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No need to rearrange the tiles.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad found his heart pounding hard in his chest. ‘You are wasting more of my time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, I’m putting an end to your wasting your time, sir.’ He paused, cocked his head. ‘Probably a mistake. Oh well.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd lowered his face down directly over the box, then gusted a sharp breath against one of the tiles. Momentarily clouding it. And the insect, with one of its heads facing that suddenly opaque, suddenly non-reflective surface, simply stopped. Reached up a leg and scratched its abdomen. As the mist cleared on the tile, it scratched once more, then resumed its circling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTehol straightened. ‘I’m free! Free!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad could not speak for ten, fifteen heartbeats. His chest was suddenly tight, sweat beading on his skin, then he said in a rasp, ‘Don’t be a fool.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You lied? Oh, I can’t believe how you lied to me! Well then, piss on you and your pissy stupid puzzle, too!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Invigilator’s sceptre swept in an arc, intersecting with that box on the desk, shattering it, sending its wreckage flying across the room. The insect struck a wall and stayed there, then it began climbing towards the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Run!’ whispered Tehol Beddict. ‘Run!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sceptre swung next into Tehol’s chest, snapping ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pull the chain tighter on my ankles,’ Janath said. ‘Force my legs wider.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You enjoy being helpless, don’t you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes. Yes!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, Tanal Yathvanar knelt at the side of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chain beneath ran through holes in the bed frame at each corner. Pins held the lengths in place. To tighten the ones snaring her ankles all he needed to do was pull a pin on each side at the foot of the bed, drawing the chain down as far as he could, and, as he listened to her moans, replace the pins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he rose and sat down on the edge of the bed. Stared down at her. Naked, most of the bruises fading since he no longer liked hurting her. A beautiful body indeed, getting thinner which he preferred in his women. He reached out, then drew his hand away again. He didn’t like any touching until he was ready. She moaned a second time, arching her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanal Yathvanar undressed. Then he crawled up onto the bed, loomed over her with his knees between her legs, his hands pressing down on the mattress to either side of her chest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-436.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
