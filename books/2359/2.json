{"id":68073,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003ePhiladelphia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;8:OO A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy Whitney stepped out of the lobby of her apartment building into a gray, sleety rain that fell impartially on sleek limousines driven down Market Street by uniformed chauffeurs, and on the abandoned and boarded-up houses huddled together in the slums of North Philadelphia. The rain washed the limousines clean and made sodden messes of the garbage piled high in front of the neglected row houses. Tracy Whitney was on her way to work. Her pace was brisk as she walked east on Chestnut Street toward the bank, and it was all she could do to keep from singing aloud. She wore a bright-yellow raincoat, boots, and a yellow rain hat that barely contained a mass of shining chestnut hair. She was in her mid-twenties, with a lively, intelligent face, a full, sensuous mouth, sparkling eyes that could change from a soft moss green to a dark jade in moments, and a trim, athletic figure. Her skin ran the gamut from a translucent white to a deep rose, depending on whether she was angry, tired, or excited. Her mother had once told her, \"Honestly, child, sometimes I don\u0027t recognize you. You\u0027ve got all the colors of the wind in you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, as Tracy walked down the street, people turned to smile, envying the happiness that shone on her face. She smiled back at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s indecent for anyone to be this happy, Tracy Whitney thought. I\u0027m marrying the man I love, and I\u0027m going to have his baby. What more could anyone ask?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Tracy approached the bank, she glanced at her watch. Eight-twenty. The doors of the Philadelphia Trust and Fidelity Bank would not be open to employees for another ten minutes, but Clarence Desmond, the bank\u0027s senior vice-president in charge of the international department, was already turning off the outside alarm and opening the door. Tracy enjoyed watching the morning ritual. She stood in the rain, waiting, as Desmond entered the bank and locked the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanks the world over have arcane safety procedures, and the Philadelphia Trust and Fidelity Bank was no exception. The routine never varied, except for the security signal, which was changed every week. The signal that week was a half-lowered venetian blind, indicating to the employees waiting outside that a search was in progress to make certain that no intruders were concealed on the premises, waiting to hold the employees hostage. Clarence Desmond was checking the lavatories, storeroom, vault, and safe-deposit area. Only when he was fully satisfied that he was alone would the venetian blind be raised as a sign that all was well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe senior bookkeeper was always the first of the employees to be admitted. He would take his place next to the emergency alarm until all the other employees were inside, then lock the door behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePromptly at 8:30, Tracy Whitney entered the ornate lobby with her fellow workers, took off her raincoat, hat, and boots, and listened with secret amusement to the others complaining about the rainy weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The damned wind carried away my umbrella,\" a teller complained. \"I\u0027m soaked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I passed two ducks swimming down Market Street,\" the head cashier joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The weatherman says we can expect another week of this. I wish I was in Florida.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy smiled and went to work. She was in charge of the cable-transfer department. Until recently, the transfer of money from one bank to another and from one country to another had been a slow, laborious process, requiring multiple forms to be filled out and dependent on national and international postal services. With the advent of computers, the situation had changed dramatically, and enormous amounts of money could be transferred instantaneously. It was Tracy\u0027s job to extract overnight transfers from the computer and to make computer transfers to other banks. All transactions were in code, changed regularly to prevent unauthorized access. Each day, millions of electronic dollars passed through Tracy\u0027s hands. It was fascinating work, the lifeblood that fed the arteries of business all over the globe, and until Charles Stanhope III had come into Tracy\u0027s life, banking had been the most exciting thing in the world for her. The Philadelphia Trust and Fidelity Bank had a large international division, and at lunch Tracy and her fellow workers would discuss each morning\u0027s activities. It was heady conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah, the head bookkeeper, announced, \"We just closed the hundred-million-dollar syndicated loan to Turkey....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMae Trenton, secretary to the vice-president of the bank, said in a confidential tone, \"At the board meeting this morning they decided to join the new money facility to Peru. The up-front fee is aver five million dollars....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJon Creighton, the bank bigot, added, \"I understand we\u0027re going in on the Mexican rescue package for fifty million. Those wetbacks don\u0027t deserve a damned cent....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s interesting,\" Tracy said thoughtfully, \"that the countries that attack America for being too money-oriented are always the first to beg us for loans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the subject on which she and Charles had had their first argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy had met Charles Stanhope III at a financial symposium where Charles was the guest speaker. He ran the investment house founded by his great-grandfather, and his company did a good deal of business with the bank Tracy worked for. After Charles\u0027s lecture, Tracy had gone up to disagree with his analysis of the ability of third-world nations to repay the staggering sums of money they had borrowed from commercial banks worldwide and western governments. Charles at first had been amused, then intrigued by the impassioned arguments of the beautiful young woman before him. Their discussion had continued through dinner at the old Bookbinder\u0027s restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the beginning, Tracy had not been impressed with Charles Stanhope III, even though she was aware that he was considered Philadelphia\u0027s prize catch. Charles was thirty-five and a rich and successful member of one of the oldest families in Philadelphia. Five feet ten inches, with thinning sandy hair, brown eyes, and an earnest, pedantic manner, he was, Tracy thought, one of the boring rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though reading her mind, Charles had leaned across the table and said, \"My father is convinced they gave him the wrong baby at the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a throwback. I don\u0027t happen to think money is the end-all and be-all of life. But please don\u0027t ever tell my father I said so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was such a charming unpretentiousness about him that Tracy found herself warming to him. I wonder what it would be like to be married to someone tike him\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;one of the establishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had taken Tracy\u0027s father most of his life to build up a business that the Stanhopes would have sneered at as insignificant. The Stanhopes and the Whitneys would never mix, Tracy thought. Oil and water. And the Stanhopes are the oil. And what am I going on about like an idiot? Talk about ego. A man asks me out to dinner and I\u0027m deciding whether I want to marry him. We\u0027ll probably never even see each other again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles was saying, \"I hope you\u0027re free for dinner tomorrow...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhiladelphia was a dazzling cornucopia of things to see and do. On Saturday nights Tracy and Charles went to the ballet or watched Riccardo Muti conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra. During the week they explored NewMarket and the unique collection of shops in Society Hill. They ate cheese steaks at a sidewalk table at Geno\u0027s and dined at the Caf�� Royal, one of the most exclusive restaurants in Philadelphia. They shopped at Head House Square and wandered through the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Rodin Museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy paused in front of the statue of The Thinker. She glanced at Charles and grinned. \"It\u0027s you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles was not interested in exercise, but Tracy enjoyed it, so on Sunday mornings she jogged along the West River Drive or on the promenade skirting the Schuylkill River. She joined a Saturday afternoon t\u0027ai chi ch\u0027uan class, and after an hour\u0027s workout, exhausted but exhilarated, she would meet Charles at his apartment. He was a gourmet cook, and he liked preparing esoteric dishes such as Moroccan bistilla and guo bu li, the dumplings of northern China, and tahine de poulet au citron for Tracy and himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles was the most punctilious person Tracy had ever known. She had once been fifteen minutes late for a dinner appointment with him, and his- displeasure had spoiled the evening for her. After that, she had vowed to be on time for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy had had little sexual experience, but it seemed to her that Charles made love the same way he lived his life: meticulously and very properly. Once, Tracy had decided to be daring and unconventional in bed, and had so shocked Charles that she began secretly to wonder if she were some kind of sex maniac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pregnancy had been unexpected, and when it happened, Tracy was filled with uncertainty. Charles had not brought up the subject of marriage, and she did not want him to feel he had to marry her because of the baby. She was not certain whether she could go through with an abortion, but the alternative was an equally painful choice. Could she raise a child without the help of its father, and would it be fair to the baby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to break the news to Charles after dinner one evening. She had prepared a cassoulet for him in her apartment, and in her nervousness she had burned it. As she set the scorched meat and beans in front of him, she forgot her carefully rehearsed speech and wildly blurted out, \"I\u0027m so sorry, Charles. I\u0027m\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an unbearably long silence, and as Tracy was about to break it, Charles said, \"We\u0027ll get married, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy was filled with a sense of enormous relief. \"I don\u0027t want you to think I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You don\u0027t have to marry me, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised a hand to stop her. \"I want to marry you, Tracy. You\u0027ll make a wonderful wife.\" He added, slowly, \"Of course, my mother and father will be a bit surprised.\" And he smiled and kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy quietly asked, \"Why will they be surprised?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles sighed. \"Darling, I\u0027m afraid you don\u0027t quite realize what you\u0027re letting yourself in for. The Stanhopes always marry\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;mind you, I\u0027m using quotation marks\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0027their own kind.\u0027 Mainline Philadelphia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027ve already selected your wife,\" Tracy guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles took her in his arms. \"That doesn\u0027t matter a damn. It\u0027s whom I\u0027ve selected that counts. We\u0027ll have dinner with Mother and Father next Friday. It\u0027s time you met them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt five minutes to 9:00 Tracy became aware of a difference in the noise level in the bank. The employees were beginning to speak a little faster, move a little quicker. The bank doors would open in five minutes and everything had to be in readiness. Through the front window, Tracy could see customers lined up on the sidewalk outside, waiting in the cold rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy watched as the bank guard finished distributing fresh blank deposit and withdrawal slips into the metal trays on the six tables lined up along the center aisle of the bank. Regular customers were issued deposit slips with a personal magnetized code at the bottom so that each time a deposit was made, the computer automatically credited it to the proper account. But often customers came in without their deposit slips and would fill out blank ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard glanced up at the clock on the wall, and as the hour hand moved to 9:00, he walked over to the door and ceremoniously unlocked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe banking day had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next few hours Tracy was too busy at the computer to think about anything else. Every wire transfer had to be double-checked to make sure it had the correct code. When an account was to be debited, she entered the account number, the amount, and the bank to which the money was to be transferred. Each bank had its own code number, the numbers listed in a confidential directory that contained the codes for every major bank in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning flew by swiftly. Tracy was planning to use her lunchtime to have her hair done and had made an appointment with Larry Stella Botte. He was expensive, but it would be worth it, for she wanted Charles\u0027s parents to see her at her best. I\u0027ve got to make them like me. I don\u0027t care whom they chose for him, Tracy thought. No one can make Charles as happy as I will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 1:00, as Tracy was getting into her raincoat, Clarence Desmond summoned her to his office. Desmond was the image of an important executive. If the bank had used television commercials, he would have been the perfect spokesman. Dressed conservatively, with an air of solid, old-fashioned authority about him, he looked like a person one could trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Tracy,\" he said. He prided himself on knowing every employee\u0027s first name. \"Nasty outside, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, well. People still have to do their banking.\" Desmond had used up his small talk. He leaned across his desk. \"I understand that you and Charles Stanhope are engaged to be married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy was surprised. \"We haven\u0027t even announced it yet. How\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesmond smiled. \"Anything the Stanhopes do is news. I\u0027m very happy for you. I assume you\u0027ll be returning here to work with us. After the honeymoon, of course. We wouldn\u0027t want to lose you. You\u0027re one of our most valuable employees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charles and I talked it over, and we agreed I\u0027d be happier if I worked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesmond smiled, satisfied. Stanhope and Sons was one of the most important investment houses in the financial community, and it would be a nice plum if he could get their exclusive account for his branch. He leaned back in his chair. \"When you return from your honeymoon, Tracy, there\u0027s going to be a nice promotion for you, along with a substantial raise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, thank you! That\u0027s wonderful.\" She knew she had earned it, and she felt a thrill of pride. She could hardly wait to tell Charles. It seemed to Tracy that the gods were conspiring to do everything they could to overwhelm her with happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Charles Stanhope Seniors lived in an impressive old mansion in Rittenhouse Square. It was a city landmark that Tracy had passed often. And now, she thought, it\u0027s going to be a part of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was nervous. Her beautiful hairdo had succumbed to the dampness in the air. She had changed dresses four times. Should she dress simply? Formally? She had one Yves Saint Laurent she had scrimped to buy at Wanamaker\u0027s. If I wear it, they\u0027ll think I\u0027m extravagant. On the other hand, if l dress in one of my sale things from Post Horn, they\u0027ll think their son is marrying beneath him. Oh, hell, they\u0027re going to think that anyway, Tracy decided. She finally settled on a simple gray wool skirt and a white silk blouse and fastened around her neck the slender gold chain her mother had sent her for Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the mansion was opened by a liveried butler. \"Good evening, Miss Whitney.\" The butler knows my name. Is that a good sign? A bad sign? \"May I take your coat?\" She was dripping on their expensive Persian rug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led her through a marble hallway that seemed twice as large as the bank. Tracy thought, panicky, Oh, my God. I\u0027m dressed all wrong! ! should have worn the Yves Saint Laurent. As she turned into the library, she felt a run start at the ankle of her pantyhose, and she was face-to-face with Charles\u0027s parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles Stanhope, Sr., was a stern-looking man in his middle sixties. He looked like a successful man; he was the projection of what his son would be like in thirty years. He had brown eyes, like Charles\u0027s, a firm chin, a fringe of white hair, and Tracy loved him instantly. He was the perfect grandfather for their child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles\u0027s mother was impressive looking. She was rather short and heavy-set, but despite that, there was a regal air about her. She looks solid and dependable, Tracy thought. She\u0027ll make a wonderful grandmother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Stanhope held out her hand. \"My dear, so good of you to join us. We\u0027ve asked Charles to give us a few minutes alone with you. You don\u0027t mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she doesn\u0027t mind,\" Charles\u0027s father declared. \"Sit down... Tracy, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them seated themselves on a couch facing her. Why do I feel as though I\u0027m about to undergo an inquisition? Tracy could hear her mother\u0027s voice: Baby, God will never throw anything at you that you can\u0027t handle. Just take it one step at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy\u0027s first step was a weak smile that came out all wrong, because at that instant she could feel the run in her hose slither up to her knee. She tried to conceal it with her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So!\" Mr. Stanhope\u0027s voice was hearty. \"You and Charles want to get married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word want disturbed Tracy. Surely Charles had told them they were going to be married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Tracy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Charles really haven\u0027t known each other long, have you?\" Mrs. Stanhope asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy fought back her resentment. I was right. It is going to be an inquisition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long enough to know that we love each other, Mrs. Stanhope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love?\" Mr. Stanhope murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Stanhope said, \"To be quite blunt, Miss Whitney, Charles\u0027s news came as something of a shock to his father and me.\" She smiled forebearingly. \"Of course, Charles has told you about Charlotte?\" She saw the expression on Tracy\u0027s face. \"I see. Well., he and Charlotte grew up together. They were always very close, and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;well, frankly, everyone expected them to announce their engagement this year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not necessary for her to describe Charlotte. Tracy could have drawn a picture of her. Lived next door. Rich, with the same social background as Charles. All the best schools. Loved horses and won cups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us about your family,\" Mr. Stanhope suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy God, this is a scene from a late-night movie, Tracy thought wildly. I\u0027m the Rita Hayworth character, meeting Cary Grant\u0027s parents for the first time. I need a drink. In the old movies the butler always came to the rescue with a tray of drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where were you born, my dear?\" Mrs. Stanhope asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Louisiana. My father was a mechanic.\" There had been no need to add that, but Tracy was unable to resist. To hell with them. She was proud of her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mechanic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He started a small manufacturing plant in New Orleans and built it up into a fairly large company in its field. When father died five years ago, my mother took over the business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does this\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;er\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;company manufacture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exhaust pipes and other\u0027automotive parts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. and Mrs. Stanhope exchanged a look and said in unison, \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir tone made Tracy tense up. I wonder how long it\u0027s going to take me to love them? she asked herself. She looked into the two unsympathetic faces across from her, and to her horror began babbling inanely. \"You\u0027ll really like my mother. She\u0027s beautiful, and intelligent, and charming. She\u0027s from the South. She\u0027s very small, of course, about your height, Mrs. Stanhope\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \" Tracy\u0027s words trailed off, weighted down by the oppressive silence. She gave a silly little laugh that died away under Mrs. Stanhope\u0027s stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Mr. Stanhope who said without expression, \"Charles informs us you\u0027re pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, how Tracy wished he had not! Their attitude was so nakedly disapproving. It was as though their son had had nothing to do with what had happened. They made her feel it was a stigma. Now I know what I should have worn, Tracy thought. A scarlet letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand how in this day and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \" Mrs. Stanhope began, but she never finished the sentence, because at that moment Charles came into the room. Tracy had never been so glad to see anyone in her entire life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Charles beamed. \"How are you all getting along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy rose and hurried into his arms. \"Fine, darling.\" She held him close to her, thinking, Thank goodness Charles isn\u0027t like his parents. He could never be like them. They\u0027re narrow-minded and snobbish and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a discreet cough behind them, and the butler stood there with a tray of drinks. It\u0027s going to be all right, Tracy told herself. This movie\u0027s going to have a happy ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dinner was excellent, but Tracy was too nervous to cat. They discussed banking and politics and the distressing state of the world, and it was all very impersonal and polite. No one actually said aloud, \"You trapped our son into marriage.\" In all fairness, Tracy thought, they have every right to be concerned about the woman their son marries. One day Charles will own the firm, and it\u0027s important that he have the right wife. And Tracy promised herself, He will have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles gently took her hand which had been twisting the napkin under the table and smiled and gave a small wink. Tracy\u0027s heart soared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tracy and I prefer a small wedding,\" Charles said, \"and afterward\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" Mrs. Stanhope interrupted. \"Our family does not have small weddings, Charles. There will be dozens of friends who will want to see you married.\" She looked over at Tracy, evaluating her figure. \"Perhaps we should see that the wedding invitations are sent out at once.\" And as an afterthought, \"That is, if that\u0027s acceptable to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes, of course.\" There was going to be a wedding. Why did I even doubt it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Stanhope said, \"Some of the guests will be coming from abroad. I\u0027ll make arrangements for them to stay here at the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Stanhope asked, \"Have you decided where you\u0027re going on your honeymoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles smiled. \"That\u0027s privileged information, Father.\" He gave Tracy\u0027s hand a squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long a honeymoon are you planning?\" Mrs. Stanhope inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About fifty years,\" Charles replied. And Tracy adored him for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner they moved into the library for brandy, and Tracy looked around at the lovely old oak-paneled room with its shelves of leather-bound volumes, the two Corots, a small Copley, and a Reynolds. It would not have mattered to her if Charles had no money at all, but she admitted to herself that this was going to be a very pleasant way to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost midnight when Charles drove her back to her small apartment off Fairmount Park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope the evening wasn\u0027t too difficult for you, Tracy. Mother and Father can be a bit stiff sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, they were lovely.\" Tracy lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was exhausted from the tension of the evening, but when they reached the door of her apartment, she asked, \"Are you going to come in, Charles?\" She needed to have him hold her in his arms. She wanted him to say, \"I love you, darling. No one in this world will ever keep us apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Afraid not tonight. I\u0027ve got a heavy morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy concealed her disappointment. \"Of course. I understand, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll talk to you tomorrow.\" He gave her a brief kiss, and she watched him disappear down the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe apartment was ablaze and the insistent sound of loud fire bells crashed abruptly through the silence. Tracy jerked upright in her bed, groggy with sleep, sniffing for smoke in the darkened room. The ringing continued, and she slowly became aware that it was the telephone. The bedside clock read 2:30 A.M. Her first panicky thought was that something had happened to Charles. She snatched up the phone. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA distant male voice asked, \"Tracy Whitney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. If this was an obscene phone call... \"Who is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Lieutenant Miller of the New Orleans Police Department. Is this Tracy Whitney?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Her heart began to pound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I have bad news for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand clenched around the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about your mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;has Mother been in some kind of accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s dead, Miss Whitney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" It was a scream. This was an obscene phone call. Some crank trying to frighten her. There was nothing wrong with her mother. Her mother was alive. I love you very, very much, Tracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate to break it to you this way,\" the voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was real. It was a nightmare, but it was happening. She could not speak. Her mind and her tongue were frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lieutenant\u0027s voice was saying, \"Hello...? Miss Whitney? Hello...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be on the first plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat in the tiny kitchen of her apartment thinking about her mother. It was impossible that she was dead. She had always been so vibrant, so alive. They had had such a close and loving relationship. From the time Tracy was a small girl, she had been able to go to her mother with her problems, to discuss school and boys and, later, men. When Tracy\u0027s father had died, many overtures had been made by people who wanted to buy the business. They had offered Doris Whitney enough money so that she could have lived well for the rest of her life, but she had stubbornly refused to sell. \"Your father built up this business. I can\u0027t throw away all his hard work.\" And she had kept the business flourishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Mother, Tracy thought. I love you so much. You\u0027ll never meet Charles, and you\u0027ll never see your grandchild, and she began to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a cup of coffee and let it grow cold while she sat in the dark. Tracy wanted desperately to call Charles and tell him what had happened, to have him at her side. She looked at the kitchen clock. It was 3:30 A.M. She did not want to awaken him; she would telephone him from New Orleans. She wondered whether this would affect their wedding plans, and instantly felt guilty at the thought. How could she even think of herself at a time like this? Lieutenant Miller had said, \"When you get here, grab a cab and come to police headquarters.\" Why police headquarters? Why? What had happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in the crowded New Orleans airport waiting for her suitcase, surrounded by pushing, impatient travelers, Tracy felt suffocated. She tried to move close to the baggage carousel, but no one would let her through. She was becoming increasingly nervous, dreading what she would have to face in a little while. She kept trying to tell herself that it was all some kind of mistake, but the words kept reverberating in her head: I\u0027m afraid I have bad news for you.... She\u0027s dead, Miss Whitney.... I hate to break it to you this way....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tracy finally retrieved her suitcase, she got into a taxi and repeated the address the lieutenant had given her: \"Seven fifteen South Broad Street, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver grinned at her in the rearview mirror. \"Fuzzville, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo conversation. Not now. Tracy\u0027s mind was too filled with turmoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe taxi headed east toward the Lake Ponchartrain Causeway. The driver chattered on. \"Come here for the big show, miss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea what he was talking about, but she thought, No. I came here for death. She was aware of the drone of the driver\u0027s voice, but she did not hear the words. She sat stiffly an her seat, oblivious to the familiar surroundings that sped past. It was only as they approached the French Quarter that Tracy became conscious of the growing noise. It was the sound of a mob gone mad, rioters yelling some ancient berserk litany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Far as I can take you,\" the driver informed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Tracy looked up and saw it. It was an incredible sight. There were hundreds of thousands of shouting people, wearing masks, disguised as dragons and giant alligators and pagan gods, filling the streets and sidewalks ahead with a wild cacophony of sound. It was an insane explosion of bodies and music and floats and dancing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better get out before they turn my cab over,\" the driver said. \"Damned Mardi Gras.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course. It was February, the time when the whole city celebrated the beginning of Lent. Tracy got out of the cab and stood at the curb, suitcase in hand, and the next moment she was swept up in the screaming, dancing crowd. It was obscene, a black witches\u0027 sabbath, a million Furies celebrating the death of her mother. Tracy\u0027s suitcase was torn from her hand and disappeared. She was grabbed by a fat man in a devil\u0027s mask and kissed. A deer squeezed her breasts, and a giant panda grabbed her from behind and lifted her up. She struggled free and tried to run, but it was impossible. She was hemmed in, trapped, a part of the singing, dancing celebration. She moved with the chanting mob, tears streaming down her face. There was no escape. When she was finally able to break away and flee to a quiet street, she was near hysteria. She stood still for a long time, leaning against a lamppost, taking deep breaths, slowly regaining control of herself. She headed for the police station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Miller was a middle-aged, harassed-looking man with a weather-beaten face, who seemed genuinely uncomfortable in his role. \"Sorry I couldn\u0027t meet you at the airport,\" he told Tracy, \"but the whole town\u0027s gone nuts. We went through your mother\u0027s things, and you\u0027re the only one we could find to call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Lieutenant, tell me what\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;what happened to my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She committed suicide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold chill went through her. \"That\u0027s\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;that\u0027s impossible! Why would she kill herself? She had everything to live for.\" Her voice was ragged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She left a note addressed to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morgue was cold and indifferent and terrifying. Tracy was led down a long white corridor into a large, sterile, empty room, and suddenly she realized that the room was not empty. It was filled with the dead. Her dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA white-coated attendant strolled over to a wall, reached for a handle, and pulled out an oversized drawer. \"Wanna take a look?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! I don\u0027t want to see the empty, lifeless body lying in that box. She wanted to get out of this place. She wanted to go back a few hours in time when the fire belt was ringing. Let it be a real fire alarm, not the telephone, not my mother dead. Tracy moved forward slowly, each step a screaming inside her. Then she was staring down at the lifeless remains of the body that had borne her, nourished her, laughed with her, loved her. She bent over and kissed her mother on the cheek. The cheek was cold and rubbery. \"Oh, Mother,\" Tracy whispered. \"Why? Why did you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We gotta perform an autopsy,\" the attendant was saying. \"It\u0027s the state law with suicides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe note Doris Whitney left offered no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy darling Tracy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease forgive me. I failed, and I couldn\u0027t stand being a burden on you. This is the best way. I love you so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more. The district attorney served your mother notice that he was going to ask for an indictment against her for fraud, that she was facing a prison sentence. That was the day she really died, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy was seething with a wave of helpless anger. \"But all she had to do was tell them the truth\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;explain what that man did to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old foreman shook his head. \"Joe Romano works for a man named Anthony Orsatti. Orsatti runs New Orleans. I found out too late that Romano\u0027s done this before with other companies. Even if your mother had taken him to court, it would have been years before it was all untangled, and she didn\u0027t have the money to fight him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t she tell me?\" It was a cry of anguish, a cry for her mother\u0027s anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother was a proud woman. And what could you do? There\u0027s nothing anyone can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re wrong, Tracy thought fiercely. \"I want to see Joe Romano. Where can I find him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchmidt said flatly, \"Forget about him. You have no idea how powerful he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where does he live, Otto?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has an estate near Jackson Square, but it won\u0027t help to go there, Tracy, believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy did not answer. She was filled with an emotion totally unfamiliar to her: hatred. Joe Romano is going to pay for killing my mother, Tracy swore to herself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-tomorrow-comes/page-2.html","bookId":2359,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:06 AM"}
