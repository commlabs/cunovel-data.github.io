{"id":64026,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003e6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shock of hearing Haymitch\u0027s voice yesterday, of learning that he was not only functional but had some measure of control over my life again, enraged me. I left the studio directly and refused to acknowledge his comments from the booth today. Even so, I knew immediately he was right about my performance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took the whole of this morning for him to convince the others of my limitations. That I can\u0027t pull it off. I can\u0027t stand in a television studio wearing a costume and makeup in a cloud of fake smoke and rally the districts to victory. It\u0027s amazing, really, how long I have survived the cameras. The credit for that, of course, goes to Peeta. Alone, I can\u0027t be the Mockingjay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe gather around the huge table in Command. Coin and her people. Plutarch, Fulvia, and my prep team. A group from 12 that includes Haymitch and Gale, but also a few others I can\u0027t explain, like Leevy and Greasy Sae. At the last minute, Finnick wheels Beetee in, accompanied by Dalton, the cattle expert from 10. I suppose that Coin has assembled this strange assortment of people as witnesses to my failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it\u0027s Haymitch who welcomes everyone, and by his words I understand that they have come at his personal invitation. This is the first time we\u0027ve been in a room together since I clawed him. I avoid looking at him directly, but I catch a glimpse of his reflection in one of the shiny control consoles along the wall. He looks slightly yellow and has lost a lot of weight, giving him a shrunken appearance. For a second, I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s dying. I have to remind myself that I don\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing Haymitch does is to show the footage we\u0027ve just shot. I seem to have reached some new low under Plutarch and Fulvia\u0027s guidance. Both my voice and body have a jerky, disjointed quality, like a puppet being manipulated by unseen forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Haymitch says when it\u0027s over. \"Would anyone like to argue that this is of use to us in winning the war?\" No one does. \"That saves time. So, let\u0027s all be quiet for a minute. I want everyone to think of one incident where Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you. Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle, or her dress went up in flames or she made a halfway decent shot with an arrow. Not where Peeta was making you like her. I want to hear one moment whereshe made you feel something real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuiet stretches out and I\u0027m beginning to think it will never end, when Leevy speaks up. \"When she volunteered to take Prim\u0027s place at the reaping. Because I\u0027m sure she thought she was going to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Excellent example,\" says Haymitch. He takes a purple marker and writes on a notepad. \"Volunteered for sister at reaping.\" Haymitch looks around the table. \"Somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m surprised that the next speaker is Boggs, who I think of as a muscular robot that does Coin\u0027s bidding. \"When she sang the song. While the little girl died.\" Somewhere in my head an image surfaces of Boggs with a young boy perched up on his hip. In the dining hall, I think. Maybe he\u0027s not a robot after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who didn\u0027t get choked up at that, right?\" says Haymitch, writing it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cried when she drugged Peeta so she could go get him medicine and when she kissed him good-bye!\" blurts out Octavia. Then she covers her mouth, like she\u0027s sure this was a bad mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Haymitch only nods. \"Oh, yeah. Drugs Peeta to save his life. Very nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moments begin to come thick and fast and in no particular order. When I took Rue on as an ally.Extended my hand to Chaff on interview night. Tried to carry Mags. And again and again when I held out those berries that meant different things to different people. Love for Peeta. Refusal to give in under impossible odds. Defiance of the Capitol\u0027s inhumanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaymitch holds up the notepad. \"So, the question is, what do all of these have in common?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were Katniss\u0027s,\" says Gale quietly. \"No one told her what to do or say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unscripted, yes!\" says Beetee. He reaches over and pats my hand. \"So we should just leave you alone, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople laugh. I even smile a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s all very nice but not very helpful,\" says Fulvia peevishly. \"Unfortunately, her opportunities for being wonderful are rather limited here in Thirteen. So unless you\u0027re suggesting we toss her into the middle of combat - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027sexactly what I\u0027m suggesting,\" says Haymitch. \"Put her out in the field and just keep the cameras rolling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But people think she\u0027s pregnant,\" Gale points out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll spread the word that she lost the baby from the electrical shock in the arena,\" Plutarch replies. \"Very sad. Very unfortunate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of sending me into combat is controversial. But Haymitch has a pretty tight case. If I perform well only in real-life circumstances, then into them I should go. \"Every time we coach her or give her lines, the best we can hope for is okay. It has to come from her. That\u0027s what people are responding to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if we\u0027re careful, we can\u0027t guarantee her safety,\" says Boggs. \"She\u0027ll be a target for every - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go,\" I break in. \"I\u0027m no help to the rebels here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you\u0027re killed?\" asks Coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make sure you get some footage. You can use that, anyway,\" I answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" says Coin. \"But let\u0027s take it one step at a time. Find the least dangerous situation that can evoke some spontaneity in you.\" She walks around Command, studying the illuminated district maps that show the ongoing troop positions in the war. \"Take her into Eight this afternoon. There was heavy bombing this morning, but the raid seems to have run its course. I want her armed with a squad of bodyguards. Camera crew on the ground. Haymitch, you\u0027ll be airborne and in contact with her. Let\u0027s see what happens there. Does anyone have any other comments?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wash her face,\" says Dalton. Everyone turns to him. \"She\u0027s still a girl and you made her look thirty-five. Feels wrong. Like something the Capitol would do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Coin adjourns the meeting, Haymitch asks her if he can speak to me privately. The others leave except for Gale, who lingers uncertainly by my side. \"What are you worried about?\" Haymitch asks him. \"I\u0027m the one who needs the bodyguard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" I tell Gale, and he goes. Then there\u0027s just the hum of the instruments, the purr of the ventilation system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaymitch takes the seat across from me. \"We\u0027re going to have to work together again. So, go ahead. Just say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of the snarling, cruel exchange back on the hovercraft. The bitterness that followed. But all I say is \"I can\u0027t believe you didn\u0027t rescue Peeta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he replies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a sense of incompleteness. And not because he hasn\u0027t apologized. But because we were a team. We had a deal to keep Peeta safe. A drunken, unrealistic deal made in the dark of night, but a deal just the same. And in my heart of hearts, I know we both failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you say it,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you let him out of your sight that night,\" says Haymitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. That\u0027s it. \"I play it over and over in my head. What I could have done to keep him by my side without breaking the alliance. But nothing comes to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t have a choice. And even if I could\u0027ve made Plutarch stay and rescue him that night, the whole hovercraft would\u0027ve gone down. We barely got out as it was.\" I finally meet Haymitch\u0027s eyes. Seam eyes. Gray and deep and ringed with the circles of sleepless nights. \"He\u0027s not dead yet, Katniss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re still in the game.\" I try to say this with optimism, but my voice cracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still in. And I\u0027m still your mentor.\" Haymitch points his marker at me. \"When you\u0027re on the ground, remember I\u0027m airborne. I\u0027ll have the better view, so do what I tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see,\" I answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI return to the Remake Room and watch the streaks of makeup disappear down the drain as I scrub my face clean. The person in the mirror looks ragged, with her uneven skin and tired eyes, but she looks like me. I rip the armband off, revealing the ugly scar from the tracker. There. That looks like me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I\u0027ll be in a combat zone, Beetee helps me with armor Cinna designed. A helmet of some interwoven metal that fits close to my head. The material\u0027s supple, like fabric, and can be drawn back like a hood in case I don\u0027t want it up full-time. A vest to reinforce the protection over my vital organs. A small white earpiece that attaches to my collar by a wire. Beetee secures a mask to my belt that I don\u0027t have to wear unless there\u0027s a gas attack. \"If you see anyone dropping for reasons you can\u0027t explain, put it on immediately,\" he says. Finally, he straps a sheath divided into three cylinders of arrows to my back. \"Just remember: Right side, fire. Left side, explosive. Center, regular. You shouldn\u0027t need them, but better safe than sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoggs shows up to escort me down to the Airborne Division. Just as the elevator arrives, Finnick appears in a state of agitation. \"Katniss, they won\u0027t let me go! I told them I\u0027m fine, but they won\u0027t even let me ride in the hovercraft!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take in Finnick - his bare legs showing between his hospital gown and slippers, his tangle of hair, the half-knotted rope twisted around his fingers, the wild look in his eyes - and know any plea on my part will be useless. Even I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea to bring him. So I smack my hand on my forehead and say, \"Oh, I forgot. It\u0027s this stupid concussion. I was supposed to tell you to report to Beetee in Special Weaponry. He\u0027s designed a new trident for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the word trident, it\u0027s as if the old Finnick surfaces. \"Really? What\u0027s it do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But if it\u0027s anything like my bow and arrows, you\u0027re going to love it,\" I say. \"You\u0027ll need to train with it, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Of course. I guess I better get down there,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finnick?\" I say. \"Maybe some pants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks down at his legs as if noticing his outfit for the first time. Then he whips off his hospital gown, leaving him in just his underwear. \"Why? Do you find this\" - he strikes a ridiculously provocative pose - \"distracting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help laughing because it\u0027s funny, and it\u0027s extra funny because it makes Boggs look so uncomfortable, and I\u0027m happy because Finnick actually sounds like the guy I met at the Quarter Quell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m only human, Odair.\" I get in before the elevator doors close. \"Sorry,\" I say to Boggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be. I thought you...handled that well,\" he says. \"Better than my having to arrest him, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say. I sneak a sidelong glance at him. He\u0027s probably in his mid-forties, with close-cropped gray hair and blue eyes. Incredible posture. He\u0027s spoken out twice today in ways that make me think he would rather be friends than enemies. Maybe I should give him a chance. But he just seems so in step with Coin....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a series of loud clicks. The elevator comes to a slight pause and then begins to move laterally to the left. \"It goes sideways?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. There\u0027s a whole network of elevator paths under Thirteen,\" he answers. \"This one lies just above the transport spoke to the fifth airlift platform. It\u0027s taking us to the Hangar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hangar. The dungeons. Special Defense. Somewhere food is grown. Power generated. Air and water purified. \"Thirteen is even larger than I thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t take credit for much of it,\" says Boggs. \"We basically inherited the place. It\u0027s been all we can do to keep it running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clicks resume. We drop down again briefly - just a couple of levels - and the doors open on the Hangar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I let out involuntarily at the sight of the fleet. Row after row of different kinds of hovercraft. \"Did you inherit these, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some we manufactured. Some were part of the Capitol\u0027s air force. They\u0027ve been updated, of course,\" says Boggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel that twinge of hatred against 13 again. \"So, you had all this, and you left the rest of the districts defenseless against the Capitol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that simple,\" he shoots back. \"We were in no position to launch a counterattack until recently. We could barely stay alive. After we\u0027d overthrown and executed the Capitol\u0027s people, only a handful of us even knew how to pilot. We could\u0027ve nuked them with missiles, yes. But there\u0027s always the larger question: If we engage in that type of war with the Capitol, would there be any human life left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds like what Peeta said. And you all called him a traitor,\" I counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he called for a cease-fire,\" says Boggs. \"You\u0027ll notice neither side has launched nuclear weapons. We\u0027re working it out the old-fashioned way. Over here, Soldier Everdeen.\" He indicates one of the smaller hovercraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mount the stairs and find it packed with the television crew and equipment. Everyone else is dressed in 13\u0027s dark gray military jumpsuits, even Haymitch, although he seems unhappy about the snugness of his collar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFulvia Cardew hustles over and makes a sound of frustration when she sees my clean face. \"All that work, down the drain. I\u0027m not blaming you, Katniss. It\u0027s just that very few people are born with camera-ready faces. Like him.\" She snags Gale, who\u0027s in a conversation with Plutarch, and spins him toward us. \"Isn\u0027t he handsome?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale does look striking in the uniform, I guess. But the question just embarrasses us both, given our history. I\u0027m trying to think of a witty comeback, when Boggs says brusquely, \"Well, don\u0027t expect us to be too impressed. We just saw Finnick Odair in his underwear.\" I decide to go ahead and like Boggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a warning of the upcoming takeoff and I strap myself into a seat next to Gale, facing off with Haymitch and Plutarch. We glide through a maze of tunnels that opens out onto a platform. Some sort of elevator device lifts the craft slowly up through the levels. All at once we\u0027re outside in a large field surrounded by woods, then we rise off the platform and become wrapped in clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the flurry of activity leading up to this mission is over, I realize I have no idea what I\u0027m facing on this trip to District 8. In fact, I know very little about the actual state of the war. Or what it would take to win it. Or what would happen if we did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlutarch tries to lay it out in simple terms for me. First of all, every district is currently at war with the Capitol except 2, which has always had a favored relationship with our enemies despite its participation in the Hunger Games. They get more food and better living conditions. After the Dark Days and the supposed destruction of 13, District 2 became the Capitol\u0027s new center of defense, although it\u0027s publicly presented as the home of the nation\u0027s stone quarries, in the same way that 13 was known for graphite mining. District 2 not only manufactures weaponry, it trains and even supplies Peacekeepers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean...some of the Peacekeepers are born in Two?\" I ask. \"I thought they all came from the Capitol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlutarch nods. \"That\u0027s what you\u0027re supposed to think. And some do come from the Capitol. But its population could never sustain a force that size. Then there\u0027s the problem of recruiting Capitol-raised citizens for a dull life of deprivation in the districts. A twenty-year commitment to the Peacekeepers, no marriage, no children allowed. Some buy into it for the honor of the thing, others take it on as an alternative to punishment. For instance, join the Peacekeepers and your debts are forgiven. Many people are swamped in debt in the Capitol, but not all of them are fit for military duty. So District Two is where we turn for additional troops. It\u0027s a way for their people to escape poverty and a life in the quarries. They\u0027re raised with a warrior mind-set. You\u0027ve seen how eager their children are to volunteer to be tributes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCato and Clove. Brutus and Enobaria. I\u0027ve seen their eagerness and their bloodlust, too. \"But all the other districts are on our side?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Our goal is to take over the districts one by one, ending with District Two, thus cutting off the Capitol\u0027s supply chain. Then, once it\u0027s weakened, we invade the Capitol itself,\" says Plutarch. \"That will be a whole other type of challenge. But we\u0027ll cross that bridge when we come to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we win, who would be in charge of the government?\" Gale asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone,\" Plutarch tells him. \"We\u0027re going to form a republic where the people of each district and the Capitol can elect their own representatives to be their voice in a centralized government. Don\u0027t look so suspicious; it\u0027s worked before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In books,\" Haymitch mutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In history books,\" says Plutarch. \"And if our ancestors could do it, then we can, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankly, our ancestors don\u0027t seem much to brag about. I mean, look at the state they left us in, with the wars and the broken planet. Clearly, they didn\u0027t care about what would happen to the people who came after them. But this republic idea sounds like an improvement over our current government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if we lose?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we lose?\" Plutarch looks out at the clouds, and an ironic smile twists his lips. \"Then I would expect next year\u0027s Hunger Games to be quite unforgettable. That reminds me.\" He takes a vial from his vest, shakes a few deep violet pills into his hand, and holds them out to us. \"We named themnightlock in your honor, Katniss. The rebels can\u0027t afford for any of us to be captured now. But I promise, it will be completely painless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take hold of a capsule, unsure of where to put it. Plutarch taps a spot on my shoulder at the front of my left sleeve. I examine it and find a tiny pocket that both secures and conceals the pill. Even if my hands were tied, I could lean my head forward and bite it free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinna, it seems, has thought of everything. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mockingjay-the-hunger-games-3/page-6.html","bookId":1687,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:15 AM"}
