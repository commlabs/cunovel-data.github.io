I try to push him back down on the bed but he bites again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes burst open, realizing he shouldn\u0027t be here, “Damn, Leo! When did you get here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab my bow and quiver and look around. He gives me a look. He’s judging me for how soft I’ve grown. He climbed right in the tent without waking me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, “I know, buddy.” I have to remember what we\u0027ve been through, not where we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb out of the tent, keeping low to the ground. I have half a mind to grab Will from his tent too, but I don’t. Leo and me can handle whatever it is that’s picking his wolf ass. He ran a long way to tell me about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot just that, but Will will only add drama and mean stares, or that desperate look he gets that annoys me. Seeing him weak like that does nothing for his cause. I know he\u0027s sorry, but every time I close my eyes, all I see is him kissing my sister, and me strapped to a table in the breeder farms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence of the forest is calming and deceptive to anyone who doesn’t know about the song. But I know the song. I can hear it. A bird in the distance makes the warning noise and the others shoot it along the woods in an echo. One single sharp note. There are no other noises. No squirrels or rabbits or mice. Just the birds passing the message along the forest. If there is trouble it’s always the same, this song or total silence. Either way, it\u0027s bad news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe run along the crest of a hill and down into the valley. I can see the guards aren’t in the trees. I give Leo a look. He whines almost silently and looks towards the bottom of the hill. His eyes are darting; he\u0027s looking for something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take my inhales slow, paced purposefully, to prevent me from gasping. “Shit,” I whisper and look around; it’s me and them and I have a bow. I can’t kill them as fast with a bow as I can with a gun. I’m about to run back up to the camp like a coward, when I remember…I’m immune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost slap my own forehead. I casually walk down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo doesn’t get it. He tries to lead me off. I rub his ear, “It’s okay. You stay here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir hunting party is large. I don’t even understand how it’s possible. Shouldn’t they be dying off by now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, pulling my first arrow and sliding it between my fingers. One of them lifts his head from the ground, where the body they’re eating is laying dead. I can only assume it’s the guard who should be in this quadrant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe infected snarl at me as they lift their heads. I lose my arrow into the brown, matted head of the first one. They jump up, moving faster than I remember them being able to, and come in a mangled group. I down four before they get to me, then I pull my knives from my boots. Their skin makes a disturbing squishing sound with the slicing of the blades. Their dirty, rotten blood fills the air around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne grabs my arm. I cut into him but another knocks me over into the brush. Leo jumps the one on top of me but is flung across the small clearing. I hear him whimper as he lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI panic when I see the green blood splattering. One of them is smothering me and I don’t really believe I’m immune, not totally. I’m pressing my mouth shut tight as the first set of teeth rip into my forearm. My lips come apart fast, tearing a scream across the silent forest. In amongst their high moans, my scream is so different. I feel a hand grab at my other arm as they cover me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggle but a voice pulls me from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Em, it’s okay, baby. I got you,” he whispers into my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears are rolling down my cheeks when I open my eyes. I’m being smothered alright, but it’s by Will and my blankets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my face into his neck and let it out. I don’t want to. I want it to be him, not Will, comforting me. I want his fur to muffle the sobs like always as his paws wrap around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got you, Em. You’re safe,” he strokes my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m covered in sweat and the panic is still so intense, I swear I can feel the greasy, green blood on my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and he just holds me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now that was a bad dream. You woke most of the camp with your screams,” Anna whispers and snickers her squeaky whistle of a laugh. “No more perimeter runs for you before bedtime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel for the greasy blood with my fingertips before I trust licking my lips. I’m cold and shaking, even in the heat of the night air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need Leo. Something is wrong. I have a feeling. Not a good one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie back in my bed and curl around Will. I don’t want it to be him, but it is. I know it will take me a long time to fall back to sleep. I look back at Will as I settle down, “Something is wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes open. He gives me a strange look and nods, “I’ve never seen you have a nightmare like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow, “I need Leo. We might have to make a trek to the cabin. Something is wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses my nose, “Go to sleep. We’ll talk about it tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and pull away from him, “You can stay, but I don’t want you to touch me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t leave. I’m glad he doesn’t, but I’m even more excited that it’s his choice. I don’t need him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and fall back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning he’s gone. It’s light out and I’m alone in the tent. When I leave the tent, I see the eyes of the other people on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar walks up smiling, “Rough night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clench my jaw, “It was a bad dream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, “After everything you’ve been through Emma, a bad dream is expected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced around at the people giving me cautious looks, “Do they still think I’m a monster?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes circled back to her, “And yet, you get off scot-free?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes gleam with something I assume is smugness, “It’s not so free being me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah well, you could try it my way sometime and see how different it is.” I walk away, gripping my quiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend the day keeping busy. I don’t want to see Will or the hateful people of the camp. I want to curl up with a good book or sit by the river with Leo. I don’t think I\u0027ll be able to meet Will\u0027s gaze today, not after being so needy and breaking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk past the group of ladies I saved from the farms. They smile and wave. The numbers are less than I imagined would have stayed. I glance around the camp for the bratty babies, but I don’t see them. Instead, I see the pile of dried meat is getting low. I know fresh meat is a daily thing but the dry meat is part of the stores. It’s the travel food and the stuff we will eat in the winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about to make for the woods when I see Will talking with a man. I decide to take a nap and then hunt after supper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake alone and sweaty in my tent but at least the bad dreams didn’t come. I grab my bow and make my way into the woods alone. Everything I do is alone. For me the camp isn’t much different than being with Leo at the cabin. Doesn’t matter if it\u0027s people or animals, they give me a wide birth. I wish I didn’t care anymore, but it sort of hurts like I don’t belong anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get out into the greenbelt, I miss the fur in my fingers. I love the greenery and the sounds surrounding me, but it isn’t the same without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dreams start to make their way back into my mind. Being in the woods isn’t making the creepy feeling of being consumed by the infected go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focus on the sound of the forest and slow my rapidly-beating heart. The song of the animals is like peace and quiet in its noisy sort of way. The sharp sound of the warning signal is nowhere to be heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forest is still in the way I like. The animals carry on with their day. I wipe some of the sweat from my brow and close my eyes. There is fear inside of me that needs to be stilled. I force myself to be comfortable in the silence and listen for it. When I hear the hoof of something large breaking the branches it stands on, I open my eyes, pull back the arrow, and take my breath. On the exhale, I release and it’s the only sound I focus in on—the sound of the arrow slicing the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like that the forest moves around me. I am one with it, even with a weapon and a dying deer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile crosses my lips, it\u0027s not because an animal is dead but because nature has allowed me to become part of its natural cycle. Like I’m not a threat to it, not like the rest of us. They let me be afraid, not like the people at the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trek down the hill to the dying deer. Her legs twitch but the arrow is perfectly positioned in her side. I pull my knife and stroke my hand along her forehead to her neck. It’s thick and pounding from her panicked heartbeat. I slide the knife across her throat, spilling the last of her life into the duff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” I whisper as she leaves her body. I’m about to gut her when I’m interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can take the meat without gutting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jump up, pulling my next arrow. An older man, with a nice smile and a twinkle in his green eyes, shrugs, “Or you can shoot my old ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has nice teeth but that doesn’t make me trust him. The ones with the nice teeth always fight for their survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrow my gaze, “The forest doesn’t change for you. They sound the same. They didn’t announce you sneaking up on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, “No. They accepted me as one of them a long time ago. Besides, I wasn’t sneaking, I just walk quietly now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt makes me smile. I don’t know why. Maybe because people with nice teeth don’t usually get accepted by the forest. I guess though that I have good teeth. Granny made me brush and floss all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe points at the deer, “You got a good shot on you. Lung/heart shots are hard to do perfectly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You been alone a long time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, “Me too—well, before I stumbled upon the jokers I live with. I just found this camp too. Who knew so many of us were gathering and living together in peace. Now if you wanna take the meat without the nonsense of gutting that deer, I can show you how.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-1.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
