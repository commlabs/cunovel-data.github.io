His head was down and he was wearing a baseball cap low on his forehead. Even before he reached her, she knew it was Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her arm. \"It\u0027s me, Will. Don\u0027t be afraid. I need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tugged her arm free. \"Have you been out here waiting for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I was on my way to your garage. I was going to wait until you came down. Then I saw you on the sidewalk and I . . . Let\u0027s go in the alley and talk.\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe declined and told him they would talk right where they were standing. He looked around. The street was all but deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My attorney told me you got me probation, that you made some kind of deal with the prosecutor? Is that true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was furious. No one was supposed to know about her part in his release. \"How did your attorney find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Is it true?\" he repeated. \"Did you do that for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo reason to deny it now. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded desperate when he asked, \"Can you get me out of this?\" He grabbed her arm again and pleaded. \"You have to get me out of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison inhaled sharply. Not because Will had hold of her arm, but because she glanced over his shoulder and saw Liam walking toward them. He wasn\u0027t wearing a suit jacket, and his hand was on the butt of his gun. He looked as though he wanted to kill someone. Where in God\u0027s name had he come from this time? The street had been empty just seconds ago, and all of a sudden there he was. If she looked away, she half expected him to vanish again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a rush, she whispered, \"Will, do you have any weapons on you? Like a gun or a knife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Why would I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand up as a signal for Liam to stay back, which he completely ignored. When he was just a couple of feet behind Will, he stopped. He was so close she was surprised Will couldn\u0027t feel Liam\u0027s breath on the back of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will, listen to me,\" she said. \"You have to surrender right now. Surrender to me,\" she blurted, and even after she said it, she knew it didn\u0027t make any sense. \"Okay? If you turn yourself in, maybe that will count in court and you won\u0027t have to face a longer sentence. Please. Do the right thing, and I\u0027ll help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill wasn\u0027t listening to reason. \"Maybe I could get to Canada and hide there,\" he said. \"No one would ever-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped him. \"You can\u0027t hide forever. I don\u0027t want to see you in prison for the rest of your life or, worse, gunned down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so naive, Allison,\" he scoffed. \"To you the world is rosy, and people like me can get a fair shake. You think all I have to do is walk up to some cop and surrender and everything will be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to surrender, Will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntagonistic now, he said, \"What happens if I don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the FBI agent behind you is going to slam you up against the building, handcuff you, and take you in. Please. I don\u0027t want you to get hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill\u0027s head snapped around. Liam was standing there with his hand on his gun. Like a caged animal, Will turned in all directions, trying to find an escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t even think about running,\" Liam warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill\u0027s shoulders slouched. Realizing there wasn\u0027t any way out, he gave a long, defeated sigh, as though all the fight that was in him was being expelled at that very moment. His voice sullen now, he said, \"I surrender.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam quickly patted him down to make certain there weren\u0027t any weapons on him while he called the police to come pick him up. Within seconds they heard the sirens approaching from a few blocks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill turned to Allison and started to beg. \"Allison, please, you have to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam wouldn\u0027t let him continue. \"Stop right there. Do you have any idea how much your cousin has done for you? The lengths she has gone to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Will turned once again in her direction, Liam snapped, \"Keep your arms folded in front of you and look only at me.\" Will complied immediately, and Liam continued. \"Now you\u0027re going to do your part. It\u0027s time you take responsibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison watched silently as Liam continued to give Will a piece of his mind, letting him know how furious he was for the way Will had treated her. By the time the police car pulled up and two officers got out, Will was cowering and seemed about to cry. She knew she shouldn\u0027t interfere, but she couldn\u0027t stop herself. She called to the officers, \"Will surrendered to Special Agent Scott, and you can see he\u0027s cooperating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam gave her a look that suggested she not say another word. He didn\u0027t contradict her, though, and she took that as a win. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-94.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
