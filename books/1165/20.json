FROM THE PAST.","content":"\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; “One and one with a shadowy third.” \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You have the air, mon ami, of a malgamiter,” said Mrs. Vansittart, looking into Cornish\u0027s face—“lurking here in your little inn in a back street! Why do you not go to one of the larger hotels in Scheveningen, since you have abandoned The Hague?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Because the larger hotels are not open yet,” replied Cornish, bringing forward a chair.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is true, now that I think of it. But I did not ask the question wanting an answer. You, who have been in the world, should know women better than to think that. I asked in idleness—a woman\u0027s trick. Yes; you have been or you are ill. There is a white look in your face.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She sat looking at him. She had walked all the way from Park Straat in the shade of the trees—quite a pedestrian feat for one who confessed to belonging to a carriage generation. She had boldly entered the restaurant of the little hotel, and had told the waiter to take her to Mr. Cornish\u0027s apartment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It hardly matters what a very young waiter, at the beginning of his career, may think of us. But downstairs they are rather scandalized, I warn you,” she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, I ceased explaining many years ago,” replied Cornish, “even in English. More suspicion is aroused by explanation than by silence. For this wise world will not believe that one is telling the truth.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When one is not,” suggested Mrs. Vansittart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “When one is not,” admitted Cornish, in rather a tired voice, which, to so keen an ear as that of his hearer, was as good as asking her why she had come.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She laughed. “Yes,” she said, “you are not inclined to sit and talk nonsense at this time in the morning. No more am I. I did not walk from Park Straat and take your defences by storm, and subject myself to the insult of a raised eyebrow on the countenance of a foolish young waiter, to talk nonsense even with you, who are cleverer with your non-committing platitudes than any man I know.” She laughed rather harshly, as many do when they find themselves suddenly within hail, as it were, of that weakness which is called feeling. “No, I came here on—let us say—business. I hold a good card, and I am going to play it. I want you to hold your hand in the mean time; give me to-day, you understand. I have taken great care to strengthen my hand. This is no sudden impulse, but a set purpose to which I have led up for some weeks. It is not scrupulous; it is not even honest. It is, in a word, essentially feminine, and not an affair to which you as a man could lend a moment\u0027s approval. Therefore, I tell you nothing. I merely ask you to leave me an open field to-day. Our end is the same, though our methods and our purpose differ as much as—well, as much as our minds. You want to break this Malgamite corner. I want to break Otto von Holzen. You understand?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cornish had known her long enough to permit himself to nod and say nothing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If I succeed, tant mieux. If I fail, it is no concern of yours, and it will in no way affect you or your plans. Ah, you disapprove, I see. What a complicated world this would be if we could all wear masks! Your face used to be a safer one than it is now. Can it be that you are becoming serious—un jeune homme sérieux? Heaven save you from that!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; I have a headache; that is all,” laughed Cornish.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Vansittart was slowly unbuttoning and rebuttoning her glove, deep in thought. For some women can think deeply and talk superficially at the same moment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you know,” she said, with a sudden change of voice and manner, “I have a conviction that you know something to-day of which you were ignorant yesterday? All knowledge, I suppose, leaves its mark. Something about Otto von Holzen, I suspect. Ah, Tony, if you know something, tell it to me. If you hold a strong card, let me play it. You do not know how I have longed and waited—what a miserable little hand I hold against this strong man.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She was serious enough now. Her voice had a ring of hopelessness in it, as if she knew that limit against which a woman is fated to throw herself when she tries to injure a man who has no love for her. If the love be there, then is she strong, indeed; but without it, what can she do? It is the little more that is so much, and the little less that is such worlds away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cornish did not deny the knowledge which she ascribed to him, but merely shook his head, and Mrs. Vansittart suddenly changed her manner again. She was quick and clever enough to know that whatever account stood open between Cornish and Von Holzen the reckoning must be between them alone, without the help of any woman.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then you will remain indoors,” she said, rising, “and recover from your ... strange headache—and not go near the malgamite works, nor see Percy Roden or Otto von Holzen—and let me have my little try—that is all I ask.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” answered Cornish, reluctantly; “but I think you would be wiser to leave Von Holzen to me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah!” said Mrs. Vansittart, with one of her quick glances. “You think that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She paused on the threshold, then shrugged her shoulders and passed out. She hurried home, and there wrote a note to Percy Roden.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “DEAR MR. RODEN,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It seems a long time since I saw you last, though perhaps it only seems so to me. I shall be at home at five o\u0027clock this evening, if you care to take pity on a lonely countrywoman. If I should be out riding when you come, please await my return.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yours very truly,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “EDITH VANSITTART.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She closed the letter with a little cruel smile, and despatched it by the hand of a servant. Quite early in the afternoon she put on her habit, but did not go straight downstairs, although her horse was at the door. She went to the library instead—a small, large-windowed room, looking on to Oranje Straat. From a drawer in her writing-table she took a key, and examined it closely before slipping it into her pocket. It was a new key with the file-marks still upon it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A clumsy expedient,” she said. “But the end is so desirable that the means must not be too scrupulously considered.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She rode down Kazerne Straat and through the wood by the Leyden Road. By turning to the left, she soon made her way to the East Dunes, and thus describing a circle, rode slowly back towards Scheveningen. She knew her way, it appeared, to the malgamite works. Leaving her horse in the care of the groom, she walked to the gate of the works, which was opened to her by the doorkeeper, after some hesitation. The man was a German, and therefore, perhaps, more amenable to Mrs. Vansittart\u0027s imperious arguments.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I must see Herr von Holzen without delay,” she said. “Show me his office.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man pointed out the building. “But the Herr Professor is in the factory,” he said. “It is mixing-day to-day. I will, however, fetch him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mrs. Vansittart walked slowly towards the office where Roden had told her that the safe stood wherein the prescription and other papers were secured. She knew it was mixing-day and that Von Holzen would be in the factory. She had sent Roden on a fool\u0027s errand to Park Straat to await her return there. Was she going to succeed? Would she be left alone for a few moments in that little office with the safe? She fingered the key in her pocket—a duplicate obtained at some risk, with infinite difficulty, by the simple stratagem of borrowing Roden\u0027s keys to open an old and disused desk one evening in Park Straat. She had conceived the plan herself, had carried it out herself, as all must who wish to succeed in a human design. She was quite aware that the plan was crude and almost childish, but the gain was great, and it is often the simplest means that succeed. The secret of the manufacture of malgamite—written in black and white—might prove to be Von Holzen\u0027s death-warrant. Mrs. Vansittart had to fight in her own way or not fight at all. She could not understand the slower, surer methods of Mr. Wade and Cornish, who appeared to be waiting and wasting time.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The German doorkeeper accompanied her to the office, and opened the door after knocking and receiving no answer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Will the high-born take a seat?” he said; “I shall not be long.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There is no need to hurry,” said Mrs. Vansittart to herself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And before the door was quite closed she was on her feet again. The office was bare and orderly. Even the waste-paper baskets were empty. The books were locked away and the desks were clear. But the small green safe stood in the corner. Mrs. Vansittart went towards it, key in hand. The key was the right one. It had only been selected by guesswork among a number on Roden\u0027s bunch. It slipped into the lock and turned smoothly, but the door would not move. She tugged and wrenched at the handle, then turned it accidentally, and the heavy door swung open. There were two drawers at the bottom of the safe which were not locked, and contained neatly folded papers. Her fingers were among these in a moment. The papers were folded and tied together. Many of the bundles were labelled. A long narrow envelope lay at the bottom of the drawer. She seized it quickly and turned it over. It bore no address nor any superscription. “Ah!” she said breathlessly, and slipped her finger within the flap of the envelope. Then she hesitated for a moment, and turned on her heel. Von Holzen was standing in the doorway looking at her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They stared at each other for a moment in silence. Mrs. Vansittart\u0027s lips were drawn back, showing her even, white teeth. Von Holzen\u0027s quiet eyes were wide open, so that the white showed all around the dark pupil. Then he sprang at her without a word. She was a lithe, strong woman, taller than he, or else she would have fallen. Instead, she stood her ground, and he, failing to get a grasp at her wrist, stumbled sideways against the table. In a moment she had run round it, and again they stared at each other, without a word, across the table where Percy Roden kept the books of the malgamite works.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A slow smile came to Von Holzen\u0027s face, which was colourless always, and now a sort of grey. He turned on his heel, walked to the door, and, locking it, slipped the key into his pocket. Then he returned to Mrs. Vansittart. Neither spoke. No explanation was at that moment necessary. He lifted the table bodily, and set it aside against the wall. Then he went slowly towards her, holding out his hand for the unaddressed envelope, which she held behind her back. He stood for a moment holding out his hand while his strong will went out to meet hers. Then he sprang at her again and seized her two wrists. The strength of his arms was enormous, for he was a deep-chested man, and had been a gymnast. The struggle was a short one, and Mrs. Vansittart dropped the envelope helplessly from her paralyzed fingers. He picked it up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are the wife of Karl Vansittart,” he said in German.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am his widow,” she replied; and her breath caught, for she was still shaken by the physical and moral realization of her absolute helplessness in his hands, and she saw in a flash of thought the question in his mind as to whether he could afford to let her leave the room alive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Give me the key with which you opened the safe,” he said coldly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She had replaced the key in her pocket, and now sought it with a shaking hand. She gave it to him without a word. Morally she would not acknowledge herself beaten, and the bitterness of that moment was the self-contempt with which she realized a physical cowardice which she had hitherto deemed quite impossible. For the flesh is always surprised by its own weakness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Von Holzen looked at the key critically, turning it over in order to examine the workmanship. It was clumsily enough made, and he doubtless guessed how she had obtained it. Then he glanced at her as she stood breathless with a colourless face and compressed lips.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope I did not hurt you,” he said quietly, thereby putting in a dim and far-off claim to greatness, for it is hard not to triumph in absolute victory.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She shook her head with a twisted smile, and looked down at her hands, which were still helpless. There were bands of bright red round the white wrists. Her gloves lay on the table. She went towards them and numbly took them up. He was impassive still, and his face, which had flushed a few moments earlier, slowly regained its usual calm pallor. It was this very calmness, perhaps, that suddenly incensed Mrs. Vansittart. Or it may have been that she had regained her courage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” she cried, with a sort of break in her voice that made it strident—“yes. I am Karl Vansittart\u0027s wife, and I—cared for him. Do you know what that means? But you can\u0027t. All that side of life is a closed book to such as you. It means that if you had been a hundred times in the right and he always in the wrong, I should still have believed in him and distrusted you—should still have cared for him and hated you. But he was not guilty. He was in the right and you were wrong—a thief and a murderer, no doubt. And to screen your paltry name, you sacrificed Karl and the happiness of two people who had just begun to be happy. It means that I shall not rest until I have made you pay for what you have done. I have never lost sight of you—and never shall—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She paused, and looked at his impassive face with a strange, dull curiosity as she spoke of the future, as if wondering whether she had a future or had reached the end of her life—here, at this moment, in the little plank-walled office of the malgamite works. But her courage rose steadily. It is only afar off that Death is terrible. When we actually stand in his presence, we usually hold up our heads and face him quietly enough.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You may have other enemies,” she continued. “I know you have—men, too—but none of them will last so long as I shall, none of them is to be feared as I am—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She stopped again in a fury, for he was obviously waiting for her to pause for mere want of breath, as if her words could be of no weight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you fear anything on earth,” she said, acknowledging is one merit despite herself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I fear you so little,” he answered, going to the door and unlocking it, “that you may go.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her whip lay on the table. He picked it up and handed it to her, gravely, without a bow, without a shade of triumph or the smallest suspicion of sarcasm. There was perhaps the nucleus of a great man in Otto von Holzen, after all, for there was no smallness in his mind. He opened the door, and stood aside for her to pass out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is not because you do not fear me—that you let me go,” said Mrs. Vansittart. “But—because you are afraid of Tony Cornish.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And she went out, wondering whether the shot had told or missed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2873/79498.html","bookId":1165,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:14:57 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:14:57 AM"}
