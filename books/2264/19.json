{"id":87406,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath and stepped in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat man was listening to Frank Sinatra, as if he couldn\u0027t be more cliché with his white suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up and grinned at me, shaking his jowls. His face was sweaty, even though he wasn’t actually doing anything. He was sweating from existing, like that took work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked me up and down, \"You\u0027re hot. I\u0027m gonna have to get the name of your company.\" He smiled like he was being sexy as he undid his dress shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost gagged. Instead, I grinned like I was about to backcomb my hair and tell him about saving whales and orphans. In my best Miss America country accent, I smiled and twirled my long, dark hair, \"Why, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI always had a thing for accents. Whenever I read aloud, it was with a British accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached into my clutch and chatted like it was small talk, \"I heard you like it kinda rough, so I was thinking maybe we could do a little spanking first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, \"Oh my God. You\u0027re a gift from God. I gotta remember to thank Vince tomorrow. The last girl complained.\" My stomach dropped at those words. At least it would make killing him easier. I was only guessing about the spanking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirked and nodded, \"Yeah, Vince said to say hi. I think that was his name.\" I tilted my head and made a confused face as I pulled my lipstick out, \"My name is Wanda. It\u0027s short for Wanda Lynn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote my new name on the mirror in the foyer, like I was one of those waiters in the restaurants with the paper tablecloths and the upside-down writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda huh, I like that name.\" He shot back his drink. The sound of the ice made me want some too, but I didn’t need that clouding my brain, not yet. I would need it later, when I wanted to drink away the memory of his naked body anywhere near mine. He poured more and walked towards me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuck the lipstick in the clutch and walked to him as I fished the two pills out. I held them in my fingers and dragged my hands up his sweaty fat chest, pinching the pills between two fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggled, \"You wanna spank me first or me spank you?\" As the words left my lips, I contemplated just taking the poison myself and ending it there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and grabbed my breast in my thousand-dollar halter-top. \"I think I\u0027ll spank you first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head and smiled sweetly, \"Okay.\" I looked around, \"Where do you want me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pursed his lips, \"Bed, ass in the air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skirt on or off?\" I dragged my empty fingers along the waistband of my skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"Skirt on and pulled up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed and walked to the bed. I looked at him, as sexy as I could and lifted the skirt slightly, letting my ass cheeks peek out the bottom. He smiled like he got a new toy, or let’s be honest, a sundae. He licked his lips and I decided it was a sundae for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bent over the bed and placed my hands on the bed, still gripping the pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked over and rubbed his hands over my nearly bare cheeks. The French underwear rode a fair amount. He rubbed in a circular motion and then gave me a hard smack. I made a sexy face and moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like that, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smacked again and then rubbed more. His fingers were brushing my underwear. I wanted to bury my face and cry, but I smiled. I gave him my sexy bedroom face. He smacked again. The vibration was actually not bad, considering I had never been spanked before. Not that the feel could take away from the fact, I was being spanked by a three hundred pound sweating beast. He rubbed my cheeks, \"You work out, Wanda\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I do. I run sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gripped my ass and nodded, I could see the filthy thoughts burning through his mind. He spanked once more and then pulled my underwear to the side. I stood up fast and planted a kiss on his squishy lips. I could smell cigar and paint chips, I swear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lie back,\" I whispered into his lips. He lay back on the bed. I crawled towards him and unzipped his pants. I coughed. It was part fake and part smell. He smelled like sweat, old booze, and smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed, almost panting. I got up and pranced over to the table. I took his drink he had before and drank a sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want the rest?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took it in my hand and slipped the pills in, as I walked to the bucket of ice. I clinked in one more and stirred it with my finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licked his lips again. The capsules were fast dissolving I guessed, because they were gone by the time I got to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot it back and reached for me, but I grabbed the glass and pulled away, \"I still have a tickle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, \"I\u0027m gonna tickle you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"You are a bad man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my eyes, \"You want me to punish you for a minute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. I poured the scotch into the glass and carried it to him. I drank a sip and passed him the rest. He gulped it back and scrambled off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled his belt off and wrapped it around his wrists behind his back and bent him over the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pull it out, stroke it,\" he muttered into the bedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped and used my mom voice, \"I’m in charge. I\u0027ll pull it out, when I\u0027m ready. You\u0027ve been a bad boy.\" I ripped his pants down and spanked his flabby ass cheek. He moaned into the bed. I spanked again, harder. He moaned into the bed and then he started to twitch. He jerked like he was having a heart attack. I stepped back and put my hands to my mouth. I cried out for help, \"Help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around the room. No one was there to help me. How good was it looking on the camera? I turned and ran for the door. I screamed, \"HELP ME!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man was walking down the hallway. He looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help, please!\" I shouted and turned, running back into the room. The man followed. When we got inside, fat man was dead on the floor. His pants were down and his hands were bound behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man untied the fat man’s wrists and pushed him on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call 9-1-1!\" he said frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was having a proper panic attack. I grabbed the phone next to the bed and dialed 9-1-1. The phone made a noise and a person answered, \"Front desk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I need 9-1-1. My…uhm…boyfriend. He\u0027s had an attack. We were playing around and he got sick. Hurry. Please hurry.\" I covered my eyes and hung up the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed the fat man\u0027s hand and sobbed fake cries. I didn’t have any tears. I should have had some, but apparently, I couldn’t cry when I was being the person they needed me to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy panic attack was authentic by the time the ambulance arrived. I was hugging myself and pacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man from the hallway, who had come to help, wrapped an arm around me as they attached the fat man to the stretcher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had you been dating long?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"We just started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed, \"You wanna come back to my room and I\u0027ll get you a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up at him and smiled, not that it mattered. His eyes were focused on my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks. I just want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in a dress shirt and slacks eyed me up. I had already given him my statement. \"It\u0027s a heart attack they figure, so you\u0027re free to go.\" I nodded and hugged my arms around myself. I picked up my purse and the glass I drank from. I poured one more shot of scotch and drank it back. I carried it from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark-red Wanda, with a heart, on the mirror made me sick, as I made my way to the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know the room he was staying in, but I sort assumed it would be the presidential suite. I also sort of assumed, that he would expect me to find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped in past the bellhop. I hadn’t recalled there being one before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Presidential suite, please,\" I muttered like I was stricken with trauma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped the cell phone in his belt, like it was to the beat of a cheesy Celine Dion song. I looked over at him and smiled when I saw it was Luce. She honestly looked like a guy, in a bellhop\u0027s uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the screen of the cell phone and read the sideways message, making a smirk cross my lips. I hugged myself tighter, as she started to get a head bob to the music. She dropped her hat on the floor. I bent to pick it up, palming the powder she dropped in the tiny packet. She smiled when I passed the hat to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped off the elevator, ignoring her completely, and made my way to the door. I knocked, holding my clutch and the packet in the same hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario answered and smiled bitterly, \"That was a show and a half.\" He stepped back to let me in and shook his head, \"I should have guessed you would find a way to ensure that it was a legit kill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I don’t know what you mean. It was horrible, the way he had a massive heart attack like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI entered the room, opening my clutch and passing him the lipstick back and slipping the packet in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is yours,\" I said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were burning, \"You disappointed me in so many ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt fear creeping up inside of me, when I glanced at his twitching hands. I had learned to take a hit in training but I really didn’t want to take one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed me and ran his hand up into my hair. He pulled back slightly, tilting my head and exposing my throat, \"You let him touch you,\" he whispered into my cheek and tugged hard on my hair. I sucked a breath in, trying not to wince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled pleasantly, \"I told you, this is mine.\" He reached down and brushed his fingers along the center of my underwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head slightly, \"He didn’t touch that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flashed, \"You let him have an experience with you, that I have not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ass started to hurt, just imagining the things he was going to do to it. I needed the powdered belladonna packet in my purse. I needed him to pass out. He towered over me, almost putting me on my tiptoes in the six-inch heels. My fingers dug into his thick chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really want a shower,\" I said softly. It was true. I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked me over, \"You\u0027re lucky. You have another job to do in a couple days. I need you rested.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-19.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
