Our hero dodged and was about to throw the book at the fellow when the door opened and a man-of-all-work, hired by the boarding house keeper, rushed in and caught Grant Deems by the collar.

An hour later he packed his valise, settled with Miss Littell, and left not only the boarding house but also the town. It was the last our hero saw of him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t want to meet such a rival again,” said our hero, in talking the matter over with Miss Littell. “I do not mind fair and square competition, but Mr. Deems was not fair.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am sorry I let him have a room,” was the boarding house mistress’ reply. “I must confess he did not impress me favorably when first he made his appearance.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I presume you want the room occupied, Miss Littell.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That’s just it; I need the money, for I have a mortgage coming due and it must be paid.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I see. Well, perhaps somebody else will soon come to take the room,” answered Frank. He was right in this surmise; a gentleman came the next day, who took the apartment Grant Deems had occupied, and paid a dollar per week more for board. So in the end Miss Littell was better off than before.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Frank remained in the vicinity of Brentwood nearly two weeks. Business was very good with him, and he not only sold his new books but also bought up several rare volumes which, later on, brought him in a profit of twenty-two dollars. He considered that he was on the highroad to success, and was correspondingly happy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From Brentwood he went to Colton and then to a large city which I shall call Coalville, for several important coal mines were not far distant. Here business was not quite so good, and much bad weather made him spend some days indoors, but all told, he did enough to keep from complaining.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It can’t be good all the time,” he reasoned. “If it was I’d be a rich man in no time. I’ve got to take my share of hard knocks.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n While Frank was at Coalville he received a long letter from his father, part of which ran as follows:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We are all more than pleased to hear of your wonderful success. You are evidently cut out for the book business, just as Mr. Vincent said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yesterday I received another visit from a lawyer representing the railroad company. The company now wish to pay me seven hundred dollars for my injuries. I have referred them again to Mr. Begoin, and he advises me to take two thousand dollars and not a cent less.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He says he feels sure I can expect that much. If I get it, it will be a big lift to us.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So far we have heard nothing further from Jabez Garrison. More than likely he has fled from the country.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We have just received a letter from your brother Mark. He mailed it at Santiago, Cuba. His ship was then about to sail for Charleston, so it won’t be long before he is again at a United States port. He does not know how soon he will reach Philadelphia and receive his discharge.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mark is a sailor, sure,” thought Frank, after reading the communication. “But I hope when he gets home he will be content to settle down.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Our hero was sorry to learn that nothing more had been heard of Jabez Garrison.

He was accompanied by a boy named Darry Field, who lived at the hotel at which the young book agent was stopping.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Darry was a nice lad, and Frank had taken to him from the start.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know that old mine from end to end,” said Darry. “I can show you every nook and corner of it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How can we get down the shaft?” questioned Frank. “There isn’t any car running, is there?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We won’t have to go down by way of the shaft.
