Did you go to them?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘I stopped at one door,’ his mother replied: ‘the servant was dressed as fine as a gentleman. He looked at me with contempt, and said his mistress had company.[21] At another house, I got to see the lady. She was sitting in a velvet chair, rocking her baby, and was handsome and pleasant spoken, and asked me to sit down.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘She gave you some work?’ said John.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Ah!’ replied Mrs Leddam, sighing, ‘I don’t think she ever felt trouble. For a moment she seemed sorry for me; but she was so much taken up with her little girl, that she seemed to forget for a while that I was in the room, and then dismissed me hastily, telling me to call again. As I rung the bell at another fine house, the mistress came out to the door, elegantly dressed, and stepped into a carriage which was waiting. I asked her for work, and told her of my starving children. She looked cross, and said there was no end to the calls of poor people. I looked at a bright purse which she held in her hand, and thought that one of the gold pieces[22] that shone through the silk would make me easy for a week. At last I felt faint and sick, and came home.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Wasn’t you glad, mother,’ said Henry, ‘when you found us so well off?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Yes, my son; I felt that God had not forsaken us. And now, John, read me the chapter we had yesterday.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Which, mother? where Jesus fed the five thousand?’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Yes; I love to hear that part which speaks of women and children: surely He will take care of us helpless ones.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It has been said, and whoever feels sorrow may know it to be true, ‘A dark hour makes Jesus bright.’ Before I close this chapter, let me ask my young reader to remember the words at the beginning, and try to put them in practice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You may not always have money to give to the poor, but you can be kind[23] and thoughtful. A few kind words will often cheer the sad heart of the widow or orphan.\n\u003cbr\u003e Would you be like Jesus,\n\u003cbr\u003e And show His gentle mind?\n\u003cbr\u003e Then in all your actions\n\u003cbr\u003e Remember to be kind.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2697/74154.html","bookId":1461,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:23:10 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:23:10 AM"}
