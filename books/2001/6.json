It’s mutually beneficial.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sunk in and I stopped on the stair above him. “You’re nice to me because you think I’m pretty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And because you have brown eyes. I’m a sucker for big old brown eyes.” He laughed. “I’m a shallow, shallow boy. Hey, it helps that you’re pretty. It brings out the nice guy in me. Makes me what to share my cookies with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. “So if I was ugly, you wouldn’t be nice to me?” Cam pivoted around, facing me. Even a whole step below, he was taller than me. “I’d still be nice to you if you were ugly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wicked grin slipped over his full lips. He bent his head down and whispered, “I just wouldn’t offer you any cookies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded my arms and tried to ignore the close proximity of our faces. “I’m beginning to think cookies is a code word for something else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it is.” He tugged on my bag again as he took a confident step back, forcing me down another step. “And just think about it. If cookie was a code word, whatever it symbolizes, it’s been in your mouth, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me was slightly disturbed by that and the other part? A laugh bubbled up my throat and came out, sounding a bit hoarse. “You are really…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amazing? Awesome?” He paused, brows raised. “Astonishing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was going to go with bizarre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, hell, if I had feelings that might actually hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned, falling into the easy banter with him. “I guess it’s a good thing that you don’t have feelings then, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guess so.” He went down a couple more steps and stopped on the landing. “You better hurry or you’re going to be late to your next class.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly shit! He was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam laughed at my wide eyes and stepped out of my way as I charged down the steps. “Damn, if only you moved that fast for my cookies, I’d be a happy guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up!” I tossed over my shoulder as I hit the next set of steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” he yelled after me. “Don’t you want to know what cookies is a code word for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! Good God, no!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter followed me into the hall and all the way to my next class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your apartment is really nice,” Brittany said from my couch. A history text lay open, but unread in her lap. “I would love not to have to live in a dorm. My roommate snores like a banshee is her sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hovered between the coffee table and the TV, really unsure on how Brittany and Jacob had ended up in my apartment after class. At lunch, we’d talked about getting together and exchanging notes from history and somehow my place was offered up. I really think it was Jacob’s idea, and since both of them were here we were getting absolutely no studying done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnxious energy buzzed through me like a hummingbird. It had been so long since I had people in my space. Back home, no one but family came around and only the maid entered my bedroom. Not only had I been a virtual pariah in my town and at school, it had been the same way inside my house. But before that Halloween party, everyone hung out at my house, especially the girls from the studio. Everyone had still talked to me then and I’d still danced. Before that party, things had been normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fiddled with my bracelet, nervous. I liked them here because it was normal and reminded me of the before. It was what people in college did, but it was so… different to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob resurfaced from my kitchen, a bag of chips in hand. “Forget about the apartment. Don’t get me wrong. It is a nice apartment, but I want to hear more about Cam’s cookies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a chip from the bag. “I should’ve never told you about that conversation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever,” he replied, mouth full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany giggled. “I am so dying to know what cookies are slang for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably his cock,” Jacob plopped down on the arm of the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” I said, taking a handful of chips. I needed the calorie fortitude for where this conversation was heading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany nodded. “Makes sense then. I mean, with the whole not sharing cookies with ugly girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think he really meant that,” I said, popping a chip in my mouth. “So, back to our history notes…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck history. Back to Cam’s cock.” Jacob said. “Do you know, if cookies is a code word for cock, then that means his cock was in your mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked on the chip and grabbed my can of soda, inhaling the liquid as my face burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Theoretically speaking that is,” Jacob added, grinning like a total shithead. He hopped up. “I don’t know how you do it, Avery. If I lived across the hall from him, I’d be plastered to his front door noon to midnight. And I’d be all over his cookies. Yum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaving a hand in front of my face, I shook my head. “You can have his cookies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, honey, if he swung batter-batter for my team, I’d be all over that in a heartbeat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany’s eyes rolled. “Big surprise there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I don’t understand is how come you aren’t all over his cookies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, but Brittany shook her head and said, “I don’t think cookies mean cock. I think it might mean his balls being that its plural and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob burst into loud laughter. “Then that means his balls were in your mouth theoretically speaking! Damn, that’s some dirty baking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped at the two. Was this typical conversation? “Oh my God, can we please stop talking about his cock and balls or I’ll never be able to eat cookies again. Like ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Seriously. How come you aren’t all up on that.” Jacob climbed onto the back of the couch like an overgrown cat. “He’s obviously flirting with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” I replied, believing it might be safe to eat another chip without dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob’s jaw dropped. “So?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany closed the history book and dropped it on the floor with a loud thump. Guess there went studying completely. “Jacob is like a sex-starved woman in her mid-thirties, so he can’t possibly understand why you wouldn’t want to take a ride on the town bike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Jacob, and he just shrugged and said, “Very true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even I have a hard time understanding that. Cameron is really good looking,” Brittany continued. “And I have never heard any girl talking crap about him, so he must treat them good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving no idea what to say, I dropped into the black moon chair near the TV. Explaining to them the why behind it all was a big fat no go. “I don’t know. I’m just not interested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have ovaries?” Jacob asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a look. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid down the back of the couch and sat beside Brittany. “Then how are you not interested?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoving the rest of the chips in my mouth, I struggled to respond without coming across like a frigid prude. But I was a total frigid prude, wasn’t I? Or afflicted, depending on who you asked. Either way, while the idea of cocks and balls interested me, the thought of actually getting up, close and personal with them made me break out in a cold sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was sweating now. The chips were already souring in my stomach. I’d be breaking out the Tums later. My mind immediately went straight to the email from last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping my hands over my jeans, I shook my head. “I’m just not interested in a relationship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob laughed. “We’re not saying that Cam is either, you know? You don’t have to want to be in a relationship for a little bow-chicka-bow-wow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany looked at him slowly. “Did you really just say that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did. And I owned it. Gonna make me a shirt that says that.” Jacob flashed a grin. “Anyway, all I’m saying is he’s an opportunity you might not want to pass up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t even give that a thought. “Why are we even talking about this? We have one class together and he lives across the hall—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re partners for the rest of the semester,” Brittany added. “Kind of romantic, going out at night and gazing up at stars.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach tightened. “It’s not romantic. Nothing is romantic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows rose as she ran her hand through the short locks of blonde hair. “Well, hello, Debbie Downer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “All I’m saying is that I don’t know him. He doesn’t know me. And he’s just a flirt. You’ve even said he’s the town bike. This is just probably how he is. He’s a nice and friendly guy. That’s all. So can we just forget about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, you bitches be boring me to tears,” Jacob said, and Brittany stuck her tongue out at him. Light glinted off the bolt, and I winced, thinking that had to have hurt. “And I need some salsa to go with these chips.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the bottom cupboard,” I shouted, but he was already halfway in the kitchen, doors opening and slamming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch to my relief, the topic veered away from me and the nonexistent whatever with Cam. Hours passed and I became more comfortable with them here and we even cracked open our history books for a few short seconds. When it got close to nine, they packed up their stuff and headed toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany stopped and sprang forward. Before I could prepare myself, she gave me a quick hug and peck on the cheek. I stood there, sort of shell shocked. She smiled. “There’s a big party at one of the frats Friday night. You should come with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered Cam saying he was busy Friday and since he obviously liked to party, that was probably why. I shook my head. “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be antisocial,” Jacob said, opening the door. “We’re cool people to hang with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “I know. I’ll think about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Brittany wiggled her fingers. “See you tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut in the hall, Jacob started pointing at Cam’s door as he thrust his hips and wiggled his ass. I bit down on my lip to stop laughing. It went on until Brittany caught the collar of his polo and yanked him down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, I shut the door and locked it. It didn’t take much time for me to clean up and get ready for bed. The whole bed thing was pointless because I wasn’t sleepy and since I was avoiding the laptop and therefore my email, I ended up watching reruns of Ghost Hunters until I was convinced there was a poltergeist in my bathroom. Turning off the TV, I stood and ended up doing something I hated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePacing my apartment like I used to do in my bedroom back home. With the TV off and my apartment quiet, I could hear little minute noises from the other apartments. I focused on those noises instead of letting my mind do the wander thing because tonight had been good and I didn’t want to ruin it. The last couple of days had been great with the exception of the whole plowing into Cam thing. Things were good. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wait-for-you-wait-for-you-1/page-6.html","bookId":2001,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM"}
