{"id":91242,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe simple wooden structure at the end of Rogues Circle seemed understated even for the decrepit side of the sprawling southern city of Calimport. The building had few windows, all boarded or barred, and not a terrace or balcony to speak of. Similarly, no lettering identified the building, not even a number on the door to place it. But everyone in the city knew the house and marked it well, for beyond either of its iron-bound doors, the scene changed - dramatically. Where the outside showed only the weathered brown of old wood, the inside displayed a myriad of bright colors and tapestries, thickly woven carpets, and statues of solid gold. This was the thieves\u0027 guild, rivaling the palace of Calimshan\u0027s ruler himself in riches and decor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt rose three floors from the street level, with two more levels hidden below. The highest level was the finest, with five rooms - an octagonal central hall and four antechambers off it - all designed for the comfort and convenience of one man: Pasha Pook. He was the guildmaster, the architect of an intricate thieving network. And he made certain that he was the first to enjoy the spoils of his guild\u0027s handiwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook paced the highest level\u0027s central hall, his audience chamber, stopping every circuit to stroke the shining coat of the leopard that lay beside his great chair. An uncharacteristic anxiety was etched upon the guildmaster\u0027s round face, and he twiddled his fingers nervously when he was not petting his exotic pet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis clothes were of the finest silk, but other than the brooch that fastened his wrappings, he wore none of the abundant jewelry customary among others of his station - though his teeth did gleam of solid gold. In truth, Pook seemed a half-sized version of one of the four hill giant eunuchs that lined the hall, an inconspicuous appearance for a silver-tongued guildmaster who had brought sultans to their knees and whose name sent the sturdiest of the ruffian street dwellers scurrying for dark holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook nearly jumped when a loud knock resounded off the room\u0027s main door, the one to the lower levels. He hesitated for a long moment, assuring himself that he would make the other man squirm for waiting - though he really needed the time to compose himself. Then he absently motioned to one of the eunuchs and moved to the overstuffed throne on the raised platform opposite the door and dropped a hand again to his pampered cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lanky fighter entered, his thin rapier dancing to the swagger of his stride. He wore a black cape that floated behind him and was bunched at his neck. His thick brown hair curled into and around it. His clothes were dark and plain but crisscrossed by straps and belts, each with a pouch or sheathed dagger or some other unusual weapon hanging from it. His high leather boots, worn beyond any creases, made no sound other than the timed clump of his agile stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greetings, Pook,\" he said informally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook\u0027s eyes narrowed immediately at the sight of the man. \"Rassiter,\" he replied to the wererat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRassiter walked up to the throne and bowed halfheartedly, throwing the reclining leopard a distasteful glance. Flashing a rotted smile that revealed his lowly heritage, he put one foot upon the chair and bent low to let the guildmaster feel the heat of his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook glanced at the dirty boot on his beautiful chair, then back at the man with a smile that even the uncouth Rassiter noticed was a bit too disarming. Figuring that he might be taking his familiarity with his partner a bit too far, Rassiter removed his foot from its perch and shuffled back a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook\u0027s smile faded, but he was satisfied. \"It is done?\" he asked the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRassiter danced a circle and nearly laughed out loud. \"Of course,\" he answered, and he pulled a pearl necklace from his pouch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook frowned at the sight, just the expression the sly fighter had expected. \"Must you kill them all?\" the guildmaster said in a hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRassiter shrugged and replaced the necklace. \"You said you wanted her removed. She is removed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook\u0027s hands clutched the arms of the throne. \"I said I wanted her taken from the streets until the job was completed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She knew too much,\" Rassiter replied, examining his fingernails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was a valuable wench,\" Pook said, back in control now. Few men could anger Pasha Pook as did Rassiter, and fewer still would have left the chamber alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of a thousand,\" chuckled the lanky fighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother door opened, and an older man entered, his purple robes embroidered with golden stars and quartermoons and a huge diamond fastening his high turban. \"I must see - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook cast him a sidelong glance. \"Not now, LaValle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Master - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook\u0027s eyes went dangerously thin again, nearly matching the lines of his lipless grimace. The old man bowed apologetically and disappeared back through the door, closing it carefully and silently behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRassiter laughed at the spectacle. \"Well done!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should learn LaValle\u0027s manners,\" Pook said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, Pook, we are partners,\" Rassiter replied. He skipped over to one of the room\u0027s two windows, the one that looked south to the docks and the wide ocean. \"The moon will be full tonight,\" he said excitedly, spinning back on Pook. \"You should join us, Pasha! A grand feasting there will be!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook shuddered to think of the macabre table that Rassiter and his fellow wererats planned to set. Perhaps the wench was not yet dead...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook away such thoughts. \"I am afraid I must decline,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRassiter understood - and had purposely enticed - Pook\u0027s disgust. He danced back over and put his foot on the throne, again showing Pook that foul smile. \"You do not know what you are missing,\" he said. \"But the choice is yours; that was our deal.\" He spun away and bowed low. \"And you are the master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An arrangement that does well by you and yours,\" Pook reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRassiter turned his palms out in concession, then clapped his hands together. \"I cannot argue that my guild fares better since you brought us in.\" He bowed again. \"Forgive my insolence, my dear friend, but I can hardly contain the mirth of my fortunes. And tonight the moon will be full!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go to your feast, Rassiter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lanky man bowed again, cast one more glare at the leopard, and skipped from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door had closed, Pook ran his fingers over his brow and down through the stylishly matted remains of what once had been a thick tousle of black hair. Then he dropped his chin helplessly into a plump palm and chuckled at his own discomfort in dealing with Rassiter, the wererat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked to the harem door, wondering if he might take his mind off his associate. But he remembered LaValle. The wizard would not have disturbed him, certainly not with Rassiter in the room, unless his news was important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave his pet a final scratch on the chin and moved through the chamber\u0027s southeast door, into the wizard\u0027s dimly lit quarters. LaValle, staring intently into his crystal ball, did not notice him as he entered. Not wanting to disturb the wizard, Pook quietly took the seat across the small table and waited, amusing himself with the curious distortions of LaValle\u0027s scraggly gray beard through the crystal ball as the wizard moved this way and that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally LaValle looked up. He could clearly see the lines of tension still on Pook\u0027s face, not unexpected after a visit from the wererat. \"They have killed her, then?\" he asked, already knowing the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I despise him,\" said Pook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaValle nodded in agreement. \"But you cannot dismiss the power that Rassiter has brought you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard spoke the truth. In the two years since Pook had allied himself with the wererats, his guild had become the most prominent and powerful in the city. He could live well simply from the tithes that the dockside merchants paid him for protection - from his own guild. Even the captains of many of the visiting merchant ships knew enough not to turn away Pook\u0027s collector when he met them on the docks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd those who didn\u0027t know better learned quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Pook couldn\u0027t argue about the benefits of having Rassiter and his fellows around. But the guildmaster had no love for the wretched lycanthropes, human by day and something beastly, half rat and half man, by night. And he wasn\u0027t fond of the way they handled their business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough of him,\" Pook said, dropping his hands to the velvety black tablecloth. \"I am certain that I shall need a dozen hours in the harem to get over our meeting!\" His grin showed that the thought did not displease him. \"But what did you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wide smile spread over the wizard\u0027s face. \"I have spoken with Oberon in Baldur\u0027s Gate this day,\" he said with some pride. \"I have learned of something that may make you forget all about your discussion with Rassiter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook waited curiously, allowing LaValle to play out his dramatics. The wizard was a fine and loyal aide, the closest thing the guildmaster had to a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your assassin returns!\" LaValle proclaimed suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Pook a few moments to think through the meaning and implications of the wizard\u0027s words. But then it hit him, and he sprang up from the table. \"Entreri?\" he gasped, barely finding his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaValle nodded and nearly laughed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook ran his hand through his hair. Three years. Entreri, deadliest of the deadly, was returning to him after three long years. He looked curiously at the wizard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has the halfling,\" LaValle answered to his unspoken question. Pook\u0027s face lit up in a broad smile. He leaned forward eagerly, his golden teeth shining in the candlelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruly LaValle was glad to please his guildmaster, to give him the news he had waited so very long to hear. \"And the ruby pendant!\" the wizard proclaimed, banging a fist on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" Pook snarled, exploding into laughter. His gem, his most prized possession. With its hypnotic powers, he could rise to even greater heights of prosperity and power. Not only would he dominate all he met, but he would make them glad for the experience. \"Ah, Rassiter,\" Pook muttered, suddenly thinking of the upper hand he could gain on his associate. \"Our relationship is about to change, my rodent friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much will you still need him?\" LaValle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook shrugged and looked to the side of the room, to a small curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Taros Hoop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaValle blanched at the thought of the thing. The Taros Hoop was a mighty relic capable of displacing its owner, or his enemies, through the very planes of existence. But the power of this item was not without price. Thoroughly evil it was, and every one of the few times LaValle had used it, he had felt a part of himself drain away, as though the Taros Hoop gained its power by stealing his life force. LaValle hated Rassiter, but he hoped that the guildmaster would find a better solution than the Taros Hoop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard looked back to find Pook staring at him. \"Tell me more!\" Pook insisted eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaValle shrugged helplessly and put his hand on the crystal ball. \"I have not been able to glimpse them myself,\" he said. \"Ever has Artemis Entreri been able to dodge my scrying. But by Oberon\u0027s words, they are not too far. Sailing the waters north of Calimshan, if not already within the borders. And they fly on a swift wind, Master. A week or two, no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Regis is with him?\" Pook asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very much alive,\" said the wizard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good!\" Pook sneered. How he longed to see the treacherous halfling again! To have his plump hands around Regis\u0027s little neck! The guild had fallen on tough times after Regis had run off with the magical pendant. In truth, the problems had come mostly from Pook\u0027s own insecurity in dealing with people without the gem, so long had he been using it, and from the guildmaster\u0027s obsessive - and expensive - hunt to find the halfling. But to Pook, the blame fell squarely upon Regis. He even blamed the halfling for the alliance with the wererats\u0027 guild, for certainly he wouldn\u0027t have needed Rassiter if he had had his pendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now everything would work out for the best, Pook knew. Possessing the pendant and dominating the wererats, perhaps he could even think of expanding his power outside Calimport, with charmed associates and lyncanthrope allies heading guilds throughout the southland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaValle seemed more serious when Pook looked back at him. \"How do you believe Entreri will feel about our new associates?\" he asked grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, he does not know,\" said Pook, realizing the implications. \"He has been gone too long.\" He thought for a moment then shrugged. \"They are in the same business, after all. Entreri should accept them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rassiter disturbs everyone he meets,\" the wizard reminded him. \"Suppose that he crosses Entreri?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook laughed at the thought. \"I can assure you that Rassiter will cross Artemis Entreri only once, my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then you shall make arrangements with the new head of the wererats,\" LaValle snickered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePook clapped him on the shoulder and headed for the door. \"Learn what you can,\" he instructed the wizard. \"If you can find them in your crystal ball, call to me. I cannot wait to glimpse the face of Regis the halfling again. So much I owe to that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you shall be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the harem,\" Pook answered with a wink. \"Tension, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaValle slumped back in his chair when Pook had gone and considered again the return of his principal rival. He had gained much in the years since Entreri had left, even rising to this room on the third level as Pook\u0027s chief assistant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis room, Entreri\u0027s room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the wizard never had any problems with the assassin. They had been comfortable associates, if not friends, and had helped each other many times in the past. LaValle couldn\u0027t count the number of times he had shown Entreri the quickest route to a target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was that nasty situation with Mancas Tiveros, a fellow mage. \"Mancas the Mighty,\" the other wizards of Calimport had called him, and they had pitied LaValle when he and Mancas fell into dispute concerning the origins of a particular spell. Both had claimed credit for the discovery, and everyone waited for an expected war of magic to erupt. But Mancas suddenly and unexplainedly went away, leaving a note disclaiming his role in the spell\u0027s creation and giving full credit to LaValle. Mancas had never been seen again - in Calimport or anywhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, well,\" LaValle sighed, turning back to his crystal ball. Artemis Entreri had his uses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the room opened, and Pook stuck his head back in. \"Send a messenger to the carpenter\u0027s guild,\" he said to LaValle. \"Tell them that we shall need several skilled men immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaValle tilted his head in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The harem and treasury are to stay,\" Pook said emphatically, feigning frustration over his wizard\u0027s inability to see the logic. \"And certainly I am not conceding my chamber!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaValle frowned as he thought he began to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor am I about to tell Artemis Entreri that he cannot have his own room back,\" said Pook. \"Not after he has performed his mission so excellently!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" said the wizard glumly, thinking himself relegated once again to the lower levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So a sixth room must be built,\" laughed Pook, enjoying his little game. \"Between Entreri\u0027s and the harem.\" He winked again at his valued assistant. \"You may design it yourself, my dear LaValle. And spare no expense!\" He shut the door and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard wiped the moisture from his eyes. Pook always surprised him, but never disappointed him. \"You are a generous master, my Pasha Pook,\" he whispered to the empty room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd truly Pasha Pook was a masterful leader as well, for LaValle turned back to his crystal ball, his teeth gritted in determination. He would find Entreri and the halfling. He wouldn\u0027t disappoint his generous master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-halfling-s-gem-the-icewind-dale-trilogy-3/page-9.html","bookId":2104,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:48:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:48:44 PM"}
