But she still looks amazing. Now that she and Trick are a sort-of item, she doesn’t dress for anyone but him anymore. I’ll admit it. It’s kinda sweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wear a bright canary yellow dress. It comes a little above my knees, has long sleeves and is tight. It hugs my curves. You would think I’d look like a clown wearing a yellow dress with bright red hair but, somehow, it works. I can’t wear underwear under this dress, it shows the lines. So I decide, for one night, to go without.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel bare. And icky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finish my look with light yellow strappy pumps. My makeup is done using a little eyeliner, a lot of mascara and pale pink lipstick. My hair falls in waves down my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love this dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tina went on her scouting trip earlier this year, she sent me a picture of this dress and I knew immediately I had to have it. I begged and pleaded with her to get it. Then I demanded, I mean asked, she ordered ten, and within two weeks on the racks, they were sold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we’re ready to go, we hop in the cab I called for and we’re off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToot toot!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t wait! I’m on the prowl tonight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess subconsciously I am peacocking with my outfit. I mentally pray that I don’t look like an abstract Picasso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cab pulls up to The White Rabbit and we whoop as we exit. B-Rock, the huge African American bald doorman, chuckles and shakes his head when he sees us. We approach and he says, “I thought I recognized that craziness. Damn, you girls are looking good tonight. Give B-Rock some love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile big. We do this every weekend. B-Rock likes to act up a little and we love him so much that we play along. He looks like a bear, but he’s a total kitten. And he’s adorable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all take turns kissing his cheek and head on into the club. We’re VIPs at The White Rabbit. We never pay for a thing and have the largest booth in the VIP section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the only place aside from my apartment that I can let go and unwind after a rough week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe White Rabbit is, by far, the most awesome club I’ve ever been to. The theme is Alice in Wonderland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow cool is that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitresses all wear short Alice costume dresses with thigh high white stocking and white pumps. They rock long white blonde wigs and dramatic pale makeup. The whole club has a whimsical feel to it. But apart from that, it’s a regular club with drinks and good music. There are two floors, upstairs is VIP and downstairs is the regular club area. Downstairs is set in the shape of the letter U. Booths and tables line the outer area, the bar is the entire back of the room and the dance floor is lowered slightly. VIP consists of different shaped booths which are soft leather and crazy comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line for entry is always down the street and the dance floor is always packed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess you could say Nik does well for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hold hands and make our way up the stairs to the VIP section. The regular Asian Alice greets us. “Hi ladies, come on through.” We decline her offer to show us to our booth. We’ve been coming here for over a year. We know where to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the staff know us by name. Every time I’m here I feel like a celebrity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe approach our booth, which seats ten, and I spot Nik and Tina. Tina sits on Nik’s lap and they talk with their faces close together. Smiling like idiots. I resist the urge to roll my eyes. The truth is I’m so happy for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plonk down next to them with a huge smile and feign annoyance, “God, can’t you guys get a room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina smiles, leans forward and kisses my cheek. Nik kisses my other cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re a Nat sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik replies with a smile, “If you knew how little quality time I get with my wife now that Tats is around, you wouldn’t even go there, sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina responds, “Sad but true, honey.” She smiles. “She’s so worth it though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and tell them, “Oh, yeah. If she’s anything like her favorite Teta Nat, she’s going to be awesome.” We all laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the seat depress, an arm goes around my shoulders, and I’m pulled into a hard body. I grin. Lips touch my ear. “Remind me why we never hooked up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle then straighten before turning to Max and play-think. I scrunch my face, tilt my head and look up. I reply, “Because we’re friends?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax smirks and says a resigned, “Oh, yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help but chuckle. Max and I flirt all the time. We both know we’ll never be more than friends but it’s fun and he’s gorgeous. Max and Nik look alike. Nik is built a little bigger than Max though, but they both have an olive skin tone, dark hair, muscular bodies, amber-colored eyes and big white smiles with a single dimple. Trick also looks like them, being cousins and all, but he’s a little shorter and has hazel eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRidiculously hot. All of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrick arrives at the booth and Lola pounces on him. He chuckles and whispers something into her ear. She takes his hand and they walk away. I smirk. One guess what they’ll be doing in half a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate my stupid ass for looking out for Ghost. And just when I give up, I spot him at the VIP bar with a dark-haired pretty woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest aches. I absently rub at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and tell the others I’m going to the downstairs bar. Mimi and Tina smile knowingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yeah, babies. On the prowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I walk away, my heel catches and I stumble. I’m falling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, crap!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArms close around my waist and hold me firmly. The person helps me steady myself and asks, “Are you alright?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brush the hair from out of my face, look up and almost choke on my tongue. In front of me stands a man. A tall, built, very good-looking man. He has blue eyes and black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stammer, “Ahhh- I- Ye- Uh huh.” He smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a smile it is. It’s wide and showcases his perfect white teeth. I like a man with great teeth. His eyes crinkle in the corners. The smile transforms his face. He’s gorgeous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t believe it but I’m blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles, lets go of me, then offers his hand. “I’m Cole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawwwwt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m suddenly a little shy. I put my hand in his and respond quietly, “I’m Nat.” I avoid his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill holding my hand, he lowers his smiling face to look into mine and asks, “Would you like to get a drink with me, Nat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite my lip to stop my smile. He looks at my bottom lip and stops smiling. I quickly release my lip and reply softly, “Yes. I’d love that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile forms on his face as he pulls me closer and holds my hand as we walk down the stairs together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sure didn’t take long!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you work at the clothing store across the street, you’re twenty-eight, you’re of a Croatian background and you’re very single?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSipping on my cosmopolitan, I nod my head. “Yep. That’s me in a nutshell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole smiles. “Well, me in a nutshell would be pretty short too. I’m thirty-two, all American. I live downtown. I’m a personal trainer and I’m also very single.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncomplicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust what I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and lift my drink. “To being very single.” He smiles and touches his drink to mine. We sip and I feel a hand on my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill smiling, I look up to see Ghost looking blankly at me. “I need to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him in disbelief for a moment before I hiss, “Now? Right now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at Cole and I’m not sure what happened to the guy I was sitting with a minute ago. Gone is the friendly smile and in its place is a glower. His brows have dropped; he looks terrifying. His grip on his glass is so tight I’m afraid he’ll break it. Cole’s voice is dead calm as he asks, “Is there a problem here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Ghost has a chance to answer, I respond, “No. Ash is my neighbor. He probably just got some of my mail again?” I look at Ghost with pleading eyes. “Right, Ash?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost’s face has softened slightly and he looks me in the eye when he replies, “Yeah. Sure.” He doesn’t sound convincing so I act up a bit. I put my hand on his arm and smile. “I’ll come by tomorrow and get it. Say hi to Tasha for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I mention Tasha, Ghost’s eyes turn hard and he replies quietly, “Yeah, whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as he walks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did he need to talk to me about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole breaks my thoughts. “So, he’s your neighbor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up, I see he’s clearly confused. He toys with his drink and looks absently through his glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and exaggerate my reply. “Oh yeah! We’ve known each other a while now. In fact, just the other night I had to go over there to tell him and his lady friend to keep the noise down. If you get what I mean?” I wink and smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding dawns on his face. He chuckles and rubs the back of his neck. “Oh, I thought he was coming on to you. I didn’t like that. I mean, I was sitting right here.” He looks sheepish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle. “No. We aren’t like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes my hand and plays with my fingers. “Good, because I was planning on asking you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile then bite my lip. I clear my throat and admit, “Well, it’s a good thing I’d say yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole smiles his brilliant smile and agrees, “Yeah. That is a good thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get home from the club, I’m smiling like an idiot and feel so light, I practically float right through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up staying a little later than normal. I glance at my phone for the time. 3:17am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYikes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, a lot later than normal! But Cole is so dreamy! And I’m seeing him again Monday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill smiling like a complete dork, I kick off my shoes and drop my purse on the counter. I walk over to my room, undress and walk to the bathroom buck-naked. I dress in my jammies, walk back to my room and flick on the lamp. And I squeal my freakin’ head off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost is lying on my bed with his hands crossed behind his head. And the ass is smirking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw me naked!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yell, “You saw me naked!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles wider, bites the tip of his tongue and nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I love when he does the tongue thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy blood boils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up a shoe and throw it at him. He moves to avoid it and rolls right off the bed. I burst out laughing. I laugh long and so hard I have tears streaming down my face. I open my eyes and spy Ghost on the floor rubbing his head. I walk over to him and still chuckling, ask, “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowls but smiles. “Yeah.” Then he stands and says, “Now that you’re home, we can talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost breaking into my apartment doesn’t even worry me. He did the same to Tina, like, a gazillion times. He’s some big-shot security guy, so I guess he knows enough about locks and alarms to bypass them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, I flop onto my bed face-down and utter, “It’s so late, Ghost. Can’t we talk tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis comes out muffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bed depresses. “No. We talk now. It’s important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up and Ghost is lying next to me with his arms behind his head, staring up at the ceiling. His arms look perfectly delicious in the black uniform tee he wears and I inwardly curse him. I exhale loudly and give in. “Okay. What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks suddenly nervous and mutters, “About Tasha…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him off, “Not my business. Next topic of discussion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost nods and goes on, “I think you should rethink this avoiding each other business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my body so I’m on my side. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost turns to look at me and states firmly, “Because it’s selfish of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the feck?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and explains, “For seven months all our friends have been divided and I don’t like it. We live next door to each other, so grow the hell up and get over whatever it is that stops us from talking because I’ve had it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage coils in my gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shout, “I’m not selfish!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods his head. “Okay, fine. Show me you aren’t. Let’s stop avoiding each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain wanders as he says this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat could go wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could begin to feel things for him. Gooey, icky things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen don’t sleep with him again, stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are his intentions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat and ask, “What are your intentions, Ghost?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns to face me and looks uneasy. He frowns and sniffs his reply, “I don’t know. Be friends or some shit.” He finishes with a small shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriends with Ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can do friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a minute silence, I respond quietly. “Yeah, okay. We can be friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost blinks and slides off my bed. He turns off my lamp, covers me with the quilt and whispers, “Night, Nat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. “Night, Ghost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll is right in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo use crying over stolen milk\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes open wide and I stiffen. I pull the covers up to my chin and listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone’s in my kitchen!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one has a key to this place yet, so I come to the conclusion I’m being robbed. I grab my phone and slowly edge off the bed, being careful not to make a sound. I dial 911 on my cell on hold my thumb over the green call button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMental note: buy mace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peek down the hall and see a man’s body hanging out of my refrigerator. Luckily, the refrigerator door is in the way so he can’t see me. I creep as quietly as I can down the hall, into the kitchen then slam the refrigerator door into the man as hard as I can. The man gets squished and makes an Oomph sound. I run to the door, unlock it, go out into the hall and bang on Ghost’s door as loudly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body trembles. I’m scared to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper shakily, “Please be home. Please be home.” I lose patience and shriek, “Ghost! Open the door! Please be home!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-thy-neighbour-friend-zoned-2/page-4.html","bookId":2799,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:42:29 PM"}
