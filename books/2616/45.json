We\u0027ve scared him shitless. He will respect us and our territory even more now.” Cian was grinning with satisfaction as the Master of San Antonio looked after the car with desperate fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can try.” Amaliya rolled down the window. “Hey! Hey! Dead guys!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead stopped their assault and turned as one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCian felt his skin crawl at the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go back to the earth and rest,” she ordered waving her hand at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, the dead began to sink back into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It worked,” Amaliya whispered. “I can do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSantos fell to his knees in shock and stared at Amaliya in terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCian gave the man a curt nod, then he turned the car around. It sped down through the gates and away from the great house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya waited until they were on the highway before slugging Cian as hard as she could. The Mercedes veered sharply to the left. Luckily, a car wasn\u0027t traveling in that lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell was that for?” Cian demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dumping my ass here in San Antonio! What the hell was that all about?” She was furious. The pain in her face and chest were a throbbing reminder of Santos\u0027 lack of hospitality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not do that,” Cian said to her sharply. “You should know that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wanted me gone so you could marry Samantha! You told me that yourself! You could have just told me to get the hell out of Austin and I would have!” she screamed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you just miss the fact I rescued you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was more like I rescued myself and you just happened to be there,” she huffed, and restrained herself from slugging him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I came to rescue you,” he said with a growl in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, my face hurts.” She moaned and laid her forehead against the dashboard. “You could have shown up before they pummeled my face into the ground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I called Santos as soon as I heard where you were,” he said in a gentler tone, and his hand stroked her back gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, Roberto dumped me, huh? Or was it Sam?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roberto was trying to protect me,” Cian admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmaliya lifted her head up to see they were heading back to Austin not via I-35, but US 281. She knew from her time living in Austin that it would loop them around through the outskirts of Hill Country up to US-290 so they would enter Austin from the West, not the South.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why this way?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to feed. We can pull over out here easier. Plus it’s darker. No continuous city lights,” he explained to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling back in the chair, she ran her hands over her arms. She was feeling hungry, but she was angry. “Look, just let me off somewhere. Give me whatever cash you have and I\u0027m going to just head out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. You\u0027re going back to Austin with me after you feed,” he said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re not the boss of me,” she said through gritted teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sick of all of this crap and she just wanted to get away. Just runaway and be done with it. She\u0027d call her Grandmama and tell her where to get the Lincoln.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am now. You\u0027re not going anywhere. We need to prepare for The Summoner. Now that you\u0027ve shown you have his powers twice, he\u0027s going to be coming for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCian\u0027s voice sounded very sure of this and it sent a chill down her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t even know how I did it!” She wasn\u0027t even really sure that she had summoned up the dead. But if she hadn\u0027t done, then why would have they gone back into the earth when she ordered it? Lightly, she touched her broken cheekbone and shivered at the sharp stab of pain. She was definitely healing slowly and she was famished. Crossing her arms over her stomach, she curled up in the car seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn\u0027t matter if you know how you did it or not, he\u0027ll come for you for now. I don\u0027t think he ever anticipated that you inherited some of his ability. I know I never heard of this happening before. I certainly cannot control the dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared out the window at the dark landscape rushing past them. Tears were threatening to fall, as her face pulsed with pain. Her hunger grew. When she had said the words that Cian now called a curse, she had felt something drain out of her body and into the ground below her. It was as if a thread had been pulled and a piece of her had quickly unraveled. When she had taken back her words, she had felt it snap back. Now she was keenly aware of the shadow wound inside of her that could call to the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My Grandmama sees the dead,” she said. “That is why she was suspicious of me. She sees the dead so clearly, they are like living beings to her. My grandfather was terrified, so she stopped talking about it. When she was a little girl, she used to help ghosts cross over. That\u0027s why she is addicted to those stupid TV shows with mediums and ghosts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then, maybe that\u0027s why its been different for you,” Cian suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked toward him and saw that he was deep in thought. He looked different tonight with his much longer hair and a goatee. “My life is seriously fucked up, isn\u0027t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Both of our lives are.” His hands were gripping the steering wheel tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll leave when we get to Austin.” She felt a little calmer now. He had come to San Antonio for her and dumping her seemed like something Roberto would do. Tie her up, shove her in a trashcan and leave her out for the San Antonio vamps to play with. “I\u0027ll get Grandmama\u0027s car and head to Mexico. Unless they\u0027re as crazy as you guys are about territory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Worse,” Cian informed her with a sigh. “It\u0027s a constant struggle for control down there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then maybe Canada,” she decided. She could feel her sharp teeth brushing against her bruised lips and she ran a finger over them thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay in Austin,” Cian said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re getting married,” she pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lapsed into silence and she curled up even tighter. Her body hurt like crazy. There were still a lot of cars on the road, but they would soon thin out as they got further out of San Antonio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must have dozed for awhile for she was startled when he pulled over onto the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to drink,” he said, and slashed his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell of his blood overwhelmed her. Without hesitating, she leaned over and gripped his arm between her hands and covered the gash with her mouth. Sucking hard, she drew his blood into her in a wonderful cool rush. It wasn\u0027t as warm as a mortal\u0027s would be, but it was rich and full of the life she needed. She gasped as the blood began to flow through her and her body began to tingle as she healed. She felt Cian\u0027s hand slide into her hair and she giggled, blood almost coming out her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he whispered in a raspy voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If anyone saw us they\u0027d think I was giving you a blow job,” she said, and bit into his wrist again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite his earlier seriousness, Cian\u0027s laughter filled the car. It even broke the tension between them a little as the deliciousness of the moment filled them. The more she drank, the more she felt entangled in him and soon wanted to climb on top of him and devour him in other ways. His fingers in her hair tightened and slowly drew her head back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t hesitate to kiss him back when he covered her mouth with his and her hands clung to his shoulders. It felt so good to heal and it felt so good to feel fully alive again. His tongue licked the blood from her lips and he drew back reluctantly. Slowly, she sank back into her seat and ran her hands over her now healed face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCian looked a little pale as he sucked on his wrist so it would heal more quickly. There was a disquieting atmosphere in the car as they both retreated into their own thoughts. Amaliya had no idea what was on his mind, but she was still thinking about blood and sex. Unfortunately, she was also thinking about him being engaged and as annoying as Samantha was, she appeared to love him very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith The Summoner somewhere out there, she had no desire to stick around anyway. She knew that if she stayed around, it would only put Cian in more danger and she was done with doing that. She\u0027d grab the car and the phone her grandmother had given her that was still at the apartment and she\u0027d bail. Simple as that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, Cian shifted gears and the car sped back into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence on the trip back to Austin had been stifling. They had both retreated into their corners and avoided even looking at each other. Amaliya had the distinct feeling they were both gearing up for the big argument they both knew was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached downtown Austin, she finally looked toward him to see that his jaw was set in a harsh line. It made her feel agitated and she looked away sharply. He parked in the parking garage and she was out of the car before the engine died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amaliya,” Cian said from behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked to the elevator and punched the button. Turning, she rested her hands on her hips. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to talk.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-45.html","bookId":2616,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:50:17 PM"}
