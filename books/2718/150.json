He presses the barrel of his gun into my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s crazy,” Employee #221 says. “Call security again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roger that.” Employee #741 speaks into his walkie-talkie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGonzo has heard. He looks a little sad as he nods. There’s not much I can do without alerting the guys to his presence. And so I put up my palm. It’s not really a wave, not a goodbye or a hello, just a hand, a Hey, I see you. He gives me a palm right back. I see you, too. And then he does what he should; he folds into the swarm of people trying to have a good time and make a few memories, just another face in the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re taking him in for processing,” Employee #741 says, and I know what that means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat is tight and my eyes sting. I’m close to crying. I’ve gotten all the way here just to fail at the last minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I ask you something? What do you guys think you’re going to accomplish with all this? I mean, honestly, how can you prepare for the unpredictable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just shut up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sit me down, and suddenly, I’m pissed. Fuck this. I will not shut up. “It’s a small world after all …,” I sing. “It’s a small world after all. …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing? Stop singing,” the agent commands, and it just makes me angrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“… a small, small world!” I sing even louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I love it when they give you entertainment in line,” a lady in a big sun hat says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy hits me hard with the gun. I double over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” a guy in line says. “What are you doing? He’s a kid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir, we’re with United Snow Globe Wholesalers, working to protect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay out of it, pal. Let the pros handle it,” another guy in line advises the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly,” Employee #457 says. “This is a matter of security.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. It’s a matter of abuse,” the dad says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep singing. “… world of laughter, a world of tears …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kids don’t know what’s going on. But they know the song. And they start to sing along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s it, kids!” I shout. “We’re putting this on TV, so everybody needs to grab a partner and sing really, really loud!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mention of TV, the line goes nuts. The USGW vigilantes aren’t expecting this. And that’s all I need. Okay, coyote mofo man. Get your anvil ready. Come and get my road-runner ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bolt for Tomorrowland and hope my legs hold out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey! Stop!” the agents yell behind me. “Don’t make us shoot!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe can’t shoot me. I’m a kid. And this is Disney World. There’s no shooting at Disney World. Beside me, there’s a blinding flash, and a family of four buying cotton candy becomes an instant plastic tableaux behind glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast as I can, I duck around the Mad Tea Party ride; darting in and out of the crowds, I make it past the Speedway, and finally I can see colorful planets of Tomorrowland. Shit. I’m gasping for breath. Vision’s blurry. Behind me, I can hear screaming and shouts. The snow globe men are close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lines for everything are twenty minutes deep at least. Except for the Tomorrowland Transit Authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me!” I shout, staggering up the ramp, pushing past the few people in line. Before anyone can object, I hop onto the moving conveyor belt, past the attendant, who can only get out a lame “Hey, watch it” as I fall into the seat of the tram. I stay low, out of sight as the little tram glides into a tunnel toward the Carousel of Progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart’s beating as fast as the drum break in “Cypress Grove Blues.” I’m alert, eyes peeled, ears open, totally awake and alive. I’m waiting for a signal, a sign that I’m in the right place. A narrator’s voice drones into the darkness. He sounds like he should be selling cars in an old newsreel. The train slows in front of a window showing a diorama of Tomorrowland. The narrator tells us this is a vision of the future: a place where people can live, work, and play in harmony. Some posters show machines that do things for you. Robots. The standard-issue sci-fi stuff. I guess at one point this was cutting-edge. It was a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tram jolts around a corner, and suddenly, the tunnel goes totally dark. I can’t see my hand in front of my face. It makes my pulse jump in my throat. Is this it? Are they coming for me? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/going-bovine/page-150.html","bookId":2718,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM"}
