I did,\" I say, trying to calm her. \"Oh. Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you go to college, Victor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Literally or figuratively?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there a difference with you?\" she asks. \"How can you be so dense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, baby. It\u0027s some kind of gene displacement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t listen to this. You complain about Baxter Priestly\u0027s name and yet you know people named Huggy and Pidgeon and Na Na.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I finally snap, \"and you slept with Charlie Sheen. We all have our little faults.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should\u0027ve just had dinner with Baxter,\" she mutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, come on, a little champagne, a little sorbet. I\u0027m rolling a joint so we can calm down. Now, who is this Baxter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You met him at a Knicks game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god that\u0027s right-the new male waif, underfed, wild-haired, major rehab victim.\" I immediately shut up, glance nervously over at Chloe, then segue beautifully into: \"The whole grunge aesthetic has ruined the look of the American male, baby. It makes you long for the \u002780s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only you would say that, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, I\u0027m always watching you flirt with John-John at Knicks games.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you wouldn\u0027t dump me for Daryl Hannah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I\u0027d dump you for John-John if I really wanted the publicity.\" Pause, mid-lick, looking up. \"That\u0027s not, um, a possibility... is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stares at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab her. \"Come here, baby.\" I kiss her again, my cheek now damp because Chloe\u0027s hair is always wet and slicked back with coconut oil. \"Baby? Why isn\u0027t your hair ever dry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVideo cameras from Fashion TV sweep the room and I have to get Cliff to tell Eric to make sure they come nowhere near Chloe. M People turns into mid-period Elvis Costello which turns into new Better Than Ezra. I order a bowl of raspberry sorbet and try to cheer Chloe up by turning it into a Prince song: \"She ate a raspberry sorbet... The kind you find at the Bowery Bar...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe just stares glumly at her plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, that\u0027s a plate of cilantro. What\u0027s the story?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been up since five and I want to cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how was the big lunch at Fashion Cafe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to sit there and watch James Truman eat a giant truffle and it really really bothered me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because... you wanted a truffle too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Victor. Oh god, you don\u0027t get anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, baby, spare me. What do you want me to do? Hang around Florence for a year studying Renaissance pottery? You get your legs waxed at Elizabeth Arden ten times a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sit around plotting seating arrangements.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby baby baby.\" I light up the joint, whining. \"Come on, my DJ\u0027s missing, the club\u0027s opening tomorrow, I have a photo shoot, a f**king show and lunch with my father tomorrow.\" Pause. \"Oh shit-band practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is your father?\" she asks disinterestedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A contrivance,\" I mutter. \"A plot device.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy Siegal walks by in taffeta and I duck under the table with my head in Chloe\u0027s lap, looking up into her face, grinning, while taking a deep toke. \"Peggy wanted to handle the publicity,\" I explain, sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChloe just stares at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So-o-o anyway,\" I continue. \"James Truman eating a giant truffle? The lunch? `Entertainment Tonight,\u0027 yes-go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was so hip I ate,\" I hear her say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you eat?\" I murmur indifferently, waving over at Frederique, who pouts her lips, eyes squinty, like she was cooing to a baby or a very large puppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ached, ached, Victor. Oh god, you never listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joking, baby. I\u0027m joking. I really see what you\u0027re saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at me, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, your hip ached and-have I got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stares at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay, reality just zapped me...\" I take another toke, glance nervously at her. \"So-o-o the video shoot tomorrow, um, what is it exactly?\" Pause. \"Are you, like, naked in it or anything?\" Pause, another toke, then I c**k my head to exhale smoke so it won\u0027t hit her in the face. \"Er... what\u0027s the story?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-17.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
