Not to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they really act like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes. All the time. It\u0027s a basic human trait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse knew the dragon could read at least the upper levels of his mind. They resonated in terrible harmony. And he could see the mighty thoughts behind the eyes in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon was horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry,” said Wonse weakly. “That\u0027s just how we are. It\u0027s all to do with survival, I think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will be no mighty warriors sent to kill me? it thought, almost plaintively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo heroes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not any more. They cost too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I will be eating people!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse whimpered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the sensation of the dragon rummaging around in his mind, trying to find a clue to understanding. He half-saw, half-sensed the flicker of random images, of dragons, of the mythical age of reptiles and-and here he felt the dragon\u0027s genuine astonishment-of some of the less commendable areas of human history, which were most of it. And after the astonishment came the baffled anger. There was practically nothing the dragon could do to people that they had not, sooner or later, tried on one another, often with enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have the effrontery to be squeamish, it thought at him. But we were dragons. We were supposed to be cruel, cunning, heartless and terrible. But this much I can tell you, you ape-the great face pressed even closer, so that Wonse was staring into the pitiless depths of its eyes-we never burned and tortured and ripped one another apart and called it morality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon stretched its wings again, once or twice, and then dropped heavily on to the tawdry assortment of mildly precious things. Its claws scrabbled at the pile. It sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA three-legged lizard wouldn\u0027t hoard this lot, it thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There will be better things,” whispered Wonse, temporarily relieved at the change in direction. There had better be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I-” Wonse hesitated-“can I ask you a question?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don\u0027t need to eat people, surely? I think that\u0027s the only problem from people\u0027s point of view, you see,” he added, his voice speeding up to a gabble. “The treasure and everything, that doesn\u0027t have to be a problem, but if it\u0027s just a matter of, well, protein, then perhaps it has occurred to a powerful intellect such as your own that something less controversial, like a cow, might-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon breathed a horizontal streak of fire that calcined the opposite wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeed? Need? it roared, when the sound had died away. You talk to me of need? Isn \u0027t it the tradition that the finest flower of womanhood should be sent to the dragon to ensure peace and prosperity ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, you see, we have always been moderately peaceful and reasonably prosperous-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDO YOU WANT THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS TO CONTINUE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe force of the thought drove Wonse to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” he managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon stretched its claws luxuriantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the need is not mine, it is yours, it thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow get out of my sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonse sagged as it left his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon slithered over the cut-price hoard, leapt up on to the ledge of one of the hall\u0027s big windows, and smashed the stained glass with its head. The multicoloured image of a city father cascaded into the other debris below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long neck stretched out into the early evening air, and turned like a seeking needle. Lights were coming on across the city. The sound of a million people being alive made a muted, deep thrumming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon breathed deeply, joyfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it hauled the rest of its body on to the ledge, shouldered the remains of the window\u0027s frame aside, and leapt into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was vaguely round, of a woodish texture, and when struck made a noise like a ruler plucked over the edge of a desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Colon tapped it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I give in,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot proudly lifted it out of the battered packaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s a cake,” he said, shoving both hands under the thing and raising it with some difficulty. “From my mother.” He managed to put it on the table without trapping his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you eat it?” said Nobby. “It\u0027s taken months to get here. You\u0027d think it would go stale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, it\u0027s to a special dwarfish recipe,” said Carrot. “Dwarfish cakes don\u0027t go stale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Colon gave it another sharp rap. “I suppose not,” he conceded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s incredibly sustaining,” said Carrot. “Practically magical. The secret has been handed down from dwarf to dwarf for centuries. One tiny piece of this and you won\u0027t want anything to eat all day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get away?” said Colon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A dwarf can go hundreds of miles with a cake like this in his pack,” Carrot went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet he can,” said Colon gloomily, “I bet all the time he\u0027d be thinking, \u0027Bloody hell, I hope I can find something else to eat soon, otherwise it\u0027s the bloody cake again.\u0027 ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot, to whom the word irony meant something to do with metal, picked up his pike and after a couple of impressive rebounds managed to cut the cake into approximately four slices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There we are,” he said cheerfully. “One for each of us, and one for the captain.” He realised what he had said. “Oh. Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” said Colon flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in silence for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I liked him,” said Carrot. “I\u0027m sorry he\u0027s gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was some more silence, very similar to the earlier silence but even deeper and more furrowed with depression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I expect you\u0027ll be made captain now,” said Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon started. “Me? I don\u0027t want to be captain! I can\u0027t do the thinking. It\u0027s not worth all that thinking, just for another nine dollars a month.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drummed his fingers on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that all he got?” said Nobby. “I thought officers were rolling in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nine dollars a month,” said Colon. “I saw the pay scales once. Nine dollars a month and two dollars plumes allowance. Only he never claimed that bit. Funny, really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wasn\u0027t the plumes type,” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re right,” said Colon. “The thing about the captain, see, I read this book once . . . you know we\u0027ve all got alcohol in our bodies . . . sort of natural alcohol? Even if you never touch a drop in your life, your body sort of makes it anyway ... but Captain Vimes, see, he\u0027s one of those people whose body doesn\u0027t do it naturally. Like, he was born two drinks below normal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gosh,” said Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes ... so, when he\u0027s sober, he\u0027s really sober. Knurd, they call it. You know how you feel when you wake up if you\u0027ve been on the piss all night, Nobby? Well, he feels like that all the time. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poor bugger,” said Nobby. “I never realised. No wonder he\u0027s always so gloomy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So he\u0027s always trying to catch up, see. It\u0027s just that he doesn\u0027t always get the dose right. And, of course-” Colon glanced at Carrot-\u0027 \u0027he was brung low by a woman. Mind you, just about anything brings him low.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what do we do now, Sergeant?” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And do you think he\u0027d mind if we eat his cake?” said Carrot wistfully. “It\u0027d be a shame to let it go stale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older men sat in miserable silence as Carrot macerated his way through the cake like a bucket-wheel rockcrusher in a chalk pit. Even if it had been the lightest of souffles they wouldn\u0027t have had any appetite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were contemplating life without the captain. It was going to be bleak, even without dragons. Say what you liked about Captain Vimes, he\u0027d had style. It was a cynical, black-nailed style, but he\u0027d had it and they didn\u0027t. He could read long words and add up. Even that was style, of a sort. He even got drunk in style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d been trying to drag the minutes out, trying to stretch out the time. But the night had come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no hope for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were going to have to go out on the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was six of the clock. And all wasn\u0027t well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I miss Errol, too,” said Carrot\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was the captain\u0027s, really,” said Nobby. “Anyway, Lady Ramkin\u0027ll know how to look after him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s not as though we could leave anything around, either,” said Colon. “I mean, even the lamp oil. He even drank the lamp oil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And mothballs,” said Nobby. “A whole box of mothballs. Why would anyone want to eat mothballs? And the kettle. And sugar. He was a devil for sugar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was nice, though,” said Carrot. “Friendly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I\u0027ll grant you,” said Colon. “But it\u0027s not right, really, a pet where you have to jump behind a table every time it hiccups.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I shall miss his little face,” said Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobby blew his nose, loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was echoed by a hammering on the door. Colon jerked his head. Carrot got up and opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of members of the palace guard were waiting with arrogant impatience. They stepped back when they saw Carrot, who had to bend a bit to see under the lintel; bad news like Carrot travels fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027ve brung you a proclamation,” said one of them. “You\u0027ve got to-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027s all that fresh paint on your breastplate?” said Carrot politely. Nobby and the sergeant peered around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s a dragon,” said the younger of the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The dragon,” corrected his superior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ \u0027Ere, I know you,” said Nobby. \u0027You\u0027re Skully Maltoon. Used to live in Mincing Street. Your mum made cough sweets, din\u0027t she, and fell in the mixture and died. I never have a cough sweet but I think of your mum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hallo, Nobby,” said the guard, without enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I bet your old mum\u0027d be proud of you, you with a dragon on your vest,” said Nobby conversationally. The guard gave him a look made of hatred and embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And new plumes on your hat, too,” Nobby added sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This here is a proclamation what you are commanded to read,” said the guard loudly. “And post up on street corners also. By order.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whose?” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Colon grabbed the scroll in one ham-like fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where As,” he read slowly, tracing the lettering with a hesitant finger, “It hathe Pleas-Sed the Der-Rer-Aa-Ger-the dragon, Ker-Ii-king of kings and Aa-Ber-Ess-Uh-Ler-” sweat beaded on the broad pink cliff of his forehead-“absolute, that is, Rer-Uh-Ler-Eh-Rer, ruler of-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lapsed into the tortured silence of academia, his fingertip jerking slowly down the parchment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said at last. “That\u0027s not right, is it? It\u0027s not going to eat someone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Consume,” said the older guard. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-37.html","bookId":1627,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM"}
