Willing myself to be unseen, I was able to navigate through the throng of guests with ease. I reached the far end of the party just as Laura disappeared into the monastery ruins with Dietrich and her friends. I should not have been surprised that the ruins would be a lure for the younger and more daring of the party attendees. It was an imposing sight in the moonlight. A perfect place to hide and seek, or for an indiscreet dalliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, unsure if I should follow, when I saw the other young man and Laura’s companion dart out of the ruins, both of them laughing like conspirators. Realizing that Laura was left alone in the dark with a young man who seemed far too rambunctious to be of any good character, I rushed toward the ruins. As I neared the fallen structures, a sudden panic seized me. This had once been a holy place. Since my nature was corrupted by Vlad, perhaps I could not enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting my dress and petticoats, I steeled my determination and took a step into the darkness enshrouding the ruins. Fire did not rain down upon me, nor did I feel the terrible disquiet that fills me whenever I am near a holy place. Encouraged, I hurried past the decaying broken walls covered in moss and shadows, following the sound of voices. I soon realized that many young couples had stolen away into the ruins for romantic rendezvous. I caught glimpses of them out of the corner of my eye as they tried to hide away in the shadows for a moment of indiscretion. Laura was not among them, but I could hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeeper I plunged, darting through broken archways, down stone steps, and around collapsed walls. Fear began to unfurl within me as I remembered the horror that Vlad had inflicted when he had held me down and forced himself into my virgin body. I could not bear for Laura to be assaulted in the same manner. If what Csilla said was true, Dietrich was a person of low moral character. I would not allow him to hurt Laura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI burst through a thicket of trees and nearly tumbled down a stairway that led to a wide expanse of grass and broken walls. I released myself to the wind and let it catch me. Instead of falling, I floated to the bottom of the steps and landed with ease. Sweeping my gaze over my surroundings, I caught sight of a figure in white being drawn behind the remains of a tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, no,” Laura’s faint cry carried on the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dashed across the ruins, clutching my shawl tightly around my shoulders. Darting around the wall, I found Dietrich pressing Laura against the grubby stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a kiss,” he whispered in a voice that was deep with the desire for more than just a kiss. His hand was about her throat, pressing hard enough that she could not speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let her be,” I ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swiveled about and I saw that he was a handsome lad with a shock of brown hair and vivid blue eyes. “Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura’s gaze darted toward me as Dietrich slightly released the pressure on her throat. I was as surprised as Dietrich when Laura pushed against him with both hands. Startled, he stumbled back a few steps. Again, she shoved him, sending him sprawling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said no,” she shouted, breathing heavily, her face flushed with anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laura, let us depart.” I held out my hand and she hurried over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were supposed to be playing hide and seek,” she gasped, her hand moving to her bruised throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your friends abandoned the game. That is why I followed.” I slipped my arm about her waist and considered smashing the boy into the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thank you! I did not realize his intentions until he would not release my hand. Otherwise, I never would have come,” Laura said, her anger heating her words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You lie.” Dietrich rose to his feet and brushed off his clothing. “You came here of your own will to be with me. Everyone at the party saw us together and will know what happened here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisgusted by his words, I scoffed at him. “You are the liar! I saw what happened. She rebuffed you and pushed you off your very feet.” I glared at him, but kept my powers in check. I was relieved he had not the time to force himself upon her, but I was also proud that Laura had fought him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And who are you?” He scoffed at me. “Why would anyone listen to you? You’re just a girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am Countess Dracula.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDietrich visibly paled and he stumbled back as if in fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Laura is my friend,” I continued, uncertain as to why he was so afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t hurt her! I just wanted a kiss. I want to marry her! Do right by her!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to marry you!” Laura’s words were snapped off in an angry, bitter tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to marry someone! Allow me to win your heart.” Dietrich’s appeal was desperate and I almost felt a pang of sorrow for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no desire to marry any man.” Laura gathered up her skirts and rushed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed, my hand reaching out to steady her, for my vision at night was far superior. Now that we were away from her attacker, her tears began to flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could my friends betray me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart felt for her. “Perhaps they thought you had feelings for him and that they were performing some sort of favor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have told both numerous times that I had no interest in him or any other man and that I have no intention of ever getting married,” Laura replied. “I do not understand why they would disregard my desires.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps they believed you were playing a game with him. Many girls do enjoy a man’s pursuit of their affections.” In England many of the young ladies played elaborate games with the men they eventually married. I found the whole process tedious to a great degree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I am not one of those women. I do not want to marry. Ever. I do not want a man to rule over me and tell me how to live my life. Father says I will end up a bitter spinster. So be it! I would much rather live alone in my twilight years than have Dietrich as a husband!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tirade brought a smile to my lips, certain I had uttered similar words many times. “I cannot agree more. I never desired to marry either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why did you?” She stopped in mid-stride and looked at me, her dark eyes filled with curiosity. “Why did you marry that horrible man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, I lifted my eyes toward the moon. “I had no choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you don’t love him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I shook my head adamantly. “No. Never.” Unexpected tears filled my eyes. “I could never love him because...” I could not say the next words. How easily I had almost confessed to the brutal slayings of my family. I realized this folly and gathered my wits. “...he frightens me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He frightens everyone. I am terrified of him. How could you marry him if you are afraid of him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory of his beatings flitted through my mind, the taste of his blood, the brutality of his lovemaking, and his fearsome anger. “I suppose I had very little choice in the end.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see her disappointment and it wounded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laura, sometimes people are trapped by circumstances and they do the very best they can with the lot handed them. I am doing my very best. As you see, my husband is far away from here, and I am living my own life. I hope to maintain this as the norm. I have no desire to be anyone’s wife.” It was truth. To be a wife meant to be owned by a man. I desired to be loved and adored for who I am. Ignatius did not have to marry me to prove that he loved me. I merely needed his kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am determined not to give in to the plotting of my family or my friends.” Laura started to walk to the party. “I shall find my own way. Be my own woman. If I must, I shall find a way to support myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I hope you do exactly as you desire and do not suffer my fate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly she turned and seized my hands. “Truly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleasing me, she smiled slightly. “Then perhaps we shall be friends after all, Countess Dracula.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should very much like that,” I told her. “But call me Glynis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well, Glynis.” She tucked her arm around mine and together we returned to the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brilliance of the candles drew us back to the heart of the grand affair. I noted that Sir Stephan was startled to see his daughter at my side. I smiled sweetly at him as I strolled with Laura across the lawn toward the banquet beneath the tent canopies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem emerged from the throng of partygoers, his dark eyes swiftly appraising my condition and Laura’s. I could see the line of his shoulders relax as he fell into step beside me. “It is best, Countess, if you do not wander off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was merely spending time with a friend,” I answered briskly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura tilted her head to view Adem. Her eyes slightly widened as she took in his scarred face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember that your husband’s enemies are now your own and it is best to stay near the other revelers at the party.” Adem’s voice was low enough that I alone would hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you said Buda was safe? And where were you just now?” I was peeved at being chastised and my tone made this imminently clear. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-31.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
