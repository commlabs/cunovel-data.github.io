But in my mind, in this moment and all the moments that remain to me, I will honour her, as I honour Gesler and Stormy. They lived as brothers, they fell as brothers. I shall call them kin, and of the tasks awaiting me, I shall in turn strive to see this through .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDestriant, in your sorrow and grief – which I even now taste – I will seek to give meaning to their deaths .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wings shifted slightly at a sudden twist in the currents, and all at once the air seemed to thicken around the Shi’gal Assassin, filling with a strange susurration – heavy whispers, a sudden darkness that swarmed and swirled, blotting out the entire sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Gu’Rull realized that he would not be making this journey alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinter sat up, and then stood. She studied the sky – and there, to the east. A black cloud, vast and seething, growing. Growing. Gods below . ‘Everyone!’ she shouted. ‘Get under your shields! Take cover! Everyone!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Beloved children! Listen to your mother! Hear her words – the words of Crone! We took inside us his flesh! All that we could find! We kept it alive on the blood of sorcery! All for this moment! Rejoice, my sweet children, for the Fallen God is reborn! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Crone gave voice to her joy, and on all sides her children, in their tens of thousands, cried out in answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe winged K’Chain Che’Malle, clutching its precious prize, was buffeted by the cacophony, and Crone cackled in delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, she could sense the fragments of bone scattered on the knoll – the bones of dozens of people once interred in crypts within the barrow. Would they be enough? There was no choice. The moment had come, and they would take what was available to them. They would make a man. A poor man. A weak man. But a man nonetheless – they would make a home for the god’s flesh from these bones, and then fill it with their own blood, and it would have to be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Great Ravens whirled over the knoll, and then plunged downward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler threw himself behind the carved stela. The thunder of wings was deafening, crashing down, and the air grew hot and brittle. He felt the stone shuddering against his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething like fists struck the ground, concussive blows coming one after another. He clutched at his head, tried to block his ears, but it was no use. The world had vanished inside a storm of black wings. He was suffocating, and before his eyes small objects were flashing past, converging somewhere close to the sword. Splinters, bleached fragments – bones, pulled into the air, prised loose from tangles of grass and roots. One cut a vicious gouge across the back of his hand and he flinched it under cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho had voiced the warning?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever it had been, it had probably saved their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for me – I stayed too close to the sword. I should have gone down lower, with my soldiers. But I held back. I didn’t want to see their faces, didn’t want to feel this terrible love that takes a commander before battle – love for his soldiers, every one of them, that builds and ever builds, trying to shatter his heart .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy courage failed – and now —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu’Rull circled high overhead. He watched as the Great Ravens launched themselves at the knoll, saw the blooms of raw power erupt one after another. The black-winged creatures were sacrificing themselves, one by one, to return their god to living flesh – to make for his soul a mortal house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the birds swung up alongside him and he tracked her with his lower eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘K’Chain Che’Malle! I am Crone, mother of all these blessed children! You bring a gift!’ And she laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching for her mind, Gu’Rull recoiled at the first touch – so alien, so cold in its power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrone cackled. ‘Careful! We are anathema in this realm! Heed me well now – your task is not done. Beyond this gift you carry, you will be needed on the morrow. But I tell you this – in your moment of dire need, look again to the skies. Do you understand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I promised a most noble lord. I have sent my sweetest daughter far away, but she will return. You will see – she returns!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge raven banked up closer still. ‘Look below! They are almost all gone. We have waited for this all our lives – do you see what we have made? Do you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did. A figure, sprawled close to the Otataral sword, bound by chains to the earth. But its chest was a gaping hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu’Rull crooked his wings, plummeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrone followed, cackling madly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last of the other ravens plunged into the man’s body in a flash of lurid power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWings thundering to slow his descent, the Shi’gal landed straddling the man and looked down, appalled at this mockery the Great Ravens had made. Bent bones, twisted muscles, a sickly pallor, the face deformed as if by disease. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-431.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
