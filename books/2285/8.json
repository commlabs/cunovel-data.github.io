She shook her head but smiled tolerantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, Mama Cheever!” the younger woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s fine, Liz. Go save your spot.” There was something both matronly and businesslike about her. She wore western-style boots, jeans and a colorful cotton shirt. She’d seen Dustin arrive and was coming toward him. Her hair was pulled back in a severe bun. Maybe that was it. She had a long, sharp-featured face that rather resembled a giraffe’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agent Blake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sandra, Sandra Cheever. Or Mama Cheever, as you heard, which I still don’t get. I don’t cuddle patients, don’t tuck them in—I don’t even brew tea, for God’s sake. But I do handle the paperwork and the scheduling around here. We have everything we need except your signature for the files. These days—especially working with animals—we have to get waivers. But your office took care of everything else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s great. What do I do? Where do I start? I’m ready to sign.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands on her hips, she cast her head at an angle to study him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s good to hear your enthusiasm,” she told him. “I was afraid you’d be hostile to the situation—that it was a ‘come here or lose your job’ scenario.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m from Nashville, but you know that. You probably know everything about me,” Dustin said. “And I love horses. This sounded better than any other offer I’ve had, so yep. I’m enthusiastic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent. Then I’ll just bring you in to see Aaron. He’s our managing director.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted a hand to point at a door with a placard that read Aaron Bentley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just tap and go on in,” Sandra said, grimacing as they heard a loud squeal from the back. “I’m going to go supervise. They’re good kids. When they’re here, anyway. But...they can get a bit crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra hurried to the back. Dustin watched her go as he tapped on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come in, it’s open!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin stepped into the office. It was old-fashioned, to say the least. While the desk bore a laptop computer and a printer, an old blotter still sat on it, too, along with a memo tray piled high with papers. The room had two big leather-covered chairs in front of the desk and a worn couch to the rear. Windows looked out over one of the pastures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man standing behind the desk was about six feet tall, bearded and balding. His beard was neatly clipped; he seemed far better organized in his personal appearance than he did in his office management skills. Thin gold-rimmed glasses sat on his nose. He smiled seeing Dustin and walked around the desk, offering his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must be Agent Blake. I’m sorry. One of us should have been out there to greet you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, a nice woman named Sandra did greet me. And yes, I am. But please call me Dustin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We go by first names here, so that’s great. I’m Aaron. Aaron Bentley. We’re glad to have you here, Dustin. We’ve broken ground with many different groups, you know. About ten years ago, we started working with veterans—the physically wounded, and those who have wounded minds. We help children with disabilities, addicts of all ages, you name it—horse therapy can work wonders. But you’re our first law enforcement official. Let’s sit down for a moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron returned to the swivel chair behind his desk, while Dustin sank into one of the old leather armchairs. It was comfortable. As messy as the office might look, that apparent chaos actually contributed to a sense of ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I spoke with your supervisor, a Mr. Jackson Crow,” Aaron said, folding his hands in front of him. He didn’t glance at papers or fiddle with anything on his desk. He gave his absolute attention to Dustin. “He said you were having nightmares and that he believes you’re—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Burned out?” Dustin suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Experiencing one of those spells where you’re having trouble weighing the good you’re able to provide against the horrors you have to see. I admit, when I first got the call, I suspected you’d been involved in some dreadful situation where innocents had been killed. But he tells me you’re one of his best agents and that he wants you to take some time off. He also said you don’t do well with traditional psychiatrists or therapy and that he hopes this will work for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, did he tell you that?” Dustin murmured. He’d had a general idea of what Jackson Crow had planned on saying; he didn’t know how close to home it might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I smoked once, Aaron. Years ago. Cigarettes, I mean. I went to a hypnotist to stop. Thinking about water and staring at a bull’s-eye on the wall did nothing for me. I merely wanted to kill the hypnotist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, this isn’t like that, but...we do have group and individual therapy. We also do camping trips to the little brook a couple miles from here. You don’t have to think about the water—you can walk right into it if you choose. Frankly, I’m not sure we’ll be what you’re looking for, but we’re anxious to see if we can help men and women in your situation. If nothing else, a little R \u0026amp; R is always good for someone who is constantly under life-or-death tension.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad to be here. You know I live in northern Virginia—D.C. area, really—and I love it. But Nashville and these hills—well, this is home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good, good!” Aaron seemed genuinely pleased. “Now I should tell you that we’re in the middle of a real shake-up. We’ve just lost our founder—Marcus Danby. It’s a tough time for all of us. So...your people knew he was dead when they called. The fact that you wanted to go ahead, anyway, is a testament to Marcus. At any rate,” he said briskly, “I put you in with a small group this morning. I understand you met one of the kids, Joey, last night. Young man, acting out. Terrible loss in his family. Anyway, I won’t tell you any more. Come on out. I believe that Liv’s at the stables and the troops are gathering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they went out the front door, another man was coming in. Aaron paused to introduce the two of them. “Dustin, meet Mason Garlano. You met Drew and Mariah Naughton last night, so once you’ve spent your first session with Liv, you’ll know all of us except for Sydney Roux. He takes care of the horses and the stables with Drew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason Garlano had sleek, curly dark hair and dark eyes. He was in his twenties, with a slightly exotic flair and unmistakable charm. He quickly shook Dustin’s hand. “We’re glad you’re here—and hope you enjoy your visits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin thanked him and followed Aaron to the stables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first sight, Olivia Gordon was little short of spectacular. He understood immediately why the adolescents he’d met the night before were so crazy about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe resembled her cousin, Malachi, except that everything that made Malachi Gordon appear rough and rugged came out as pure beauty in Olivia. They had the same sable hair, a color that was rich and shiny. Hers was long, waving down her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeans and a blue denim shirt had never been worn so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she turned to look at him, he saw that her eyes were a crystalline blue. They seemed to have a million different facets, all of them subtle shades of blue and green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened when she met him. “So, uh, welcome. You’re the FBI man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. “Yep.” Did that mean she understood why he was there? He assumed so. “A pleasure to meet you. I believe I’m with your group now?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, glancing at Aaron. “I hear you work in the D.C. area—or you’re based there, anyway. Do you know my cousin? Malachi Gordon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I do. You two have quite a resemblance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re double-cousins. Our mothers were sisters and our fathers were brothers,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm. Well, that must explain it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey gazed at each other, but were interrupted by a small body that raced past him—and threw his arms around Liv.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh!” she gasped, and then laughed, hugging the intruder. “Brent, turn around now. I want you to meet a new member of our group. This is Dustin. Dustin, please meet Brent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent had Down syndrome. He studied Dustin unabashedly and smiled, thrusting out his hand. “Pleased to meet you, Dustin.” He enunciated his words carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brent, pleased to meet you, too, buddy,” Dustin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here, I’m here!” A woman came trotting out to the paddock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Patty,” Olivia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I late?” the woman asked. She looked at Olivia but then stared at Dustin. “Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not late,” Olivia said. She introduced Dustin. The woman kept staring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joey should be here any minute,” Olivia said. “I’ll be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her way to the stables. “Hi, Patty,” Brent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatty smiled at him. “Hi, there, Brent.” She looked at Dustin again. “So, you’re really with the FBI ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What have they got you in here for?” she asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not even sure how to explain it,” Dustin told her. She was still smiling as she studied him. He slanted his head. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry!” she said. “I’m in court-ordered therapy because of some...problems I had. I’m glad. I need my life back. I have a little girl and I want custody of her. At least shared custody. Her dad’s half the reason I’m here—nope! I’m the reason I’m here. But now I get to say I was in with an FBI agent, and that makes it...I don’t know. It makes it better somehow. I mean, people who do important things, people like you, can have problems just like me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, uh, good,” Dustin said, a little helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Especially after what happened to Marcus,” she added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t get a chance to say any more. Joey was there. Dustin was glad to see that he seemed to have a special place in his heart for Brent and made a point of greeting him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-forever-krewe-of-hunters-11/page-8.html","bookId":2285,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:49:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:49:43 PM"}
