The man above her didn\u0027t hesitate to punch her so hard across the face that her vision swam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid fuckin\u0027 lesbo bitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hit her again and her vision began to darken. Dimly, she heard Jenni screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off her! Get off her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone tackled the man and pushed him off her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie tried to roll over and tasted blood in her mouth. She spit it out and managed to roll onto her knees and palms. Men\u0027s voices were shouting and arguing behind her and she heard the impact of a fist against flesh. There were more screams. She crawled to the wall and resting her hand against it, drew herself slowly up. Her body was shaking and she felt like vomiting. The world swam around her. Slowly, she realized she was still clutching the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinging around, she aimed at the man who had punched her. He had Travis in a strangle hold and two other men were trying to get him off of Travis. The zombies were almost all dead. Just two more rattled the fence and screeched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him go,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men continued to fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked at her, his green eyes bright with fierce anger. He let go of Travis abruptly and lunged at her again. The gun slid up his slick skin to his neck as he tackled her to the ground once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to feed you to those things,\" he hissed in her face. \"You killed my brother, you bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was already dead,\" Katie managed to say as his weight slowly pressed the air out of her lungs. Her finger tightened on the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the gleam in his eye, Katie realized he didn\u0027t give a fuck about the gun. He put his hands on her throat and started to squeeze. Something fell on him from above, smashing into the back of his head and Katie gasped as the weight of it knocked all the air out of her. Gasping, she tried to hold onto the gun, her vision darkening still. Her assailant\u0027s eyes rolled up into his head as he slid into unconsciousness. Then Jenni was over her, smoothing back her hair and whispering, \"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis pulled Jenni away and knocked the now unconscious attacker off of Katie. He leaned over her and took the gun from her hand. \"Katie, try to breathe, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled for breath as her hand grasped his arm. Jenni stroked her hair gently, trying to calm her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, she managed to say, \"sonofabitch,\" and that made both Travis and Jenni smile with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis lifted her up into his arms and carried her back toward the ladder. She could see that the no man\u0027s land between the truck barrier and the fence was nothing but dead bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We…did…it,\" she whispered hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Travis assured her and hoisted her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan and Mike lifted her up over the wall and laid her down on the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dropping from the harness is real loca, Loca,\" Juan informed Jenni.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if you had missed and hit the spikes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, you would miss me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan snorted. \"Yeah, right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis leaned down and gingerly touched the side of her face. It was throbbing and hurt like hell. \"Katie, Katie…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m going away,\" Katie whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe passed out cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond her, past the wall, past the fence, past the trucks, the corral was seeped in blood and gore and nothing moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Voices\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie swam to the surface of consciousness slowly. The darkness was deep and stifling. She clawed at it, trying to rise, trying to break free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"…defending all of us…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis\u0027 voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"…shot a man in cold blood…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the Mayor\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"…there is no cure for a bite…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuan sounded pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"…we would have had to shoot him anyway…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurtis was defending her. Wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struggled to push up through the thick membrane of the darkness and strained to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be an idiot,\" a woman\u0027s voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeggy, the city secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, this world has all new rules. Katie did that guy a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni, safe and sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is in charge around here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mayor again, sounding shrill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I would say Travis,\" Juan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were murmurs of agreement, Peggy and Curtis included.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m an elected official!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the new elections were just held and you lost,\" Juan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the handcuffs off,\" Travis ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHandcuffs?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie realized the cold brace around her wrists was metal. She tried to open her eyes and failed. Something cold and wet was resting on her forehead and eye. An ice pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Curtis, I am your boss!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not anymore,\" Curtis answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the keys,\" Travis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, she tried to open her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, you awake?\" Travis\u0027 voice, warm and strong. So much like her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes fluttered and light broke the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt him fumbling with the handcuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kinky,\" she moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis laughed and his features swam before her eyes and slowly solidified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore figures pushed into her vision and she saw Jenni\u0027s large eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not dead…\" she managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And not arrested,\" Juan assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t let her go,\" the Mayor protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch us,\" Travis answered, and leaned down and gathered her up in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ice pack tumbled off her head and onto the cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping her arms loosely around his neck, she whispered,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"…need…to…stop…playing…romantic hero…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I keep telling you that, but you just don\u0027t listen,\" Travis chided her playfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s bullheaded that way,\" Jenni agreed, following him as he carried Katie out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie slumped against Travis. \"Head hurts,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she slipped away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Movement\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni pushed her way into the city council meeting room and elbowed her way past the many people gathered there: townspeople, construction workers, city workers, other stragglers who had found their way here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was pressed into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the council table sat Katie, Travis, Juan, the Mayor, Peggy and Curtis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was already in an uproar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"…we should have a say…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"…who says what we should do…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenni was relieved to see that Katie looked very alert despite her swollen face and blackened eye. Her lip was still swollen and cracked, but it didn\u0027t take away from the fierce look on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason was seated toward the front and motioned Jenni over. She slipped into the seat he was saving for her and Jack rested his chin on her knee so he could have scratches behind his ears. He gave her a doggy grin of satisfaction as she commenced her scratching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurtis stood up slowly. \"Okay, okay, let’s be civil about this. A lot has happened since yesterday. We need to stay calm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room quieted down a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurtis sat down and Travis stood up. \"I\u0027m not real good at leadership stuff, but we need to do something to make sure that what happened yesterday doesn\u0027t happen again. Now, my strong point is building and I can design new fortifications for this…uh…fort. Juan also has a lot of ideas and we are working together to expand our fort and also make it safer. Safer to live in. Safer to get in and out of. We\u0027re going to need a lot of volunteers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, the Mayor here, he can run a city and he will be dealing with the logistics of that. Food distribution, water consumption, living quarters, all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mayor slowly raised his head and Jenni could tell he was a defeated man who had grabbed onto whatever was left of his power base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the lesbo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came from the back of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis\u0027 face darkened, but he kept his temper. \"Katie, Bill, and Curtis have experience in law enforcement-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She killed Patrick in cold blood!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick was bitten,\" Travis said softly. \"A bite is deadly in this new world.
