Thunder began to flash between his eyebrows, and his body emitted billowing claps of thunder. A thunderstorm sounded out like tigers and dragons roaring together. The lightning surrounding the Thunder Light Sword grew, becoming increasingly terrifying. The heaven and earth thunder origin energy was completely sucked into this thunderstorm.
