We\u0027re going to use it to keep the fire from spreading until they\u0027ve primed the water pump.\" Rohan slid a glance toward Christopher Frost. \"Since Swansea is too old to carry the containers, I\u0027ll take one and you\u0027ll take the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia knew Christopher well enough to sense his dislike of taking orders, especially from a man he considered his inferior. But he surprised her by acceding without protest, and followed Cam Rohan to the burning house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia watched as Cam Rohan and Christopher Frost lifted the ungainly copper containers, which had been fitted with leather hosing, and hauled them past the front door. Captain Swansea remained on the steps, shouting instructions after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe windows were shot with lurid flashes as fire began to digest the interior of the house. Soon, Amelia thought bleakly, nothing would be left but a blackened skeleton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking her way back to her sisters, Amelia stood beside Win, who was cradling Leo\u0027s head in her lap. \"How is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s ill from the smoke.\" Win ran a gentle hand over her brother\u0027s disheveled head. \"But I think he\u0027ll be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing down at Leo, Amelia muttered, \"The next time you try to kill yourself, I\u0027d appreciate it if you wouldn\u0027t take the rest of us with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave no indication of having heard, but Win, Beatrix, and Poppy glanced at her in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now, dear,\" Win said in gentle reproof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia stifled the hot words that rose to her lips and stared stonily at the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore people were arriving, some forming a line to pass water buckets back and forth from the river to the hand-pump. There was no sign of activity from within the building. She wondered what Rohan and Frost were doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin seemed to read her mind. \"It seems Captain Swansea finally has an opportunity to test his invention,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What invention?\" Amelia asked. \"And how do you know about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sat next to him at supper, at Stony Cross Manor,\" Win replied. \"He told me that during his experiments with rocketry design, he had the idea for a device that would extinguish fires by spraying them with pearl ash solution. When the copper canister is upended, a vial of acid mixes with the solution, and it creates enough pressure to force the liquid from the canister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would that work?\" Amelia asked doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly hope so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both flinched at the sound of breaking windows. The handpump crew was making an opening large enough to direct a stream of water inside the burning room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecoming more worried by the moment, Amelia watched intently for any sign of Rohan or Frost. She was highly skeptical about the notion of running into a burning house with an untested device that could explode in one\u0027s face. Confronted by the chemicals, the smoke, and the heat, the men might be disoriented or overwhelmed. The idea of some harm befalling either of them was unbearable. Her muscles knotted with anxiety until streaks of pain fired through every limb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she began to consider the idea of venturing to the front threshold, Rohan and Frost emerged from the house with the emptied canisters and were immediately approached by Captain Swansea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia hurried forward with a cry of gladness, fully intending to stop once she reached them. Which was why it was a surprise when her legs insisted on carrying her forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan dropped the canister and caught her tightly. \"Easy, hummingbird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had lost his coat and her shawl somewhere amid the impetuous dash. The cold night air pierced the thin layer of her gown, causing her to shiver hard. He gripped her more closely, easing her into the pungent fragrance of smoke and sweat. His heartbeat was steady beneath her ear, his hand tracing warm circles on her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The extinguishers were even more effective than I\u0027d anticipated,\" she heard Captain Swansea say to Christopher Frost. \"Two or three more canisters, and I do believe we could have put it down by ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollecting herself, Amelia looked out from the circle of Rohan\u0027s arms. Frost stared at her with patent disapproval and something that might have been jealousy. She knew she was making a spectacle of herself with Cam Rohan. Again. But she couldn\u0027t make herself leave the comforting shelter of his arms just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Swansea was smiling, pleased with the results of his efforts. \"The fire\u0027s under control now,\" he told Amelia. \"I should think they\u0027ll have it out quite soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain, I\u0027ll never be able to thank you enough,\" she managed to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been waiting for an opportunity like this,\" he declared. \"Though of course I wouldn\u0027t have wished for your home to serve as the testing site.\" He turned to view the progress with the handpump, which was now operating at full capacity. \"I\u0027m afraid,\" he said ruefully, \"the water damage will be just as bad as that from the smoke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps some of the upstairs rooms are still habitable,\" Amelia said. \"In a few minutes I should like to go up and see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Rohan interrupted calmly. \"You and the rest of the Hathaways are going to Stony Cross Manor. They have more than enough guest rooms to accommodate you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Amelia could say a word, Christopher Frost answered for her. \"I\u0027m staying with the Shelsher family at the village tavern. Miss Hathaway and her siblings will go there with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia felt the change in Rohan\u0027s hold. His hand came to her arm, and his thumb found the inside curve of her elbow, where her pulse thrummed hard beneath fragile skin. He touched her with the possessive intimacy of a lover. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-52.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
