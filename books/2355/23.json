The early mornings were foggy and chilling now, and the first rains of winter had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill Castle still stopped in at Schwab\u0027s every morning, but it seemed to her that the conversations were always the same. The Survivors talked about who had lost a part and why. They gloated over each disastrous review that came out and deprecated the good ones. It was the threnody of losers, and Jill began to wonder if she were becoming like the rest of them. She was still sure that she was going to be Somebody, but as she looked around at the same familiar faces, she realized they all felt the same way about themselves. Was it possible they were all out of touch with reality, all of them gambling on a dream that was never going to happen? She could not bear the thought of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill had become the mother confessor to the group. They came to her with problems, and she listened and tried to help; with advice, a few dollars or a place to sleep for a week or two. She seldom dated because she was absorbed in her career and she had not met anyone who interested her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever Jill was able to put a little money aside, she sent it to her mother with long, glowing letters about how well she was doing. In the beginning, Jill\u0027s mother had written back urging Jill to repent and become a bride of God. But as Jill made occasional movies and sent more money home, her mother began to take a certain reluctant pride in her daughter\u0027s career. She was no longer against Jill\u0027s being an actress but she pressed Jill to get parts in religious pictures. \"I\u0027m sure Mr. DeMille would give you a role if you explained your religious background to him,\" she wrote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdessa was a small town. Jill\u0027s mother still worked for the Oil People, and she knew that her mother would talk about her, that sooner or later David Kenyon would hear of her success. And so, in her letters, Jill made up stories about all the stars she worked with, always careful to use their first names. She learned the bit players\u0027 trick of having the set photographer snap her picture as she stood next to the star. The photographer would give her two prints and Jill would mail one to her mother and keep the other. She made her letters sound as though she was just one step short of stardom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is the custom in Southern California, where it never snows, that three weeks before Christmas a Santa Claus Parade marches down Hollywood Boulevard and that each night after that until Christmas Eve a Santa Claus float makes the journey. The citizens of Hollywood are as conscientious about the celebration of the Christ child as are their neighbors in northern climes. They are not to be held responsible if \"Glory Be to God on High\" and \"Silent Night\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" pour out of home and car radios in a community that is sweltering in a temperature of eighty-five or ninety degrees. They long for an old-fashioned white Christmas as ardently as other red-blooded patriotic Americans, but because they know that God is not going to supply it, they have learned to create their own. They festoon the streets with Christmas lights and plastic Christmas trees and papier-mache cutouts of Santa Claus and his sled and his reindeer. Stars and character actors vie for the privilege of riding in the Santa Claus Parade; not because they are concerned about bringing holiday cheer to the thousands of children and adults who line the path of the parade, but because the parade is televised and their faces will be seen coast to coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill Castle stood on a corner, alone, watching the long parade of floats go by, the stars on top waving to their loving fans below. The Grand Marshal of the parade this year was Toby Temple. The adoring crowds cheered wildly as his float passed by. Jill caught a quick glimpse of Toby\u0027s beaming, ingenuous face and then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was music from the Hollywood High School Band, followed by a Masonic Temple float, and a marine corps band. There were equestrians in cowboy outfits and a Salvation Army band, followed by Shriners. There were singing groups carrying flags and streamers, a Knott\u0027s Berry Farm float with animals and birds made of flowers; fire engines, clowns and jazz bands. It might not have been the spirit of Christmas, but it was pure Hollywood spectacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill had worked with some of the character actors on the floats. One of them waved to her and called down, \"Hiya, Jill! How ya doin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral people in the crowd turned to look enviously at her, and it gave her a delightful feeling of self-importance that people knew she was in the Business. A deep, rich voice beside her said, \"Excuse me - are you an actress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill turned. The speaker was a tall, blond, good-looking boy in his middle twenties. His face was tanned and his teeth were white and even. He wore a pair of old jeans and a blue tweed jacket with leather-patch elbows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. An actor, I mean.\" He grinned and added, \"Struggling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill pointed to herself and said, \"Struggling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Can I buy you a cup of coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name was Alan Preston and he came from Salt Lake City where his father was an elder in the Mormon Church. \"I grew up with too much religion and not enough fun,\" he confided to Jill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s almost prophetic, Jill thought. We have exactly the same kind of background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a good actor,\" Alan said ruefully, \"but this is sure a rough town. Back home, everybody wants to help you. Here, it seems like everybody\u0027s out to get you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked until the coffee shop closed, and by that time they were old friends. When Alan asked, \"Do you want to come back to my place?\" Jill hesitated only a moment. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Preston lived in a boardinghouse off Highland Avenue, two blocks from the Hollywood Bowl. He had a small room at the back of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They ought to call this place The Dregs,\" he told Jill. \"You should see the weirdos who live here. They all think they\u0027re going to make it big in show business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike us, Jill thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe furniture in Alan\u0027s room consisted of a bed, a bureau, a chair and a small rickety table. \"I\u0027m just waiting until I move into my palace,\" Alan explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill laughed. \"Same with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan started to take her in his arms, and she stiffened. \"Please don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her a moment and said gently, \"Okay,\" and Jill was suddenly embarrassed. What was she doing here in this man\u0027s room, anyway? She knew the answer to that. She was desperately lonely. She was hungry for someone to talk to, hungry for the feel of a man\u0027s arms around her, holding her and reassuring her and telling her that everything was going to be wonderful. It had been so long. She thought of David Kenyon, but that was another life, another world. She wanted him so much that it was an ache. A little later, when Alan Preston put his arms around Jill again, she closed her eyes and it became David kissing her and undressing her and making love to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill spent the night with Alan, and a few days later he moved into her small apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Preston was the most uncomplicated man Jill had ever met. He was easygoing and relaxed, taking each day as it came, totally unconcerned with tomorrow. When Jill would discuss his way of life with him, he would say, \"Hey, remember Appointment in Samarra? If it\u0027s going to happen, it\u0027ll happen. Fate will find you. You don\u0027t have to go looking for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan would stay in bed long after Jill had gone out looking for work. When she returned home, she would find him in an easy chair, reading or drinking beer with his friends. He brought no money into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a dope,\" one of Jill\u0027s girlfriends told her. \"He\u0027s using your bed, eating your food, drinking your liquor. Get rid of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jill didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Jill understood Harriet, understood all her friends who clung desperately to men they did not love, men they hated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the fear of being alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill was out of a job. Christmas was only a few days away and she was down to her last few dollars, yet she had to send her mother a Christmas present. It was Alan who solved the problem. He had left early one morning without saying where he was going. When he returned, he said to Jill, \"We\u0027ve got a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Acting, of course. We\u0027re actors, aren\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill looked at him, filled with sudden hope. \"Are you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I am. I ran into a friend of mine who\u0027s a director. He\u0027s got a picture starting tomorrow. There\u0027s parts for both of us. A hundred bucks apiece, for one day\u0027s work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful!\" Jill exclaimed. \"A hundred dollars!\" With that she could buy her mother some lovely English wool for a winter coat and have enough left over to buy a good leather purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a little indie. They\u0027re shooting it in back of someone\u0027s garage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill said, \"What can we lose? It\u0027s a part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe garage was on the south side of Los Angeles, in an area that in one generation had gone from exclusivity to middle-class gentility to seed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were greeted at the door by a short, swarthy man who took Alan\u0027s hand and said, \"You made it, buddy. Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Jill and whistled appreciatively. \"You told it like it is, pal. She\u0027s an eyeful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan said, \"Jill, this is Peter Terraglio. Jill Castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you do!\" Jill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pete\u0027s the director,\" Alan explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Director, producer, chief bottle washer. I do a little of everything. Come on in.\" He led them through the empty garage into a passageway that had at one time been servants\u0027 quarters. There were two bedrooms off the corridor. The door to one was open. As they approached it, they could hear the sound of voices. Jill reached the doorway, looked inside and stopped in shocked disbelief. In the middle of the room four naked people were lying on a bed; a black man, a Mexican man, and two girls, one white and one black. A cameraman was lighting the set while one of the girls practiced fellatio on the Mexican. The girl paused for a moment, out of breath, and said, \"Come on, you cock. Get hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill felt faint. She wheeled around in the doorway to start back down the passageway, and she felt her legs start to give way. Alan had his arm around her, supporting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not answer him. Her head was suddenly splitting, and her stomach was filled with knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait here,\" Alan ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was back in a minute with a bottle of red pills and a pint of vodka. He took out two of the pills and handed them to Jill. \"These will make you feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill put the pills in her mouth, her head pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wash it down with this,\" Alan told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did as he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" Alan handed her another pill. She swallowed it with vodka. \"You need to lie down a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led Jill into the empty bedroom, and she lay down on the bed, moving very slowly. The pills were beginning to work. She started to feel better. The bitter bile had stopped coming up into her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, her headache was fading away. Alan handed her another pill. Without even thinking about it, Jill swallowed it. She took another drink of vodka. It was such a blessing to have the pain disappear. Alan was behaving peculiarly, moving all around the bed. \"Sit still,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sitting still.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill thought that was funny and began to laugh. She laughed until the tears streamed down her face. \"What - what were those pills?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For your headache, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerraglio peered into the room and said, \"How we doin\u0027? Everybody happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every - everybody\u0027s happy,\" Jill mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerraglio looked at Alan and nodded. \"Five minutes,\" Terraglio said. He hurried off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan was leaning over Jill, stroking her breast and her thighs, lifting her skirt and working his fingers between her legs. It felt marvelously exciting, and Jill suddenly wanted him inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, baby,\" Alan said, \"I wouldn\u0027t ask you to do anything bad. You\u0027d just make love to me. It\u0027s what we do anyway, only this time we get paid for it. Two hundred bucks. And it\u0027s all yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, but it seemed to take forever to move it from side to side. \"I couldn\u0027t do that,\" she said, fuzzily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to concentrate to remember. \"Because I\u0027m - I\u0027m gonna be a star. Can\u0027t do porno films.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like me to fuck you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes! I want you, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan started to say something, then grinned. \"Sure, baby. I want you, too. Come on.\" He took Jill\u0027s hand and lifted her off the bed. Jill felt as though she were flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in the hallway, then moving into the other bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Terraglio said as he saw them. \"Keep the same setup. We\u0027ve got some fresh blood coming in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to change the sheets?\" one of the crew asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the fuck do you think we are, MGM?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill was clinging to Alan. \"David, there are people here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll leave,\" Alan assured her. \"Here.\" He took out another pill and gave it to Jill. He put the bottle of vodka to her lips, and she swallowed the pill. From that point on, everything happened in a haze. David was undressing her and saying comforting things. Then she was on the bed with him. He moved his naked body close to her. A bright light came on, blinding her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put this in your mouth,\" he said, and it was David talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes.\" She stroked it lovingly and started to put it in her mouth and someone in the room said something that Jill could not hear, and David moved away so that Jill was forced to turn her face into the light and squint in the glare. She felt herself being pushed down on her back and then David was inside her making love to her, and at the same time she had his penis in her mouth. She loved him so much. The lights bothered her and the talking in the background. She wanted to tell David to stop them, but she was in an ecstasy of delirium, having orgasm after orgasm until she thought that her body would tear itself apart. David loved her, not Cissy, and he had come back to her and they were married. They were having such a wonderful honeymoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David...\" she said. She opened her eyes and the Mexican was on top of her, moving his tongue down her body. She tried to ask him where David was, but she could not get the words out. She closed her eyes while the man did delicious things to her body. When Jill opened her eyes again, the man had somehow turned into a girl with long red hair and large bosoms trailing across Jill\u0027s belly. Then the woman started doing something with her tongue and Jill closed her eyes and fell into unconsciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men stood looking down at the figure on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She gonna be all right?\" Terraglio asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Alan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really come up with \u0027em,\" Terraglio said admiringly. \"She\u0027s terrific. Best looker yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My pleasure.\" He held out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerraglio pulled a thick wad of bills out of his pocket and peeled off two of them. \"Here y\u0027are. Wanna drop by for a little Christmas dinner? Stella\u0027d love to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t,\" Alan said. \"I\u0027m spending Christmas with the wife and kids. I\u0027m catching the next plane out to Florida.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re gonna have a hell of a picture here.\" Terraglio nodded toward the unconscious girl. \"What kind of billing should we give her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan grinned. \"Why don\u0027t you use her real name? It\u0027s Josephine Czinski. When the picture plays in Odessa, it\u0027ll give all her friends a real kick.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stranger-in-the-mirror/page-23.html","bookId":2355,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:25 AM"}
