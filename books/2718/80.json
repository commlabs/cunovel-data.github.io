Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome guy drives up in a tricked-out SUV. “Tara, where the hell you been?” he shouts through the open passenger window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking the lollipop out of her mouth, she yells back, “None of your f**king business!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why you gotta talk that way? Let’s go to the party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTara tosses the lollipop into the parking lot. “I’m out of cigarettes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got cigs. Who’s this?” he asks, nodding in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Just what I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whaddyou care,” she says. “Maybe he’s my new boyfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just came here for a soda,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah? Where is it, then?” the guy in the SUV taunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this were a movie, I would bust a secret move so fierce the entire place would be razed to the ground. I’d finish with something snappy like “And don’t forget my soda, punk” while I strolled off into the night. But it’s not a movie, and I just stuff my twitching hands into my pockets like the big mad-cow-disease-afflicted chickenshit that I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not the boss of me!” Tara shouts to the guy in the SUV. “I can do whatever I want. In case you forgot, we are broken up, Jus-tin!” She gives it a head swivel for added effect and puts her arm around my waist, which is basically like painting a target on my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should be getting back,” I say, stepping away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJus-tin! turns on his inside car light. I can see he’s wearing a blue trucker hat and an oversized football jersey, and a huge diamond stud in his right ear. He’s got a scruffy brown beard. “Aw, come on, Tara. You don’t mean that, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns to me. “Do you have any cigarettes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you get some?” she asks, sidling up to me. I notice with no small percentage of fear that the Justin guy looks like he could seriously kick my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That guy won’t let me back in,” I say, holding out my hands in a “sorry” pose. They’ve stopped spazzing, so there’s that, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmployee #12 stands near the doors with his arms folded across his chest, letting us know we are not welcome in his Gas-It-N-Git lot. It’s a cops-will-be-called stance. An I-am-an-action-hero-of-the-all-night-mart stance. I wonder how he would sound saying “Don’t forget my soda, punk”?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit,” Tara says, chewing at a ragged nail. She saunters over to the open passenger window on the SUV. “Gimme a smoke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lighted cigarette is passed through the window. She takes a deep puff, blows out some smoke, and just like that, opens the door and crawls in. There’s some intense kissing. Justin turns off the interior light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, later,” I say, walking back toward the hulking shadow of the interstate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait!” Tara calls. She’s hanging out the window, her arms dangling, the cigarette stuck between her first and second fingers. “You wanna go to a party?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drive through the sleeping town. The traffic lights have gone to blinking yellows, and the streets glisten from an earlier rain. Tara tells me her five-minute life story. She’s fifteen. She lives with her mom, who works as a nail technician and brings home free polish and cucumber lotion to the trailer they share with four cats. “The whole dang bathroom smells like cucumber and cat poop, I swear,” she says, offering me a cigarette, which I decline. Tara hates school but loves a show about supermodels and wants to be one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She just did a boat show,” Justin tells me with a mix of pride and wariness. Like he only wants other guys to notice that he’s with a hot girl, not actually notice the hot girl herself. Justin’s eighteen but still a junior. He also lives with his mom and her “sorry-assed retard of a boyfriend” in a “crappy, two-bedroom apartment near Enormo-Mart.” For money, he bags groceries and sells the odd bit of pot, which is why hitting Brian Kinner’s party is “so vital.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey finally ask me about myself. Usually I would edit my story, say as little as possible so I could stay in hiding mode. It’s been my M.O. my entire life—living just below the radar. But tonight, I’m so tired I just tell them everything. It feels good not to hold myself in check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mad cow disease?” Tara says, exhaling smoke. “Is that something you get from sex?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say. “It’s not contagious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow,” Tara says. “That’s so sad. Justin, don’t you think that’s so sad?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/going-bovine/page-80.html","bookId":2718,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM"}
