I\u0027ll ask him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" A flash of panic. \"Luis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hamlin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile holding I move into the kitchen, over to the refrigerator, and take out a bottle of Perrier. I\u0027m looking for a glass when I hear a click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" I say when McDermott gets back on the line. \"I don\u0027t want to see Luis or Courtney so, you know, dissuade them or something. Use your charm. Be charming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hamlin has to have dinner with a client from Texas and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him off. \"Wait, this has nothing to do with Luis. Let Hamlin take the fag out himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hamlin wants Carruthers to come because Hamlin is supposed to be dealing with the Panasonic case, but Carruthers knows a lot more about it and that\u0027s why he wants Carruthers to come,\" McDermott explains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause while taking this in. \"If Luis comes I\u0027ll kill him. I swear to god I\u0027ll kill him. I\u0027ll f**king kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, Bateman,\" McDermott murmurs, concerned. \"You\u0027re a real humanitarian. A sage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. just...\" I start, confused, irritated. \"Just... sensible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to know if Luis comes does this mean that Courtney will come too?\" he wonders again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Hamlin to invite - oh shit, I don\u0027t know.\" I stop. \"Tell Hamlin to have dinner with the Texas guy alone.\" I stop again, realizing something. \"Wait a minute. Does this mean Hamlin will... take us out? I mean pay for it, since it\u0027s a business dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, sometimes I think you\u0027re very smart, Bateman,\" McDermott says. \"Other times...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit, what the hell am I saying?\" I ask myself out loud, annoyed. \"You and I can have a goddamn business dinner together. Jesus. I\u0027m not going. That\u0027s it. I\u0027m not going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even if Luis doesn\u0027t come?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Nope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" he whines. \"We have reservations at 1500.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... have to... watch The Cosby Show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh tape it for Christ sakes, you ass. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait.\" I\u0027ve realized something else. \"Do you think Hamlin will\" - I pause awkwardly - \"have some drugs, perhaps... for the Texan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does Bateman think?\" McDermott asks, the jaded ass**le.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm. I\u0027m thinking about it. I\u0027m thinking about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a pause McDermott says \"Tick-tock, tick-tock\" in singsong. \"We\u0027re getting nowhere. Of course Hamlin is going to be carrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get Hamlin, have him... get him on three-way,\" I sputter, checking my Rolex. \"Hurry. Maybe we can talk him into 1500.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" McDermott says. \"Hold on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are four clicking noises and then I hear Hamlin saying, \"Bateman, is it okay to wear argyle socks with a business suit?\" He\u0027s attempting a joke but it fails to amuse me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing inwardly, my eyes closed, I answer, impatient, \"Not really, Hamlin. They\u0027re too sporty. They interfere with a business image. You can wear them with casual suits. Tweeds, whatever. Now Hamlin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bateman?\" And then he says, \u0027\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luis cannot come,\" I tell him. \"And you\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No prob,\" he says. \"The Texan\u0027s not coming anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hay letsyall go to See Bee Jee Bees I har that\u0027s pretty new wave. Lifestyle difference,\" Hamlin explains. \"The Texan is not accepted until Monday. I quickly, and quite nimbly I might add, rearranged my hectic schedule. A sick father. A forest fire. An excuse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does that take care of Luis?\" I ask suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luis is having dinner with the Texan tonight, which saves me a whole lotta trouble, pardner. I\u0027m seeing him at Smith and Wollensky on Monday,\" Hamlin says, pleased with himself. \"So everything is A-okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" McDermott asks tentatively, \"does this mean that Courtney isn\u0027t coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have missed or are going to miss our reservations at 1500,\" I point out. \"Besides, Hamlin, you went there last night, huh?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-133.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
