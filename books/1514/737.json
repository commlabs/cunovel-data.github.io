In the next instant, an exceptionally majestic and boundless fluctuation instantaneously swept out from within Little Marten’s body. The fluctuation was like black clouds that enveloped the skies before turning into a thick pressure that slowly filled the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandpa Marten will now let you guys laugh your fill!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the majestic aura swept outwards, a blood-thirsty look appeared on Little Marten’s handsome face. He had been extremely infuriated by the Demonic Sound Mountain’s array over this period of time, hence, after breaking the array, his anger had thoroughly exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChi!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA purplish black glow that blotted the skies started screaming out of Little Marten’s palm as he directly patted down, smashing a few unlucky fellows into a fleshy pulp. In the next moment, eyes suffused with a purplish black glow locked onto the the Golden Ghost Owl who was currently showing a rather ugly expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You yellow furred devil, let’s see where can you hide now!” Little Marten said with a sinister smile. With a shift of his body, he directly appeared in front of the Golden Ghost Owl like a spectre, as a purplish black spiral containing a frightening fluctuation exploded forward like lighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to Little Marten’s brutal offensive, the Golden Ghost Owl cut a sorry figure as it promptly retreated. He was after all weaker than Little Marten by a whole level. In a direct one on one confrontation, it naturally was no match for the former. However, now that the formation had been broken, he had no place to escape, and could only brace himself and fight while hoping that the helpers from the Yuan Gate would be able to make it in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roar!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Little Marten attacked, Little Flame also suddenly raised his head and howled, causing his already sturdy steel tower like body to inflate another fold. A scarlet glow started to appear and flowed on the surface of his body. This was obviously an extremely strong body enhancing martial art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile his body continued to swell, Little Flame shot towards the Demonic Sound Mountain like a cannonball with a stamp of his foot. With his scarlet eyes and ferocious appearance, there was no longer any trace of the previous simple and honest expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You be careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon seeing the two of them take action, Lin Dong did not hesitate any longer. After saying a single sentence to Ying Huanhuan, the green dragon wings surfaced once again on his back. He instantly transformed into a green flash and shot towards the Demonic Sound Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwish!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong was like a ray of light as he shot towards the peak of the mountain. With a dragonified arm, he wielded the black tree as he created a path of carnage. Those whom he had remembered earlier had their bodies viciously swatted by the heavy black tree until they could only howl in pain due to their now bloodied bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, only the higher echelons of the Demonic Sound Mountain were considered slightly strong. Although the Golden Ghost Owl and the two great generals were capable of putting up a fight, the others were of hardly any use. Therefore when the Lin Dong trio killed their way towards the mountain like wolves and tigers, the fellows that had seemed fierce and malicious fled faster than rabbits, just like a beaten army in total collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong smashed another previously dirty mouth fellow with the tree trunk, causing him to vomit blood as he was swatted away. Just as he was about to take another step, Lin Dong’s gaze suddenly focused as his other hand instantaneously transformed into a green dragon arm. Immediately after, his hand clenched tightly into a fist as he sent a punch rumbling forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a flash, two fists that contained vigorous energies ferociously collided with each other. A visible energy ripple rapidly spread out, causing the dead leaves on the ground to be shaken and turned to dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the force dispersed, Lin Dong’s body trembled faintly before he retreated half a step backwards. As for the person facing him, he stumbled and retreated multiple steps, before dispelling the strength that had entered his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaising his head, Lin Dong looked towards the person in front of him. With a body covered in a robe made of leopard pelt, he had a tall and sturdy physique with a deep scar on his forehead, making him look quite sinister. Moreover, the unrestrained fluctuation from him caused Lin Dong’s eyebrows to raise. Given such a fluctuation, he should have already reached the Nine Yuan Nirvana stage, however it was substantially weaker than Wang Yan...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Son of a bitch, you killed so many people from my Demonic Sound Mountain! Leopard Grandfather will wring your head off and turn it into my piss bucket!” The man wearing a leopard pelt stared at Lin Dong with a fierce and sinister expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Superficial Nine Yuan Nirvana stage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong sent a smile towards the man in a leopard pelt while shaking his head. Although the person before him was at the Nine Yuan Nirvana stage, from the previous exchange, Lin Dong could feel that he was even weaker than Yao Ling, let alone comparing him to Wang Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An obstinate brat, look and see if your father won’t rip you to shreds!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, the face of the leopard pelt wearing male turned chilly. Vigorous Yuan Power rushed forth from within his body. In the next moment, he stamped his foot and shot towards Lin Dong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swish!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA swift and fierce fist wind of the leopard pelt wearing male swept towards Lin Dong, who immediately grabbed his arm with a green dragon arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You still dare to mess with me with such puny strength?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaid Lin Dong with a faint smile. His gaze suddenly turned chilly as boundless energy erupted like flood waters. With a ferocious tug, he caused the leopard pelt wearing male to directly lose balance. In the next instant, Lin Dong flung his leg out, which viciously landed on the man\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the gazes of the surrounding Demonic Sound Mountain men, the leopard pelt wearing man was flung hundreds of metres away, smashing trees into dust as he crashed into them along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter experiencing fights with formidable Nine Yuan Nirvana stage experts like Yao Ling and Wang Yan, the leopard pelt wearing male truly made Lin Dong somewhat sigh in regret. Although they were all of the same stage, the difference between the strong and the weak was was very clear. Lin Dong truly did not know how this fellow trained to such a level...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoar!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, the leopard pelt wearing male struggled and stood up. Wiping the fresh blood off from the corners of his mouth, his eyes started to turn scarlet. Soon after, he raised his head and let out a howl. Instantly, his body started to rapidly squirm, before finally transforming into a giant golden leopard. Bringing along a foul wind, he maniacally pounced at Lin Dong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong calmly watched the giant golden leopard flying towards him without the slightest intention of withdrawing. His arms transformed into dragon arms, as he grasped the black tree and gave a ferocious swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang Bang Bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surrounding Demonic Sound Mountain men watched the intense battle between the giant golden leopard and Lin Dong. Yet, the leopard was unable to gain any upper hand, and was being forced to retreat time after time. Turning their gazes, they looked at the other fights taking place. The Golden Ghost Owl and the other great general were also being forced into an extremely sorry state...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a situation was not good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few of the men from the Demonic Sound Mountain looked at each other and were thinking of stealthily fleeing away. When the trees topple the monkeys will scatter. From the situation in front of them, it was obvious that they could no longer hold the Demonic Sound Mountain...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire Demonic Sound Mountain had currently sunk into an extreme state of chaos as rumbling and intense sounds transmitted endlessly all around. The entire mountaintop shook as if it was shattering and crumbling as a bloody scent soared into the skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Demonic Sound Mountain descended into chaos, three figures appeared in a flash on the peak of a far away mountain, while their gazes stared indifferently at the Demonic Sound Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, looks like the Demonic Sound Mountain has already been broken by other people. That bastard is truly useless, can’t even endure just this bit…” These three were naturally the three from the Yuan Gate that had appeared previously. As for the person speaking, it was the handsome man in white. He smiled and said as he looked at the Demonic Sound Mountain that reeked of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior martial uncle Jiang, do we take action and help?” Another man dressed in black said with a grin on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let a few more die before we take action.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of the two men stood an old man dressed in brown. With an indifferent tone, he said, “There is an Earth Core Spiritual Brewing Saliva hidden within the Demonic Sound Mountain. That blockhead assumed that no one knew about it, and even invited me over. Since we have came here, let’s also take that treasure away. This kind of heavenly treasure should be given to our Yuan Gate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xia Yan, go take care of all those people that have fled the Demonic Sound Mountain in secret, I don’t want the news here to spread.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax senior martial uncle Jiang, none of them will escape.” The male in black replied. With a smile, he proceeded to transform into a ray of light as he headed into the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shen Yun, go and take the zither from the hands of that girl. Ha ha, I truly can’t believe that I am actually able to see a Pure Yuan Treasure here. Looks like even the heavens are helping our Yuan Gate.” The old man dressed in brown commanded with a casual smile as he pointed towards Ying Huanhuan who was standing outside of the Demonic Sound Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male in white gave a reply while giving a faint smile. As he gazed into the distance, he gave a frivolous smile, “ A little beauty eh, let me handle this…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the appearance of his voice, his figure had already disappeared in a strange manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two beside him left, the old man dressed in brown turned his gaze towards the top of the Demonic Sound Mountain, where Little Marten and the Golden Ghost Owl were ferociously battling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A person of Profound Life Stage, ha, looks like tidying up this matter will be a little troublesome…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-734\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-736\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-735","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:54 AM"}
