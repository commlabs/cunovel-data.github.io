I rub the head through her wetness and thrust in, feeling the aftershocks of her orgasm in the contractions of her pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start fucking her hard, burying myself balls-deep. I pull her top down, letting her breasts spill out as I lean down and suck a fat nipple in my mouth. God, I miss the taste of her milk, but soon enough I’ll have it again. Thinking about it makes me harder, and I thrust roughly into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sean!” She pulls at my T-shirt, and it’s then I realize I’m still dressed. Only my cock is out, and it’s working in and out of her tight body. My shirt is the last thing on my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t stop moving inside her as I help Tessa remove my shirt. I’m like an animal, wanting to give her my seed make a baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKissing up her neck, I bite her earlobe and lick the shell of her ear. I feel her shiver under me, and I hold her close as she tightens her legs around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say it, little fox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear her intake of breath as I plunge deeper, needing to be inside her body as fully as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m yours, Sean. Only yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her clench around me, and I reach between us to rub her clit. She’s already ready for another orgasm, and this time I want to cum with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling her tighten on me again, I adjust the angle of my hips, letting her have every rigid inch of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goddamn right you are. And I’m yours, Tessa. Only yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clamps down on my cock, exploding into her orgasm. She clings to me as her hips jerk upward, tensing and contracting as she goes off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrusting into her as far as I can go, I hold myself there as her clenches pull my own orgasm from me. I spill my seed into her welcoming womb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the smile on my face as I hold myself up on my elbows and bury my face in her neck. Nothing is sweeter or more satisfying than being inside my love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing her hips, I roll us over so she’s straddling me and lying on my chest. I can feel her trying to catch her breath as I try to catch mine, both of us spent from the quick passion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re welcome, baby,” I say, kissing the top of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at me and raises an eyebrow. “Welcome for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just gave you a baby girl. It’s what you wanted, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her pussy pulse around me again as she starts to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thrust into her, and her giggles turn into a moan as I lazily move in and out of her soaked cunt. “Why are you laughing, little fox? You know I’m right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When it comes to you, Sean, I never doubt a thing you say. I guess only time will tell.” She pushes down on my cock, moving with me, then sits up to take all of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold her hips, rocking her back and forth on my cock, getting as deep as I can go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You love me, little fox?” I never get tired of hearing her say how much I mean to her, and I don’t suspect I will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePushing her gorgeous auburn hair out of her face, she looks down at me and smiles. “I love you, Sean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit up and kiss her neck, needing my mouth on her. “Stealing you was the best decision I ever made.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the vibrations of her laugh against my lips, and I smile, too. It sounds crazy saying it out loud, but I’ve never once regretted it. Taking Tessa and bringing her to the island and making a family has been more than I could have ever dreamed of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s given me a life I don’t deserve, and I spend my days worshiping her and taking care of our son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day I’ll tell him the truth about what I did and how we came to be here. He deserves to know when he’s older, but not today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, today is for making love to my perfect goddess and creating a new life inside her. Today, like every day, is for happiness. Today I hold my angel in my arms and tell her over and over how beautiful she is and how lucky I am that she chose me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if I never gave her a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE END \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thief-breeding-3/page-47.html","bookId":1798,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:28:25 PM"}
