Whether he damned his soul or not, he had no choice. Tears in his eyes, he raised the knife and slashed the blade across his throat. Lancing pain dropped the dagger from his fingers. He fell to his hands. Blood poured from his throat across the dark stones under him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dawn’s light, his red blood glowed brilliantly against the black rock. It was his last sight as he died—his life’s blood flowing across the Incan altar, shining as brightly as gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuins\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday, August 20, 11:52 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohns Hopkins University\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaltimore, Maryland\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Henry Conklin’s fingers trembled slightly as he unwrapped the final layer of blankets from around his frozen treasure. He held his breath. How had the mummy fared after the three-thousand-mile trip from the Andes? Back in Peru, he had been so careful to pack and crate the frozen remains in dry ice for the trip to Baltimore, but during such a long journey anything could have gone wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry ran a hand through his dark hair, now dusted with a generous amount of grey since passing his sixtieth birthday last year. He prayed his past three decades of research and fieldwork would pay off. He would not have a second chance. Transporting the mummy from South America had almost drained the last of his grant money. And nowadays any new fellowships or grants were awarded to researchers younger than he. He was becoming a dinosaur at Texas A\u0026amp;M. Though still revered, he was now more coddled than taken seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, his most recent discovery of the ruins of a small Incan village high in the Andes could change all that—especially if it proved his own controversial theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cautiously tugged free the final linen wrap. Fog from the thawing dry ice momentarily obscured his sight. He waved the mist away as the contorted figure appeared, knees bent to chest, arms wrapped around legs, almost in a fetal position, just as he had discovered the mummy in a small cave near the frozen summit of Mount Arapa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry stared at his discovery. Ancient eye sockets, open and hollow, gazed back at him from under strands of lanky black hair still on its skull. Its lips, dried and shrunken back, revealed yellowed teeth. Frayed remnants of a burial shawl still clung to its leathered skin. It was so well preserved that even the black dyes of the tattered robe shone brightly under the surgical lights of the research lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh God!” a voice exclaimed at his shoulder. “This is perfect!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry jumped slightly, so engrossed in his own thoughts he had momentarily forgotten the others in the room. He turned and was blinded by the flash of a camera’s strobe. The reporter from the Baltimore Herald moved from behind his shoulder to reposition for another shot, never moving the Nikon from her face. Her blond hair was pulled over her ears in a severe and efficient ponytail. She snapped additional photos as she spoke. “What would you estimate its age to be, Professor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking away the glare, Henry backed a step away so the others could view the remains. A pair of scientists moved closer, instruments in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I… I’d estimate the mummification dates back to the sixteenth century—some four to five hundred years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter lowered her camera but did not move her eyes from the figure cradled on the CT scanning table. A small trace of disgust pleated her upper lip. “No, I meant how old do you think the mummy was when he died?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh…” He pushed his wire-rimmed glasses higher on his nose. “Around twenty… It’s hard to be accurate on just gross examination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the two doctors, a petite woman in her late fifties with dark hair that fell in silky strands to the small of her back, glanced back at them. She had been examining the mummy’s head, a tongue depressor in hand. “He was thirty-two when he died,” she stated matter-of-factly. The speaker, Dr. Joan Engel, was head of forensic pathology at JohnsHopkinsUniversity and an old friend of Henry’s. Her position there was one of the reasons he had hauled his mummy to Johns Hopkins. She elaborated on her statement, “His third molars are partially impacted, but from the degree of wear on the second molars and the lack of wear on the third, my estimation should be precise to within three years, plus or minus. But the CT scan results should pinpoint the age even more accurately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelying her calm demeanor, the doctor’s jade eyes shone brightly as she spoke, crinkling slightly at the corners. There was no disgust on her face when she viewed the mummy, even when she handled the desiccated remains with her gloved fingers. Henry sensed her excitement, mirroring his own. It was good to know Joan’s enthusiasm for scientific mysteries had not waned from the time he had known her back in her undergraduate years. She returned to the study of the mummy, but not before giving Henry a look of apology for contradicting his previous statement and estimation of age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry’s cheeks grew heated, more from embarrassment than irritation. She was as keen and sharp as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing hard, he tried to redeem himself. He turned to the reporter. “I hope to prove these remains found at this Incan site are not actually Incan, but another tribe of Peruvian Indians.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It has been long known that the Incas were a warrior tribe that often took over neighboring tribes and literally consumed them. They built their own cities atop these others, swallowing them up. From my study of Machu Picchu and other ruins in the remote highlands of the Andes, I’ve theorized that the lowland tribes of the Incas did not build these cloud cities but took them over from a tribe that already existed before them, robbing these ancestors of their rightful place in history as the skilled architects of the mountaintop cities.” Henry nodded toward the mummy. “I hope this fellow will be able to correct this error in history.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter took another picture, but was then forced back by the pair of doctors who were moving their examination farther down the mummy. “Why do you think this mummy can prove this theory?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The tomb where we discovered it predates the Incan ruins by at least a century, suggesting that here might be one of the true builders of these mountain citadels. Also this mummy stands a good head taller than the average Inca of the region… even its facial features are different. I brought the mummy here to prove this is not an Incan tribesman but one of the true architects of these exceptional cities. With genetic mapping available here, I can substantiate any—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Professor Conklin,” Joan again interrupted him. “You might want to come see this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter stepped aside to let Henry pass, her Nikon again rising to cover half her face. Henry pushed between the two researchers. They had been fingering the body’s torso and belly. Engel’s assistant, a sandy-haired young man with large eyes, was bent over the mummy. He was carefully tweezing and extracting a length of cord from a fold around the figure’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan pointed. “His throat was slashed,” she said, parting the leathery skin to reveal the bones underneath. “I’d need a microscopic exam to be sure, but I’d say the injury was ante-mortem.” She glanced to Henry and the reporter. “Before death,” she clarified. “And most likely, the cause of death here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry nodded. “The Incas were fond of blood rituals; many involved decapitation and human sacrifice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor’s assistant continued working at the wound, drawing out a length of cord from the wound. He paused and glanced to his mentor. “I think it’s some sort of necklace,” he mumbled, and pulled at the cord. Something under the robe shifted with his motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan raised her eyes to Henry, silently asking permission to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly the assistant tugged and worked the necklace loose from its hiding place. Whatever hung there was carefully dragged along under the robe’s ragged cloth. Suddenly the ancient material ripped and the object hanging from the cord dropped free for all to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gasp rose from their four throats. The gold shone brilliantly under the halogen spotlights of the laboratory. A flurry of blinding flashes followed as the reporter snapped a rapid series of photos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a cross,” Joan said, stating the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry groaned and leaned in closer. “Not just a cross. It’s a Dominican crucifix.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter spoke with her camera still fixed to her face. “What does that mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry straightened and waved a hand over a Latin inscription. “The Dominican missionary order accompanied the Spanish conquistadors during their attack upon the Central and South American Indians.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reporter lowered her camera. “So this mummy is one of those Spanish priests?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cool!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan tapped at the cross with her tongue depressor. “But the Incas weren’t known to mummify any of their Spanish conquerors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until now,” Henry commented sourly. “I guess if nothing else the discovery will be worth a footnote in some journal article.” His dreams of proving his theory dimmed in the glare of the golden crucifix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoan touched his hand with a gloved finger. “Don’t despair yet. Perhaps the cross was just stolen from one of the Spaniards. Let’s first run the CT scan and see what we can discover about our friend here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry nodded but held no real hope in his heart. He glanced to the pathologist. Her eyes shone with genuine concern. He offered her a small smile, which, surprisingly, she returned. Henry remembered that smile from long ago. They had dated a few times, but both had been too devoted to their studies to pursue more than a casual acquaintance. And when their careers diverged after graduation, they had lost contact with each other, except for the occasional exchange of Christmas cards. But Henry had never forgotten that smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe patted his hand, then called to her assistant. “Brent, could you let Dr. Reynolds know we’re ready to begin the scan?” She then turned to Henry and the reporter. “I’ll have to ask you to join us in the next room. You can view the procedure from behind the leaded glass in the control room.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/excavation/page-2.html","bookId":1525,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM"}
