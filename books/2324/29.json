Well, we figured that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drank some of his drink. \"Keegan,\" he said, \"has to drink. For myself, I could stop anytime. I don\u0027t, because I happen to like what the stuff does for me. But I could stop anytime, and I figure you\u0027re the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I would think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you are. Now Keegan, I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t like to call the man an alcoholic-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a hell of a thing to call a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree with you. I\u0027m not saying that\u0027s what he is, and God knows I like the man, but I think he\u0027s got a problem.\" He straightened up. \"The hell with it. He could be a fucking Bowery bum, I still wish the car hadn\u0027t been stolen. C\u0027mon back, we\u0027ll spread out and relax a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the office, with the two whiskey bottles on the desk between us, he leaned back in his chair and put his feet up. \"You checked the license number,\" he said. \"So I guess you\u0027re already working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"I went out to Brooklyn, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where? Not where we were last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you think you stood to learn there? You figure one of them left his wallet on the floor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never know what you\u0027ll find, Skip. You have to look around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose. I wouldn\u0027t know where to start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You start anyplace. And do anything you think of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You learn anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what? Never mind, I don\u0027t want to be sitting on your shoulder while you do all this. You find out anything useful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. You don\u0027t always know until later on what\u0027s useful and what isn\u0027t. You can look at it that everything you learn is useful. For instance, just knowing that the car was stolen tells me something, even if it doesn\u0027t tell me who was driving it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least you can rule out the owner. Now you know one person out of eight million couldn\u0027t have done it. Who was the owner? Some old lady, only drives it to bingo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, but it was lifted from Ocean Parkway, not far from the clam bar they sent us to first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Means they live out in Brooklyn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or they drove their own car out there, parked it and stole the one we saw. Or they went out on the subway or took a cab. Or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we don\u0027t know a whole lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back with his hands behind his head. \"Bobby got another call-back on that commercial,\" he said. \"The basketball referee in the fight against prejudice? He\u0027s got to go in again tomorrow. It\u0027s now down to him and four other guys so they want to look at everybody again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you tell? You believe a profession like that, running your ass off and fighting the competition so you can be on the tube for twenty seconds. You know how many actors it takes to change a lightbulb? Nine. One to climb up and replace it and eight others to stand around the ladder and say, \u0027That should be me up there!\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, credit where it\u0027s due, it was the actor told me the joke.\" He touched up his drink, sat back in his chair. \"Matt, that was strange last night. That was fucking strange last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the church basement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nod. \"Those disguises of theirs. What they needed was Groucho noses and moustaches and glasses, you know the kind the kids wear. Because it was like that, the wigs and beards, they didn\u0027t even come close to looking real, but they weren\u0027t funny. The gun kept it from being funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d they wear disguises?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we wouldn\u0027t recognize them. Why does anybody wear a disguise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you have recognized them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, I didn\u0027t get to see them without the disguises. What are we here, Abbott and Costello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think they recognized us,\" I said. \"When I went into the basement, one of them called out your name. It was dark, but they\u0027d had time for their eyes to get used to it. You and I don\u0027t look alike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the pretty one.\" He drew on his cigarette, blew out a great cloud of smoke. \"What are you getting at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m just wondering why they would bother with disguises if we didn\u0027t know them in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To make it harder to find them later, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess. But why should they think we\u0027d bother to look for them? There\u0027s not a hell of a lot we can do to them. We made a deal, traded money for your books. What did you wind up doing with the books, incidentally?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burned them, like I said. And what do you mean, there\u0027s nothing we could do to them? We could murder them in their beds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find the right church, take a shit on the altar, and tell Dominic Tutto they did it. That has a certain charm, now that I think of it. Fix \u0027em up, get \u0027em a date with the Butcher. Maybe they wore disguises for the same reason they stole the car. Because they\u0027re pros.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They look familiar to you, Skip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean looking past the wigs and beards and shit? I don\u0027t know that I could see past it. I didn\u0027t recognize the voices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was something familiar about them, but I don\u0027t know what it was. The way they moved, maybe. That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I know what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An economy of motion. You could almost say they were light on their feet.\" He laughed. \"Call \u0027em up, see if they want to go dancing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy glass was empty. I poured a little bourbon into it, sat back, and sipped it slowly. Skip drowned his cigarette in a coffee cup and told me, inevitably, that he never wanted to see me do the same. I assured him he wasn\u0027t likely to. He lit another cigarette and we sat there in a comfortable silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while he said, \"You want to explain something to me, forget about disguises. Tell me why they shot the lights out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To cover their exit. Give them a step or two on us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think they thought we were gonna come stampeding after them? Chase armed men through backyards and driveways?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they wanted it dark, thought they stood a better chance that way.\" I frowned. \"All he had to do was take a step and flick the switch. You know the worst thing about the gunshots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, they scared the shit out of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They drew heat. One thing a pro knows is you don\u0027t do anything that brings the cops. Not if you can help it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they figured it was worth it. It was a warning: \u0027Don\u0027t try to get even.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little touch of the dramatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And God knows it was dramatic enough. When the gun was aimed at me I thought I was gonna get shot. I really did. Then when he shot up the ceiling instead I didn\u0027t know whether to shit or go blind. What\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He pointed the gun at you and then he fired two shots into the ceiling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that something we\u0027re supposed to have overlooked? What do you think we\u0027ve been talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held up a hand. \"Think a minute,\" I said. \"I\u0027d been thinking of him shooting out the lights, that\u0027s why I missed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missed what? Matt, I don\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been lately that somebody pointed a gun at someone but didn\u0027t shoot him? And fired two bullets into the ceiling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ on stilts. Frank and Jesse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what I think. It\u0027s such a crazy thought. They didn\u0027t sound Irish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do we know they were Irish at Morrissey\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t. I guess I assumed it. Those handkerchief masks, and taking the money for Northern Relief, and the whole sense that it was political. They had that same economy of movement, you know? The way they were so precise, they didn\u0027t take extra steps, they moved through that whole robbery like somebody choreographed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they\u0027re dancers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" he said. \"Ballet Desperadoes of \u002775. I\u0027m still trying to wrap my mind around all of this. Two clowns in red hankies take off the Morrissey brothers for fifty grand, and then they jack off me and Kasabian for- hey, it\u0027s the same amount. A subtle pattern begins to emerge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know what the Morrisseys lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, and they didn\u0027t know what was gonna be in the safe, but a pattern\u0027s a pattern. I\u0027ll take it. What about their ears? You got pictures of their ears from last night. Are those the ears of Frank and Jesse?\" He started to laugh. \"I can\u0027t believe the lines I\u0027m speaking. \u0027Are those the ears of Frank and Jesse?\u0027 Sentence sounds like it was translated from another language. Are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skip, I never noticed their ears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you detectives are working all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was trying to figure out how to get out of the line of fire. If I was thinking of anything. They were fair-skinned, Frank and Jesse. And they were fair last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair and warmer. You see their eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see the color.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was close enough to see the eyes of the one who made the trade with me. But if I saw them I wasn\u0027t paying attention. Not that it makes any difference. Did either of them speak a word at Morrissey\u0027s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes. \"I\u0027m trying to remember. I think the whole thing was pantomime. Two gunshots and then silence until they were out the door and down the stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how I remember it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, paced around the room. \"It\u0027s crazy,\" he said. \"Hey, maybe we can stop looking for the viper in my bosom. We\u0027re not looking at an inside job. We\u0027re dealing with a daring gang of two who\u0027re specializing in taking off bars in Hell\u0027s Kitchen. You don\u0027t suppose that local Irish gang, what do they call them-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Westies. No, we\u0027d have heard. Or Morrissey would have heard. That reward of his would have smoked it out in a day if any of them had anything to do with it.\" I picked up my glass and drank what was in it. God, it tasted good right now. We had them, I knew we did. I didn\u0027t know a single goddamned thing about them I hadn\u0027t known an hour ago but now I knew that I was going to bag them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why they wore disguises,\" I said. \"Oh, they might have worn them anyway, but that\u0027s why they didn\u0027t want us to get a look at them. They made a mistake. We\u0027re going to get them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, look at you, Matt. Like an old firehouse dog when the alarm goes off. How the hell are you going to get them? You still don\u0027t know who they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know they\u0027re Frank and Jesse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So? Morrissey\u0027s been trying to find Frank and Jesse for a long time. Fact he tried to get you to go looking for them. What gives you the edge now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI poured myself just one more little slug of the Wild Turkey. I said, \"When you plant a bug on a car and then you want to pick it up, you need two cars. One won\u0027t do it, but with two you can triangulate on the signal and home in on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m missing something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not quite the same thing, but it\u0027s close. We\u0027ve got them at Morrissey\u0027s, and we\u0027ve got them in that church basement in Bensonhurst. That\u0027s two points of reference. Now we can home in on them, we can triangulate on their signal. Two bullets in the ceiling- it\u0027s their fucking trademark. You\u0027d think they wanted to get caught, giving the job a signature like that.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6/page-29.html","bookId":2324,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:57 AM"}
