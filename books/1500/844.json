He ordered, “Tell Paniya to investigate who exactly it is that attacked our food factory. Also, regardless of who it is, seize that factory back for me, she has 24 hours of time. As for the requirements for this battle… I do not wish for even a single intruder to escape, nor do I need any captives, she should know what I mean.

General Morgan slowly turned around, this bit of working making him look like he aged more than ten years. The general walked over to the office table, stood there silently for a bit, and then lifted up the phone, dialing a number. A bit later, he said, “Old friend, how are things on your end?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA hoarse voice transmitted from the other end of the receiver. “Everything has still been quite good up until now!

A moment later, Helen’s image appeared on the office table’s light screen. She looked a bit thin and pallid, but there was still an ice-cold and machine-like expression on her face as she coldly said, “General Morgan, energy is extremely scarce right now, I have many experimental facilities that had to be shut down, so long distance wireless communication is an extremely extravagant thing. I hope what your distinguished self has to say is important enough, at the very least enough to not let down the consumption of this energy.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eGeneral Morgan opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but ended up holding himself back.

She also paused for a second, and only then did she say, “Electricity, fuel, ammunition, raw materials, medications, and food, need more of everything. Especially food, those two fellas are quite the eaters.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eGeneral Morgan carefully asked, “Then I’ll send some supplies over tomorrow morning?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“There’s no need, I can’t afford it.” Helen directly refused. She was always like this. After Persephone had her general rank stripped, without much of a budget left to the private hospital, the funds she relied on the previous plotting to acquire were quickly used up. Right now, Helen was already no different from poverty-stricken, lacking all ability to purchase the goods that have become incredibly scarce because of war.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“How about this, I can offer you a loan specially for purchasing these things.
