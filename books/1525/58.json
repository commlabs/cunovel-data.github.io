Sam and the others were herded to the center of the plaza and surrounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam noticed Norman had the shaman’s shard of flint gripped in one fist. The photographer lifted it. “If they mean to take my tongue, they’re gonna have to fight me for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Denal?” Sam whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I left him with the rifle,” Maggie answered. “He was supposed to lead the others away so I could try and free you. We were to rendezvous in the jungle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think that plan’s gonna work,” Norman said. He pointed his flint knife. “Look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the square, one of the hunters held Sam’s Winchester in his grip. He handled the weapon as if it were a poisonous snake. The man sniffed slightly at the barrel’s end, crinkling his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Denal…” Maggie mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sign of the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gruff voice sounded behind them. They turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePachacutec pushed through the crowd. He was in full raiment, from feathered crown to fanciful robe. He lifted his staff. The golden sunburst caught the first rays of the rising sun and glinted brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king spoke slowly in Inca, while Norman translated. “We have captured the strangers in our midst. Inti rises for his sacrifice. Revive Kamapak so the gods can be honored.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to the side, a trio of women worked on Kamapak. They bathed his face in cold water and rubbed his limbs while chanting. Slowly Kamapak’s arms began to move. Then his eyes flickered open. He seemed blind for a moment until the memory of his assault returned. Anger shone in his gaze. Weakly pushing away the women, he shoved to his feet. He wobbled a bit, but one of the hunters helped steady him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKamapak ambled shakily toward his king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePachacutec spoke again, this time in English, drawing the eyes of the students. “It be an honor to give blood to Inti. You disgrace our god with your fighting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now, the sun had risen enough that the center of the square was bathed in sunlight. Sam brandished his dagger, bright in the morning light. Disgrace or not, he wasn’t going to give his blood without drawing the same from his attackers. He raised the knife higher, wishing he had a more intimidating weapon, something to strike terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this thought, the handle of the dagger grew warm and the length of gold blade shimmered and twisted, spreading and curving, until the form of a striking snake sprouted from the hilt. Sam froze, afraid to move, unsure what had just happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the transformed dagger. Gold fangs were open to the sun, threatening the gathered throng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePachacutec had taken a step back when the transformation had started. He now took a step nearer, eyes wide with awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam did not know how the transformation had occurred, but the miracle of the dagger was clearly something the Incas had never seen. Sam raised the golden asp high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePachacutec lifted his staff, mimicking Sam’s pose. His eyelids lowered slightly, as if in prayer. Suddenly the golden sunburst symbol atop his staff flowed and transformed to match the serpent. Two snakes stared each other down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Sam’s turn to back away. Pachacutec met the Texan’s gaze. Sam no longer saw anger in the man’s eyes, but tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the king’s side, Kamapak fell to his knees, bowing his head toward Sam. The gathered throng followed suit. Foreheads pressed to the stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePachacutec lowered his staff. He stepped toward them. Arms wide. “Inti has blessed you. The sun god of the Mochico listens to your dreams. You be one of the chosen of Inti!” The king crossed to stand before Sam. He offered his hand. “You be safe in our house. All of you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam was too confused to react. The sudden change in the Incas was unnerving. But he could not quite trust the transformation, any more than he could understand what had happened to the dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie pushed beside Sam. “What about Denal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePachacutec heard her. “The boy. He be not fourteen years. Too young for huarachicoy.” He smiled as if this explained it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam frowned. Huarachicoy was the ceremonial feast where a boy was accepted as a man into a tribe, when he was given his first huara, the loincloth of an adult tribesman. “What do you mean ‘too young’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKamapak raised his face and spoke. Norman translated. “It was decided that the boy, like all the tribe’s children, was to be taken to the temple. He was to be gifted directly to the gods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie turned to Sam. “Sacrifice,” she said with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?” Sam asked. “When was this to be done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePachacutec glanced to the rising sun. The bright disk was fully above the volcanic edge. “It be done already. The boy be with the gods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam stumbled backward. “No…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Texan’s reaction confused the king. The Sapa Inca’s bright smile faltered. “Be this not Inti’s wish?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Sam said more forcefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie grabbed Sam’s elbow. “We need to go to that temple. Maybe he’s still alive. We don’t know for sure that he’s dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam nodded at her words. There was a chance. He faced Kamapak and Pachacutec. “Take us to the temple.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king bowed his head, offering no argument to one of the chosen. Instead, he waved, and the shaman stood. “Kamapak will guide you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m coming with you,” Maggie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too,” Norman added, swaying a bit on his feet. Clearly the transformation and the long stressful night had taken its toll on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam shook his head. “Norman, you need to stay here. You can speak the local lingo. Get the Incas to light a signal fire on the highest ridge so the evac helicopter can find us.” Sam reached to his vest pocket and pulled out the walkie-talkie. “Here. Contact Sykes and get a status report. But more importantly… get Uncle Hank up here ASAP!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorman looked worried with the burden of his assignment, but he accepted the walkie-talkie with a slow nod. “I’ll do what I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam clapped the photographer on the shoulder, then he and Maggie hurried away, stopping only to collect Sam’s Winchester.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful!” Norman called to them. “There’s something strange up there!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam didn’t need to be told that. All he had to do was look at the golden viper mounted on the dagger’s hilt in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBright sunlight glinted off its sharp fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shivered. Old words of warning rang in his head: Beware the Serpent of Eden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry trudged toward the collapsed subterranean temple. Even from here, he saw how the crown of the hill had fallen in on itself. Sodium lamps highlighted the excavation on the lee side of the slope, where workers still struggled to dig a rescue shaft into the buried ruins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Henry walked, Philip’s litany of the events of the past few days droned on: “… and then the temple started to implode. There was nothing I could do to stop it…” Philip Sykes had come running up to Henry as soon as the professor had cleared the helicopter’s rotors, wearing a smile that was half panicked relief and half shame, like a dog with his tail tucked between his legs. Henry ignored his student’s ceaseless explanation. The theme was clear from the start: I’m not to blame!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry finally touched Philip’s shoulder. “You’ve done a great job, Mr. Sykes. Considering the circumstances and confusion here, you’ve managed admirably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip bobbed his head. “I did, didn’t I?” He ate up the praise with a big spoon… and then thankfully grew quiet, content at being absolved for any of the tragedy. Henry, though, knew the student was hiding more than he was telling. Henry had heard the disparaging comments whispered from some of the Quechan workers as they passed. He knew enough of the local Indian dialect to tell that the laborers resented Philip. Henry suspected that if he questioned the workers, a different view of the events of the past few days would come to light… and that Philip would not come out looking so squeaky clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, Henry had more important concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eyed the two guards who flanked them. They no longer brandished their guns, but they kept their hands on holstered pistols. Abbot Ruiz marched ahead of them, wheezing through nose and mouth. The altitude and exertion in climbing through the ruins were clearly taxing the heavy man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they finally reached the site where a black tunnel opened into the side of the buried temple, a man dressed in the brown robes of a friar stepped toward them. He was darkly handsome with cold eyes that seemed to take in everything with a sharp glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbbot Ruiz stared hungrily at the tunnel opening. “Friar Otera, how do things fare here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monk remained bowed. “We should reach the temple ruins by noon, Your Eminence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Very good. You have done brilliantly.” He stepped past the bowing man without a glance, dismissing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry, though, caught the glint of white-hot anger in the monk’s eyes as he straightened, the man’s face settling back to passive disinterest. But Henry knew better. A few words of faint praise were not going to satisfy this man as they had Philip. Closer to him now, Henry noted some Indian features mixed with his Spanish heritage: a deeper complexion, a slightly wider nose, and eyes so deep a brown they seemed almost black. Friar Otera was clearly a mestizo, a half-breed, a mixture of Spanish and Indian blood. Such men had hard lives here in South America, their mixed blood often a mark of humiliation and ridicule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry followed the abbot, but remained attuned to the friar’s movements. He knew he had better keep a close watch. There were dangerous layers to this man that had nothing to do with the abbot’s schemes. Henry noticed how even Philip gave the man a wide berth as the student clambered up the loose soil toward the tunnel opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriar Otera took up a pace behind Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they reached the excavated tunnel, the sun climbed fully into the sky. The clear blue skies promised a hot day to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly a crackle of static drew their eyes toward Philip. The student reached inside his jacket and pulled free a walkie-talkie. “It must be Sam,” Philip said. “He’s early.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/excavation/page-58.html","bookId":1525,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:15 PM"}
