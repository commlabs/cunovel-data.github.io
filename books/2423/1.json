Her eyes glowed with that black heat she saved for lovemaking and really huge arguments, and he was pretty sure which she was planning for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heroin,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a Ziploc, yeah. Looked like brown sugar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What\u0027d you do with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I smoked it. What do you think? I flushed it down the toilet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You flushed it down the toilet. Jesus, Norma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn\u0027t hers. She was keeping it for a friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You believed that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She\u0027s my daughter. Yes, I believed her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick stared out the window, down at Mission Street, where the Christmas lights popped and sparked under the sudden weight of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d lived in this house almost all of his thirty-seven years, and he couldn\u0027t remember a November night this cold. The glass storefront of the corner taquería was greasy with steam. Lowriders cruised the boulevard billowing smoke from their exhaust pipes. Twenty-fourth Street station was swept clean of the homeless—all gone to shelters, leaving behind piles of summer clothes like insect husks. Next door, the Romos had turned up their music the way other people turn up the heater—the sorrowful heartbeat of narcocorrido pulsing through the townhouse\u0027s wallpaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick wanted to turn to steam and disperse against the glass. He wanted to escape from what he had to do, what he had to say. And now this—Katherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Zedmans will be here in a few minutes,” he told Norma. “I\u0027ve been home since yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head to put on an earring. “What? I should\u0027ve told you earlier? Last week I needed your help, you ran off to Texas. Maybe I should\u0027ve told you at the airport, huh? Let you get right back on the plane?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick felt his throat constricting. His Air Force buddy Hunter used to tease him about marrying Norma Reyes. Hunter said he wasn\u0027t getting a wife, he was getting a Cuban Missile Crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to tell her why he\u0027d really run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to tell her that out there in the woods of Texas—for a few days—he had remembered why he\u0027d fallen in love with her. He\u0027d remembered a time when he\u0027d been excited to have a woman half his size take him on so fearlessly, grab his hand like a toddler\u0027s grip on a shiny new toy and pull him onto the dance floor with a look that said, Yeah, I want to marry an Air Force man. You got a problem with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had decided Norma deserved the truth, even if it destroyed them. But that had been at a distance of two thousand miles. Now, getting too close, the feeling was like a computer photo. Expand it too much, and it turned into pixels of random color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shucked his tuxedo coat, walked down the hallway to Katherine\u0027s room, Norma calling from behind, “I\u0027ve already grounded her, Chadwick. Don\u0027t make it worse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine was on her bed, her back to the wall, her knees up to her chin—prepared for the assault. The Guatemalan fabric had fallen off her headboard, revealing the decorations Chadwick had painted when Katherine was two—rainbows and stars, a baby-blue cow jumping over a beaming moon. Kurt Cobain\u0027s picture sagged off the wall above, where Babar the Elephant used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadness twisted into Chadwick\u0027s chest like a corkscrew. How the hell had Katherine turned sixteen? What happened to six? What happened to ten?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to see something of himself in her, but Norma had dominated their daughter\u0027s genes completely. Katherine had her mother\u0027s fiery eyes, her defiant pout. She had the coffee skin, the lush black hair, the build that was both petite and combat-sturdy. As a child, Katherine would clench her fists and lock her knees and she\u0027d be impossible to pick up—as if she were molded from stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heroin,” Chadwick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her silver necklace back and forth over her lips, like a zipper. “I told Mom. It wasn\u0027t mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You went back.” Chadwick tried to keep his voice even. “After everything we talked about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy, look, a friend asked me to keep the stuff. A friend from school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s over. Okay? I didn\u0027t want to piss him off. I was going to throw the stuff away, give it back, whatever. I didn\u0027t have time. Happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick needed to believe her. He needed to so badly her words gained substance the more he thought about them, began to harden into a viable foundation. But goddamn it. After last Saturday . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to grab Katherine by the shoulders. He wanted to wrap his arms around her and hold her until she went back to being his little girl. He wanted to take her away from here, whether Norma liked it or not, put her on a plane to Texas, bring her to Asa Hunter\u0027s woods, teach her how to live all over again, from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had seemed so simple when he talked to Hunter. Hunter saw things the way a gun did—narrow, precise, certain. Hunter had coached him, prepared him on what to say to Norma. He\u0027d let Chadwick imagine Katherine walking those woods, free from drugs and self-destructive friends and pictures of asshole rock stars on her wall. He\u0027d even offered Chadwick a job as an escort, picking up troubled kids from around the country and bringing them to the ranch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis school I\u0027m starting— It is the future, man. Get your family out of that poison city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katherine,” Chadwick said, “I want to help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How, Daddy?” Her voice was tight with anger. “How do you want to do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick caught his own face in Katherine\u0027s mirror. He looked haggard and nervous, a hungry transient pulled from some underpass and stuffed into a tux shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat next to her on the bed, put his hand next to hers. He didn\u0027t touch her. He hadn\u0027t given his daughter a hug or a kiss in . . . weeks, anyway. He didn\u0027t remember. The distance you have to develop between a father and a daughter as she grew into a woman—he understood it, but it killed him sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to go to Texas,” Chadwick said. “The boarding school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to get rid of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn\u0027t working for you, Katherine. School, home, nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re giving me a choice? If you\u0027re giving me a choice, I say no.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to agree. It would be easier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom won\u0027t go for it otherwise,” she translated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick\u0027s face burned. He hated that he and Norma couldn\u0027t speak with one voice, that they played these games, maneuvering for Katherine\u0027s cooperation the way a divorced couple would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine kept rubbing the necklace against her lips. It seemed like yesterday he\u0027d given it to her—her thirteenth birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can\u0027t baby-sit tonight,” he decided. “We\u0027ll tell the Zedmans we can\u0027t go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy, I\u0027m fine. It\u0027s just Mallory. I\u0027ve watched her a million times. Go to the auction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick hesitated, knowing that he had no choice. He\u0027d been gone from work the entire week. He couldn\u0027t very well miss the auction, too. “Give me your car keys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine fished her Toyota key out of her pocket, dropped it into his palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where\u0027s your key chain?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your Disneyland key chain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got tired of it,” she said. “Gave it away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last week you gave away your jacket. A hundred-dollar jacket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy, I hated that jacket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You aren\u0027t a charity, Katherine. Don\u0027t give away your things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him the way she used to when she was small—as if she wanted to touch her fingertips to his chin, his nose, his eyebrows, memorize his face. Chadwick felt like he was melting inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown in the stairwell, the doorbell rang. John Zedman called up, “Candygram.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn\u0027t over, Katherine,” Chadwick said. “I want to talk about this when I get home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brushed a tear off her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katherine. Understood?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Daddy. Understood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made the last word small and hot, instantly igniting Chadwick\u0027s guilt. He wanted to explain. He wanted to tell her he really had tried to make things work out. He really did love her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chadwick?” Norma said behind him, her tone a warning. “The Zedmans are here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Mallory made her usual entrance—a blur of blond hair and oversized T-shirt making a flying leap onto Katherine\u0027s bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kaferine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Katherine transformed into that other girl—the one who could attract younger kids like an ice cream wagon song; the natural baby-sitter who always smiled and was oh so responsible and made other parents tell Chadwick with a touch of envy, “You are so lucky!” Chadwick saw that side of Katherine less and less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tousled Mallory\u0027s hair. “Hey, Peewee. Ready to have some fun?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yesss!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got Candyland. I got Equestrian Barbie. We are set to party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory gave her a high five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn and John stood in the living room, cologne and perfume a gentle aura around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” John said, registering at once that Chadwick wasn\u0027t even half ready to go. “Grizzly Adams, back from the wild.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The carnivores say hello,” Chadwick told him. “They want you to write home more often.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ouch,” John said, his smile a little too brilliant. “I\u0027ll get you for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn wouldn\u0027t make eye contact with him. She gave Norma a hug—Norma having dressed in record time, looking dangerous in a red and yellow silk dress, like a size-four nuclear explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick excused himself to finish getting ready. He listened to Norma and Ann talk about the school auction, John flipping through Chadwick\u0027s music collection, shouting innocuous questions to him about Yo-Yo Ma and Brahms, Mallory setting off all the clocks on the mantel—her ritual reintroduction to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Chadwick came out again, Katherine sat cross-legged by the fireplace—his beautiful girl, all grown up, drowning in flannel grunge and uncombed hair. Mallory sat on her lap, winding the hands of an old clock, trying to get it to chime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick locked eyes with his daughter. He felt a tug in his chest, warning him not to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t worry, Dad,” she said. “We\u0027ll be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose words would be burned into Chadwick\u0027s forehead. They would live there, laser-hot, for the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the front door shut, Katherine felt herself deflating, the little knots in her joints coming loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took Candyland down from the shelf. She joked with Mallory and smiled as they drew color cards, but inside she felt the black sadness that was always just underneath her fingernails and behind her eyes, ready to break through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine wanted a fix. She knew it would only make her depression worse—buoy her up for a little while, then make the blackness wider, the edges of the chasm harder to keep her feet on. Her therapist had warned her. Ann Zedman had warned her. Her father had warned her. They were all part of the educational team, all looking out for her best interests. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-1.html","bookId":2423,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM"}
