Rain sits in the passenger seat, arms crossed, considering something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I leave the lights on?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she says, distracted. \"I don\u0027t remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make a right on Elevado to see if the blue Jeep is there and I cruise by the spot where it\u0027s usually parked and it isn\u0027t there, and after circling the block a couple of times I pull into the driveway of the Doheny Plaza and the valet takes the car and then Rain and I go back to 1508 and she lets me go down on her and when I\u0027m hard enough she sucks me off, and when I wake up the next morning, she\u0027s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain is the only topic discussed in Dr. Woolf\u0027s office on Sawtelle and I had referred to her anonymously in the last session while she was in San Diego as \"this girl\" but now with the information I have about Julian I tell him everything: how I had met Rain Turner at a Christmas party, and I realize while I\u0027m describing that moment to Dr. Woolf that I had drinks with Julian at the Beverly Hills Hotel almost immediately afterward, and how I ran into her again at the casting sessions and then at the lounge on La Cienega, and I detail the days we spent together that last week of December and how I began to think it was real, like what I had with Meghan Reynolds, and then found out from Blair that Rain is supposedly Julian\u0027s girlfriend - at this point Dr. Woolf puts down his notepad and seems more patient with me than he probably is, and I\u0027m trying to figure out the game plan and then realize Julian must have known that Rain and I had spent those days together but how was that possible? Finally, near the end of the session, Dr. Woolf says, \"I would urge you not to see this girl anymore,\" and then \"I would urge you to cut off all contact.\" After another long silence he asks, \"Why are you crying?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-23.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
