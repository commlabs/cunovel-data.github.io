It is frequently mentioned by the Fathers of the Church, from whose writings the following particulars are collected.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The First Book appears to have contained a development of the contrariety of the Scriptures, and proofs that they did not proceed from Divinity, but from men. To this end Porphyry especially adduces what Paul writes to the Galatians, chap. ii.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;* For as the ineffable principle of things possesses all\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;power and the highest power, he first produced from himself\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;beings most transcendently allied to himself; and therefore,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;by venerating these, the highest God will be in a greater\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;degree venerated, as being a greater veneration of his\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;power.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [43]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n viz. that \"when Peter came to Antioch, he withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed.\" Hence Porphyry infers, \"that the Apostles, and indeed the chief of them, did not publicly study the salvation of all men, but that each of them was privately attentive to his own renown.\" This the Fathers testify in more than one place. See the Commentary of Jerome on the above-mentioned Epistle. Jerome also, in his 89th Epistle to Augustin, informs us that Porphyry says, \"that Peter and Paul opposed each other in a puerile contest, and that Paul was envious of the virtue of Peter.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Third Book treated of the interpretation of the Scriptures, in which Porphyry condemned the mode of explaining them adopted by the commentators, and especially the allegories of Origen. This is evident from a long extract from this work of Porphyry given by Eusebius in Hist. Eccl. lib. i. cap. 13.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Fourth Book treated of the Mosaic history and the antiquities of the Jews, as we learn from Eusebius, Proep. Evang. lib. i. cap. 9, and from Theo-doret, Serm. ii. Therap.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the Twelfth Book was the most celebrated of all, in which Porphyry strenuously opposes the\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [44]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n prophecy of Daniel. Of this work Jerome thus speaks in the Preface to his Commentary on that prophet: \"Porphyry\u0027s twelfth book is against the prophet Daniel, as he was unwilling to admit that it was written by that prophet, but contends that it was composed by a person in Jud?a named Epiphanes, and who lived in the time of Antiochus. Hence he says, that Daniel does not so much narrate future as past events. Lastly, he asserts, that whatever is related as far as to the reign of Antiochus contains a true history; but that all that is said posterior to this time, as the writer was ignorant of futurity, is false.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Thirteenth Book also, according to Jerome*, was written against the same prophet; in which book, speaking of the \"abomination of desolation,\" as it is called by Daniel, (when standing in the sacred place,) he says many reproachful things of the Christians.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The same Jerome likewise, in Epist. ci., ad Pam-machium, testifies, that Porphyry accuses the history of the Evangelists of falsehood, and says** that Christ, after he had told his brethren that he should\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;* Vid. lib. iv.

Matth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;** Lib. ii. adversus Pelagianos.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [45]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n not go up to the feast of tabernacles, yet afterwards went up to it (John vii.). Hence Porphyry accuses him of inconstancy and mutability. Jerome\u0027s observation on this is curious, viz. \"Nesciens omnia scandala ad carnem esse referenda.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jerome adds (in Lib. Quasst. Hebraic, in Genesin) \"that Porphyry calumniates the Evangelists for making a miracle to the ignorant, by asserting that Christ walked on the sea, calling the lake Genezareth the sea.\" He likewise says, that Porphyry called the miracles which were performed at the sepulchres of the martyrs, \"the delusions of evil demons.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The following remarkable passage from one of the lost writings of Porphyry relative to the Christians, is preserved by Augustin in his Treatise De Civit. lib. xix. cap. 23.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sunt spiritus terreni minimi loco terreno quodam malorum d?monum potestati subjecti. Ab his sapientes Hebr?orum, quorum unus iste etiam Jesus fuit, sicut audivisti divina Apollonis oracula qu? superius dicta sunt. Ab his ergo Heb?i dsemonibus pessimis et minoribus spiritibus vetabant religiosos, et ipsis vacare prohibebant: venerari autem magis coelestes Deos, amplius autem venerari Deum patrem.

Deum autem simulantes se colère, ea sola per quae Deus adoratur, non agunt. Nam Deus quidem utpote omnium pater nullius indiget: sed nobis est bene, cum eum per justitiam et castitatem, aliasque virtutes adoramus, ipsam vitam precem ad ipsum fa-cientes, per imitationem et inquisitionem de ipso.

From these were derived the wise men of the Hebrews, of whom Jesus also was one; as you have heard the divine oracles of Apollo above mentioned assert. From these worst of demons therefore, and lesser spirits of the Hebrew, the oracles forbid the religious, and prohibit from paying attention to them, but exhort them rather to venerate the celestial gods, and still more the father of the gods.

But the unlearned and impious natures, to whom Fate has not granted truly to obtain gifts from the gods, and to have a knowledge of immortal Jupiter,—these not attending to the gods and divine men, reject indeed all the gods, and are so far from hating prohibited demons, that they even choose to reverence them*. But pretending that they worship God, they do not perform those things through which alone God is adored. For God, indeed, as being the father of all things, is not in want of any thing; but it is well with us when we adore him through justice and continence, and the other\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;*The Platonic philosopher Sallust, in his golden book On the\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;Gods and the World, says, alluding to the Christians, cap.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;18, \"Impiety, which invades some places of the earth, and\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;which will often subsist in future, ought not to give any\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;disturbance to the worthy mind; for things of this kind do\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;not affect, nor can religious honours be of any advantage to\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;the gods; and the soul from its middle nature is not always\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;able to pursue that which is right Besides, it is not\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;improbable that impiety is a species of punishment; for\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;those who have known and at the same time despised the gods,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;we may reasonably suppose will in another life be deprived\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;of the knowledge of their nature.
