Yes, I will marry you today!” she said with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI removed her promise ring from her left hand and placed it on her right. I slid the diamond ring on her finger and kissed it. We both stood up and I swung her around, holding her tight and kissing her nonstop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have made me the happiest man alive!” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’ve made me the happiest girl in the world. I love you so much, Collin Black, and I can’t wait to marry you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you too, Amelia. I have everything all arranged already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me when I put her down and smiled. “What if I would have said no?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s the chance I took. But somehow, I knew you’d say yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What am I going to wear? I need a ring for you! Flowers? My hair, makeup! Oh my God, I’m starting to panic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “Amelia. Calm down. I’ve arranged all that. There’s a jewelry shop in the lobby; we can go pick out my ring. I have two women catering to you today. They will be helping you pick a dress and they’ll be doing your hair and makeup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took in a deep breath. “Okay. You’re truly amazing. Did you know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been told a few times.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat down at the table and ate our breakfast. “Collin, I’m scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you scared?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your parents are going to be so upset. Not to mention Julia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When we get back to New York, I’ll let my mom plan a reception for all of our family and friends. She’ll love it. Listen, Amelia, I don’t want to wait. Once we get back to New York, you have your classes, your clinicals, and you’ll be graduating in a few months. There won’t be any time to plan a wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right and I don’t want to wait either,” she said as she got up, sat down on my lap, and wrapped her arms around my neck. “I can’t wait to be your wife, Mr. Black,” she said as her lips brushed against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia and I were married at the Chapel of the Flowers. It was a beautiful ceremony and I paid top dollar to make sure everything was perfect. I wore a black tuxedo and she wore a white, tea-length dress with beads that glistened when she walked down the aisle. She wore her beautiful blonde hair up in cascading curls and carried a bouquet of pink and white roses. She was the most beautiful bride in the world and I was captivated by her every single day. The ceremony was perfect and a few tears were shed by both of us. I vowed to love her, cherish her, and devote my life to her forever. We shared our first kiss as husband and wife and walked up the aisle hand in hand. We exited the chapel and stood in front of the long, white limo that was waiting for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you so much, Mrs. Black.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you, Mr. Black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kissed one more time and climbed into the limo. We celebrated with a beautiful dinner, dancing, and a lot of lovemaking as husband and wife. She was my eternity and my savior. There was no place or no one else I wanted to be with. She took my breath away every single minute of the day and she made me happy. My life was now complete with her by my side as my wife and I was going to build an incredible family and future with her. We lay wrapped up in each other’s arms after a fulfilled night of sex and champagne. My eyes flew open as the sun shined brightly through the crack in the curtains. We were flying back to New York today and panic started to settle in as one thought came to my mind: SHIT. How am I going to tell my parents that we got married in Vegas?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe End \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-62.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
