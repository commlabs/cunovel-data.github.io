Her movements were stiff with fatigue, but sharp with determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll sleep when this is over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, a buzzing, flashing light brought Noelle out of her state of concentration. She\u0027d been losing her ability to focus anyway, due to her increasingly massive fatigue. As good as she was at missing sleep and still functioning, she was really starting to feel the effects of this stressful situation. If she didn\u0027t take a break soon, she was going to start pounding her head against the drafty cabin wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle rubbed her eyes and stood to see what was making all that noise. David\u0027s phone sat on top of his zipped duffel bag, blinking and vibrating impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle didn\u0027t dare answer it, and a quick scan of the cabin told her he was nowhere around. She picked up the phone, hooked it on her waistband and went out in search of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea if the call was important or not, but she didn\u0027t want to take any chances that he\u0027d need to talk to whoever was on the other end right away. She just hoped the phone had voice mail, because she wasn\u0027t going to answer it and take the chance the call would give away their location.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air outside the cabin was nippy but smelled clean. After being inside the cramped space for so long, it was nice to have the bright, open sky over her head rather than heavy wooden beams. Her coat kept out the worst of the cold, but she shoved her hands deep into her pockets to keep her fingers warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a little rush of embarrassment, Noelle knocked on the door of the outhouse, hoping she wasn\u0027t interrupting anything important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t respond, a fact for which she was immensely grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light dusting of snow covered the ground and Noelle could see David\u0027s big boot prints etched plainly into the snow. She followed the path, which headed into the trees growing on the slope leading down the mountain. About: fifty yards along, the footprints vanished along with the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle stood there, looking around for any sign as to which way he\u0027d gone. She found none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than wander around in the trees and get lost, she cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the third shout, he appeared silently out of the trees, panic sharpening his features. He pushed her to the ground, his hand covering her mouth, his body pressing hers flat against the cold earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not alone,\" he whispered against her ear. \"I just hope they didn\u0027t hear you yelling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear lanced through her and she went stiff beneath; him. She tugged at his hand, which he moved so she could whisper. \"The Swarm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid shook his head while staring at her mouth. He stared for a long time, her question apparently forgotten. Just when she was sure he was about to kiss her, he rolled off her and braced his weight on his elbows. His shoulders were hunched and his voice was clipped and harsh. \"Hunters, but I\u0027m not taking any chances. I\u0027ve been watching them all morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying on the ground without David\u0027s warmth protecting her left her feeling cold and vulnerable. When she tried to sit up, David said, \"Stay down. They\u0027re just down in the next valley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled to her belly and propped herself up on her elbows, mimicking David\u0027s position. \"What are they doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid pulled out a pair of binoculars and peered down into the valley. \"Drinking beer, mostly. It doesn\u0027t look like they heard you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it a little early for beer?\" asked Noelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid shrugged. \"Guess not for them. They\u0027ve been out here since daybreak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would the Swarm sit around drinking beer when our cabin is less than a mile away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think they would, but even if they are just hunters, if they stumble across the cabin, it\u0027s going to cause problems. Caleb\u0027s cabin isn\u0027t supposed to exist, at least not on public records. If these fools mention that we\u0027re staying up here to someone back in town, we\u0027ll have to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t we just go somewhere else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid shook his head. \"This place is about as safe as it\u0027s going to get unless you want to keep moving around. I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be able to get as much work done that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the thought.of trying to work in a moving car made her stomach queasy. \"So what do we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep watching them and make sure they don\u0027t get any closer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if they dori\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a sinister little smile. \"I\u0027ll convince them this is a bad way to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do? Set out bear traps or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or something. Right now, I need you to go back to the cabin, where you\u0027ll be safe. I\u0027ll handle things out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle didn\u0027t really want to go back to the cabin alone. She knew she should be brave and tough and force herself to go back to work, but she was tired and worried.. She was feeling particularly vulnerable with those men down in the valley below, though she didn\u0027t want to admit anything of the sort. David had enough to worry about without having the added worry of her feelings. She was a big girl and could take care of herself, at least under normal circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, these were far from normal, and she really needed to be close to someone she trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather stay. The work isn\u0027t going too well and I needed a break to clear my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take you for a walk later. Right now I really need you out of harm\u0027s way. Even if those men are just hunters, they\u0027re still drinking and carrying weapons. It\u0027s not a good combination.\" He gripped her shoulder, feeling her through her coat. \"And you forgot to wear your vest.\" He said that last part with a paternal frown better suited to a naughty child than a full-grown woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle didn\u0027t like it a bit and she fought off the need to get defensive with him. He was right. She never should have left without wearing her Kevlar vest. She\u0027d have to get used to it if she wanted to live. \"I was in a hurry,\" she said, remembering why she\u0027d come out here to begin with. \"The phone was ringing.\" She dug under her coat and pulled it from her belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid took the phone, his look grim. \"Did they just call once?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle nodded. \"I think so. I mean, I was working, but it did distract me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell of a phone,\" he muttered as he turned it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to call and get a message or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He didn\u0027t elaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if someone\u0027s trying to get in touch with us? What if it\u0027s urgent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" he said in a frighteningly even tone. \"Someone at that safe house leaked your location. That\u0027s what caused the attack. I\u0027m not about to trust anyone until I know who that leak was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle couldn\u0027t suppress a little shiver of fear as it raced up her spine. \"You don\u0027t have any backup?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked away, but not before she could see the frustration lining his face. \"I\u0027ll do fine without it. You should go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, it no longer mattered if he thought she was a coward. As long as he let her stay, he could think whatever he wanted. \"Do you mind if I stay a while? I could, you know, be your backup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis features softened and he looked like he was about to smile over her offer. \"Just exactly how much do you know about covert surveillance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that I can\u0027t do it from inside that cabin.\" Just thinking about going back to the dingy little room again was enough to make it hard to breathe. The weight of her situation was bearing down upon her, wearing her thin. She wasn\u0027t making much progress with the code. She needed a break—to be out in the open for a little while breathing fresh air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he was about to refuse, but after searching her face, he gave in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just stay low and quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle grinned, feeling momentarily free of her burdens. She scooted a little closer to David in an effort to stay warm. \"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid glanced at Noelle, expecting her to be staring off into space, working on something only she could see. Instead, he found that she\u0027d fallen asleep. She hadn\u0027t even been out here ten minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for backup, David thought with an indulgent grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d curled up on her side in an effort to stay warm and David covered her with a thin survival blanket he pulled from his pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it always was whenever he looked at her while she slept, David felt something shift in his chest—become more comfortable and somehow tighter at the same time. She looked so trusting and it tugged at every one of his protective instincts whenever he glanced her way. He was the only thing standing between her and death, and yet she trusted him enough that she just dozed off with armed men in the next valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a long time since anyone had trusted him like that. He was humbled, willing to do anything to prove he was worthy of her trust. He couldn\u0027t fail her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle\u0027s red hair blended in perfectly among the fallen leaves, her gold-rimmed glasses glinting like the clusters of snowflakes still clinging to branches here and there. Her cheeks were flushed pink and her lips were parted, breathing silvery plumes of warmth into the air. Man, what he wouldn\u0027t give to be here with her for the sheer enjoyment of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d never made love on a cold forest floor before. He\u0027d had enough sleeping on frozen ground during his career for him ever to choose that over a nice, warm bed. But right now, David couldn\u0027t think of a better place to get naked with a woman than right here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d keep her warm with his body and heat from the passion he\u0027d light deep inside her. He\u0027d love her so good .she\u0027d forget all about the cold air and scattered leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d make it so good she\u0027d forget she was a hunted woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid slipped her glasses from her nose to pocket them for safekeeping. His fingers grazed along her cheek and he closed his eyes against the smooth satin of her skin brushing against his knuckles. She murmured something low and incoherent and shifted toward his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled away and forced himself to focus on his surroundings. He could no longer lie on his stomach without pain as his erection grew in response to the feel of her skin. Not even the frozen ground was enough to keep his lust at bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing his thoughts back to the men below, David peered through the binoculars. It appeared as though they were packing their gear to leave, now that the beer had run out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid watched them leave the way they\u0027d come. He\u0027d scouted earlier and seen a couple beat-up trucks parked along the side of the only road leading up this side of the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was glad they weren\u0027t camping out for the night. \\ David didn\u0027t think he would be able to stand being out : here in the cold all night while Noelle stayed alone in the cabin, unprotected. And he certainly couldn\u0027t let her stay with him without the benefit of a fire to keep her warm. Without one, she would freeze by morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless he kept her warm another way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid spat a caustic curse into the frigid air. He could not keep thinking of her as a woman. He had to think of her as a job, an op, an assignment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assignment let out a sleepy sigh of contentment* which felt like a warm hand stroking his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle shifted and David had to pull the blanket back up over her shoulders again. He hated waking her now that she\u0027d finally gone to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid wasn\u0027t sure how much longer her body was going to be able to keep this pace before something had to give.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was relentless with herself in pursuit of the solution to the code Monroe had presented. David had seen men with less determination make it through Special Forces training. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-20.html","bookId":2374,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM"}
