Always dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunman Felix remembered the very first time he had been introduced to Simon Kennedy, remembered his face and his smile and his handshake. Remembered seeing him dance, for chrissakes, at debutante parties and charity balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunman Felix remembered his laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very big social figure. Very prestigious to have him at a party. Very big deal. Because he was so smooth, you know. Smooth and polished and cultured. Very big into culture is our monster. Patron of the arts, they called him - probably still do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And all those people and all those kids are looking up to this pig, told to look and act and think like him and be gracious and smooth when you meet him. Young guys told to stand up tall and the girls straightening their gowns and touching up their hair as he comes down the bloody receiving line because everybody loves him, you see. Everybody thinks he\u0027s such a grand person!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunman Felix turned and looked at them, at Cat and Davette, and his face was hard to meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just walks right up to them. Because they don\u0027t know. Right up to them and smiles and shakes their hands and talks to them and they talk back - just like he was real. Because they don\u0027t know!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked away from them and spoke again, so low they could barely hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one knows. But us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunman Felix was quiet for a while, pacing again back and forth, smoking furiously and inwardly boiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat and Davette exchanged a glance when they heard his teeth grind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha!\" he shouted without any humor, and stopped abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at them and his tone was reasonable and deeply wicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, when your aunt died and the medical examiner came over to take care of things for you - you ever met the guy before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette thought a moment. \"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded. \"Sure. At your level you meet everybody eventually. But did you know him? Did your aunt hang out with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... no. I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he suddenly drops everything and comes to your aid. I mean, she had lots of old friends, didn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Of course. But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you see! Your Aunt Victoria committed suicide. An autopsy is automatic, by law. That M.E. - what\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Harshaw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Harshaw. He gives her an autopsy - he\u0027s got to. It\u0027s the law with all suicides. And he sees the marks. He sees the bites. And he knows what\u0027s what and... that\u0027s how they found Ross! Don\u0027t you see? Harshaw sees it\u0027s a vampire and he tells Kennedy. That\u0027s the only way a vampire can survive in the middle of the city. He owns the medical examiner. Owns him or one of his bitches does. Maybe he owns the poor guy\u0027s wife... It doesn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The point is: he\u0027s strong. Strong and powerful and he knows people, and the people he doesn\u0027t know socially, he owns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That fucking house of his. That fort. No way to get to him there. Daytime, high noon - it doesn\u0027t matter. Think you can get through that wall? Through that Fort Knox front gate? And, even if you did, are you prepared to kill half a dozen security guards who almost certainly haven\u0027t got a clue as to what\u0027s what? Then the staff, of course. They\u0027ll try to stop you. Some of them know, too. And they\u0027ll really put up a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And by then, just how many SWAT teams and police choppers and Texas Rangers do you think will be surrounding you - shooting at you on sight - for trying to pull some terrorist act on the home of so prominent a man?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pillar of the fucking community?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patron of the fucking arts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunman Felix sat down, abruptly, and turned to his watery drink and drank it dry and held out the glass for another. Cat took it from him and went to refill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha!\" laughed Felix again... and that awful laugh made them jump...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha! I still get solicitations from him. Or some charity board he\u0027s on. You know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette jumped again at his look, nodded. \"I remember him now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunman Felix nodded and smiled. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette didn\u0027t like his smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had some favorite charity goodie, didn\u0027t he? Got something at the office in the mail along with a bunch of clippings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Opera,\" said Davette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he looked at her and his eyes went wide and his smile was too bright and tortured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! Of course! Opera. Isn\u0027t it all just so wonderful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavette didn\u0027t know what to say. Cat, standing there pale and staring, remembered the drink in his hand and handed it to the Gunman. Felix drank it dry in a single gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Opera. Some big project about...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he stopped and looked at Davette and it hit her, too, and she looked back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Opera House!\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he replied. \"The Opera House.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he looked over at the newspaper Cat had left crumpled on the floor, open to the Entertainment Section because they had been thinking about going to an afternoon movie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunman Felix stood up and strode over to it and picked it up and rifled quickly through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha!\" he cackled when he found what he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he came back and he leaned down to where Davette was sitting on the floor and planted the open newspaper on the rug beside her and punched his index finger into it so hard it went through the newsprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked. It was an ad. For the much delayed, greatly heralded, grand opening of the Dallas Opera House. One week from today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be there,\" whispered Gunman Felix and his voice was old dead wood. \"He\u0027ll be there. And they will rush up to him and shake his hand and congratulate him and love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And in return, he\u0027ll slash their throats and swell fat and thick on their blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one spoke for a few moments after that. Cat and Davette couldn\u0027t speak, could only stare at the maniacal grin sitting before them, relishing and cherishing and worming the pain deeper into his own soul. He seemed to take such dreadful delight in the crushing irony of it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said after a while and he was much much calmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImpossibly so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he repeated. \"He could just walk up to people and talk to them. But they could just walk up to him, too. Even somebody who knew what he was. He would not suspect. He would simply smile at them, like a big... fat... tick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He would be completely off his guard, wouldn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Felix!\" gasped Cat. \"You can\u0027t mean...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rock and roll, Cherry Cat. Isn\u0027t that what you always say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be serious!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunman Felix just smiled and stared at the newspaper ad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to, Cat. Got to.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-31.html","bookId":2118,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM"}
