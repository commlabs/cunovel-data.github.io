I know you were in SWAT and all . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young detective’s eyes were pleading. His voice verged on panic, which played Kelsey just the right way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey smiled like a sadist anticipating a bar fight. “Miss Lee, if you’ll excuse me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment he was out of the room, Maia moved around DeLeon’s desk and read the note on her corkboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite——Timing is wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSantos—ME——retired\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2107 Dunbar\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e864-9719\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia simply could have memorized the information—she was good at that—but some instinct made her peel the note off the board, along with the photo of Lucia DeLeon and Etch Hernandez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is crazy, she decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she slipped the photo and the note into her coat pocket. She moved another picture to cover the blank space—the photo of Ralph and Ana and their baby at the zoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother wave of nausea swept over her, leaving her shivering and weak-kneed against the sergeant’s desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night, she had come so close to telling Tres what was wrong with her. Now he was on the run, protecting a murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should’ve left Tres where she found him, tending bar in Berkeley. The most impetuous thing she’d ever done: slipping a business card across the bar to a guy she barely knew, just because he had beautiful green eyes and a smile that doubled her heart rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might make a good investigator, she’d told him. Give me a call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen years later, her judgment was still rotten. She’d quit her job in San Francisco, moved to Austin to be closer to him, left everything behind. She would do anything to help him. But when it came to making responsible choices, he was hopeless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph Arguello embodied everything Maia resented about Tres’ hometown—dangerous, suffocating roots that had been pulling Tres away from Maia as long as they’d known each other. She’d almost lost him once before, when he’d first moved back to Texas. Now, when she needed his full attention more than ever . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she’d told him the truth last night, what would he have done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn explosion of voices from the cubicle area brought her back to the present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell—he’s got my—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds of scuffling, something heavy thrown against a cubicle wall. Then a bruised and bloody elf, now armed with the young detective’s Glock, burst into the office, Kelsey and two other detectives close behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia’s reflexes were slow. Before she knew what was happening, the elf was behind her, his arm clamped around her waist, the gun at her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back off!” the elf screamed at the cops. “Back the hell off!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elf’s breath was sour and warm against her cheek. The muzzle of the Glock dug under her jaw. But at that moment, Maia was more scared of Kelsey. He had his pistol trained on the suspect, just an inch to the right of Maia’s ear. She saw no thought of negotiation in his eyes. No concern for her safety. He was hesitating only because he wanted a nice clean shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia grabbed the elf’s arm around her waist. She dug her thumb into the acupressure point at his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screamed, his muscles loosening from the shock to his nervous system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove her elbow into his ribs. He buckled forward and she rammed his head into the desk. He crumpled to the floor, the gun clattering onto the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cops went slack-jawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gentlemen,” she said shakily. “If you’ll excuse me . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey parted for her like a bead curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway through the homicide division, Kelsey caught up with her. “Counselor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was a beautiful shade of pomegranate. “What was—how did you . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a shaky breath. “We have no further business, Detective. If I communicate with my client, I will advise him of our conversation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey looked at her as if reappraising her value. He rubbed the old scars on his fingers. “I didn’t tell you the deal, Miss Lee. Forty-eight hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until the DNA test results from the Franklin White case are made public. Until we release the fact that Ana got shot because she was about to name her husband as prime suspect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression stayed deadly serious. “This time Monday morning, Counselor. Navarre has that long to bring me Ralph Arguello. After that, believe me, I won’t have to worry about bringing Arguello to justice, or anybody who’s helping him. Guy White will take care of our problem for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRALPH AND I SPENT A COLD SLEEPLESS NIGHT WITH SOME transients under a bridge on West Main.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe homeless guys decorated a Christmas tree with beer cans. They roasted pecans over a trash can fire, tried to remember the words to “We Three Kings” and kept asking Ralph if he had the DTs because of the way he was shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried talking to him about Ana and the Frankie White case. I told him Ana would be okay. We had other options besides running from the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might as well have been talking to the transients’ shopping cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph stared into the flames, every once in a while muttering the Rosary in Spanish, as if trying to draw ghosts out of the heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE FIRST TIME I’D MET RALPH was also my first real experience with Frankie White. We were all juniors at Alamo Heights High School. Ralph got jumped by three Anglo linebackers outside a convenience store because he’d flirted with one of their girlfriends. I was on the football team, too, but I never liked unfair fights. I jumped in on Ralph’s side. He and I kicked some ass. One of the linebackers happened to be an overgrown blond preppie named Frankie White.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn typical Ralph fashion, he became friends with both Frankie and me after the fight. I was never sure what Ralph saw in Frankie, but I understood Frankie’s fascination with Ralph. Ralph was completely unintimidated by Frankie’s mobster family ties. No one in San Antonio had ever had the guts to punch Frankie in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral months later, Ralph invited Frankie and me to dinner at his house for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arguello family lived in a crumbling white adobe cottage on the wrong side of McCullough, ten feet from the train tracks. The skeet club’s shooting range was behind the back fence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tiny rooms were packed with a horde of smaller Arguello siblings, cousins and nephews whose names I could never keep straight. The extended family, Ralph informed me, lived with Mama Arguello full-time. Most had dead or missing or apathetic parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankie White gave me an amused look, like, Can you believe this shit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSleeping bags filled the living room. Three dogs lounged on the sofa. The walls were cluttered with family photos and crucifixes and portraits of saints. No air-conditioning. A hundred degrees inside, with a limp breeze pushing the pale yellow curtains. Ralph’s mother stood at the stove, making tortillas by hand and cooking them on a hot plate. She kissed me, though she didn’t know me. She smelled of gladiolas and cornmeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it had been me, at age seventeen, I would’ve been embarrassed by the house, my mother, the way the kids clamored over Ralph and demanded piggyback rides and quarters and arm-wrestling rematches. Especially with Frankie White there, who lived in a mansion and drove his own Mercedes. But Ralph didn’t care. He grinned at the kids, laughed, joked around. He seemed as confident as he had when Frankie and the other linebackers tried to assault him. Nothing fazed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, not until we went into the backyard to set the picnic table and found his latest stepfather (the sixth) trying to kiss Ralph’s fourteen-year-old cousin. Apparently, it had happened before, because Ralph’s voice turned to ice. “I warned you, pendejo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwelve minutes later, Ralph dumped the battered stepfather half-conscious into the curbside trash can, tossed his suitcase next to him and called a taxi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankie beamed like a kid at his first R-rated movie. “That was hella cool, Arguello.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack inside, his mother screamed, cried, made excuses for the bum she’d married, but Ralph just held her while she pummeled his chest. “He’s no good for you, Mama. I’ll look after you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she argued money, Ralph produced six hundred-dollar bills for the week’s expenses, more cash than I’d ever seen. He told the younger kids to go back outside and set the table. He grounded his fourteen-year-old cousin to the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time dinner was ready, the family’s happy chaos seemed to be restored. We ate homemade carne guisada tacos and drank Big Red while fireflies blinked across the lawn. Gunshots crackled in the summer air. Every so often a train rumbled by and made the ground shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrankie White enjoyed himself immensely. He kept glancing at the bedroom window, where the fourteen-year-old cousin was watching him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph’s mother was the only one who didn’t cheer up. She stared at the citronella candle on the table as if she wished the flame would freeze, just once, into a shape she could hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night under the Main Street Bridge, years later, staring at the trash can fire, Ralph reminded me of his mother for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN THE MORNING, WE CHANGED INTO clothes from a Goodwill donation box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’d already ditched Ralph’s car in an H.E.B. grocery store parking lot, so we hot-wired the Chevy Impala of a former client I didn’t like very much. Then we headed downtown with my .22 pistol, six dollars and thirty-two cents between us, and very little hope of living through the weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d managed to grab my cell phone before leaving the house, but we decided to use a pay phone on the corner of South Saint Mary’s instead. I doubted SAPD could triangulate a mobile call. According to Ana they couldn’t even figure out their own e-mail system. But there was no point taking chances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Maia’s number. She was already in town. If possible, she sounded even angrier than she had the night before, when I called to let her know I was a fugitive from justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she told me about her conversation with Detective Kelsey and the note she’d found on Ana’s bulletin board, a pickup full of immigrant laborers cruised past on Houston Street. The driver slowed to see if we wanted work. Ralph shook his head. The truck drove on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tres?” Maia prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re protecting a murderer. Turn him in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pinched the collar of my Goodwill ski jacket, tried to pretend the smell of mildew wasn’t coming from me. “The lead on the ME . . . ‘timing.’ What does that mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” she said wearily. “It doesn’t matter. DNA is one of the few things you can’t argue with. That’s all they’ll need to convict.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in her voice worried me. Aside from the anxiety and the anger, she sounded . . . sick. The way she sounded whenever she was forced to face her phobia about boats and deep water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I’m not,” she said. “You’re running from the law.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look, Maia . . . Ana didn’t believe the DNA results. You could retrace her steps, find out where she was going with the investigation.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mission-road-tres-navarre-6/page-7.html","bookId":2421,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:35 PM"}
