Jessie,\" the young man mumbled, reading his confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering his gun, Monk nodded and pushed inside. \"Where\u0027s Lisa?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. 1 was up in triage,\" he explained, trembling all over, close to shock. \"Then the explosions. . . four of the crew opened fire in the hospital ward. I ran. Dr. Cummings had gone to speak with the toxicologist. I prayed to Vishnu that she had fled back to her cabin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man glanced to the fouled bed, then just as quickly away. \"Dr. Cummings had left her bag up in triage. I grabbed it. Found her key. But the man here had already been waiting inside. He got angry when I wasn\u0027t her. Made me kneel on the floor. He had a radio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie pointed to the portable radio on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what happened to his throat?\" Monk asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t let him report in. And Dr. Cummings had left more than her key card in her bag.\" From his waistband, Jessie pulled free a scalpel. \"I... I had to . ..\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk squeezed his upper arm. \"You did good, Jessie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man sagged down atop the other bed. \"I heard them over shipwide radio. Calling for some of the doctors. Including Dr. Cummings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did they want them to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ship\u0027s bridge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they repeat the order?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie stared for a moment, then slowly shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Lisa must have obeyed. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk now had a destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed to the door that linked their two rooms. It had been left ajar. A quick peek revealed his room was in no better shape. Someone had cleared his personal gear, including his satellite phone. He searched a bit more to be sure. No luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk also examined the dead body and discovered a surprise. The dark hue of the pirate\u0027s skin extended only to hands and face. The remainder of the man\u0027s skin was as pale as snow, sprinkled with a few freckles. This was no local islanderâ€”but some mercenary in disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was going on here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk crossed back to his room to grab a pair of basketball shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he pulled them over his bare feet, he spoke to Jessie. \"We can\u0027t stay here. Someone will come looking for your sleeping beauty over there. We\u0027ll find you somewhere else to hole up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going after Lisa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m coming with you.\" Jessie stood up a bit shakily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man tugged his shirt over his head, plainly intending to go in a pirate disguise, too. The young man was all rib bones, but Monk supposed there were some wiry muscles under there, too. Jessie had jumped the man here, taken out someone twice his size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m better alone,\" Monk said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie finally got his shirt over his head, mumbling something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse turned to him, exasperated. \"I\u0027ve been trained in jujitsu and karate. Fifth-degree black belt in each.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re India\u0027s answer to Jackie Chan. You\u0027re still not coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock at the door startled them both. Someone shouted at them in Malay, plainly a question. Monk didn\u0027t understand a word. He lifted his rifle. He had other means of communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie slipped past him, shoving Monk\u0027s rifle barrel down as he passed. The nurse called through the door, sounding irritated, snapping back in Malay. An exchange followed, then whoever was at the door left, plainly satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie turned back to him, cocking one eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, maybe you could be useful,\" Monk admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4:20 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa stood with the other scientists and Ryder Blunt. The group of captives had been led at gunpoint to the foredeck of the ship. The large helicopter rested on its pad, tethered down now. Its hatches were open and a beehive of activity buzzed around it. Men unloaded heavy crates from its cargo holds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noted some of the stamped names and corporate logos: synbiotic, welch scientific, genecorp. One box bore a stenciled American flag and the letters usamriid. The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all medical equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crates vanished down the throat of an elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught Henri Barnhardt\u0027s eye. The toxicologist had also noted the marked crates. One hand absently scratched his bearded chin. Deep frown lines bracketed his lips. Off to the side, Miller and Lindholm simply stood with their eyes glazed over, while Ryder Blunt attempted to light another cigar in the blustering breezes atop the cruise ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding under the helicopter\u0027s rotors, Dr. Devesh Patanjali continued to oversee the final unloading personally. He had never explained his cryptic statement about saving the world. Instead he had ordered them all up here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Maori leader of the gunmen stood to one side, hands free of any weapons, but his palm rested on a holstered horse pistol, a massive sidearm. He stood with squinted eyes, surveying the foredeck\u0027s activity, like a sniper sweeping a killing field. Lisa knew nothing escaped his notice, including the young woman who had accompanied Dr. Devesh Patanjali.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remained a mystery, having spoken not a single word, her face an unwavering mask. She stood atop the foredeck with her sleek black boots together, her hands folded at her waist, a formal posture of waiting and servitude. And though her face might be unreadable, the shape and curve of her form had fully captured the attention of the Maori gunman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa had overheard her name when Dr. Patanjali had passed out of the presidential suite below. Surina. The doctor had given her a chaste kiss on the cheek as he left. It had been accepted without a flicker of emotion. The woman appeared to be of mixed Indian blood, dressed in a long sari wrap of muted oranges and rose silk, draped over which was a long ebony braid. If untied, her hair must sweep the floor behind her heels. Marking her heritage, she bore a crimson dot, the traditional bindi, on her forehead. But her complexion, a polished teak, was much lighter than Devesh Patanjali\u0027s, suggesting a European bloodline somewhere in her past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether she was Devesh\u0027s sister, wife, or merely a companion, Lisa could not discern. But there was also something menacing in her silence, possibly heightened by the coldness in her eyes. Also her left arm was gloved in black, so skintight it was hard to tell if it was leather or rubber. But it looked like her limb had been dipped in black India Ink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing her arms, Lisa turned and searched the receding profile of Christmas Island. In the short time they\u0027d been under way, the island had shrunk to a misty green silhouette, trailing a smudge of dark smoke into the sky. But who was there to see it as a signal? Painter would surely grow suspicious if neither she nor Monk called in to report. And for the moment, she placed all her hopes on his paranoia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily it was a safe bet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wind gusted as the tradewinds kicked up. Gulls coasted the breezes overhead, catching her eyes. If only she could fly away as easily . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shout drew her attention back to the helicopter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men in surgical scrubs hauled a stretcher from the rear hold of the helicopter. Wheels dropped and locked. Devesh hovered over them, checking the patient strapped to the gurney. Portable monitoring equipment lay nestled haphazardly around the patient for transport. The figure was sealed in an oxygen tent. The patient appeared to be a woman from the rise and fall of her chest. Facial features were obscured by a respirator and a tangled octopus of tubes and wires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh pointed his cane, and the two orderlies guided the gurney toward the elevators, following the train of medical equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally crossed back to his captives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have all the labs and medical suites set up in the next hour. Luckily, Dr. Cummings and her partner were very kind to have brought pieces of equipment that were beyond even my reach. Who would have known your Defense Department\u0027s research-and-development branch had perfected a portable scanning electron microscope? Along with electrophoresis equipment and protein sequencer? Quite a bit of serendipity to have such tools land in our laps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tapped his cane and set off. \"Come. Let me show you the true face of what assails us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa followed with the others. In this instance, she didn\u0027t need the rifles at her back to make her obey. Mysteries were piled atop mysteries here, and she wanted answers, some clue to the reason for this assault and for Devesh\u0027s words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dear, together we must save the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were led down three decks. Along the way, Lisa had noted crews of men in chemical suits, working along the lower passageways, moving within stinging clouds of sprayed disinfectant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh continued to the forward section of the ship. The hall ended ut II wide circular space, off which the pricier cabins extended. Monk had mandeered one of the large suites here for his own laboratory. It seemed Devesh had commandeered all the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucking under an isolation drape, he waved them into the busy central workspace. \"Here we are,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA score of men were cracking open crates, yanking out packing straw and Styrofoam, hauling free plastic-wrapped medical and laboratory equipment. One man emptied a boxful of petri dishes used to culture bacteria. The door to Monk\u0027s lab lay open. Lisa noted a man inside with a clipboard, inventorying Sigma\u0027s equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevesh marched them to a neighboring cabin. He swiped a personal key card and shoved open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, he spoke to the tattooed leader of the mercenary force. \"Rakao, please have Dr. Miller taken to the bacteriology suite.\" He turned to the scientist. \"Dr. Miller, we\u0027ve taken the liberty of bringing up and expanding your bacteriology station. New incubation ovens, anaerobic growth media, blood culture plates. I\u0027d like you to coordinate with Dr. Eloise Chenier, my team\u0027s virologist, down the hall, to complete the infectious-disease lab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Maori leader waved for one of his men to escort Miller down the hall. The bacteriologist glanced around at the others, plainly not wanting to leave their company, but the rifle at his back discouraged any argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Miller left, Devesh nodded to their group. \"And, Rakao, would you personally escort Sir Ryder and Dr. Lindholm up to the radio room? We\u0027ll join you momentarily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir.\" The tattooed man did not like this decision, his one word heavy with warning, eyeing Lisa and Henri with suspicion. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-23.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
