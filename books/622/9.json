The main difficulty was about getting money to buy what was absolutely necessary. This was very irritating, especially since Tony knew about Ben’s hidden treasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One morning Tony went to Ben for money, saying:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There isn’t a scrap of food in the house except a little tea.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You can make some tea. That will do,” said Ben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It may do for you, but it won’t for me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It costs a sight to support two people.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know about that. I’ve only spent two dollars in six days. You don’t call that much, do you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Two dollars!” ejaculated the old man, terrified. “Oh, it’s too much. I am ruined!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Are you?” said Tony coolly. “Then all I can say is, you’re easily ruined. I want half a dollar.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I shan’t give it to you,” snarled Ben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you mean to starve?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I won’t part with all I have. You are robbing me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That won’t make much difference, as you’ll be dead in three days,” said Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What?” almost shrieked Ben, in dismay. “Who told you so? The doctor?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You ain’t goin’ to murder me, are you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No; you are going to murder yourself.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What do you mean?” demanded Ben peevishly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You’re not willing to buy anything to eat,” explained Tony, “and you can’t live above three days on nothing.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Is that all? What made you frighten me so?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I only told you the truth. Are you going to give me the money?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Perhaps you’ll tell me where I’m going to get so much money?” said Ben, in the same tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I will tell you if you want me to,” answered Tony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Where?” asked Ben eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Under the floor,” returned Tony composedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What!” screamed Ben, in consternation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Just where I said. There’s plenty of money under that plank.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who told you?” groaned the old man, livid with terror. “Have—have you taken any?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Not a dollar. It’s all there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Have you been spying when I was asleep?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, I haven’t. That ain’t my style.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How could you find out, then?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I’ll tell you. The first night I was here, you got up in your sleep and took up the board. Then you drew out two bags of gold pieces and counted them.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, I’m ruined! I’m undone!” lamented Ben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I don’t see how you are.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I shall be robbed. There’s only a little there—only a few dollars to bury me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I guess you mean to have a tall funeral,” said Tony coolly. “There’s a thousand dollars there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, no, only fifty,” answered the old man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There’s no use talking, I know better. If you don’t believe it, suppose I count the pieces.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, no!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Just as you say. As it is, you’ve got plenty of money, and I know it, and if you ain’t willing to use some of it, I’ll go off and leave you alone.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t go,” said Ben hastily. “You’re a good boy. You wouldn’t rob a poor old man, would you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nor a rich old man either, but I don’t mean to starve. So give me fifty cents and I’ll get some fresh bread and butter, and tea and sugar.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No matter about the butter. It costs too much.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I want butter myself. My constitution requires it,” said Tony. “You needn’t eat it if you don’t want to.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ben groaned again, but he produced the money required, and Tony soon returned from the grocery store with small supplies of the articles he had named.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now we’ll have some breakfast,” said Tony cheerfully. “Don’t you feel hungry?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A—a little,” acknowledged Ben reluctantly. “I wish I wasn’t. It costs so much to live.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t think it costs you much,” said Tony. “This morning I’m going to give you a boiled egg.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I can’t afford it,” groaned the old man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You may as well eat it, as it’s here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How much did you pay?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Three cents for two.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ben groaned again, but when breakfast was ready he showed an unusually good appetite, and did not refrain from partaking of the egg, expensive as it was.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Compton came in the next morning, and pronounced the old man better and stronger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shall I be able to get up soon, doctor?” asked Ben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In a day or two, I think.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ben heaved a sigh of relief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I’m glad of it,” he said. “I can’t afford to be sick.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Has it cost you much?” asked the doctor, amused.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It costs a sight to live. He eats a good deal.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He’s a growing boy; but he’s worth all he costs you. You’d better ask him to stay with you a few weeks.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, no; I can’t afford it,” said Ben hastily. “He’s a good boy; but he’s very hearty—very hearty.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t vex him, doctor,” said our hero. “I’m tired of staying here. I want to get out on the road again.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ben looked relieved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Right, boy,” he said—“you’re right. It’s a dull place. You’ll be better off to go.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You have been lucky to have him here during your sickness,” said the doctor. “Without his care, or that of some one else, you would probably have died.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But I won’t die now?” asked old Ben anxiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not at present, I hope. But you must live better than you have been accustomed to do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I shall be glad to get away,” said Tony hurriedly, to the doctor, outside of the house. “I’m used to tramping, and I can’t stand it much longer. There’s one thing I want to tell you before I go.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Go on, my boy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am afraid the old man will be robbed sometime.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Is there anything to steal?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony, in a low tone, imparted to Dr. Compton the discovery he had made of the miser’s hoards.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I suspected as much,” said the doctor. “I will do what I can to induce Ben to have the gold moved to a place of safety, but I don’t feel confident of my ability to do it. Such men generally like to have their hoards within their own reach.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two nights later Tony awoke shortly after midnight. It was a bright, moonlight night, as on the first night he slept there. Again he saw Ben crouched on the floor, engaged in counting his hoards. The old man had recovered enough strength to get out of bed without assistance. This time, he was broad awake.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tony was not the only witness of the spectacle. Casting his eyes toward the window, he was startled by seeing a dark, sinister face pressed against the pane, almost devouring the old man and his gold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was the face of Rudolph, the tramp!\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2019/57594.html","bookId":622,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 5:56:04 AM"}
