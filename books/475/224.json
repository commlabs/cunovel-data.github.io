Nay, he builds it for the sea and the storm. When he was making it, he thought of tempests and hurricanes; if he did not, he was a poor shipbuilder. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen God made thee a believer, He meant to try thee; and when He gave thee promises, and bade thee trust them, He gave such promises as are suitable for times of tempest and tossing. Dost thou think that God makes shams like some that have made belts for swimming, which were good to exhibit in a shop, but of no use in the sea? \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe have all heard of swords which were useless in war; and even of shoes which were made to sell, but were never meant to walk in. God\u0027s shoes are of iron and brass, and you can walk to Heaven in them without their ever wearing out; and His life-belts, you may swim a thousand Atlantics upon them, and there will be no fear of your sinking. His Word of promise is meant to be tried and proved. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is nothing Christ dislikes more than for His people to make a show-thing of Him, and not to use Him. He loves to be employed by us. Covenant blessings are not meant to be looked at only, but to be appropriated. Even our Lord Jesus is given to us for our present use. Thou dost not make use of Christ as thou oughtest to do. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eO man, I beseech you do not treat God\u0027s promises as if they were curiosities for a museum; but use them as every day sources of comfort. Trust the Lord whenever your time of need comes on.--C. H. Spurgeon \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Go to the deeps of God\u0027s promise,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd claim whatsoever ye will;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe blessing of God will not fail thee,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis Word He will surely fulfill.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow can God say no to something He has promised?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e八月十二日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「因此祂已将又宝贵又极大的应许赐给我们。」（彼后一4）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e一个造船匠造船的目的，是不是为了要把船搁在船架上呢？不，他造船的目的，乃是要把船放在海洋和波涛中。他在造的时候，就已经想到了。 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e当神把你造成一个信徒的时候，祂的目的就是要把你放在试炼中；所以当祂给你应许，吩咐你信赖的时候，祂就给你一些在狂浪顚簸中所能应用的应许。你想神的应许，会不会像有些商店里出卖的游泳圈──只能在玻璃窗内陈列，不能在洋海中应用呢？ \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e我们都知道：作玩具的刀剑，在战场上是没有用处的；作玩具的鞋子，是不能穿着走路的。但是神的鞋是铜的、铁的，你能够穿着它们走上天去，它们永远也不会穿坏；神的救生圈，你用以游过一千个大西洋，也不会使你沉溺。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e神最不喜欢的，就是祂的子民把祂当作一个展览品，不去用祂。祂喜欢我们享用祂。所立的约并不是给人看的，乃是给我们享用的。我们的主耶稣，也是神赐给我们，给我们现在享用的。读者，你有没有照你应得的，去享用基督？ \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e信徒阿，我求你不要把神的应许，当作展览会里的古玩；你应当天天用它们来作安慰的泉源，在患难中随时仰赖祂。──司布眞\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e神对于已经应许过的东西，怎能说「不」呢？\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5308.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:46:50 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:46:50 AM"}
