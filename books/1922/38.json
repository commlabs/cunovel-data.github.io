The top was a triangle with long straps at the shoulders and ribs that secured with Velcro and could be worn in a variety of ways to allow the wearer to determine where her br**sts needed the most support. It was specially designed for curvy women and was the first top I\u0027d ever had that kept me from bouncing all over the place. What Gideon objected to was the nude color, which coordinated with the racing stripes on the matching black yoga pants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like you na**d in private,\" he muttered. \"I\u0027ll need to be with you whenever you go to the gym.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t complain, since I\u0027m very much enjoying the view at the moment.\" Plus, I was perversely excited by his possessiveness after the hurt he\u0027d inflicted with his withdrawal Saturday night. Two very different extremes - the first of many, I was sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get this over with.\" He grabbed my hand and led me away from the locker rooms, snatching two logo\u0027d towels off a stack as we passed them. \"I need to f**k you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to be f**ked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus, Eva.\" His grip on my hand tightened to the point that it hurt. \"Where to? Free weights? Machines? Treadmills?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treadmills. I want to run a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led me in that direction. I watched the way women followed him with their gazes, then their feet. They wanted to be in whatever section of the gym he was, and I couldn\u0027t blame them. I was dying to see him in action, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reached the seemingly endless rows of treadmills and bikes, we found that there weren\u0027t two treadmills free adjacent to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon walked up to a man who had two open on either side of him. \"I\u0027d be in your debt if you\u0027d move over one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy looked at me and grinned. \"Yeah, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon took over the man\u0027s treadmill and motioned me to the one beside it. Before he programmed his workout, I leaned over to him. \"Don\u0027t burn off too much energy,\" I whispered. \"I want you missionary-style the first time. I\u0027ve been having this fantasy of you on top, banging the hell out of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze burned into me. \"Eva, you have no idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly giddy with anticipation and a lovely surge of feminine power, I got on my treadmill and started at a brisk walk. While I warmed up, I set my iPod shuffle to random and when \"Sexy Back\" by Justin Timberlake came on I hit my stride and went full-out. Running was both a mental and physical exercise for me. Sometimes I wished just running fast could get me away from whatever was troubling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter twenty minutes I slowed, then stopped, finally risking a glance at Gideon who was running with the fluidity of a well-oiled machine. He was watching CNN on the overhead screens, but he flashed a grin at me as I wiped the sweat off my face. I swigged from my water bottle as I moved to the machines, picking one that give me a clear view of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went a full thirty on the treadmill; then he moved to free weights, always keeping me in his line of sight. As he worked out, quickly and efficiently, I couldn\u0027t help thinking how virile he was. It helped that I knew exactly what was in his shorts, but regardless, he was a man who worked behind a desk, yet kept his body in combat shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I grabbed a fitness ball to do some crunches, one of the trainers came up to me. As one would expect in a top-of-the-line gym, he was handsome and very nicely built.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" he greeted me, with a movie star smile that showcased perfect white teeth. He had dark brown hair and eyes of nearly the same color. \"First-timer, right? I haven\u0027t seen you in here before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, first time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Daniel.\" He extended his hand, and I gave him my name. \"Are you finding everything you need, Eva?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So far so good, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What flavor smoothie did you go for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your free orientation smoothie.\" He crossed his arms and his thick biceps strained the narrow cuffs of his uniform polo shirt. \"You didn\u0027t get one from the bar downstairs when you signed up? You\u0027re supposed to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, well.\" I shrugged sheepishly, thinking it was a nice touch all the same. \"I didn\u0027t have the usual orientation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get the tour? If not, let me take you around.\" He touched my elbow lightly and gestured toward the stairs. \"You also get a free hour of personal training. We could do that tonight or make an appointment for later in the week. And I\u0027d be happy to take you down to the health bar and scratch that off the list, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I can\u0027t really.\" My nose wrinkled. \"I\u0027m not a member.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" He winked. \"You\u0027re here on a temp pass? That\u0027s fine. You can\u0027t be expected to make up your mind if you don\u0027t get the full experience. I can assure you, though, that CrossTrainer is the best gym in Manhattan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon appeared at Daniel\u0027s shoulder. \"The full experience is included,\" he said, coming around and behind me to slide his arms around my waist, \"when you\u0027re the owner\u0027s girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word \"girlfriend\" reverberated through me, sending a crazy rush of adrenaline through my system. It was still sinking in that we had that level of commitment, but that didn\u0027t stop me from thinking the designation had a nice ring to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Cross.\" Daniel straightened and took a step back; then extended his hand. \"It\u0027s an honor to meet you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-38.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
