And behold they were hanged up in irons, a little way off on the other side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then said Mercy to him that was their Guide and Conductor, What are those three men? And for what are they hanged there?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e GREAT-HEART: These three men were men of very bad qualities, they had no mind to be Pilgrims themselves, and whosoever they could they hindered. They were for sloth and folly themselves, and whoever they could persuade with, they made so too, and withal taught them to presume that they should do well at last. They were asleep when Christian went by, and now you go by they are hanged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e MERCY: But could they persuade any to be of their opinion?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e GREAT-HEART: Yes, they turned several our of the way. There was Slow-pace, that they persuaded to do as they. They also prevailed with one Short-wind, with one No-heart, with one Linger-after-lust, and with one Sleepy-head, and with a young woman her name was Dull, to turn out of the way and become as they. Besides they brought up an ill report of your Lord, persuading others that he was a Task-master. They also brought up an evil report of the good Land saying \u0027twas not half so good as some pretend it was. They also began to vilify his Servants, and to count the very best of them meddlesome troublesome busy-bodies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1807/52504.html","bookId":1048,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:27:45 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:27:45 AM"}
