Instead, all I felt was darkness - like a blanket over my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in that darkness, the soul that had been Jack at eighteen whimpered. A tiny light became brighter and brighter, and suddenly the shadows were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stared at me in confusion. He appeared exactly the same as he had when I\u0027d touched him. He hadn\u0027t aged fifty years. He didn\u0027t sport deadly wounds he could no longer heal. The only thing that was different were his eyes. There was no longer a demon panting to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" He glanced around the clearing, flinching at the carnage. \"Where am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him out of here,\" I told Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so fast,\" he murmured. \"Perhaps we should perform one final test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of test?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The full moon comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up. Night approached. I had been in the Land of Souls longer than I\u0027d thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hum filled my head, a desperate need; thirst pressed at the back of my throat. I was both different and still the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFumbling in my pocket, I found the spare vial of serum and drained it in one long pull. The pulsing call of the moon and the intense craving for blood receded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the moon hits the sky, if he doesn\u0027t change, he is healed.\" Edward glanced at me. \"If you have cured him, you will have more work in your future than you will be able to manage. You will not have time for kissy-kissy with the FBI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flash of annoyance at the man\u0027s audacity caused me to speak more sharply to him than I ever had before. \"That\u0027s all you have to say? No words of wisdom for your granddaughter? No apology?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apologize? For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother. Your daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have sworn I saw him flinch, but it might have just been a trick of the fading sunlight through the dappled trees. Edward Mandenauer cared for no one and nothing but the hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had no choice,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had a choice with me. You could have told me who I was. Given me some affection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No I couldn\u0027t.\" His bony shoulders slumped, and he turned toward the horizon. \"I\u0027ve lost too many women I love. Every time the monsters took another, a part of me was destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He must have lost a lot of women,\" Jessie muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved across the dry leaves until I stood right behind the man who was my grandfather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know what you would become,\" he said quietly, \"if I might have to kill you someday. How could I bounce you on my knee and tell you everything would be all right? Wouldn\u0027t that have been a bigger lie than all the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure, but I saw his dilemma. Besides, the idea of him bouncing a child on his knee was more frightening than some of the things that wandered the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I shifted, why didn\u0027t you kill me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every time I looked at you, I saw...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have your grandmother\u0027s eyes.\" He took a deep breath and straightened his sloping shoulders. \"I was right to keep you. You were the key to everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny how that worked out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Life has a way of coming full circle if you give it enough time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have told me the truth after I came back from Stanford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By then it was too late. Too many lies. And I didn\u0027t want anyone to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How mortifying to have a granddaughter who turns furry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked away without another word. Some things never changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that was... interesting.\" Jessie shifted her gun toward Jack, who was so confused he appeared in a near-catatonic state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Edward, who had gotten as far away from us as he could without leaving the ravine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll come around.\" Nic touched my shoulders. \"Somewhere inside his icy cold heart he loves you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that.\" I turned in his arms. \"I\u0027m always going to be the way I am, and he\u0027ll never be able to love what he hates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused and considered the rest. I had to tell Nic the truth. There\u0027d been too many lies for too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a choice in the Land of Souls. I could have become human instead of...\" I lifted my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And left the world to rot?\" He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t think so. You made the right choice, Elise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the tension slid out of me. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun inched below the horizon, and I shuddered as the silver glow of the moon threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving out of Nic\u0027s embrace, I murmured, \"Stand back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon rose, spilling light into the shadow, spilling magic across us all. Jack didn\u0027t change, but I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantaneous and without pain I became a wolf. Wild and free, I ran through the night. My beast at one with myself, I felt a peace I\u0027d never suspected could exist within me and a power beyond anything I\u0027d imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs dawn filled the sky, I returned to the cabin. All was quiet. Edward was gone, along with Jack. Will was back. I was certain Jessie had already called Leigh, and soon I\u0027d be able to fix Damien. Life was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped into the bathroom and turned on the shower, then I stared at the brand-new me in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo makeup, hair tousled and cascading to my waist,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI appeared younger, probably because the lines of worry and stress had flown, along with the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever wear a suit again, to hell with panty hose, but I\u0027d have to get some new Italian shoes. I liked them too much to give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy days in the lab were over, which was lucky since there wasn\u0027t any lab. I had places to go, werewolves to find, and I knew just who I was going to take with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if my thoughts had conjured him up, Nic slipped into the room. His arms slid around my waist. He kissed my neck, then glanced into the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better than okay. What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same.\" He laid his cheek on top of my head. \"Or at least I am now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won. Most of the bad guys are dead. Everyone on our side still alive. Sometimes that doesn\u0027t happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. Nic wanted me, that much I knew, but he\u0027d never mentioned love. I still didn\u0027t want him to leave - ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a proposition for you.\" Nic wiggled his eyebrows and I laughed. \"Not that kind. A job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hopes fell. It really wasn\u0027t fair to ask him to give up a career he was so good at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward hired me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head came up so fast I nearly clipped him in the nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Take it easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around. \"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He pointed out that I couldn\u0027t go back to the tame old FBI now that I\u0027d seen the true nature of the world. He\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I knew he was going to become a J-S agent, I was scared. He could get killed a whole lot easier that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I accepted the offer, although I think Edward was just trying to be nice - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t know how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ll be a lot of legal issues to work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are cured werewolves responsible for the actions they committed while possessed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh. That was a toughie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to be... a liaison I guess you\u0027d call it -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;between the J¨¹ger-Suchers and the Feds.\" He shrugged. \"Someone has to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed a secret sigh of relief. That sounded safer than blasting monsters with silver. Although I had a feeling Nic wasn\u0027t going to stay in the office 24/7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as that\u0027s what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After all these years my law degree is going to come in handy.\" Nic tilted his head. \"I still think Edward is trying to make up for his mistakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic didn\u0027t know Edward. The man apologized never, admitted he was wrong... also never. Still -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the pentagram on my palm. Times changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward and I would have a talk - a long one - about my mother and grandmother, and my father, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d need to discuss our pasts and the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever his reasons,\" Nic continued, \"I agree with him. The FBI was just a job; the J¨¹ger-Suchers are a lifestyle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we ever need a recruiting poster, I\u0027ll be sure to use that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha-ha.\" He tugged on the ends of my hair. \"Edward was right about one thing. This is just the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of werewolves to find, and someone has to hold them down while you heal them. If you don\u0027t mind a rookie on your team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t think of anyone I\u0027d rather have next to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went still. Everything that hadn\u0027t been said, and a lot that had, hung in the air between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elise, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught my breath, uncertain of what he meant to say - fearing one thing, hoping for another, not really certain what would be the best for us both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been an ass,\" he blurted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. \"Would you let me finish?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. Far be it from me to stop a man when he\u0027s admitting to being an ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re funny.\" He took a deep breath. \"I was an ass when I said there was nothing between us but sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI no longer had any desire to make a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more than that?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you. Always have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This wasn\u0027t something you thought I should know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You left me, Elise, when everything was great. I had no idea why. I figured there was something wrong with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I found out the truth -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Well, it was a little hard to declare everlasting love while you were drooling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now who\u0027s funny?\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he could joke was encouraging. Only if he was comfortable with what I was, would he be able to do that. The weight on my chest lifted just a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All this secret J-S stuff, conspiracies, witches, silver bullets - I was afraid you might be killed. I didn\u0027t know if I could stand to lose you twice. I didn\u0027t handle the first time well at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you disappeared, I lost it. Spent months searching. Sometimes I think I went into the FBI subconsciously believing I could find you that way. But years went by, and you were just gone. I got over you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I told myself I had. Believed it, too. Until I walked into that office and saw you again. I thought my heart had stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been a part of me from the day I first dropped that book on your foot. I don\u0027t ever want to be separated from you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I don\u0027t want you to be. Except - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. There were quite a few things that we had to discuss. I loved Nic, but I\u0027d been given a job to do, and no one could stop me from doing it. Not even him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to know what you\u0027re getting into.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A life with you. It\u0027s all I\u0027ve ever wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Life with me means no life, Nic. Constant threats, too much work, the high probability of a bloody death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that differs from my present life how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being an FBI agent is a far cry from being a J¨¹ger-Sucher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said. \"I can hardly wait to start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"There\u0027ll be no children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t recall saying I wanted some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did. When we were at Stanford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was a kid myself. For me the world\u0027s a different place than it was last week. Bringing children into it... I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s the best idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thoughts kept coming out of his mouth. Eerie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re all I need, Elise. My dream has always been you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m more like a nightmare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the same you I fell in love with, both then and now. Becoming a wolf under the moon doesn\u0027t change anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you haven\u0027t been paying attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see who you are inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Woof, woof,\" I mocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s only a small part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shows what you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know the truth, and I don\u0027t give a damn. You\u0027re Elise Hanover. You collect toy crows and Italian shoes. You like rare cheeseburgers and white wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You laugh at my jokes, when I used to make them. Now that I\u0027ve found you, I might even learn to laugh again myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know I won\u0027t age? Ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze wandered over the sparkle of gray in his hair, the lines the sun, the wind, time had put next to his eyes and his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m always going to appear to be twenty-two, which is going to get harder and harder to explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do we have to explain it to? The people who matter know the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never looked at the situation quite like that before. Still...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll die,\" I murmured, eyes burning. \"And I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone dies, Elise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me. At least not from disease or old age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d rather not be together at all than worry about my expiring ahead of you? The way I see it, your days are a little more numbered than mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. He made excellent points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic grabbed me around the waist and hauled me against him. \"You can try and convince me to leave you for the rest of our lives, but the only thing that\u0027ll make me go is your telling me you don\u0027t love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into his eyes. Was he hiding his doubts? I couldn\u0027t see any. All I saw was love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I continued to hesitate, he leaned in slowly, giving me time to protest, to escape, to lie and tell him I didn\u0027t want him, didn\u0027t need him, didn\u0027t love him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t, so with a kiss, I surrendered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted me into his arms and carried me across the hall to the bedroom. Excitement prickled along my skin as he laid me on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs our lips touched, our bodies joined to the sound of gentle whispers and promises for a future that suddenly seemed so bright.
