Lainey started plotting her next book, then spent a week going over the galleys of her last story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah insisted on taking care of her, refusing to let her do too much at one time, insisting she needed to rest more and work less. He did the cooking. He learned how to run the washer and dryer. He even ventured out to do the marketing. One afternoon, when he had sent her off to take a nap, Lainey had informed him that it was a good thing she had her writing to occupy her, since he spent so much time looking after the baby. Another time, she had laughingly accused him of being jealous that she was breastfeeding, because that was one thing he couldn\u0027t do for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, it was heartwarming to watch him with their son. She remembered what he had said about life on Xanthia, about how children were raised away from their parents, and she wondered how this man, this gentle, loving man, would have been able to endure being parted from his son forever when he could barely stand being away from Mike for more than an hour or so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer parents came over often, always with a present for Mike, until the nursery began to look like a toy store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter six weeks of being treated like an invalid, Lainey rebelled. Insisting that she felt fine, she arranged to have her mother babysit, made reservations at an expensive restaurant down by the beach, bought a new dress, and dragged Micah out of the house, intent on a romantic evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you feel up to this?\" Micah asked as Lainey backed the car out of the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll go crazy if I don\u0027t get out of the house. Honestly, Micah,\" Lainey said, seeing the doubt on his face, \"I feel fine.\" She reached over and patted his arm. \"And Mom will take good care of the baby, don\u0027t worry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could I be concerned?\" he asked. \"She raised you, didn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did a heck of a job!\" Lainey declared with a decided lack of modesty. \"Isn\u0027t it a beautiful night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah glanced up. The sky was clear, the stars shining brightly. \"Beautiful,\" he agreed, and wondered, not for the first time, how Earth and Xanthia could be so different and yet so similar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey arrived at the restaurant a short time later. Lainey gazed out the window, her chin resting on her hand as she watched the waves lap at the shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they have oceans on Xanthia?\" she asked, turning her gaze to Micah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, though not as big as this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And fish? And sharks? And whales?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah nodded. \"We have a multitude of sea life, different in some ways from yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a fish that has legs and buries its eggs on land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? I\u0027d like to see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we have a large fish, what you would call a whale, that is almost a hundred feet long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a sea serpent to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could call it that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And do you have dogs and cats and horses? And birds and bees?\" Lainey grinned at him. \"I can\u0027t help it, I want to know everything about your world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Xanthia is much like Earth. We have animals similar to yours, just as our people are similar to yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In some ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe in God?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah nodded, his expression somber. \"Of course. All intelligent life forms acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been afraid of being invaded by creatures from outer space,\" Lainey remarked. \"I\u0027ve always believed that if there were people on other worlds, they would be just like us. I mean, if God created man in His own image here, then He\u0027d probably do the same on other worlds.\" Lainey grinned at Micah. \"I guess I was right, at least where Xanthia is concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very wise,\" Micah said. \"I\u0027ve been to many other worlds and I\u0027ve never seen any monsters. The people may not look exactly the same, but all are humanoid in appearance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they have organized religion on Xanthia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly. We have places of worship, but people attend whenever they wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not like here, where we go to church on Sunday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a religious man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicah nodded. \"In my way. On Xanthia, I went to worship once each week when I was home. Sometimes to meditate. Sometimes I went into one of the reflection cells and played one of the religious tapes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you mind going to church with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey smiled at him, then sat back as the waitress brought their food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dinner, Lainey called home to check on the baby, and then they went for a moonlight walk on the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better take our shoes off,\" Lainey suggested. Micah steadied her as she removed her heels and stockings; then he took off his shoes and socks and they walked barefoot in the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The water is cold,\" Micah mused. \"On Xanthia, the oceans are warm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you miss your home?\" Lainey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not when you\u0027re with me,\" he replied, pressing a kiss to her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft sigh escaped Lainey\u0027s lips. \"Oh, Micah, you should have been a poet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly as he drew her into his arms. She was beautiful in the moonlight. Her hair shimmered with blue highlights, her skin was luminous, her eyes as warm and dark as a handful of earth. She was like the ancient goddess, Zanadeus, who had walked the shores of Xanthia, luring unsuspecting men into the arms of the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently, he framed her face in his hands. \"You\u0027re my home, Lainey,\" he murmured. \"Don\u0027t you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis kiss was warm and soft, filled with promises of forever, of sun-kissed days and moonlit nights, of happiness doubled because it was shared, of sorrow halved because it was understood by another. He kissed her with all the love in his heart, and prayed that it would be enough, knowing his life would cease to have meaning if Lainey ceased loving him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Micah, let\u0027s go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled by her request, he drew back so he could see her face. \"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" A faint blush heated her cheeks. \"I was hoping... I mean, it\u0027s been a long time since we...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed up at him, her eyes filled with a need that went beyond words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it all right?\" Micah asked. \"It\u0027s not too soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not soon enough,\" she murmured, her lips grazing his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat seared through him, instantaneous, as though his whole body had been struck by star fire. She kissed him, and the flames burned hotter and brighter and he knew he couldn\u0027t wait until they got home, that he had to have her now, or die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwinging her up into his arms, Micah walked swiftly down the beach toward a small cove. Stripping off his coat, he spread it on the sand and then, his hands shaking with urgency, he began to undress her, marveling anew at the perfection of her body, at the silken touch of her skin beneath his fingertips. She was the essence of life, a goddess come to life, a miracle wrapped in moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned low in his throat as Lainey\u0027s hands moved over him, freeing him from his clothing, gliding over his skin. Wrapped in each other\u0027s arms, they sank slowly to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roar of the surf echoed the pounding of his heart as he worshiped her with his eyes, his touch. His heart swelled with love when she urged him to shed his human shape. She whispered her love as she caressed him, her hands exploring the solid wall of his chest, brushing the webbing on his hands. She nipped his earlobe, and each touch told him more eloquently than words that she loved him for who and what he was, that their differences didn\u0027t matter at all, that nothing mattered except the love they shared, the love that had bound them together and culminated in the birth of their son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, he merged his flesh with hers, afraid of hurting her in his eagerness. It had been so long, he thought, so long since he\u0027d been able to bury himself within her warmth, her sweetness. Tears burned his eyes as she welcomed him home, her hips lifting to receive him, her arms holding him tight as she whispered his name, then gasped with pleasure as two became one in heart and mind and body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name exploded from his lips in a harsh cry of exultation as they reached for the stars and found them. Together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey came awake slowly, a smile on her face. Now she knew how Scarlett had felt the morning after Rhett carried her up that long flight of stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a contented sigh, she reached across the bed for Micah, but her hand closed on empty air. Disappointed, she slid out of bed, pulled on her robe, and padded down the hallway to the nursery. Sure enough, Micah was there, bent over the white wicker changing table as he sprinkled powder on the baby\u0027s dimpled bottom, then put a clean diaper in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting the baby to his shoulder, Micah turned around, his eyes caressing her. \"Good morning, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning.\" Lainey smiled up at him. \"Did I thank you for last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks are necessary,\" Micah said, returning her smile. \"I assure you it was my pleasure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And mine. Are you hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very hungry.\" His gaze moved over hers, hotter than the tail of a comet. \"I could use some breakfast, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappiness bubbled inside Lainey as she took the baby from his arms. \"I\u0027ll feed the baby, and then fix your breakfast,\" she said with a saucy grin. \"And then I\u0027ll see what I can do about that other craving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLainey snuggled closer to Micah. Never before had she realized what a blessing it was to work at home, to be able to work at her leisure, to take long lunch breaks in her husband\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh, she gazed at Micah, feeling utterly content. She loved him, wholly, completely, not just because he was the most handsome man she had ever known, but because he was thoughtful, generous, caring, kind, compassionate... She smiled inwardly, thinking there weren\u0027t enough words to describe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to tell him how much she loved him when she noticed the troubled look in his eye. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Micah, I know you better than that. What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need something to do, something to occupy my time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" He rolled onto his side, facing her. \"I love you, Lainey, more than my own life, but I can\u0027t stay here, in the house, forever. I miss piloting my craft. I miss the excitement, the adventure. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she understood. She\u0027d die without her writing. It was a part of her, something she had to do. And yet, as dear as her writing was to her, she sensed that flying meant even more to Micah than her writing meant to her. But there were no spaceships for him to fly here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, she realized there was no way he could get any kind of job without the required forms of identification - a birth certificate, a driver\u0027s license, a high school diploma, a Social Security number. Some jobs required applicants to be fingerprinted. Did Xanthians have fingerprints? And what if a physical exam was needed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe groaned softly, dismayed by the seemingly endless documents Micah would need. And yet, such things couldn\u0027t be impossible to obtain. There were lots of people who had entered the country illegally and they managed to get by. Somehow, they would find a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still trying to come up with a solution the following morning when the doorbell rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe minute she looked through the peephole and saw Frank Bergen standing on the porch, she knew that trying to find a birth certificate for Micah was the least of their worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoping Micah wouldn\u0027t come home early from his walk, she opened the door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sunlight-moonlight/page-26.html","bookId":2306,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:52 PM"}
