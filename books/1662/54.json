{"id":101463,"no":54,"title":"Page 54","content":"\u003cp\u003e“Is that the only reason?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lazy, indulgent grin played across his lips as he tugged on the belt of my robe. “Not the only reason. Probably the smartest, but definitely not the most pressing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings had changed between us in a matter of hours. We talked more last night…and kissed some more before falling asleep in each other’s arms. Now, there was an openness, a partnership in things. He was still a total smartass. And yeah, that smug grin still irked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the jerk loved me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon sat up and pulled me into his lap. He kissed my forehead. “What are you thinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI burrowed my head into the space between his shoulder and neck. “A lot of things. Do…do you think it’s wrong to be happy right now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms tightened. “Well, I wouldn’t send out a mass text message or anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I’m not entirely happy. I don’t think I’ve really come to terms with everything. Adam was…” He trailed off, his throat working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I liked him,” I whispered. “I don’t expect Dee to ever forgive me, but I want to see her. I need to make sure she’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’ll forgive you. She needs time.” His lips moved against my temple, and my heart squeezed. “Dee knew you tried to warn her off. She called me when you told her to leave, and I told her and Adam to stay out of there, but they parked the car down the street and came back. They made that choice, and I know she’d do it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat tightened. “There are so many things I wouldn’t do again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” He placed two fingers under my chin, tipping my head back. “We can’t focus on that now. It’s not going to do any good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched up, kissing his lips. “I want to see Dee after school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing for lunch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Other than eating? Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. We’re skipping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Going to see Dee, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile turned wicked. “Yeah, but first, there are things I want to do, and we don’t have nearly enough time for that now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arched a brow. “Are you going to try to squeeze in dinner and a movie then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kitten, your mind is a terrible and dirty place. I was thinking we could go for a stroll or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tease,” I murmured and started to stand, but he held me there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say what?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what you told me earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart leaped into my throat. I’d told him a lot of things, but I knew what he wanted to hear. “I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darkened a second before he kissed me until I was ready to say screw the whole doing-right-by-me thing. “That’s all I ever need to hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those three words?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Always those three words.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNews of Adam’s passing hadn’t hit the school yet, and I wasn’t telling anyone other than Lesa and Carissa. The story was he had died in a car accident. Police would back it up if questions were asked. My friends took it like expected. There were a lot of tears, and again I was surprised that my eyes could still fill with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon poked me once in class to remind me of our lunch plans, and then one more time because he felt like it. Layers of guilt followed me through most of morning classes, alternating with brief moments of exhilaration. I knew that even if Dee forgave me, it wouldn’t change anything. I needed to come to terms with the role I’d played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I also knew I couldn’t stop living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I entered bio, I met Matthew’s eyes. There was a twitch to his lips before he opened up his grade book. Lesa was abnormally subdued due to what I’d told her. Halfway through class, the intercom kicked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe school secretary’s voice rang out. “Katy Swartz is needed in the principal’s office, Mr. Garrison.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA jolt of unease pierced my stomach as I grabbed my bag. Shrugging at Lesa’s look, I passed Matthew a near-panicked one as I headed out. I sent Daemon a quick text from my mom’s cell that she’d given me that morning, letting him know I was being called to the office. I didn’t expect him to respond back. I wasn’t even sure he had his cell with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gray-haired secretary was rocking a Brigitte Bardot hairstyle and a bright pink sweater. I leaned against the counter, waiting for her to look up. When she did, she squinted through her spectacles. “Can I help you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Katy. I was called to the office?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh! Oh, yes, come on, dear.” There was compassion in her tone as she stood. She hobbled toward Principal Plummer’s office. “Right this way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t see through the glass windows, so I had no idea what was waiting for me when she threw all her weight behind opening the door. I marked off any job in the school system in my future if she hadn’t been able to retire at her age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrincipal Plummer sat behind his desk, smiling at whoever was seated on the other side. My gaze followed his, and I was shocked to see Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” I asked, twisting my backpack’s strap against my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill came to his feet quickly and rushed to my side. He clasped my free hand. “Kellie’s been in an accident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I think I gasped. Alarm pounded at my sides as I stared at him. “What do you mean? Is she okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression was pained and haggard as he avoided meeting my eyes. “She left work this morning, and they think she hit a patch of ice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How bad is it?” My voice wobbled. All I could see was Dad—Dad in a hospital bed, pale and frail, the smell of death that clung to the walls and the hushed voices of the nurses…and then the mannequin in the coffin that sort of resembled Dad but couldn’t have been him. Now all those memories were replaced with Mom. This can’t be happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill curved a hand over my shoulders, gently turning me around. We were walking out of the office, but I wasn’t conscious of any of it. “She’s in the ER. That’s all I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to know more than that.” I didn’t recognize my own voice. “Is she awake? Talking? Does she need to have surgery?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, opening the door. Outside the snow had stopped, and plows were clearing the parking lot. The air was frigid, but I didn’t feel it. I was numb. Will led me to a tan Yukon I didn’t recognize. Unease trickled in, and a horrible thought struck me. I halted a few feet from the passenger side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you get a new car?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned as he opened the car door. “No. I use this during the winter. Perfect for snowy roads. I tried to tell your mother to get something like this other than that damn matchbox she drives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling stupid and paranoid, I nodded. It made sense. A lot of people had their “winter” vehicle around here. And with everything that had happened, I’d forgotten about what I’d discovered about Will—his sickness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed in, clutching my bag to my chest after I buckled my seat belt. Then I remembered Daemon. I checked the phone and saw there wasn’t a reply yet. I sent him another quick text, telling him that Mom was in an accident. I’d call him and leave a more detailed message once I knew how…how bad things were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI choked on a breath when I thought about losing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill rubbed his hands together before he turned the key. The radio came on immediately. It was a weather broadcast. The man’s voice coming from the speakers was cheery. I hated him. Meteorologists were watching a Nor’easter forming in the South, slated to slam into West Virginia early next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What hospital is she at?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Winchester,” he said, twisting around as he reached for something in the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared straight ahead, trying to keep the panic at bay. She’s going to be okay. She has to be. She’ll be okay. My lips trembled. Why weren’t we already on the damn road?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI faced him. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m really sorry about this,” he said, his face expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s going to be okay, right?” My breath caught again. Maybe he wasn’t telling me the worse of it. Maybe she was…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mom is going to be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t time for me to feel relief or to question what he said. He leaned forward, and I saw a long, scary-looking needle. I jerked back in the seat, but I wasn’t fast enough. Will pushed the needle into the side of my neck. There was a pinch, and then coolness rushed through my veins, followed by a faint burning sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knocked his hand away, or I thought I did. Either way, the needle was gone from his hand, and he was watching me curiously. My hand fluttered to my neck. I couldn’t feel my pulse, but it beat through me wildly. “What…what did you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHands on the steering wheel, he pulled out of the school parking lot without answering. I asked him again. At least I think I did, but I wasn’t sure. The road up ahead blurred in a kaleidoscope of white and gray. My fingers slipped over the door handle. I couldn’t will them to work, and then I couldn’t keep my eyes open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling upon the Source was out of the question. Darkness crept into the corners of my eyes, and I fought it with every ounce of the strength I had left. If I lost consciousness I knew it was all over, but I couldn’t keep my head from listing to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last thought was, Implants are everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 34\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came to, it felt like a drummer had taken up residency in my head and my mouth was dry. I’d felt like this once before, when a friend and I had drunk an entire bottle of cheap wine during a sleepover. Except then I’d been hot and sweaty, and now I was freezing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my head off the coarse blanket my cheek rested on, prying my eyes open. Shapes were blurry and indistinguishable for several minutes. Flattening out my hands, I pushed up, and a wave of dizziness assaulted me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy arms and feet were bare. Someone had taken off my sweater, shoes, and socks, leaving me in my tank top and jeans. Goose bumps pimpled my skin in response to the near-freezing temperature of wherever I was. I knew I was inside somewhere. The steady hum of lights and distant voices told me that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually my eyes cleared, and I almost wished they’d stayed out of focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a cage that resembled a large kennel used for dogs. The thick black metal was spaced enough that I could fit a hand through it. Maybe. I looked up, realizing there was no way I could stand or even lie down completely straight without touching the bars. Manacles and chains hung from the top. Two of them were hooked to my numb, chilled ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic clawed through me, forcing my breath in and out as my gaze darted around at a frantic pace. Cages surrounded me. A gleaming reddish-black substance coated the insides of the bars closest to me and on top of the manacles around my ankles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept telling myself to keep it together, but it wasn’t working. I scooted onto my backside, sitting up as far as I could and reaching down, wanting to pull the things off my ankles. The moment my fingers touched the top of the metal, red-hot pain swept up my arms, straight to my head. I yelped, jerking my hands back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-54.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
