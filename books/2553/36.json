The unrisen sun was just beginning to lighten the low clouds lidding the city. In a few hours the streets below would be packed with the weekly Saturday horde of Christmas shoppers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick had been awake for hours. This had become a pattern every night since the poisoning of the sims. Fall asleep easily - with the help of a couple of stiff Scotches - and then find himself wide awake at 3:00A .M. or so with his mind sifting through the litterbox his life had become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll because of an argument in a country club men\u0027s room. What if he hadn\u0027t chosen that moment to go to the bathroom? What if he\u0027d waited until after that second drink? Holmes Carter would have been long gone, and without Carter\u0027s bad attitude, Patrick would have laughed off Tome\u0027s request to unionize the club sims. If he\u0027d done that, where would he be now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, he\u0027d still have a law practice; he missed Maggie, even missed some of his clients. He\u0027d also have a house instead of a fire-blackened foundation. And he might still have Pamela, although he wondered if that would be such a good thing. From his present perspective he could see that their relationship had been one more of mutual convenience than rooted in any deep regard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe probably wouldn\u0027t have spent Thanksgiving alone, either. Ever since his folks retired to South Carolina, they\u0027d always called and insisted he come down for Thanksgiving. Not this year. That was Dad\u0027s doing, Patrick was sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d known Dad had been upset with the whole idea of a sim union - he\u0027d made that perfectly clear over the phone on more than one occasion - but Patrick hadn\u0027t realized just how much until Thanksgiving came and went without an invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had hurt. Even now, more than a week later, the wound still ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo here he was: jobless, homeless, alone, and functionally orphaned. And aligned with a masked mystery man who\u0027d invited him to join a nameless fifth column movement to bring down one of the world\u0027s most powerful multinational corporations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I said yes,\" he whispered, still not believing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not me, he kept telling himself. This is somebody else. All I wanted out of life was stability and a good living. That was why I went into law. I am not a risk taker. I am not an adrenaline junkie. How did I come to this? And how do I get out of it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasy. Just say no. Pack up and walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd do what? Labor relations? After what he\u0027d been through, could he go back to sitting at a table and listening to union and management argue over the length of coffee breaks or who qualified for daycare? Not likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was Romy. Walking away from Zero meant walking away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo for the foreseeable future he\u0027d stick this out and see where it took him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully it would soon take him out of this hotel. Zero had suggested he relocate himself and his practice to Manhattan. Romy had laughed off Patrick\u0027s suggestion that he move in with her while he hunted for an office and an apartment. So for the time being, home was a room in the Hotel Pennsylvania. Finding space - whether living or office - wasn\u0027t easy. The new boom had sent prices in Manhattan up to where the new space station was nearing completion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jangle of the phone startled him. He stepped through the dark room to the night table, found the phone, and fumbled the receiver to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy\u0027s voice: \"Am I interrupting something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only my daily predawn reverie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him an address. \"If you haven\u0027t anything better to do, meet me there ASAP. I\u0027ll wait for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick sensed strain in her voice, but before he could ask for any details she hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDutifully he pulled on yesterday\u0027s clothes, grabbed a large container of coffee on his way through the lobby, and ventured into the early morning chill of Seventh Avenue in search of a taxi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver shot him a look when he read off the address. \"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure,\" Patrick told him after double-checking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver shrugged - reluctantly, Patrick thought - and gunned the cab into the traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick considered that look and thought, Romy, Romy, what are you getting me into now? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-36.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
