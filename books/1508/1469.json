Most of the marks on the Emperor Stone exuded the atmosphere of countless years, but these two characters seemed quite new, as if they were just carved in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“How interesting.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eImperial Prince Naqi grinned. The ‘Lin’ character reminded him of a certain someone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, he couldn’t confirm this at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Wasn’t it said that leaving behind a name on the highest point of the Emperor Stone was extremely difficult? That to do so perfectly was something that couldn’t even occur in a hundred million years? These types of rumors were passed down about the Emperor Stone, but those two characters up there are clearly recently carved in. It seems this Emperor Stone is also mediocre.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNaqi chuckled. He was considered knowledgeable about the geniuses of humanity. He suspected that the Lin character was left behind by Lin Ming, and that the Xian character might be from Xiao Moxian. During the great battle at the Chaotic Blood Continent, Naqi hadn’t seen Xiao Moxian; he had only heard that she had excellent talent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThinking about it, Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian’s current cultivation was suitable for adventuring through the Asura Road. If Lin Ming were to have entered the Asura Road directly after their battle at Chaotic Blood Continent, then he wouldn’t find that strange at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSince Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian were both able to leave behind their name at the highest point at the Emperor Stone, and also do so perfectly, Naqi was fully confident he could easily accomplish the same.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter all, although he had lost to Lin Ming during their showdown at the Chaotic Blood Continent, Naqi still wasn’t fully convinced of his loss. The truth was that from beginning to end, Lin Ming had not been able to suppress him. In fact, at the very final stages of their battle, he had faintly suppressed Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was only that at the most critical moment, Lin Ming had summoned forth that strange stone gate during his attack, causing him to directly impact into it. Not only did crashing into that stone gate heavily wound Naqi to the point of vomiting blood but it also caused the tide of the battle to reverse. If that hadn’t happened, Imperial Prince Naqi had full confidence he could have obtained victory at the end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter all, in terms of endurance, Naqi had absolute confidence in himself as a body transformation martial artist.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this sort of situation, he believed that whether it was talent, potential, or strength, he far surpassed Lin Ming. If Lin Ming were able to perfectly leave his name upon the Emperor Stone then there was no need to mention himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMoreover, even that woman Xiao Moxian had done it. This proved that the Emperor Stone mission wasn’t too difficult. Although Imperial Prince Naqi had never seen Xiao Moxian before, just the rumors he had heard weren’t enough to prove to him that her talent surpassed Lin Ming’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha, what Your Highness says is right. I think that this Emperor Stone seems as if it’s especially prepared for you. Your Highness has the title of Imperial Prince, and this is the Emperor Stone. If Your Highness isn’t able to perfectly leave your name atop it then the words Emperor Stone are really useless after all!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Once Your Highness decides to go I’m sure there will be immediate success!” Some of Naqi’s subordinates started to flatter him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for those people that were watching from far away, they felt contempt in their heart as they heard this. After being rudely driven out by this new group of people, all they had were criticisms in their hearts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Really, it’s as if he isn’t scared his tongue will be cut by the wind. It’s as if he thinks leaving a name upon the Emperor Stone is some sort of fun little game.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“They might have seen the perfect marks that that man and woman left on the Emperor Stone, thus they think it’s simple to do the same. In fact, I am willing to bet that the couple from yesterday were monstrous geniuses amongst all monstrous geniuses. Hehe, I can’t wait for these people to fail.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeveral martial artists were secretly discussing amongst themselves with true essence sound transmissions. They definitely didn’t dare to say these words out loud. In the Asura Road where there were countless masters all around, a few unwise words could easily cost someone their life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, just as they were speaking, that white-clothed martial artist amongst the group of newcomers looked over at them. He smiled as he pointed a finger at them and hooked it in a ‘come here’ gesture, almost making them faint from fear.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Damn!

They began to walk towards Imperial Prince Naqi with some trepidation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The lot of you, I want to ask you something. The two that left behind their names on the Emperor Stone, was it a man and a woman?” Naqi asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe martial artists that were questioned immediately nodded. They told Imperial Prince Naqi what they knew about the couple’s appearance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The young man had a yellow complexion and his looks were ordinary…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eImperial Prince Naqi traced his chin. This description clearly didn’t match with Lin Ming, but there was always the possibility that he had used an appearance changing technique. For someone like Lin Ming who had such a sensitive status, doing so would allow him to travel through the Asura Road in a much safer manner.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm, very good, now all of you can screw off!” Imperial Prince Naqi demonically grinned. With a sudden punch of his fists, a crazy surge of astral essence erupted, recklessly impacting outwards. As this astral essence crashed into the martial artists they shook and cried out in pain as they were sent flying away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eRumble rumble rumble!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThree people landed against giant boulders and broke them into pieces upon impact.

Imperial Prince Naqi only sneered as he saw this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What were you all talking about just now?

In fact, the people who were speaking amongst themselves were more than those three still crawling up on their bellies. Most of the people here still thought it was nothing more than a dream for Imperial Prince Naqi to perfectly leave his name upon the Emperor Stone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow that they saw what a tragic state those three martial artists had ended up in, all of them were secretly rejoicing that they hadn’t had the bad luck to be chosen.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn truth, Imperial Prince Naqi hadn’t heard what these people were speaking about in true essence sound transmissions; he simply didn’t have the ability to do so. But just by looking at the mocking and disdainful glances everyone was sending his way he could approximate what they were speaking about. In particular, the astonished looks on their faces as he called them out confirmed this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lo-Lord, please forgive this lowly one… this lowly one had eyes but couldn’t see Mount Tai.

As people who survived in the Asura Road, they knew when they had to lower their heads, otherwise they would have died a long time ago.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Rejoice that I don’t want to waste my time killing you all. I will forgive your dog lives because I want you all to look and personally see just how shallow your experience is!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Naqi spoke, he turned his gaze to Precipice Cliff. As he looked upwards, he could see the Emperor stone. Then, a smile appeared on his lips. He had just thought of an excellent idea.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mister Zhou, I heard leaving a name upon the Emperor Stone is equal to obtaining the approval of all the outstanding heroic young elites of the past and even obtaining the support of their destiny.

If one could leave marks on the Emperor Stone then one could naturally also ruin the marks left behind by others. Of course, doing this was several times more difficult!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“My road of becoming a great emperor will start here!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Naqi spoke, his body soared upwards. His movements were smooth and elegant, like a piece of cloud being blown upwards by the wind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe pressure that surrounded Precipice Cliff wasn’t able to affect Imperial Prince Naqi at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Awesome!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“His Highness is so fierce!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany martial artists cheered from the base of Precipice Cliff, obsequiousness thick in their voices. It had to be known that Imperial Prince Naqi was someone who would become at least an extreme Empyrean in the future and he even had a chance of becoming a True Divinity. In the Good Fortune Holy Land, even the statuses of Great World Kings were far lower than his own.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eImperial Prince Naqi shot upwards like an ascending meteor.
