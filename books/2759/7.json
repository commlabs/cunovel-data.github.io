I haven’t seen him since he went off to med school. He never came home for the summers. His mom used to come in here and complain about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He looks good,” Mila says, pointing out the obvious. I stare at him, taking in his blond hair and blue eyes, and his lanky, lean frame. “You should go talk to him. That’s your job, anyway. You need to make him feel welcome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl at her. “I’m not going over there and flirting with him. It’s not happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t say flirt,” Mila answers innocently. “I said talk. He always had a thing for you, though. And you do need a social life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m just debating whether to stab her in the eye with a fork when Ethan glances up and notices me. He gives me an excited wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell,” I mutter, as Mila crows triumphantly. “I’ll be back to deal with you in a minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear her laughing as I make my way over to Ethan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Madison.” He smiles, reminding me exactly how gorgeous his smile is. “I was hoping you’d be here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m always here,” I tell him wryly. “I think I practically live here. Are you back for good? I thought I’d heard that you were coming back to the ob-gyn department at the clinic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles again and I briefly wonder why I don’t feel a reaction. Is it because I’ve known him so long?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, that’s where I’m at. If you ever want to switch from Dr. Hall to me, I’m sure I can make your yearly exams much more pleasant for you.” He waggles his eyebrows in the ridiculous way I remember, and for a minute he seems just like the kid I knew in high school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yeah, that’s just what I want. The guy who vomited up his chocolate milk on me in kindergarten doing my pap smear. Besides, you’re not even a real doctor yet, are you? And I’ve had Dr. Hall for years. So… it’s not gonna happen. Your hands aren’t getting anywhere near this.” I gesture toward my downstairs area and he shakes his head. “It’s good to see you, though. It’s been forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am a real doctor. I’m a resident doctor. That counts, you little brat. I can even prescribe medicine and shit. But whatever. It’s good to see you too. You look fantastic, exactly the same as you did the day we graduated high school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin at his compliment. “Thanks, Ethan. I’ve been feeling old lately, so that’s good to hear. You look pretty good too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe throws his most charming smile at me. “We need to sit down and catch up sometime soon, Mad. I’ve missed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare down at him, trying to see him in the way any other female would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s tall, at least six-two, blond and blue-eyed. He looks like a descendent of Vikings or something. Well, without the muscles of a Viking. We’d make gorgeous babies together, if I’m honest. But I’ve known him since preschool, which means that I know all the dumbass stuff he did between then and now. I still vividly remember him eating a grasshopper on a dare in fourth grade. His tongue isn’t getting anywhere near mine, doctor or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winks and I shake my head. I’m just getting ready to tell him how terrifying it is that people are putting their health in his hands when the restaurant door opens, letting a slice of sunlight in to shine across the floor. I follow the light to the man who just walked in from the rain. He’s sliding his cell phone into the pocket of his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up and his eyes meet mine and there’s no way in hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo effing way in hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is slamming a million miles an hour in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it’s Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve got to be fucking kidding me. The universe obviously has a strange sense of humor. After lusting after this girl last night and wondering what happened to her all day today, I’m now standing face-to-face with her? What are the odds of that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty fucking small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet there she is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison stares at me in shock as she stands next to a guy dressed in fancy jeans and a button-up shirt. The guy is clearly a candy-ass, but he’s not my concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m totally fixated on Madison: her wide eyes, her mouth slightly open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s exactly how I feel. But unlike her, I manage to keep the surprise off my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m trying to process the crazy coincidence of us meeting like this, the second meeting in two days, when I see my sister emerge from a back hall, carrying a large tray of drinks. As Jacey glances up at me, everything suddenly clicks together and makes perfect sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey mentioned that she was going to bring a friend with her to the club last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jacey has told me about her boss before, a supposedly cool girl who had to grow up way too soon for reasons that I don’t remember right now. What I do remember is that she called her Maddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddy is Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey is the common thread, the root of this unholy coincidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and watch while Jacey sets her tray down and bounds across the room to grab me in a bear hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gabriel!” she squeals. “It’s about time you got here. I’ve missed your ugly face.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help but hug her back, even though I’m annoyed about the whole Madison thing. I almost feel like Jacey finagled all of this on purpose, but I know that can’t be right. There’s no way she could’ve arranged our meeting behind the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel Madison’s cool stare, but I refuse to look up and meet it because I can’t tell if she’s annoyed or intrigued that I’ve intruded upon her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the life of me, I can’t remember much after that fucking taxi accident last night. It was a total blackout, the first one I’ve had in months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t remember what I said to her, I don’t remember how I acted around her, I can’t remember shit. I do have strange little flashes of Madison tucking me into bed, but I don’t know if those are real memories or if my mind was just playing tricks on me. You never know with me, not when I’m in that fucked-up state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if it was real, I hate that she saw me like that. It’s humiliating, which is as good a reason as any to ignore her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Sis,” I murmur into Jacey’s blonde hair. “Happy birthday! You smell like spaghetti.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes and lets go of me, turning to Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maddy, you’ve got to come and finally meet my brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison looks stricken, but she manages to put one foot in front of the other, leaving the candy-ass’s side to stand reluctantly in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I’m uncomfortable about this myself, I fight the urge to laugh at the distinct expression of discomfort on her gorgeous face. No matter what else she might be feeling, it’s clear she’s not sure how to handle this situation, just as it’s clear that she’s not used to not being in control. She has no idea what to say to me. At all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s pretty fucking funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is my brother Gabriel.” Jacey looks up at me proudly. “He just got back from Afghanistan a few months ago and he’s hardly made the time to come see his poor little sister. Gabriel, this is my friend—and boss—Madison. You’ve heard all about her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison’s blue eyes are frozen on me, a question gleaming in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear it just as clearly as if she’d said the words. And it makes me wonder again just how much she saw last night. It puts me on the defensive and I smirk, just to prove that none of it matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Madison sees it, her eyes harden even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey stares from Madison to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um. Aren’t you going to say anything? ‘Nice to meet you,’ maybe? What’s wrong with you two? Did I miss something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison finally blinks and breaks our gaze, glancing at Jacey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s, uh, nice to meet you.” She looks uncertain of what to say next so I clear my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t see the point in mentioning what happened last night. Or what almost happened. Mentioning any part of it would open a can of worms that I don’t want to discuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison looks grateful for a moment before her face closes up and she turns cool once again. For some reason, I’m guessing that’s her normal persona… cool and collected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems very her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe she’s being cold because she’s mad that I left her at the accident? I internally flinch. I hate that I did that. It was a dick thing to do. But I wasn’t myself. If she’s judging me for that, fuck her. She doesn’t know shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin widely to show her that she’s not always in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that’s very me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s nice to formally meet you, Madison. I’ve heard a lot about you. Some of it was even good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey gasps and punches me, but I ignore her quick protests about how everything was good and how she’d never say anything bad about Madison. I even ignore her whining about how my arm hurt her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I glance down and notice the way Madison’s chest fills out her snug T-shirt, and I briefly flash back to the way her nipples tasted in my mouth, pink and sweet. My groin tightens and I quickly return my attention to the present as Madison slides her slender hand into mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a pleasure,” she answers coolly. “And Jacey, don’t worry. I know you only say good things about me. Your brother was just joking, I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow a snort, but Jacey looks appeased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, Maddy,” she mutters. “My brother didn’t used to be so rude. He’s still adjusting from being overseas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger flashes through me, quick and hot, but I tamp it down. I meant to be a little rude. I can’t get mad for being called out on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure I’ll be back to normal soon,” I agree with her smoothly before I change the subject. “Do you have a table for me? We’re gonna need a table for three. Brand’s coming too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey’s face lights up at the mention of our childhood friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank God! I haven’t seen him in at least a month. You both suck at coming to see me. You should be ashamed of yourselves.” She turns to Madison. “Can I give them the window table in the corner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. It was nice to meet you, Gabriel. I hope you enjoy your meal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe abruptly turns and joins a couple at a different table. Not that I’m going to show it, but I’m a little flabbergasted at the change in her. This cool, unflappable woman is nothing like the hot-blooded chick I met last night. I find myself staring at her tight ass for a minute, wondering how such a small ass fits such a big stick in it. I’m chuckling at the thought as Jacey leads me to my table. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-leave-beautifully-broken-2/page-7.html","bookId":2759,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:51 PM"}
