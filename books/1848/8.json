These women are—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nuns!\" Royce bit out, his gaze suddenly riveting on the heavy crucifix hanging from a black cord around Jenny\u0027s neck, then lifting to the soiled wimple and askew veil. For a moment his discovery left him nearly dumbstruck. \"God\u0027s teeth, you brought nuns here to be used as whores?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nuns!\" Stefan gasped, astounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whores!\" croaked Jenny, outraged. Surely he couldn\u0027t be so steeped in godlessness that he\u0027d actually give them to his men to be used as whores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could kill you for this folly, Stefan, so help me—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll feel differently when I tell you who they are,\" Stefan said, yanking his horrified gaze from Jenny\u0027s gray habit and crucifix. \"Standing before you, dear brother,\" he announced with renewed delight, \"is the Lady Jennifer, beloved eldest child of Lord Merrick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce stared at his younger brother, the hands at his sides unclenching as he turned to contemptuously survey Jenny\u0027s dirty face. \"Either you\u0027ve been fooled, Stefan, or the land rings with false rumors, for \u0027tis said Merrick\u0027s daughter is the rarest beauty in the land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, I wasn\u0027t fooled. She is truly his, I heard it from her own lips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching Jenny\u0027s trembling chin between his thumb and forefinger, Royce stared hard at her smudged face, studying it by the firelight while his brows drew together and his lips twisted into a mirthless smile. \"How could anyone possibly call you a beauty?\" he said with deliberate, insulting sarcasm. \"The jewel of Scotland?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the flare of anger his words brought to her face as she jerked it out of his grasp, but instead of being touched by her courage, he was angered by it. Everything about the name Merrick infuriated him, making vengeance boil up inside him, and he grasped her pale, smudged face and jerked it back to his. \"Answer me!\" he demanded in an awful voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her state of near hysteria, it seemed to Brenna that Jenny was somehow accepting blame that was rightfully Brenna\u0027s\" and, groping at Jenny\u0027s gown, using it for leverage, she hauled herself to an unsteady, standing position, then she molded her body to Jenny\u0027s entire right side, like twins fused together at birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t call Jenny that!\" she croaked when it seemed as if Jenny\u0027s continued silence would surely bring terrible retribution from the terrifying giant before them. \"They—they call me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the hell are you?\" he demanded furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is no one!\" Jenny burst out, discarding the eighth commandment in hopes that Brenna might be freed if she were believed to be a nun, rather than a Merrick. \"She is merely Sister Brenna of Belkirk Abbey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that true?\" Royce demanded of Brenna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\" Jenny cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Brenna whispered meekly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClenching his hands into fists at his sides, Royce Westmoreland briefly closed his eyes. It was like a nightmare, he thought. An incredible nightmare. After a forced march, he was out of food, out of shelter, and out of patience. And now this. Now, he couldn\u0027t even manage to get a sensible, honest answer out of two terrified women. He was tired, he realized, exhausted from three days and nights without sleep. He turned his haggard face and blazing eyes on Brenna. \"If you have any hope of surviving another hour,\" he informed her, correctly recognizing her as the most easily intimidated of the pair and, therefore, the least likely one to invent a lie, \"you\u0027ll answer me now and with the truth.\" His rapier gaze stabbed into Brenna\u0027s fear-widened hazel eyes, imprisoning them. \"Are you, or are you not, the daughter of Lord Merrick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna swallowed and tried to speak but couldn\u0027t push a word past her trembling lips. Drooping with defeat, she bowed her head and meekly nodded. Satisfied, Royce shot a murderous glance at the hellcat in gentle nun\u0027s garb, then he turned to issue a curt order to his brother: \"Tie them up and put them in a tent. Have Arik stand guard to protect them from the men. I want them both alive tomorrow for questioning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want them alive tomorrow for questioning… the words reverberated in Jenny\u0027s tortured mind as she lay in a tent on the ground beside poor Brenna, her wrists and feet bound with leather thongs, looking up at the cloudless, starlit sky through a hole in the top of the tent. What sort of questioning did the Wolf have in mind, she wondered as exhaustion finally overtook her fear. What means of torture would he use to exact answers from them, and what answers could he possibly want? Tomorrow, Jenny was certain, would mark the end of their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenny?\" Brenna whispered shakily. \"You don\u0027t think he means to kill us tomorrow, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jenny lied reassuringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Three\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wolf\u0027s camp seemed to stir to life before the last stars faded from the sky, but Jenny had not slept more than an hour all night. Shivering beneath the thin covering of her light mantle, she stared up at the inky blue heavens, alternately apologizing to God for her many follies and begging Him to spare poor Brenna from the inevitable consequences of Jenny\u0027s foolish decision to walk up the hill at dusk yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna,\" she whispered when the movements of the men grew louder outside, indicating the camp was coming fully to life, \"are you awake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the Wolf questions us, let me give the answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said again, her voice quaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not certain what he\u0027ll want to know, but it\u0027s bound to be something we shouldn\u0027t tell him. Perhaps I\u0027ll be able to guess why he asks a question and so know when to mislead him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn had scarcely streaked the sky with pink before two men came to untie them and to allow them both only a few minutes of privacy in the bushes in the woods on the edge of the wide clearing before they retied Jenny and led Brenna off to meet the Wolf. \"Wait,\" Jenny gasped when she realized their intentions, \"take me, please. My sister is… er… unwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them, a towering giant over seven feet tall who could only be the legendary colossus called Arik, gave her a blood-chilling look and walked off. The other guard continued leading poor Brenna away and, through the open flap of the tent, Jenny saw the lascivious looks the men in the camp were giving her as she walked through their midst, her wrists bound behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe half hour Brenna was gone seemed like an eternity to Jenny, but to her enormous relief, Brenna didn\u0027t show any signs of having suffered any physical cruelty when she returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" Jenny asked anxiously when the guard had walked away. \"He didn\u0027t harm you, did he.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-8.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM"}
