You want to meet me? I might have some work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say where and when.\" I named a coffee shop on Twenty-third Street half a block from the Flatiron Building. \"Let\u0027s shoot for a quarter to twelve,\" I said, \"but I might be a few minutes late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me,\" he said. \"We meetin\u0027 in a restaurant, I\u0027m gonna be there on time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The client,\" Wally said, \"turned out to be a cheap fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not unheard of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, no. The world is full of cheap fucks. How it went, I told him what a job you did, how you ought to be down for a bonus. I said we as an agency didn\u0027t expect anything over and above our standard fees, which we don\u0027t, but that when a guy working per diem comes through like you did he ought to see something extra for his troubles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he asked me what was reasonable. You know what went through my mind? The old expression, a picture is worth a thousand words. So okay, figure a buck a word, and I said a thousand dollars struck me as a reasonable amount. Which it did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Wally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it wasn\u0027t coming out of my pocket, so I could afford the gesture. And what\u0027s a thousand dollars to this fuck anyway, five hours of his lawyer\u0027s time? If that. So here\u0027s his check. Five hundred dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he say he thought a thousand was too high?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t say shit. He just went and cut a check for half of the recommended figure. Oh, and here\u0027s the letter of commendation, thanks for your efforts on our behalf, et cetera, et cetera. Look it over, see if it\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scanned a glowing testimonial on the client\u0027s letterhead. \"This is great,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got a pretty nice prose style, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wrote it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dictated it,\" he said. \"How else are you going to get this sort of thing the way you want it? At least the son of a bitch wrote it down word for word. He could have figured words are money and kept half of them for himself.\" He shook his head. \"You know, I think he was just going to give me half of whatever I said. If I asked for two grand I\u0027d have got one, and if I\u0027d asked for five hundred I\u0027d have got two and a half. I thought about sending this back to him, telling him to pay the whole shot or forget it. I\u0027ll still do that if you say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"The five\u0027s fine. Let it go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" he said, \"it evens out. I got those credit reports for you, fourteen of them, and our company rate as Class B subscribers is thirty-five bucks a pop. Which totals out at four-ninety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose I give you the check back,\" I said, \"and we call it a wash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"You don\u0027t want to do that, kiddo. Keep the check and take the reports and sustain yourself with the knowledge that being a cheap fuck never pays. The reports aren\u0027t costing you a cent, Matt. I billed them to the client.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you manage that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did a ton of shit on his behalf, and five hundred dollars\u0027 worth of credit reports won\u0027t seem out of line to anybody. Hey, fuck him, you know? What\u0027s he ask me my advice for if he\u0027s gonna take my figure and cut it in fucking half? You see what cheapness does, Matt? It\u0027s costing him the same thousand dollars and he\u0027s got us hating his guts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me,\" I said. \"I love everybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a couple of minutes early for my lunch with TJ, but he was already seated at a window table, working on a pair of cheeseburgers and a plate of onion rings. I told him about Eldoniah Mims, doing twenty-to-life upstate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Sounds like he be in the right place, Ace. Killin\u0027 folks for chump change, dude like that got no cause to be walkin\u0027 around.\" I explained that they might have hung one more killing on Mims than he had in fact committed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He carrying any extra weight for it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress came over and I ordered the spinach pie and a small Greek salad. When she moved off he said, \"You spy the way she was scopin\u0027 us out? Like she wondering what fool put you and me at the same table. Then she realize we together, so she got to figure out why. Runs all the numbers through her mind, like you\u0027re a john and I\u0027m a hustler, you\u0027re a cop and I\u0027m some lowlife you\u0027re \u0027bout to bust.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wearing pleated gray slacks and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up and the collar unbuttoned. TJ wore a shiny rayon vest striped vertically in black and scarlet, and nothing but brown skin under it. His pants were knee-length baggy black shorts. \"I\u0027m a cop on the take,\" I offered, \"and you\u0027re a millionaire drug trafficker prepared to pay me off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talkin\u0027,\" he said. \"The Excalibur\u0027s parked at the curb, Herb.\" He took a drink and wiped milk from his upper lip. \"Say this Mims- what\u0027s his first name? El something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eldoniah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eldoniah. That from the Bible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027I swear I don\u0027t know how those people come up with those names.\u0027 \" He\u0027s a good mimic, and the line came out in a fairly accurate version of Long Island Lockjaw. In his own voice- or one of his voices, anyway- he said, \"You clear Mims for this one killing, he still doin\u0027 the same twenty he doin\u0027 now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him I wasn\u0027t interested in clearing Mims, who was clearly where he belonged. My food came, and while I ate I explained about the club of thirty-one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Somebody be killing them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who you figure doin\u0027 it, one of them or some other dude?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have to be somebody with a reason, an\u0027 it ought to be more of a reason than killing a cabdriver for his coin bank.\" He finished his milk, wiped his mouth again. He said, \"I been workin\u0027 some for Elaine. Mostly mindin\u0027 the store.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She mentioned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of cool to watch people come in and take a look at me. Like they \u0027spect I\u0027ll grab something and go bookin\u0027 on out the door, an\u0027 then they catch on that I\u0027m in charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are black people running stores all over the city,\" I said. \"The antique store two doors up the street from Elaine is run by a black woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, an\u0027 there\u0027s black receptionists in the big office buildings, and black folks at department-store information desks, all of \u0027em right out where you can see them. Thing is, they don\u0027t be lookin\u0027 like they just got in off the Deuce. They dressed for success, Bess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has Elaine said anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"She cool with it. But what I might do is keep some straight clothes on a hanger in her back room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked about that some, and then he said, \"I guess I could take a ride uptown, see what the brothers and sisters know about my uncle Eldoniah. Thing is, folks just be talkin\u0027 different types of trash. Dude\u0027s on the street, all he\u0027ll tell you is how bad he is, like he dusted six cops and robbed the Bank of England. Same dude\u0027s in prison, it\u0027s always for something he didn\u0027t do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. \"The prisons are all overcrowded, and none of those guys ever did what they went away for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go up to the Bronx, see if anybody knows anything. All this is four years ago, that what you said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been almost that long since Cloonan was killed. The murder Mims was tried for came later on, and the trial was postponed a couple of times. He\u0027s only been working on his twenty for the past year and a half.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes it a little easier,\" he said. \"Least there\u0027s a chance somebody\u0027ll remember who he was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got the check. While I was leaving the tip he said, \"I was just thinking. These dudes in the club? How it\u0027s suspicious that half of \u0027em\u0027s dead after thirty years. Is that right, thirty years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More like thirty-two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thirty-two years,\" he said. \"You couldn\u0027t start a club like that on the Deuce. Never mind no thirty-two years. \u0027Fore you knew it, you wouldn\u0027t have nobody left to have a meeting with. The ones that wasn\u0027t dead themselves, they most likely be locked up for killin\u0027 the other ones.\" He took a black Raiders cap from the back pocket of his shorts, tucked his hair into it, checked his reflection in the mirror. He said, \"Group of dudes I knew four, five years ago, half of \u0027em\u0027s dead. Didn\u0027t take thirty-two years, neither. Dyin\u0027 must be easy, when I think of all the dudes caught on real quick how to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try to be a slow learner,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I tryin\u0027,\" he said. \"I doin\u0027 the best I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI treated myself to the afternoon, catching a movie on Twenty-third Street, then walking downtown to the Village. I passed the apartment building that had risen where Cunningham\u0027s had once stood, and the brownstone a block away where Carl Uhl had been murdered. I got down to Perry Street in time for the four o\u0027clock meeting and stood in the rear with a cup of coffee from the pastry shop around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speaker told what a friend alcohol had been, and how it had turned on him. \"Toward the end,\" he said, \"it just didn\u0027t work anymore. Nothing worked. Nothing relaxed me, not even seizures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I waited for a bus on Hudson Street, a florist\u0027s display caught my eye. I had them wrap a dozen Dutch iris, rode the bus to Fifty-fourth, and walked over to Elaine\u0027s shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are beautiful,\" she said. \"What brought this on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were going to be diamonds,\" I said, \"but the client got cheap about the bonus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What bonus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the picture we took at Wallbanger\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" she said. \"What a crazy evening that was. I wonder how many bars like that there are in the city, with grown men and women sticking themselves to the wall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know one on Washington Street,\" I told her, \"where they stick each other to the wall, but they don\u0027t use Velcro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do they use, Krazy Glue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Manacles, leg irons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I think I know the place you mean. But didn\u0027t they have to close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They reopened again under another name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it boys only these days? Or is it still boys and girls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys and girls. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"One isn\u0027t obliged to participate, is one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One doesn\u0027t even have to walk in the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean you can just observe, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why you ask, kemo sabe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Maybe I\u0027m interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, look how much fun we had at the Velcro Derby out in Queens. It might be even more of a hoot to watch people get kinky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would finally give me a chance to wear that leather outfit that I had no business buying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, that\u0027s why you want to go,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not sex at all, it\u0027s to make a fashion statement. You\u0027re right, though, it\u0027s the perfect costume for the well-dressed dominatrix. But what would I wear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing you, probably your gray glen-plaid suit.
