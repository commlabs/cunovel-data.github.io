She particularly enjoyed the bewildered look, of Mr. Craven, who, bare-headed, looked on this side and on that, unable to conjecture who had thrown the missile. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pompey, unconscious of the danger he had escaped, walked up to the tumbler and smelt of it. This attracted the attention of Mr. Craven, who stooped and picked it up. His bewilderment increased. If it had been a stone, he would have understood better, but how a tumbler should have found its way here as a missile was incomprehensible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It slowly dawned upon him that the person who threw it must be somewhere near. Then again, on examining it further, he began to suspect that it was one of his wife\u0027s tumblers, and he jumped to the [60] conclusion that it was Frank who threw it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If it is he, I\u0027ll wring his neck!\" he murmured, revengefully. \"I mean to find out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Pompey,\" he said, calling the dog, \"do you see this tumbler?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pompey wagged his tail.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who threw it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pompey looked up, as if for instructions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Go find him!\" said Mr. Craven, in a tone of command.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The dog seemed to understand, for he put his nose to the ground and began to run along, as if in search.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, murther! What if he finds me?\" thought Katy, crouching a little lower. \"Won\u0027t he be mad, jist?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Katy might have crawled away unobserved, very possibly, if she had started as soon as the missile was thrown. Now, that dog and man were both on the lookout, escape was cut off.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will he find me?\" Katy asked herself, with some anxiety.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [61]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The question was soon answered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pompey jumped over the wall, and a joyous bark announced his discovery. He knew Katy, and seemed to fancy that she had concealed herself in joke. He jumped upon her, and wagged his tail intelligently, as if to say:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You see, I\u0027ve found you out, after all.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Craven hurried to the wall, eagerly expecting to detect Frank in the person concealed. He started back in astonishment as Katy O\u0027Grady rose and faced him. Then he became wrathful, as he realized that his own hired servant had had the audacity to fling a tumbler at his hat.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What brings you out here, Katy?\" he demanded, with a frown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Shure, sir,\" said Katy, nonchalantly, \"I was tired wid stayin\u0027 in the hot kitchen, and I thought I\u0027d come out and take the air jist.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And so you neglected the work.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The worruk will be done; niver you mind about that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you fling this tumbler at my head?\" demanded Mr. Craven, sternly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [62]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let me look at it, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Katy looked at it scrutinizingly, and made answer:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very likely, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you know?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wouldn\u0027t swear it was the same one, sir, but it looks like it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you admit throwing a tumbler at my head, do you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Didn\u0027t you say you did just now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I threw it at your hat.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is the same thing. How came you to have the cursed impudence to do such a thing?\" asked her master, wrathfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because you was goin\u0027 to shoot the dog,\" said Katy, coolly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Suppose I was, is it any business of yours?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The dog doesn\u0027t belong to you, Mr. Craven. It belongs to Master Frank.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think it expedient for him to keep such an ill-natured brute around.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He calls you a brute, Pomp,\" said Katy, caressing Pompey—\"you that\u0027s such a good dog. It\u0027s a shame!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [63]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Catherine,\" said Mr. Craven, with outraged dignity, \"your conduct is very improper. You have insulted me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By the powers, how did I do it?\" asked Katy, with an affectation of innocent wonder.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was an insult to throw that tumbler at my head. I might order the constable to arrest you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d like to see him thry it!\" said Katy, putting her arms akimbo in such a resolute fashion that Mr. Craven involuntarily stepped back slightly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you aware that I am your master?\" continued Mr. Craven, severely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I\u0027m not,\" answered Katy, promptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are a servant in my house.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I\u0027m not. The house don\u0027t belong to you at all, sir. It belongs to my mistress and Master Frank.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s the same thing. According to the law, I am in control of their property,\" said Mr. Craven, resolved upon a master-stroke which, he felt confident, would overwhelm his adversary. \"After the great impropriety of which you have been guilty this afternoon, I discharge [64] you from my employment.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You discharge me!\" exclaimed Katy, with incredulous scorn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I discharge you, and I desire you to leave the house to-morrow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You discharge me!\" repeated Katy, with a ringing laugh. \"That\u0027s a good one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Craven\u0027s cadaverous face colored with anger.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you don\u0027t go quietly, I\u0027ll help you out,\" he added, incautiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come on, then,\" said Katy, assuming a warlike attitude. \"Come on, then, and we\u0027ll see whether you can put out Katy O\u0027Grady.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your impudence will not avail you. I am determined to get rid of you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And do ye think I\u0027m goin\u0027 to lave the house, and my ould misthress, and Master Frank, at the orders of such an interloper as you, Mr. Craven?\" she cried, angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t propose to multiply words about it,\" said Mr. Craven, with an assumption of dignity. \"If you had behaved well, you might have [65] stayed. Now you must go.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Must I?\" sniffed Katy, indignantly. \"Must I, indade?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, you must, and the less fuss you make about it the better.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Craven supposed that he had the decided advantage, and that Katy, angry as she was, would eventually succumb to his authority. But he did not know the independent spirit of Catherine O\u0027Grady, whose will was quite as resolute as his own.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And ye think I\u0027m goin\u0027 at your word—I that\u0027s been in the family since Master Frank was a baby?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sorry for you, Katy,\" said Mr. Craven, in triumphant magnanimity. \"But I cannot permit a servant to remain in my house who is guilty of the gross impropriety of insulting me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know why you want to get rid of me,\" said Katy, nodding her head vigorously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why?\" asked Craven, with some curiosity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You want to p\u0027ison the dog.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [66]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Craven started. How had his secret leaked out?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you mean?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mane! I mane that I saw you lavin\u0027 the p\u0027isoned mate for the dog three days agone, and if it hadn\u0027t been for me he\u0027d have eaten it, and the poor creetur would be stiff in death.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He did eat it. I saw him,\" said Mr. Craven, hastily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, he didn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t the same mate!\" said Katy, triumphantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What was it, then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It was a piece I cut off and carried out to him,\" said Katy. \"The other I wrapped up in a piece of paper, and buried it in the field.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Craven\u0027s eyes were opened. Pompey\u0027s cast-iron constitution was explained. After all, he was not that natural phenomenon which Mr. Craven had supposed him to be. But he was angry at Katy\u0027s interference no less.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Say no more,\" he said. \"You must go. You have no right to interfere with my plans.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [67]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Say no more? Won\u0027t I be tellin\u0027 the misthress and Master Frank how you tried to kill the poor dog, first with p\u0027ison, and nixt wid a pistol?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was something in this speech that made Mr. Craven hesitate and reflect.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He knew that Katy\u0027s revelation would provoke Frank, and make him an enemy, and he feared the boy\u0027s influence on his mother, particularly as he was concocting plans for inducing his wife to place some of her money in his hand under pretext of a new investment. He must be careful not to court hostile influences, and after all, he resolved to bear with Katy, much as he disliked her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"On the whole, Katy,\" he said, after a pause, \"I will accept your apology, and you may stay.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My apology!\" said Katy, in astonishment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, your explanation. I see your motives were good, and I will think no more about it. You had better not mention this matter to Mrs. Craven or Frank, as it might disturb them.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And won\u0027t you try to kill Pomp agin?\" asked Katy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No; I dislike dogs, especially as they are apt to run mad, but as Frank is attached to Pompey, I won\u0027t interfere. You had better take this tumbler and wash it, as it is uninjured.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All right, sir,\" said Katy, who felt that she had gained a victory, although Mr. Craven assumed that it was his.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am very glad you are so devoted to your mistress,\" said Mr. Craven, who had assumed his old suavity. \"I shall propose to her to increase your wages.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027s a mighty quare man!\" thought the bewildered Katy, as she hurried back to her work, followed by Pompey.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2968/81709.html","bookId":376,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM"}
