I gestured towards the iron stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was useless to say anything at this juncture. It wasn\u0027t a vampire that they\u0027d just seen. They knew and suspected nothing of supernatural origin here. It was Mona\u0027s spectacular \"recovery\" which had them in total disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in essence a scary moment. Because though a big frank smile of undisguised jubilance had broken out over Michael Curry\u0027s face, Rowan\u0027s scowling countenance was full of something akin to wrath. All her personal history was coiled behind that wrath, and I was fascinated by it as I\u0027d been by all her emotions before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly reluctantly, and somewhat in the manner of a sleepwalker, Rowan let me take her arm. Her entire body was tense. Nevertheless, I led her to the iron steps, and then I went before her, in order to lead the whole party. And Mona gestured for Rowan to follow me, and Mona, tossing her hair back over her shoulders, looking miserable, followed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back parlor was best for such gatherings, having no bookshelves and a deep velvet sofa and lots of tolerable Queen Anne chairs. Of course there was ormolu and inlaid wood everywhere, and a blazing new wallpaper of wine and beige stripes, and the garlands of flowers in the carpet seemed to be having convulsions, and the Impressionist paintings on the wall in their thick encrusted frames were like windows into a far far better, sun-filled universe, but it was a good room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut off the overhead chandelier immediately and switched on two of the smaller corner lamps. It was softly dim now, but not uncomfortably so, and I directed everyone to sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael beamed at Mona and said at once, \"Darling, you look absolutely beautiful,\" as if he was uttering a prayer. \"My lovely, lovely girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Uncle Michael, I love you,\" Mona answered tragically, and wiped at her eyes fiercely as though these people were somehow going to return her to her wretched mortal state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn was petrified. And his worst suspicion was rightly directed at Rowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe too appeared paralyzed except for her eyes, breaking away from Mona suddenly and fastening on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had to be quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, you see for yourself,\" I said, my eyes moving from Rowan to Michael and back again. \"Mona\u0027s cured of whatever was wrong with her, and the entire wasting sickness has been reversed. She\u0027s utterly self-sufficient and whole. If you think that I am going to explain to you how this was done, or anything about it, you\u0027re wrong. You can call me Rasputin or worse names. I don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan\u0027s eyes quivered but her face did not change. The turbulence inside her was unreadable, indeed, unknowable, and if I caught anything definitive it was a high pitch of terror that hearkened back to things which had befallen her in the past. I couldn\u0027t fathom it, there wasn\u0027t time for such mental mining, and her confusion was putting up too much of a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to walk away from here with any answers,\" I proceeded. \"Get angry at me. Go ahead. Some night, many years from now, maybe Mona will choose to explain what happened, but for now you have to accept what you\u0027ve seen. You no longer need to worry about Mona. Mona is on her own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that I\u0027m ungrateful,\" Mona said, her voice thick and her eyes filming red. She blotted them at once with her handkerchief. \"You know I\u0027m grateful. It just feels so good to be free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan fixed again on her. If Rowan found the slightest virtue in this miracle, it wasn\u0027t rising to the forefront of her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your voice isn\u0027t the same,\" said Rowan. \"Your hair, your skin-.\" She looked back to me. \"Something\u0027s wrong.\" She stared at Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This meeting\u0027s over,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t mean to be harsh, truly I don\u0027t. But you know what you need to know. Obviously you know the phone number here, that\u0027s how you found us. You know where we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn and Mona followed but Rowan and Michael didn\u0027t move. Michael was taking his lead from Rowan, but then he reluctantly stood up, because Rowan or no Rowan, it was the courteous thing to do. This man was so lovable that even under these circumstances he didn\u0027t want to offend anyone, least of all Mona, and cause anyone any discomfort at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe simply did not see us the way Rowan did. He didn\u0027t look at people. He looked into their eyes. He studied Quinn\u0027s expression but not the physicality of Quinn. He didn\u0027t even care that Quinn was so tall. He scouted for the kindness in people and invariably found it, and his own kindness invested his entire being, infusing his considerable physical gifts. It was a rugged beauty he possessed, and he put behind him a calm self-assurance that can only arise from immense strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, do you need anything?\" he asked Mona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to need some money,\" said Mona. She ignored Rowan\u0027s fixed stare. \"Of course I\u0027m not the Heiress anymore. Nobody wanted to talk about that when I was dying, but I\u0027ve known that for years. And I\u0027d retire now anyway, if it wasn\u0027t the case. The Heiress to the Mayfair fortune has to bear a child. We all know that I can\u0027t do that anymore. But I want to ask for a settlement. Nothing like the billions of the Legacy. Nothing like that at all. I mean, just a settlement so that I won\u0027t be poor. That\u0027s no problem, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem at all,\" said Michael with a very loving smile to her and a shrug. The man was totally appealing. He wanted to hug her. But he took his lead from Rowan, and Rowan had not moved from the chair. \"It\u0027s no problem, is it, Rowan?\" he asked. His eyes swept the room a bit uneasily. He fixed for a few seconds on the brilliant Impressionist painting above the sofa in front of which I stood. He looked genially at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t begin to guess what had transformed Mona. But he never dreamt of anything sinister or evil. It was amazing the degree with which he accepted it, and only as I searched his mind now, in this moment when he was confused by Rowan and without his habitual defenses, only in this moment did I understand. He accepted Mona as she was because he wanted so very much for her recovery to be true. He\u0027d thought Mona was doomed. Now a miracle had happened to Mona. He didn\u0027t need to know who\u0027d worked the miracle. Saint Juan Diego? Saint Lestat? Whatever! It was fine with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have told him a harebrained story about us pumping her full of lipids and spring water and he would have bought it wholesale. He had flunked \"Science\" in school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Rowan Mayfair couldn\u0027t escape being a scientific genius. She couldn\u0027t ignore the fact that Mona\u0027s recovery was a physical impossibility. And in her mind were memories so painful they had no pictures or people to them; they had only dark inchoate feelings and awesome guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat silent and motionless in the chair. Her eyes moved accusingly and wrathfully from Mona to me and back again and round once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a sense, perhaps flawed, that she was moving towards a brave curiosity, but . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona approached her. Not a great idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI signaled Quinn, and Quinn tried to stop Mona but Mona shook him off. Mona was determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet Mona appeared wary, as if Rowan was an animal that could scratch. I didn\u0027t like this at all. Mona stood between Rowan and everybody else in the room. I could no longer see Rowan, but I knew that Mona was only inches from Rowan and this was not good at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona bent down with her arms out. She apparently meant to kiss or embrace Rowan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan moved back so fast to get away from Mona that she knocked over the chair in which she\u0027d been sitting and the table and lamp beside it, crash, thump, bang, shuffle, and plastered herself against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael went on full alert, shooting to her side. But what was there to see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona stepped back to the center of the room, whispering \"Oh, my God,\" under her breath, and Quinn took hold of her from behind and held her and kissed her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan couldn\u0027t move. Her heart was pounding and her mouth was open and she shut her eyes as if she were about to scream. She had passed right through terror. It was utter revulsion, as if she\u0027d seen a giant insect. It was the most explosive reaction on the part of a mortal to a vampire that I\u0027d ever seen. It was panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I could charm her because I\u0027d done it before, crossed the barrier between the species without ever evoking that panic, and I determined to cross the barrier now with all my nerve. And this did take tremendous nerve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, darling, very well, sweetheart,\" I said, advancing on Rowan as fast as I dared. \"My precious, my darling,\" I said, as I slipped my arms behind her and under her, and caught her up and carried her past an astonished Michael, towards the door. Her body grew soft. (Thank Heaven.) \"I have you, my sweetheart,\" I said to her, crooning in her ear, kissing her ear, \"I\u0027m holding you, precious darling,\" as I carried her out and down the steps, her body now completely limp, \"I have you, my sweetheart, nothing can hurt you, yes, yes,\" her head falling against my chest and her hand clawing weakly at my shirt. She was gasping. \"I understand, my precious,\" I said. \"But you\u0027re safe, you\u0027re really safe, I would never let anything bad happen to you, I promise you, that\u0027s my promise, and Michael\u0027s here, he\u0027s with you, it\u0027s all right, darling, you know I\u0027m telling you the truth, that these things are truly all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see these words sinking down, down into her mind, through the levels of guilt and remembrance and flight from the present, and what she\u0027d sensed and couldn\u0027t deny and could only retreat from, and all the truths she had feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael was right behind me, and as soon as we reached the flagstones he took her from me effortlessly, and she fell into his arms in the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoldly I kissed her cheek, my lips lingering, and her hand found mine and her fingers coiled around mine. Behold, thou art fair my love, thou art fair. Her panic was still so great that she couldn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.\u0027 \" I whispered in her ear. I kissed her again and again on her soft cheek. I stroked her hair. Her fingers gripped me, but the grip had softened, as she was softened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got you, darling,\" Michael said in exactly the same tone. \"Rowan, my sweetheart, I have you, honey, I\u0027ll take you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I backed off his eyes looked at me searchingly, and without enmity. I sensed something about his love for her, that it was immense and beyond pettiness, and that he claimed no dominion over her, that he adored her. It was difficult for me to really accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowan lost consciousness. Her head fell forward and against Michael. He realized it with total alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" I said. \"Just take her home and lie down beside her and don\u0027t leave her alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what the Hell happened?\" he whispered to me as he cuddled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter,\" I said. \"Remember that. It doesn\u0027t matter. What matters is that Mona has been saved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course Mona was sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay across the bed in their room where the computer purred, and she was sobbing, and Quinn sat by her, as was becoming the custom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did I do wrong?\" Mona asked. She looked up at me. \"Tell me, what did I do wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat at the computer desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up, cheeks streaked with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t live with them the way Quinn lives at Blackwood Manor; you see it, don\u0027t you? I didn\u0027t do anything wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, stop lying to yourself,\" I said. \"You know very well you\u0027re angry with her, deeply angry. Your intentions weren\u0027t pure when you approached her. She\u0027s done something to you, deceived you, something, something you can\u0027t forgive. You practically told us right here in this room. You had to show her your power, you had to push it-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really think so?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know so,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think she\u0027s kept secrets from you. Magic secrets, secrets you haven\u0027t explained to Quinn and to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve resented her all these years as the doctor, the mad scientist, yes, right, the mad scientist, the keeper of the keys to the magic, coming in and out of your death chamber, ordering this medication and that medication and never really telling you what was happening, but other secrets, darker secrets, secrets that you and she and Michael know, not so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now here you knew you had the powerful magic. You had the keys to a powerful secret. You condescended to her. And so she saw through this duplicity, this display of patronizing affection, and she was panic-stricken when she realized you weren\u0027t alive anymore, just as you wanted her to be. You wanted her to acknowledge your power, that next to you, the way you are, she was nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really think so?\" Tears. Sniffles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know so. And you\u0027re not finished with her. Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on, Lestat,\" said Quinn, \"you\u0027re being unfair. Mona confessed that they had a score to settle. But surely she wasn\u0027t thinking of all those things, not when she went towards Rowan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, she was,\" I insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve fallen in love with her,\" said Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In love with who? Mona? I told you I love both of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Quinn. \"You know I don\u0027t mean Mona. You\u0027ve fallen completely in love with Rowan in a way that\u0027s not like your infatuation with us. You\u0027ve connected with something deep inside of Rowan and we can\u0027t compete with it. It started last night. But you can\u0027t have Rowan. You just can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mon Dieu!\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed the hall, went into my bedroom and shut and locked the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere stood Julien in his natty white-tie regalia, arms folded smugly as he gazed at me, leaning against the tall mahogany headboard of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, you can\u0027t have her,\" he said, laughing under his breath. \"I watched you slip into it like the fly into the honey. I loved it. Her taking you so unawares, oh yes, your tasting that kernel of evil with your oh-so-refined senses, kisses in the shadows, yes, and falling so blithely in love with her, so tenderly for you with all your loathsome powers. And you cannot have her. No, never. Not Rowan Mayfair. Never ever. Not the Magnate, not the Creator of the greatest family enterprise, not the champion of the family\u0027s public dreams, the family\u0027s philanthropic wonder, the family\u0027s guiding star! You can\u0027t ever have her. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou shall have all the fun of watching her from afar and never knowing what might happen to her. Old age, sickness, accident, tragedy. Won\u0027t it be something to behold! And you can\u0027t ever interfere. You don\u0027t dare!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere stood beside him little Stella, aged eight or nine, in a lovely white dress, drop waist style, a white bow in her black hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so mean to him, Oncle Julien!\" she said. \"Poor darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, but he is a mean creature, Stella dearest,\" said Julien. \"He took our beloved Mona. He deserves nothing but the worst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me, you cheap backstairs ghost,\" I said. \"I\u0027m no sentimental rake out of a bad Byronic poem. I\u0027m not in love with your precious Rowan Mayfair. The love I feel for her is something you can\u0027t know in your shallow wanderings. And Rowan\u0027s in more trouble than you can ever imagine. Now why don\u0027t you tell me what disastrous mistake you made with all your clever machinations and visitations? Or shall I get it out of Mona or Rowan or Michael? You haven\u0027t been an angelic success, have you? Take your little girl in your arms and get out of my sight. Is God giving you the power to writhe and spit with anger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePounding on the door. Mona calling my name over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were gone, the ghosts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came into my arms. \"But I can\u0027t bear it if you\u0027re angry with me, tell me you\u0027re not, I love you with my whole soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, never angry,\" I said. \"Let me hold you tight, my fledgling, my darling, my newborn one. I adore you. We\u0027ll fix everything. We\u0027ll make everything perfect for everyone.
