PAUL DEFENDS HIS MOTHER.","content":"\u0026nbsp;To say that Stephen was astonished hardly expresses the truth. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He stood with open mouth, staring at our hero, as if panic-stricken by his sudden appearance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where did you come from?\" he asked, amazement prevailing over every other sensation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"From the next room, where I heard your contemptible attempt to extort money from my mother.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At another time Stephen would have resented this speech, but now he was anxious to find out what had happened to his friend, and how Paul had managed to escape the snare that had been so carefully laid for him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How long have you been at home?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I got home at the usual time. What makes you ask?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did anything happen to-day?\" asked Stephen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Foolishly he was betraying himself, and Paul saw clearly that he knew of the plot, even if he were not concerned in it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 132]He resolved that Stephen should betray himself yet further.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What should happen?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I heard you were arrested for theft,\" said Stephen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What kind of theft?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stealing a wallet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where did you hear it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never mind!\" answered Stephen, sullenly. \"I heard it, and that\u0027s enough.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It seems then you were misinformed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Didn\u0027t you have any trouble at all?\" asked Stephen, perplexed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, something happened. A man pretended that I had stolen his wallet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Didn\u0027t I say so!\" Stephen exclaimed, triumphantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This Dutchman——\" proceeded the train boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dutchman!\" said Stephen, hastily. \"I thought it was a Quaker.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now I think of it, it was a Quaker,\" said Paul, quietly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What made you say Dutchman?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wanted to find out how much you knew about it. Did you know this Quaker?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did I know the Quaker? I don\u0027t know any Quakers.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 133]\"I thought you might. In that case, you won\u0027t feel any interest in knowing what became of him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did—did anything happen to him?\" asked Stephen, in alarm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You seem anxious,\" said Paul, keenly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t trifle with me, boy. Tell me what happened to him. As you\u0027ve told part of the story you may as well tell the rest.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He proved to be no Quaker at all,\" said Paul. \"If he was a friend of yours, as I conclude, I think you will have a chance to see him in court to-morrow.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Arrested!\" gasped Stephen, in dismay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, his plan didn\u0027t succeed. It is probably a disappointment to him and to you, but it serves you both right for conspiring against a boy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who said I had anything to do with it?\" asked Stephen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You have let it out yourself. I don\u0027t want any further proof.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"After this base conspiracy against your step-brother, Stephen Palmer,\" said the widow, with dignity, \"I hope you will have the decency to stay away. Had you behaved with any decent regard to the tie that exists between us, I would not say this——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ll repent this, Mrs. Palmer!\" said Stephen,[Pg 134] his face showing the malice he felt. \"You treat me like a dog, you and your son there. I\u0027ll be even with you yet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He left the room and the house, slamming the door behind him, but he did not renew his demand for money.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83088.html","bookId":282,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:40:14 AM"}
