You\u0027re crazy not letting them take you to the ER.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like hell,\" Lozano said. \"Look at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I didn\u0027t he grabbed my jaw and twisted my face toward his, took a penlight from his pocket and shined it in my eyes. He grunted, put the penlight away, and dug his fingers around my scalp at various points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax. My patients never complain.\" He withdrew his hands. \"You start feeling dizzy or nauseous, get your ass to the hospital. Otherwise go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got to see—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t even try seeing George, ese. Not tonight. I told Erainya the same thing. Brooke Army Medical Center won\u0027t let you close to him even if you go down there. Best-case scenario he\u0027ll be in surgery until dawn, ICU for at least two or three days. You want to see him tomorrow, go home and rest tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made me promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s one other thing,\" Lozano said. \"Got a message for you from one of the homicide dicks. Lady named DeLeon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said to tell you she couldn\u0027t be here tonight. It\u0027s not her call. But she also said you should phone her. She said it might be time to talk. That make sense to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paramedics were now moving a full body bag down the front steps of the house. The crime-scene photographers were wrapping up their work on the peripheries, taking down the floodlights from around Hector Mara\u0027s Ford Galaxie where it sat parked at the end of the block. There was still no media on the scene. Just another West Side homicide, I thought bitterly. What\u0027s the hurry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever did this,\" Lozano said softly, \"these same people have any reason to be pissed off with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him and didn\u0027t see a friend. I saw a whole lot of deaths in his eyes, a whole lot of scalpels cutting impersonally through cold muscle. It was somehow reassuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they don\u0027t yet,\" I told him, \"just give me a couple of days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya knows best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe will often tell me this. The fact that it is frequently true does nothing to help my annoyance level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning I decided she was truly insane. She called me at eight-thirty, succinctly gave me the update that George was in a coma from blood loss, his condition still critical. Then she insisted I stick with our original plans — Jem was going to his kindergarten visit today and by God I was going to take him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ, Erainya. George—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—is the reason you\u0027re taking Jem,\" she finished. \"I\u0027ll be down at the hospital. Me and Jenny from the title office already got the rotation list worked out for a vigil, two people at a time. We\u0027ve already got more help than we need, honey. You and Kelly go tonight, ten to midnight. Just be ready for kindergarten in half an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I\u0027d growled yes and hung up the phone and spent a few minutes wondering why I\u0027d given in, I realized maybe her request wasn\u0027t so crazy after all. Maybe the annoyance she\u0027d succeeded in provoking was better than other feelings I might\u0027ve been consumed with. Maybe taking Jem to kindergarten the morning after we\u0027d all been up until two, attending the possibly fatal shooting of a mutual friend, was better than anything else I might\u0027ve spent the morning doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy nine Jem and I were driving through Monte Vista in a car that was even more absurd than our situation — George Berton\u0027s precious baby, his 70 Barracuda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat too had been Erainya\u0027s idea. After my accident last night, she\u0027d pointed out, I needed a car, a temporary loaner, and Erainya just happened to know where George kept his spare keys. She didn\u0027t offer her own car to me. Go figure. I\u0027d never driven the \u0027Cuda before — never done more than glimpse it while Berton performed his holy rituals under the hood with a chamois cloth and a lug wrench and an oil can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car had nothing in common with the VW except color, age, and ragtop. The dash was polished oak. The stick shift and bucket seats were covered in black leather. A gilded Virgen de Guadalupe statuette hung from the rearview mirror. The disc brakes responded to the lightest tap and the monstrous 440 motor purred like a tigress under the shaker hood. I couldn\u0027t drive the thing without hearing War\u0027s \"Low Rider\" in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pulled over at the corner of East Craig and McCullough, outside the private school that swallowed up most of the block. The campus was a series of renovated mansions on a hill, shaded with live oaks, the thick green lawns immaculate. The kindergarten building was a plantation-style carriage house on the corner, directly above us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem and I watched kids on the playground — scampering over the jungle gym, swinging, playing on the monkey bars. The kids all looked happy. The teachers in the yard all looked happy. I felt like I should look happy too but I knew I damn well might start screaming any minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might like it here,\" I told Jem. \"Nice play structure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dressed in khaki pants and a little green polo shirt that made his dark skin glow. His hair was newly cut into a bowl of black. He pressed the creases in the top of his lunch bag over and over. He hadn\u0027t said much on the way over — a short treatise on breakfast-cereal toys, a few questions about the Barracuda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose questions stopped as soon as George\u0027s name came up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ready?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem nodded again, with no enthusiasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked up to the white-columned porch of the carriage-house kindergarten building and did a lot of handshaking with a pale blond woman in a willowy dress. Mrs. Something-or-Other. Her name started with T and had about seven syllables and I felt very inadequate when I heard the kindergartners rattling it off effortlessly. She wore a lot of perfume. Jem was mostly interested in her necklace — one of those primary-teacher specials with little ceramic animals and multicolored alphabet letters designed to capture the attention of twenty kindergartners at a time. Even I had an overwhelming urge to fondle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re so pleased to have you here today,\" Mrs. T. told us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe called over a sandy-haired kid named Travis and introduced him to Jem. Thirty seconds later Jem and Travis were in line to play wall ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you at one-thirty?\" Mrs. T. asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m supposed to leave him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled patiently, like she was used to hearing that question. \"Well, it\u0027s better for him, to interact with the children, you know—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled some more, then excused herself to go greet another pair of visitors — an ample redheaded woman with an equally redheaded, overweight child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back against the fence and watched Jem play. It was the first time I\u0027d seen him with a group of his peers. He\u0027d never been in day care, never had anybody at his birthday parties who was under thirty, yet he seemed perfectly at home. Ten kids were now involved in his wall ball game. Jem and Travis were rewriting the rules so more could play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard,\" a woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over. It was the redheaded woman who\u0027d just dropped off her kid. I tried to match her sympathetic smile. \"What\u0027s hard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leaving your child — it\u0027s hard, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth, tried to form an explanation about my non-relationship to Jem, then just nodded. The mother patted my arm in camaraderie and drifted away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at the kindergarten teacher. She was crouching to talk face-to-face with yet another visitor, a pale child with messed-up hair and an untucked shirt. My stomach twisted when I recognized him. It was Michael Brandon, Aaron and Ines\u0027s kid. His mother was standing over him, trying to fix his cowlicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes wore her usual earth tones — a tan and chocolate quilt jacket over white blouse, khakis, cord sandals. Her ancho-colored hair was tied back in a butterfly clasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe teacher tried to coax a smile out of Michael. When that didn\u0027t work, she called a kindergartner over. Neither Michael nor the other kid looked thrilled about the pair-up, but Michael reluctantly allowed the boy to lead him onto the playground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Michael approached the wall ball game, Jem zeroed in on him and came over grinning. Jem knew a fellow newbie when he saw one. He took Michael\u0027s hand and started explaining the rules of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes Brandon saw me as she turned to leave. She hesitated, then continued walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her down the steps, past a few other parents. Halfway to the curb, I caught her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned with a prepackaged smile. \"If it isn\u0027t the P.I. Don\u0027t tell me — you happen to work at the kindergarten, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa. I\u0027m just dropping off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled her elbow away. \"Oh, por favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously. Kid in the green shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed out Jem, who was now whacking the ball against the wallboard. Michael was on his team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes appraised me skeptically. She held up one hand to block the sun, her fingers making shadow bars across her nose. \"I\u0027m trying to decide whether you\u0027d rent a kid just to have an excuse to follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my boss\u0027s son. And don\u0027t give her any ideas about renting him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes let her shoulders relax just a little, dropped her hand. \"I\u0027ll assume you\u0027re telling the truth. I don\u0027t know why. But don\u0027t expect an apology.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My expectations in that department are low. How\u0027s your move coming along?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed past me, toward the playground. \"Del was generous — a whole three days to pack. I\u0027ve leased an apartment on\" — she stopped herself — \"near Woodlawn Lake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why this school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The public schools in this neighborhood...\" She shook her head. \"I went through a poor school system like that. No way my son is going to. I want to be out of San Antonio by next fall, but if I can\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027ll you do for money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my problem.\" She tugged the sleeves of her quilt jacket over her wrists. The right cuff had a black smudge on it — maybe mascara. \"As long as I find Michael someplace safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safe.\" I thought about Michael\u0027s sheet cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. Now if you\u0027ll excuse me. It\u0027s been a treat, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have a lot of packing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Packed the sheet cave yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes heated to the temperature of espresso. She stepped forward, put her hand on my chest, and gave one hard push.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Basta ya,\" she hissed. \"I\u0027ve let you into my house twice. That doesn\u0027t give you the right—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speak softly,\" I warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the back fence, Mrs. T., the kindergarten teacher, was watching us, smiling nervously, probably making mental notes for the boys\u0027 admissions files. The kindergartners continued to play. Swings creaked. The ball pounded off the backboard in Jem and Michael\u0027s game. A little girl at the top of the blue and beige play-structure tower was pounding her feet on the metal, yelling that she was the queen and nobody could get her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have any idea,\" Ines told me. \"You don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like keeping a routine for my son\u0027s sake. Getting him up every morning. Getting him dressed and fed. You don\u0027t know how hard it was just getting him here today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asking for sympathy?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-king-of-texas-tres-navarre-3/page-28.html","bookId":2418,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:40 AM"}
