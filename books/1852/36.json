I lied about Helena, too. I haven\u0027t taken her place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith shook her head. \"But you\u0027re Alec\u0027s wife now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t mean we all pretend Helena never existed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Edith nodded, Jamie whispered, \"It\u0027s painful for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Edith whispered. \"I was sure he didn\u0027t care. They weren\u0027t married long, milady. There wasn\u0027t even time to bring her daughter—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t meant to shout, but Edith\u0027s casual y spoken words so startled her that she could barely keep her expression contained. \"Father Murdock said Alec and Helena were married only two months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith nodded. \"Alec was pledged to Annie,\" she said. \"King Edgar changed his mind. Annie… well , she wasn\u0027t growing up quick enough, and Helena had just lost her husband. His name was Kevin. He died protecting his king. Helena was swol en with Kevin\u0027s child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie almost fel down. Marcus grabbed hold of her arm to steady her. \"Are you ill , milady?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not ill ,\" Jamie countered. \"I\u0027m bloody furious. Edith, how long was Helena wed to Kevin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, tel me about this child,\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had a daughter,\" Edith announced. \"Helena was waiting for Alec\u0027s return to go and get her. The little girl was being cared for by Kevin\u0027s mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith led Jamie over to the table when her mistress announced she needed to sit down. \"You are ill ,\" Edith stammered out. \"I\u0027ve caused you to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hel , no one tel s me anything,\" Jamie shouted. \"My mother was carrying me when she wed my stepfather. And if you think I\u0027l let that—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie finally got hold of her emotions. She noticed the soldiers worried expressions. She took a deep, calming breath, then managed a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edith and I have settled this little dispute. We\u0027re both sorry you had to witness our unladylike conduct. Now, then, I don\u0027t want either of you to mention this to Alec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d only embarrass us and irritate him. Isn\u0027t that right, Edith?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for Edith\u0027s quick nod, then said, \"Edith, you will continue to see to the household matters. I would like to help you every now and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you think we might have something other than mutton for dinner tonight? I do hate mutton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith smiled. Her eyes fil ed with tears again. \"What is this daughter\u0027s name?\" Jamie asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary Kathleen,\" Edith answered. \"Kevin\u0027s family has some Irish blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary is also my sister\u0027s name,\" Jamie said, smiling. \"And how old is this child now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three years,\" Edith answered. \"I haven\u0027t seen my niece since the birthing. I heard Kevin\u0027s mother died three months past. A distant relation takes care of Mary now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took all of Jamie\u0027s determination not to let her anger show. Edith looked as if she wanted to cry again, and Jamie didn\u0027t have time to soothe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind was busy racing with her plans. \"There is much for the two of us to discuss, cousin, but later, after you\u0027ve repaired your hair, will be soon enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat remark accomplished Jamie\u0027s goal. Edith immediately bounded to her feet. \"My hair has come undone?\" she asked, clearly appalled. She patted the sides of her crown while she waited for an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little,\" Jamie told her, trying not to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith made a curtsy, then rushed out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie let out a long sigh. \"You\u0027ve had quite a day, Jamie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin remarked. \"First you battle a fire and then you battle a determined woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actual y, I battled a fat boar, then Alec, then the fire, and last, Edith,\" she corrected with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A boar? You battled with a boar?\" Gavin shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just jesting with you,\" she admitted. As soon as Gavin lost some of his angry expression, she told him what happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d finished, she couldn\u0027t help but notice how incredulous the warriors looked. \"So you see, I didn\u0027t actually battle the boar. I just got in his way. Do you know this child? His name is Lindsay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin had to sit down before giving her answer. \"We know of his clan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, Jamie,\" Marcus began, \"his father is a powerful—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ruthless,\" Gavin interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laird,\" Marcus finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have gotten yourself kil ed,\" Gavin shouted as he bounded back to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t censure her, Gavin,\" Marcus countered. \"I\u0027m sure Alec must have—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t exactly tel him,\" Jamie interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men let her know what they thought of that sin. \"Quit your scowls,\" Jamie ordered. \"I promised that child I wouldn\u0027t be tel ing on him. I see no reason to tel Alec what happened. He\u0027l only worry. I\u0027l have your word on this, Gavin. Yours, too, Marcus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth warriors immediately agreed. Neither, of course, meant to honor her request, but they wanted to appease her now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did anything else happen that you\u0027ve forgotten to mention?\" Gavin drawled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me time,\" Jamie countered. \"The day\u0027s not half done, if you\u0027l remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin smiled, and miracle of miracles, Marcus smiled again, too. \"It has been quite a morning,\" she said with a sigh. \"Marcus, do you know where Mary Kathleen is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Is it a fair distance away from here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three hours\u0027 ride,\" he stated with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027d best get started right away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon, milady?\" Marcus asked. He turned to give Gavin a puzzled look, wondering if he\u0027d understood their mistress\u0027s announcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie had already disappeared behind the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027l leave at once,\" she called out. She peeked around the corner. \"You wouldn\u0027t mind taking me, would you, Marcus? \u0027Tis the truth, even with proper directions, I would probably get lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" Marcus asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To see my daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a lie, of course, for Jamie had no intention of merely seeing her daughter. She couldn\u0027t very well tel the soldiers the full truth, however, not if she wanted to gain their cooperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, she guessed they\u0027d find out soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Kathleen was coming home where she belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec\u0027s patience was nearing the shouting point. He blamed his ill temper on the fact that the early afternoon training session wasn\u0027t going at all well .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was teeth-grinding, frustrating work, for he was now instructing the younger, unseasoned warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung David, Laird Timothy\u0027s second son, bore the brunt of Alec\u0027s frustration. The boy didn\u0027t seem to get any better, no matter how long he trained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec knocked David and his sword to the ground for the third time, using the back of his bare hand to add humiliation to his lesson in defense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u0027s weapon went flying. It would have found a target in another soldier\u0027s leg if the older warrior hadn\u0027t sidestepped just in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should kil you now and be done with it,\" Alec roared at the boy. \"David, you won\u0027t last five minutes in true battle unless you learn to pay attention to what you\u0027re doing. And hold on to your weapon, for God\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the yel ow-haired warrior could respond to that criticism, Alec hauled him to his feet. He had David by the throat now, thinking he might just strangle a bit of good sense into his head one way or another. When David\u0027s freckled face turned blotchy, Alec knew he had his full attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec?\" one of the soldiers called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec tossed David to the ground before turning to the soldier. He noticed the silence then. His soldiers had all quit their tasks without gaining his permission. That fact settled in his mind a scant second before he realized they were all staring at the top of the hil .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew before he turned around that Jamie was somehow responsible for this interruption. She was the only one who could cause such astonishment in his usual y disciplined older soldiers, the only one to incite such chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to brace himself, then thought he was prepared for just about anything, yet the sight of his wife riding down the hil on Wildfire\u0027s back did take his breath away. She was riding bareback, her hair flying out behind her, and Alec was afraid to move lest he startle her. She\u0027d surely fal to the ground then and break her stubborn neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rode like a queen. Even from the distance separating them, Alec could see her soft, beguiling smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWildfire trotted down toward the slope where Alec and his men waited. Gavin and Marcus rode their mounts behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec motioned Jamie over to his side with an arrogant wave of his hand. Though he was determined to hold on to his anger over her rude interruption of his duties, he was finding it a difficult endeavor. Pride kept getting in the way of his goal, his pride in his wife\u0027s horsemanship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lost his anger altogether when he spotted the bow and quiver of arrows slung over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried not to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie obeyed her husband\u0027s command without any visible movement on the reins. She stopped Wildfire by using the pressure of her knees to give her command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec suddenly wanted to feel the pressure of her knees around him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you think you\u0027re going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Riding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With bow and arrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Jamie answered, wondering over the irritation in her husband\u0027s voice. \"One must always be prepared for any eventuality,\" she added. \"I might also do a spot of hunting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis moods were as unpredictable as the wind, she decided, for now he looked as if he wanted to laugh at her. There was a definite sparkle in his eyes. She heard several loud chuckles from the crowd of soldiers gathered in front of her, glared at the offenders for being so rude, and then turned back to Alec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you, wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t hit the side of our stables,\" Alec announced. \"Yet you think to kil a moving target?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have more faith in your wife,\" Jamie muttered as she slowly slipped the curved bow from her shoulder and reached for one of her arrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was high time she set the man straight, she decided. Jamie had noticed a brown hide anchored to the large bale of hay farther down the slope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a good fifteen arrows clustered around the center of the hide. She motioned to the target, then said, \"Wil you let me hunt if I prove my skil to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus coughed, obviously trying to disguise his laughter. Jamie turned to frown at him while she waited for her husband to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would not let you disgrace yourself so in front of my men,\" Alec announced. He wanted to goad her temper with his insolent remark, knew he\u0027d accomplished that goal when she turned back to him. She looked as if she wanted to strangle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t disgrace myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the audacity to grin at her. \"Kindly get out of my way, husband,\" she ordered. \"You may laugh later,\" she snapped when she saw how much trouble he was having restraining himself. \"If you feel so inclined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec nodded, then backed several feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Jamie fit her arrow to her bow, the soldiers started running for safety. Jamie guessed they didn\u0027t have much faith in her ability, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWildfire\u0027s head kept getting in her way. Jamie let out a sigh. She slipped off her shoes, then stood up on the mare\u0027s back, balancing herself as graceful y as a dancer. She took aim and shot her arrow a second before Alec reached her side. Jamie sat back down on Wildfire\u0027s back, patted her horse soundly for standing so stil , and then smiled at Alec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now why are you angry?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will never take such chances again, wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shout nearly ripped Wildfire\u0027s mane apart. The horse immediately tried to bolt, but Alec grabbed the reins and had Wildfire docile in little time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t help but notice that Jamie never lost her balance or showed the least amount of fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you ranting about?\" Jamie asked. \"What chance did I take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could tel from her expression she really didn\u0027t know why he was upset with her. He took a deep breath, trying to regain his control. When she\u0027d stood up, his heart had stopped beating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have kil ed yourself,\" he muttered between clenched teeth. \"If anyone\u0027s going to kil you, it\u0027s going to be me. Don\u0027t ever stand on your mount\u0027s back again. Not ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m used to riding that way when the mood strikes me, Alec. While she gal ops through a meadow I do sometimes stand up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tis the truth,\" she said. \"Would you like me to show—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t yel at me, Alec. It\u0027s upsetting Wildfire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s you I want upset, wife,\" Alec returned. \"Give me your word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all right, then,\" Jamie said. \"I give you my word. Are you happy now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then please remove your hand from my leg. Your grip is painful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wife, do you know how close you are to real jeopardy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t look at all worried by that threat. \"Alec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long have you had that tic in your cheek?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her arrow ain\u0027t near the others,\" the young soldier named David called out. The eager boy picked up Jamie\u0027s shoes and offered them to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie thanked him and quickly put them on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course my arrow isn\u0027t near the others,\" she told the soldier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew you\u0027d miss?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t miss,\" she countered. \"You\u0027l find my arrow in the very center. Go and fetch it for me please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid ran back down the hil to the target. He let out a whoop of laughter. \"She\u0027s right,\" he shouted. \"Her arrow is in the center.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie was watching Alec when that statement was shouted. She ignored the men\u0027s cheers. Her husband\u0027s reaction was a little disappointing.
