It’s obvious. And now, things could get even worse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Worse?” I say. “Worse than killing most of the Abnegation? How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The government has been threatening to shut down the experiments for almost a year now,” Nita says. “The experiments keep falling apart because the communities can’t live in peace, and David keeps finding ways to restore peace just in the nick of time. And if anything else goes wrong in Chicago, he can do it again. He can reset all the experiments at any time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reset them,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With the Abnegation memory serum,” Reggie says. “Well, really, it’s the Bureau’s memory serum. Every man, woman, and child will have to begin again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNita says tersely, “Their entire lives erased, against their will, for the sake of solving a genetic damage ‘problem’ that doesn’t actually exist. These people have the power to do that. And no one should have that power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember the thought I had, after Johanna told me about the Amity administering the memory serum to Dauntless patrols—that when you take a person’s memories, you change who they are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I don’t care what Nita’s plan is, as long as it means striking the Bureau as hard as we can. What I have learned in the past few days has made me feel like there is nothing about this place worth salvaging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the plan?” says Tris, her voice flat, almost mechanical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll let my friends from the fringe in through the underground tunnel,” Nita says. “Tobias, you will shut off the security system as I do, so that we aren’t caught—it’s nearly the same technology you worked with in the Dauntless control room; it should be easy for you. Then Rafi, Mary, and I will break into the Weapons Lab and steal the memory serum so the Bureau can’t use it. Reggie’s been helping behind the scenes, but he’ll be opening the tunnel for us on the day of the attack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What will you do with a bunch of memory serum?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Destroy it,” Nita says, even-keeled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel strange, empty like a deflated balloon. I don’t know what I had in mind when Nita talked about her plan, but it wasn’t this—this feels so small, so passive as an act of retaliation against the people responsible for the attack simulation, the people who told me that there was something wrong with me at my very core, in my genetic code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all you intend to do,” Tris says, finally looking away from the microscope. She narrows her eyes at Nita. “You know that the Bureau is responsible for the murders of hundreds of people, and your plan is to . . . take away their memory serum?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t remember inviting your critique of my plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not critiquing your plan,” Tris says. “I’m telling you I don’t believe you. You hate these people. I can tell by the way you talk about them. Whatever you intend to do, I think it’s far worse than stealing some serum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The memory serum is what they use to keep the experiments running. It’s their greatest source of power over your city, and I want to take it away. I’d say that’s a hard enough blow for now.” Nita sounds gentle, like she’s explaining something to a child. “I never said this was all I was ever going to do. It’s not always wise to strike as hard as you can at the first opportunity. This is a long race, not a sprint.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTris just shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tobias, are you in?” Nita says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look from Tris, with her tense, stiff posture, to Nita, who is relaxed, ready. I don’t see whatever Tris sees, or hear it. And when I think about saying no, I feel like my body will collapse in on itself. I have to do something. Even if it feels small, I have to do something, and I don’t understand why Tris doesn’t feel the same desperation inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I say. Tris turns to me, her eyes wide, incredulous. I ignore her. “I can disable the security system. I’ll need some Amity peace serum, do you have access to that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do.” Nita smiles a little. “I’ll send you a message with the timing. Come on, Reggie. Let’s leave these two to . . . talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReggie nods to me, and then to Tris, and then he and Nita both leave the room, easing the door closed behind them so it doesn’t make a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTris turns to me, her arms folded like two bars across her body, keeping me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you,” she said. “She’s lying. Why can’t you see that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because it’s not there,” I say. “I can tell when someone’s lying just as well as you can. And in this situation, I think your judgment might be clouded by something else. Something like jealousy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not jealous!” she says, scowling at me. “I am being smart. She has something bigger planned, and if I were you, I would run far away from anyone who lies to me about what they want me to participate in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you’re not me.” I shake my head. “God, Tris. These people murdered your parents, and you’re not going to do something about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never said I wasn’t going to do anything,” she says tersely. “But I don’t have to buy into the first plan I hear, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, I brought you here because I wanted to be honest with you, not so that you could make snap judgments about people and tell me what to do!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember what happened last time you didn’t trust my ‘snap judgments’?” Tris says coldly. “You found out that I was right. I was right about Edith Prior’s video changing everything, and I was right about Evelyn, and I’m right about this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. You’re always right,” I say. “Were you right about running into dangerous situations without weapons? Were you right about lying to me and going on a death march to Erudite headquarters in the middle of the night? Or about Peter, were you right about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t throw those things in my face.” She points at me, and I feel like I’m a child getting lectured by a parent. “I never said I was perfect, but you—you can’t even see past your own desperation. You went along with Evelyn because you were desperate for a parent, and now you’re going along with this because you’re desperate not to be damaged—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word shivers through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not damaged,” I say quietly. “I can’t believe you have so little faith in me that you would tell me not to trust myself.” I shake my head. “And I don’t need your permission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start toward the door, and as my hand closes around the handle, she says, “Just leaving so that you can have the last word, that’s really mature!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So is being suspicious of someone’s motives just because she’s pretty,” I say. “I guess we’re even.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not a desperate, unsteady child who throws his trust around. I am not damaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTRIS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI TOUCH MY forehead to the eyepiece of the microscope. The serum swims before me, orange-brown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so busy looking for Nita’s lies that I barely registered the truth: In order to get their hands on this serum, the Bureau must have developed it, and somehow delivered it to Jeanine to use. I pull away. Why would Jeanine work with the Bureau when she so badly wanted to stay in the city, away from them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I guess the Bureau and Jeanine shared a common goal. Both wanted the experiment to continue. Both were terrified of what would happen if it didn’t. Both were willing to sacrifice innocent lives to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought this place could be home. But the Bureau is full of killers. I rock back on my heels as if pushed back by some invisible force, then walk out of the room, my heart beating fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore the few people dawdling in the corridor in front of me. I just push farther into the Bureau compound, farther and farther into the belly of the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe this place could be home, I hear myself saying to Christina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese people murdered your parents, Tobias’s words echo in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know where I’m going except that I need space, and air. I clutch my ID in my hand and half walk, half run past the security barrier to the sculpture. There is no light shining into the tank now, though the water still falls from it, one drop for every second that passes. I stand for a little while, watching it. And then, across the slab of stone, I see my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right?” he says tentatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not all right. I was beginning to feel that I had finally found a place to stay, a place that was not so unstable or corrupt or controlling that I could actually belong there. You would think that I would have learned by now—such a place does not exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts to move around the stone block, toward me. “What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it.” I laugh. “Let me put it this way: I just found out you’re not the worst person I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop into a crouch and push my fingers through my hair. I feel numb and terrified of my own numbness. The Bureau is responsible for my parents’ deaths. Why do I have to keep repeating it to myself to believe it? What’s wrong with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” he says. “I’m . . . sorry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I can manage is a small grunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what Mom told me once?” he says, and the way he says Mom, like he didn’t betray her, sets my teeth on edge. “She said that everyone has some evil inside them, and the first step to loving anyone is to recognize the same evil in ourselves, so we’re able to forgive them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what you want me to do?” I say dully as I stand. “I may have done bad things, Caleb, but I would never deliver you to your own execution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t say that,” he says, and it sounds like he’s pleading with me, begging me to say that I am just like him, no better. “You didn’t know how persuasive Jeanine was—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething inside me snaps like a brittle rubber band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI punch him in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I can think about is how the Erudite stripped me of my watch and my shoes and led me to the bare table where they would take my life. A table that Caleb may as well have set up himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I was beyond this kind of anger, but as he stumbles back with his hands on his face, I pursue him, grabbing the front of his shirt and slamming him against the stone sculpture and screaming that he is a coward and a traitor and that I will kill him, I will kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the guards comes toward me, and all she has to do is put her hand on my arm and the spell is broken. I release Caleb’s shirt. I shake out my stinging hand. I turn and walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a beige sweater draped over the empty chair in Matthew’s lab, the sleeve brushing the floor. I’ve never met his supervisor. I’m beginning to suspect that Matthew does all the real work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on top of the sweater and examine my knuckles. A few of them are split from punching Caleb, and dotted with faint bruises. It seems fitting that the blow would leave a mark on both of us. That’s how the world works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night, when I went back to the dormitory, Tobias wasn’t there, and I was too angry to sleep. In the hours that I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, I decided that while I wasn’t going to participate in Nita’s plan, I also wasn’t going to stop it. The truth about the attack simulation brewed hate for the Bureau inside me, and I want to watch it break apart from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew is talking science. I’m having trouble paying attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—doing some genetic analysis, which is fine, but before, we were developing a way to make the memory compound behave as a virus,” he says. “With the same rapid replication, the same ability to spread through the air. And then we developed a vaccination for it. Just a temporary one, only lasts for forty-eight hours, but still.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “So . . . you were making it so you could set up other city experiments more efficiently, right?” I say. “No need to inject everyone with the memory serum when you can just release it and let it spread.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly!” He seems excited that I’m actually interested in what he’s saying. “And it’s a better model for having the option to select particular members of a population to opt out—you inoculate them, the virus spreads within twenty-four hours, and it has no effect on them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?” Matthew says, his coffee mug poised near his mouth. He puts it down. “I heard the security guards had to pull you off someone last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was my brother. Caleb.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah.” Matthew raises an eyebrow. “What did he do this time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing, really.” I pinch the sweater sleeve between my fingers. Its edges are all fraying, wearing with time. “I was wired to explode anyway; he just got in the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already know, by looking at him, the question he’s asking, and I want to explain it all to him, everything that Nita showed me and told me. I wonder if I can trust him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard something yesterday,” I say, testing the waters. “About the Bureau. About my city, and the simulations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightens up and gives me a strange look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you hear that something from Nita?” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. How did you know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve helped her a couple times,” he says. “I let her into that storage room. Did she tell you anything else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew is Nita’s informant? I stare at him. I never thought that Matthew, who went out of his way to show me the difference between my “pure” genes and Tobias’s “damaged” genes, might be helping Nita. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allegiant-divergent-3/page-24.html","bookId":1700,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:52 AM"}
