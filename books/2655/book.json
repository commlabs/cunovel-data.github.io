But Tsar Alexander III forbids women to attend medical school; his interest in Katerina extends only to her ability to raise the dead. Twice now, Katerina has helped him by using her power to thwart the forces of darkness—vampires bent on resurrecting the lich tsar Konstantin Pavlovich so that he can take what he sees as his rightful place on the throne. Katerina thought she had bound Konstantin to the Greylands, the realm of the dead, but he has found a way out. Now he is searching for the Morning Star, a sword that will allow him to command a legion of supernatural warriors. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eKaterina must find the sword before Konstantin does—and she must travel to Egypt to do so. Along the way, she puts up with unwanted attention from her former fiancé, the nefarious Prince Danilo, and struggles with her feelings for her true love, George Alexandrovich. But with the looming threat from Konstantin, Katerina\u0027s focus remains on the sword. Russia\u0027s fate will be determined by whoever wields the Morning Star—and delivers the final blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-morning-star-katerina-3.jpg","author":"Robin Bridges","type":"Historical","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:43 AM"}
