Only a few more things to take care of before she could go—before she started something she couldn\u0027t stop.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Someone approached the clean room, heavy footfalls that could only be a Spartan inMJOLNIR armor. Kelly appeared and waved from the other side of the glass partition thatseparated the clean room from the rest of Medical Four. Dr. Halsey buzzed her in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Reporting for treatment, Doctor,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly hesitated a moment as she glanced about at the unsterile environment the doctorhad been working in: Styrofoam cups littered the surgical instrument trays, thermalprintout paper curled from the biomonitors—and\u0026nbsp; the radiation-emitting crystal they hadfound on Reach sat on a nearby instrument tray.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I thought that crystal was in the reactor room,\" Kelly said. \"Behind plenty of radiationshielding.\"\"It\u0027s perfectly safe,\" Dr. Halsey said, \"as long as we\u0027re in nor.mal space.\" She picked upthe crystal and slipped it carelessly into her lab coat pocket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lie down please, Kelly.\" The doctor gestured to the con.toured treatment chair. \"Just afew more injections and we\u0027re done with your burn therapy.\"Kelly sighed and eased herself onto the reclined chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ERIC NYLUND273Dr. Halsey removed a cloth covering a pair of injectors. She clicked them into the ports onKelly\u0027s MJOLNIR armor ports that threaded directly into her subclavian and femoralveins. \"Keep doing your ph sical therapy, and\u0026nbsp; the dermacortic steroids will remove mostof the scarring and restore yyyour full mobility within another week,\" she explained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A week?\" Kelly growled and struggled to rise. \"Doctor, I need to be one hundred percentASAP. The Chief has a mission—\"Dr. Halsey activated the injectors, and they hissed their con.tents into Kelly\u0027s body.

You\u0027re goingon mine.\"The sedative in her bloodstream would knock out an ODST in peak condition for thebetter part of a day. Halsey estimated that Kelly would be unconscious for a little morethan two hours. By that time they\u0027d both be far\u0026nbsp; enough along that there\u0027d be no turn.ingback.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey swiveled one of the displays to face her. She exe.cuted the memory-erasecommand—wiping clean Cor\u0027tanas recollection of the research they had done on old ONIlockdown codes. She folded the printout of their results and stuffed it into her pocket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Cortana?\"\"Yes, Doctor?\" she replied. Her voice through the room\u0027s speakers sounded distracted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Locate Corporal Locklear and have him report immediately, please.\"\"Done, Doctor Halsey.\"\"Thank you, Cortana. That will be all.\" She added in a whisper so low that only she heard:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Take good care of them all for me.\"Dr. Halsey adjusted the examination table so it lay flat, and then loaded medical suppliesand equipment onto its undercar.riage. She placed a bag with four submachine guns andsixteen full clips of ammunition on top of the supplies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She found a lukewarm cup of stale coffee and gulped it down to the dregs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Corporal Locklear appeared at the open entrance to the prep room. \"Hey, Doc. Cortanasaid you needed me?\" he said tersely.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 274HALO: FIRST STRIKEHe smoothed his hand over his shaved head. \"I\u0027m kind of busy right now, so if this canwait—\"\"Whatever you\u0027re doing,\" Dr. Halsey told him, \"this is more important.\" She nodded toKelly\u0027s prone form. \"I need your help getting SPARTAN-087 to the launch bay.\"\"Is she okay?\" he asked and took a step toward her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s fine, but I have to transfer her to the asteroid base. They have a piece of equipmentnecessary to complete her treatment.\"Locklear appeared unconvinced. \"But I just saw her—\"\"She\u0027s fine,\" Dr. Halsey assured him. \"Just sedated. This pro.cedure is... unpleasant, evenfor a Spartan.\"Locklear looked into Dr. Halsey\u0027s eyes and then nodded, ac.cepting this explanation. Hemoved the head of the table and wheeled it through the doors, the med bay, and out intothe wait.ing elevator.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey followed on his heels.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the elevator doors closed, she turned to the Corporal. \"Your hand, please.\"He looked puzzled but held out his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey took it and turned it palm-up. She set the long, lu.minous blue artifact in hisgrasp. The light emitted by the alien artifact shone onto their faces and made the interiorof the eleva.tor colder. \"This is what the\u0026nbsp; Covenant so desperately want. They tore upReach to get it. They followed us into Slipspace. And Po-laski died protecting this thing.\"She watched Locklear carefully, gauging his reaction, and saw that he pulled away slightlyat this last remark; it had hit home.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what the hell am I supposed to do with it?\"\"Keep it safe,\" she told him. \"Guard it with your life, because if the Covenant ever get it,they\u0027ll be able to jump through Slipspace a hundred times faster than they can now. Doyou understand?\"Locklear closed his large fist around the crystal. \"Not really, Doc. But I can take care of it.\" He paused and wrinkled his forehead in confusion. \"But why me? Why not ask one ofyour Spartans?\"\" \u0027My\u0027 Spartans,\" Dr. Halsey replied in a whisper, \"could be ordered to hand it over toLieutenant Haverson. And he\u0027d riskERIC NYLUND275etting it back to ONI Section Three—even if he had to gamble that the Covenant mightggget it.\"Locklear snorted. \"Well, as much as I don\u0027t like El-Tee White-bread, I\u0027d hand it over ifordered, too. What\u0027s the big deal, any.way? We\u0027re almost home.\"\"Almost,\" Dr. Halsey repeated, and she gave him a slight smile. \"But the moment youjump, this crystal emits radiation like a signal flare. The Covenant will find this ship ... andmaybe this time they\u0027ll win the battle in\u0026nbsp; Slipspace.\"Locklear grimaced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She held his steely gaze a moment and then finally let go of his hand. \"So I know you\u0027ll dowhatever it takes to prevent this object from falling into enemy hands.\"He nodded grimly. \"I read you, Doc. Loud and clear.\" There was a hint of respect in hisvoice. \"I know what I have to do ... count on it.\"\"Good,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The elevator doors parted. Locklear stuffed the crystal into his ammunition vest, andLocklear wheeled the table into the Gettysburg\u0027s launch bay. \"Where do you want her?\"The bay was a beehive of activity: A hundred of Governor Jiles\u0027s crew jogged to and from passages carrying data pad schematics and field multiscanners; robotic dollies carried fatArcher missiles, spiderlike Antilon mines,\u0026nbsp; and slender pods of deuterium fuel for theGettysburg\u0027s auxiliary reactors; three Longsword fighter craft were being repaired;exoskeletons thud.ded along the deck, carrying plates of titanium and welding them inplace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There,\" Dr. Halsey told Locklear. \"Take her to that ship.\" She pointed to Governor Jiles\u0027sChiroptera-class vessel. It sat on the deck looking like a sleeping bat. Its oddly angledstealth sur.faces blended into the shadows.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Locklear shrugged and pushed the loaded gurney.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Halsey halted by the ship\u0027s port hatch. It was sealed so tightly that no seam could bediscerned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She retrieved the thermal printout from her coat and rechecked its contents. She then touched a recessed button on the hull, and a tiny plate slid aside revealing an alphanumeric keyboard. Dr. Halsey typed in a long\u0026nbsp; string and pressed ENTER.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 276HALO: FIRST STRIKEThe hatch parted with a hiss.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She smiled. \"Not even Cortana could crack their crypto, in.deed.\" She waved Locklear inside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Locklear obliged her and pushed the gurney into the ship. Dr. Halsey followed, securedthe examination table, and escorted Locklear outside. She turned and headed back into the vessel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He started back toward the elevator, then halted. \"Doc, when we were talking... you saidwhen \u0027you\u0027jump to Slipspace. You meant when \u0027we\u0027jump to Slipspace, didn\u0027t you?\"Dr. Halsey locked eyes with him for a moment. Then she touched a button inside the ship,and the hatch hissed closed be.tween them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief stepped off the elevator and onto the bridge of the Gettysburg.Lieutenant Haverson and Admiral Whitcomb stared at the displays at Weapons Station One and Engineering.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sirs,\" the Chief said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Admiral waved him forward without bothering to look up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Chief had two tasks. First, he would inform the Admiral of his first-strike mission plan. He had to convince him there was no risk to their primary goal of returning to Earth—and a huge payoff if they succeeded. The\u0026nbsp; only thing Admiral Whitcomb might object towas the high risk to his team.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Chief\u0027s second task would be more difficult. He touched the belt pouch containing Dr.Halsey\u0027s data crystals. One was her analysis of the Flood infection mechanism and apossible way to block it. The second data\u0026nbsp; crystal contained the source files of thatdiscovery, and according to Dr. Halsey it would lead to Sergeant Johnson\u0027s undignified,and unnecessary, death.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And yet, if it gave Section Three a better chance to stop the Floods—if indeed that threathad any meaning after the destruc.tion of Halo—maybe it was worth one man\u0027s life.Maybe if Sergeant Johnson knew, he\u0027d\u0026nbsp; volunteer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Chief\u0027s duty was clear: He had to hand over all files to the Lieutenant—but deep down, he had to admit that it didn\u0027t feel right.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Cortana.\" Admiral Whitcomb crossed his arms over his bar.rel chest. \"Give me an update on our power.\"Cortana\u0027s tiny image flickered to life on the holopad near theERIC NYLUND277NAV station. She crossed her arms over her chest much as he had, and minute redsymbols raced over her glowing lavender skin. \"Status is nearly identical to my last reportfive minutes ago, Admiral. Tests on Ascendant\u0026nbsp; Justice\u0027s reactor and the Get.tysburg\u0027sengines are in synch, and will be completed in forty minutes.\"\"Hurry,\" the Admiral growled. \"I don\u0027t want to get stuck with.out power when unfriendlies show up. I want to get under way to Earth. Weapons status?\"\"Aye, sir,\" Cortana said. \"Plasma turret one is obliterated; no possibility of repair. Plasma turrets two, three, and four are re.paired, and although I\u0027m waiting for power to testthem, I have run three hundred twelve virtual\u0026nbsp; test-firings without incident. Turrets five,six, and seven, however, require parts Governor Jiles does not have in his inventory. Two Archer missile pods on the Gettysburg have been refilled. That gives us sixteen missiles\u0026nbsp; hot and ready to go, sir.\"\"I\u0027d like to know where Jiles go\"t those missiles,Lieutenant Haverson muttered. \"They\u0027reUNSC military contraband.\"\"He is zpirate, Lieutenant,\" Cortana said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good work,\" the Admiral told Cortana. \"Keep me posted.\" He turned toward the Chief.\"You had something, Master Chief?\"Before the Master Chief could speak his mind, Haverson said, \"Admiral.\" He pointed at theforward screens and at the Chiroptera-class ship accelerating away from the Gettysburg\u0027slaunch bay. \"I thought Jiles was staying\u0026nbsp; on board to oversee repairs.\"\"So did I,\" the Admiral said. \"Cortana, did you catch Jiles leaving on surveillance?\"\"No, sir, but you might be interested in this.\" On the screen a grainy video appeared ofLocklear, Dr. Halsey, and a Spartan on a gurney boarding the ship. \"Locklear left them atthe ship, sir. Doctor Halsey and SPARTAN- 087 departed.\"\"Cortana,\" the Admiral barked. \"Hail that ship. Now.\"\"Hailing.\"Governor Jiles appeared on forward screen number one. \"Ad.miral,\" he said with anervous smile. \"I just saw my ship leave the launch bay.

Cortana, any response toour hail?\"\"An automated code, sir,\" she said. Her mouth opened in as.tonishment. \"UNSC CodeThree-Nine-Two.\"\"Three-Nine-Two?\" the Admiral asked. He stared into space, trying to recall the obscure code.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief cleared his throat and told him, \"Admiral, that is an official\u0027nonresponse\u0027 code, sir. Special Warfare teams use it to ignore hails... due to a higher-priority mission.\"\"God damn it.\" The Admiral\u0027s face flushed, and he ground his teeth. \"You mean the goodOn the forward screen the Chiroptera, its batlike wings nearly invisible against the black doctor just told me to go to the of space, accelerated in a sudden burst.

That vital compo.nents were removed when it was decommissioned.

I ex.pect to be compensated1—\"\"You bet it\u0027s unfortunate,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"If I\u0027d known there was a chance we could have used that ship to jump to Earth... I would have done it an hour ago. Cortana,what was her trajectory?\"\"Not Earth,\" Cortana said. \"Doctor Halsey\u0027s course points to no known system in my database.\"The Admiral scrutinized the forward screen: Jiles\u0027s face, theERIC NYLUND279empty star field, and the frozen video of Dr. Halsey and Locklear in the launch bay. \"Iwant Corporal Locklear on the bridge ten minutes ago. Lieutenant Haverson, have Cortana locate him. Then I want you personally to\u0026nbsp; escort that ODST up here.\"Haverson swallowed. \"Yes, sir.\" He marched to the elevator, and Cortana told him, \"He\u0027son B-Deck, Lieutenant, medical storage. He\u0027s not answering my COM page.\" The elevator shut.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Chief, you\u0027re on the Engineering console,\" the Admiral said. \"Cover the NAV station, too.\"\"Yes, sir.\" He moved to the Engineering station\u0027s monitors. There were thirty-five minutes to go on the shakedown cycle of the reactors and engines.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Contact,\" Cortana said. \"Bearing zero-three-zero on the so.lar plane.

I bet they\u0027re just figuringout how best to kill us.\"Governor Jiles turned to someone off screen, and then said, \"Admiral Whitcomb, given this new development I would like to evacuate my people off the Gettysburg and out ofharm\u0027s way.\"\"Of course, Governor. Do what you have to.\"The number three screen snapped off, and the stars reappeared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I\u0027ll do what I have to, too,\" Admiral Whitcomb said. \"Cortana, halt the reactor and engine shakedown.\"\"Sir?

Radiation in.dicators redlined, and then dropped to a hairbreadth ... which was technically considered safe.\u0026nbsp; The Gettysburg\u0027s engines shud.dered to life. The Chief felt the vibration though the deck half a kilometer away.\"Reactors are hot, sir,\" he reported.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 280HALO: FIRST STRIKEThe Admiral watched as Jiles\u0027s fleet of single ships and tech.nicians in jet packsabandoned the Gettysburg, swarming across the dark of space back to the safety of theirasteroid. \"Rats leav.ing a sinking ship?\" he\u0026nbsp; wondered aloud.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief wasn\u0027t sure if that was a question directed at him, but he decided toreply anyway. \"They\u0027re just men who want to live, sir.\"The Admiral nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Covenant cruiser accelerating,\" Cortana announced. \"Bear.ing on a vector otrtsystem.It\u0027s transitioning to Slipspace.\"\"Master Chief, get this tub moving.

A famous siege with a handful of defenders holding off overwhelming forces.\"The Admiral smiled. \"Texan defenders, Chief—there\u0027s a big difference. Colonel William Barrett Travis with one hundred fifty-five men held off more than two thousand Mexican invaders. They hunkered down inside a tiny\u0026nbsp; fort and fought like wildcats. Travis got ahandful of reinforcements later—thirty-two men.\" The Ad.miral\u0027s smile faded. \"You know there were fifteen civilians in.side that fort, too?\" He looked at the map again.\"Well, when\u0026nbsp; theERIC NYLUND281fighting was over, Travis and his men were dead, but it cost the enemy six hundred lives.\"\"Like the Battle of Thermopylae,\" the Chief remarked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But there were survivors at the Alamo; they let the civilians live.\" He turned to the Chief.\"You think anyone\u0027s going to sur.vive this fight?

They would see him\u0026nbsp; approach.ing. Or was there a blind spot he couldapproach from? How could he hide from the rest of the ships in their fleet, though?

And I\u0027m not going to feelguilty for any of this.\"He laughed and told himself, \"It\u0027s not like the entire universeERIC NYLUND283hasn\u0027t been trying to kill me off, though.\" Locklear turned to the robotic dolly. \"Right,amigo?\"Its treads spun, and the flatbed dolly turned to the right.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no, stop.\" He sighed. \"Man, I gotta buy myself a ticket out of this outfit. Next thing, I\u0027llbe asking one of the Spartans out on a date... if I could even tell the boys from the girls inthat squad.\" He shuddered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The doors of the large cargo elevator squeaked open; Lock.lear stepped off, and whistledfor the dolly to follow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Storage Bay Two had racks and shelves that rose from the deck five meters to the ceiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He played his flashlight over the uneven surfaces. He spied a desk and terminal in thecorner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hello, inventory control,\" he said. \"The place to go for good.ies in any Navy outfit.\" Hestrode to the desk, sat down, and tapped in a search for medicinal-grade ethyl alcohol.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A tone chimed in his earpiece, and Cortana\u0027s voice said, \"Cor.poral Locklear, I have anurgent request from Admiral—\"Locklear squelched his COM. \"Enough chatter, lady,\" he murmured. \"The bar just opened.\"The location for MED34-CH3CH2OH popped on screen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"B-I-N-G-O,\"hesang.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Locklear jumped up. \"Come on, amigo. You and me are going to throw a party.\"The deck lurched under Locklear\u0027s feet. \"What the?... We\u0027re moving?\" He turned theinventory display to face him and tapped in a command to switch to external cameramode.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Craggy asteroids moved past them—no, it was the Gettysburg that was moving. Locklearsquinted and saw a flash of blue. He magnified that part of the screen and found a dozenblurry blue flares from engine cones and the pulsing lateral lines filled with plasma.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Covenant ships.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah hell,\" he said and backed away from the desk. \"So much for happy hour.\"Something moved in his vest. Locklear reached in his pocket and pulled out the crystal Dr.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Halsey entrusted to his care. The elongated stone rippled, facets moved and rearrangedlike the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He spied the same blue color on the inventory monitor—284HALO: FIRST STRIKEpinpricks of stretched space, the first indication of a Slip-space jump.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not going through another Slipspace fight,\" Locklear said through gritted teeth. \"I\u0027mnot going to let them follow us. Or let this thing shoot off a signal flare to every Covenant ship in the galaxy.\"He grabbed a can of C-7 off the dolly and dropped Dr. Halsey\u0027s crystal on the deck. He quickly covered the thing with the foam.ing explosive. It hardened to a stiff resin in a matter of seconds. Locklear grabbed a\u0026nbsp; detonator, inserted it into the foam, andcon.nected it to a timer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e he dolly and dropped Dr. Halsey\u0027s crystal on the deck.

She said because the ONI spooks wouldn\u0027t have the guts to get rid of it if they had to ... would maybe even let it fall into Covenant hands.That made sense, but, at the same\u0026nbsp; time, there was something not quite right with thatexplanation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Locklear looked at the monitor and the pinpoints of light that now almost blotted out thestars.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Screw it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had his own reasons to blow this thing up—like not want.ing to die in another space battle. Like maybe getting some pay.back for Polaski\u0027s death. The Covenant rat-bastardswanted it so bad? Well, screw them, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This one\u0027s for you, Polaski,\" he whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Locklear set the timer for three seconds, and punched the countdown. He dived for cover behind the robotic dolly and cov.ered his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The brilliant flash of sapphire light was the last thing he ever saw.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30070.html","bookId":221,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:14:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:14:39 AM"}
