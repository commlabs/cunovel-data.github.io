She did not want the boy to overhear this argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Arizona and Virgil had left the gallery a few minutes earlier, she had slipped behind the counter. She had deemed it prudent to put a bit of distance between them. Given Nick\u0027s simmering outrage, it was clear that he was not thrilled with the idea of having been drafted. But the counter did not seem nearly wide enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pay attention. I. Am. Not. A. Real. Private. Investigator.\" Nick spaced each word out very carefully and deliberately, as though talking to someone from another planet who might not have a good grasp of the language. \"I do not have a license. I do not investigate for a living. I write fiction for a living. And you know that as well as I do. Why did you and Virgil agree to go along with A.Z.\u0027s zany scheme?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we don\u0027t have a lot of choice,\" she said briskly. \"As you pointed out, there aren\u0027t any real investigators here in Eclipse Bay, and I agree with A.Z. about Sean Valentine. He\u0027s a good man, and he is no doubt a very competent cop. But I\u0027m pretty sure that he intends to waste a lot of time looking in all the wrong places.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me you agree with Arizona\u0027s conspiracy theory? You really think Valentine should look for the culprit up at the institute?\" Nick spread his hands. \"Give me a break. That\u0027s nuts and you know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt very much that the painting was stolen by someone at the institute,\" she said coolly. \"But that still leaves a lot of rocks to turn over and I don\u0027t think Sean will do that. I\u0027ve got a hunch he\u0027ll concentrate on the Heralds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it,\" she muttered. \"He does think it was someone from the Incandescent Body, doesn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He intends to do some background checks on some of them,\" Nick admitted. \"It\u0027s a logical place to start. The Heralds constitute the largest group of newcomers and unknowns in town who would have had knowledge of the painting and where it was stored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true. There are more newcomers and unknowns up at the institute and Chamberlain College.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, maybe. Technically speaking. But it\u0027s unlikely that many of them would have heard about the painting so soon. With a few exceptions, they\u0027re considered outsiders here in Eclipse Bay. Not full-fledged members of the community. Most of them are not hardwired into the gossip circuit. The Heralds, on the other hand, knew everything about the Upsall almost immediately because Photon and A.Z. told them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Others could have known, too,\" she insisted. \"You know how word spreads in this town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to think of it, you\u0027re right,\" he replied curtly. \"There are a lot of suspects, aren\u0027t there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not like the way he said that. \"Not a lot. Some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeremy Seaton, for instance. Heck, you showed him right where the painting was stashed. You even let him take a really close look at it. And he\u0027s into art. Probably knows some underhanded dealers back in Portland or Seattle who would be willing to take a stolen Upsall off his hands, no questions asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShock reverberated through her. It took a moment to recover. Then she flattened her palms on the counter very close to his own big hands and leaned forward so that they were only inches apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare imply that Jeremy took the painting,\" she said softly. \"That is beneath contempt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want a private investigator on the case? You gotta expect some uncomfortable speculation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You brought up Jeremy\u0027s name only because you don\u0027t like him very much,\" she said through her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just trying to be logical. That\u0027s what we investigators are paid to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know something? When A.Z. came up with the idea to hire you, it struck Virgil and me that there was some merit to the plan. After all, who would know Eclipse Bay better than a Harte? And with your family history and clout here in town, you can talk to anyone. Get through any door. People will take you seriously and open up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his hands off the counter. \"Because I\u0027m considered one of the locals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You\u0027ve got access in a way that Sean Valentine does not.\" She moved one hand slightly. \"And that\u0027s why I went along with A.Z.\u0027s scheme. But now I\u0027m having second thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree with you,\" she went on smoothly. \"I think that with your poor attitude, it is highly unlikely that you will be of any use to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he will,\" Carson said very earnestly from the doorway. \"I\u0027ll help him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s very nice of you, Carson, but your father is not interested in working for me, so I\u0027ll just have to investigate without him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know how to be an investigator?\" Carson asked, intrigued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve read all your father\u0027s books about John True. How hard can it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick\u0027s eyes went very narrow. \"What\u0027s this about investigating on your own?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised one shoulder in a deliberately careless shrug. \"I don\u0027t see that I have much option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth thinned. \"You\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a really, really dumb idea, Octavia. Stay out of it. Let Sean Valentine do his job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him just as steadily as he watched her. Damned if she would let him intimidate her, she thought. She was Claudia Banner\u0027s great-niece. She could handle a Harte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Upsall was in my custody,\" she said. \"I feel responsible for the loss and I intend to do whatever I can to recover it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying to force my hand and I don\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure you do. You can\u0027t do this without me and you know it, so you\u0027re doing your best to manipulate me into a position where I have no choice but to play private eye for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t dream of trying to manipulate you,\" she said austerely. \"I\u0027m sure it would be impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe folded his arms across his chest. He did not try to conceal his irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said at last. \"You win. I\u0027ll ask your questions for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, but I really don\u0027t want you to do me any favors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not doing you a favor,\" he said. \"I\u0027m doing it for A.Z. and Virgil.\" He glanced at Carson. \"Come on, son, let\u0027s go. We\u0027ve got things to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going to be private eyes?\" Carson asked eagerly. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-30.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
