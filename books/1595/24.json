Wrapping an arm around his mate’s waist, he sighed and decided to try and take a short nap until Taz awoke. For the first time in a long while, his wolf was content inside him, having finally staked his claim on this man. Kyle nuzzled his face in the back of Taz’s neck and drifted down into sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours later, he awoke to kisses on the side of his face and turned sleepily toward the source so that one fell directly on his lips. Kyle’s eyes sprang open to see Taz leaning over him. He smiled up at him and stretched contentedly. “How do you feel, Taz-lan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaz’s eyebrows rose. “So now you call me Taz-lan? A little late for that, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle lifted his head up and stole a quick kiss. “Never. I claimed you as my mate, but I recognize you as my alpha.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaz got a frown mark between his eyes. “Your alpha, huh? So you finally plan to be my obedient nobyo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Taz-lan. I’d like to go home with you and try, anyway. And I’m dying to see our baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is quite handsome, of course. And very strong, though I think he needs his nobyo.” He dropped another kiss on his lips and gazed down into Kyle’s eyes. “I think I need my nobyo too. If my nobyo thinks he can stay with me this time…” He smiled, but his eyes still held a hint of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle slid his arms around Taz’s neck, pulling his head back down. “Always,” he murmured against his lips. “Forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaz nodded. “Good,” he said with satisfaction. “Now let’s see about going home where you belong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we could wait until morning,” Kyle said. “I can think of ways to pass the time till then.” He pulled Taz down to him and proceeded to show him exactly what he was talking about for a long, long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarsson was alone on the command deck, having volunteered to pilot the ship while the others got some rest. Kyle was below decks with his mate, and Larsson was glad things had worked out for them. He couldn’t help being envious and wishing that he’d been able to keep Tarr with him, but he tried not to think about it and put it out of his mind. He’d been so close—he almost got his hands on him again, only to have him slip away. He’d find him again, though. He had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden ding from the computer in front of him made him look down at the screen to see a message coming in addressed to him. They were in deep space, far from any space port. His entire family was with him onboard. There was only one person who could be sending him a message and his heart began to thump with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, he opened the message and saw at once that it was from Tarr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t think this is over, Lycan. If my brother is harmed, I’ll hold you personally responsible. I’m coming for you, and once I have you, I’ll never let you go. You can run from me, but you can’t hide. It’s only a matter of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarsson grinned. “My sentiments exactly, sweetheart,” he said softly, and he tapped out a brief message in reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBring it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinking back against his chair, he smiled softly to himself and relaxed for the first time that whole long day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*THE END* \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/captive-wolf-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-5/page-24.html","bookId":1595,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:10 PM"}
