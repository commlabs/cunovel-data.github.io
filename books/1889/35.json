Mine sucked, she fixed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Well, you\u0027ll make an excellent journalist and we can hire a cook.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"I\u0027m going to get this.\" We get back downstairs and she gives me a funny look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks to the tree and takes an envelope from it. \"I better give you yours too. I don’t think you want to open this in front of my parents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl. If she did the naughty photo session, I won\u0027t be happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the permanent scowl on my face as I open the envelope. I don’t get sexy, naked pictures of my fiancé though. Instead, I get a hand-written letter in broken English. I frown, \"What is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear Master Adam. I be in good health. Auntie Cici tell me to write to you because you give us moneys and makes us rich. My school be good too. I learned English and I like it. I hope we come see you soon. I have my own bed room and auntie cici crys a lot. I says why and she says cause shes so happy. She says you are angel. Me and my cousins have a big back yard and a pool. I like swimming in the blue water better than the river. It is nice. Thanks to you, Simone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her, \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins, tears filling her eyes, \"I found Dean a month ago and I asked your father to help set them up for life—I knew you would want it. He went overboard and made them millionaires, but I don’t think they mind, and I don’t think he notices the money being gone. It was not really that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am stunned. I think she was less stunned when I proposed. I shake my head, \"This is the greatest thing you have ever done. Anyone has ever done. I don’t even know how to thank you. It\u0027s the best gift ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods and holds up the ring, \"I beat you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"You did. That was amazing. Now let\u0027s go to bed so I can beat you.\" I bring the letter with me to bed; I want to read it again. I want to read it every day. I love that she took the initiative to hunt down Dean and he found the girl. I love everything about this gift and this Christmas. It\u0027s perfect, maybe not normal, but it\u0027s perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss the top of her head and lead her down the hallway. I don’t know if I deserve any of it, but I am grateful for it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe End \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-35.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
