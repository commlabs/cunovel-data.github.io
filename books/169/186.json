You can\u0027t take care of yourself any longer. You\u0027re seventy years old and your right leg will not support you in an emergency. And you have enemies-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Enemies!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, indeed. And you know it. Those sewer rats were not after simply anyone. They were not looking for just any unwary person to rip off. They identified you by calling out, `Psychohistory!\u0027 And they called you a creep. Why do you suppose that was?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t know why.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"That\u0027s because you live in a world all your own, Dad, and you don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on on Trantor. Don\u0027t you suppose the Trantorians know that their world is going downhill at a rapid rate? Don\u0027t you suppose they know that your psychohistory has been predicting this for years? Doesn\u0027t it occur to you that they may blame the messenger for the message? If things go bad-and they are going bad-there are many who think that you are responsible for it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I can\u0027t believe that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why do you suppose there\u0027s a faction at the Galactic Library that wants you out of there? They don\u0027t want to be in the way when you are mobbed. So-you\u0027ve got to take care of yourself. You can\u0027t go out alone. I\u0027ll have to be with you or you will have to have bodyguards.

At a University.\u0027 \"Which University?\" \"Santanni.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon\u0027s lips trembled. \"Santanni! That\u0027s nine thousand parsecs away from Trantor. It\u0027s a provincial world on the other side of the Galaxy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Exactly. That\u0027s why I want to go there. I\u0027ve been on Trantor all my life, Dad, and I\u0027m tired of it. There\u0027s no world in all the Empire that\u0027s deteriorating the way Trantor is. It\u0027s become a haunt of crime with no one to protect us. The economy is limping, the technology is failing. Santanni, on the other hand, is a decent world, still humming along, and I want to be there to build a new life, along with Manella and Wanda and Bellis.

You\u0027ve tried so hard and you\u0027ve gone so far, but you\u0027ve run into a deteriorating economy, a falling Empire. It\u0027s the very thing you\u0027ve been predicting for so long that\u0027s stopping you at last. So-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No. I will not stop.
