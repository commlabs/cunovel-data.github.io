In the beginning of our relationship, I used to love how strong his arms looked. How safe they made me feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow all I see is the power behind the pain. The fear they make me feel. The same fear that I grew up feeling because of a man exactly like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want this anymore. I don’t want to feel this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot ever again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like clarity. Like my light has finally come on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy now? I’m not sure. But it has, and it’s like a weight off my shoulders. I’m never going back to how my life was. Whatever it takes, it stops now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat knowledge pushes my backbone up. I stand a little straighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForbes’ eyes are trained on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she your girlfriend?” I ask, making sure to keep my voice clear and steady, even though my heart is beating so hard in my chest it’s almost painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks surprised. Of all the things I could have said, I don’t think he was expecting that. I wonder what he was expecting me to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. That privilege is all yours,” he replies through tight lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you fuck her often?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrow. “Watch your mouth, Mia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry.” I smile, sweetly … antagonistically. “Do you have sex regularly with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, she’s new.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There have been others?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” He smirks. It hurts more than I was expecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears squeeze at my eyes. Not because of his betrayal, or the beatings, but because I’m angry with myself. Angry for being so goddamn weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you used condoms with them?” He doesn’t with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank god. I’m still going to get tested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see the anger increasing in him. It tells in the dark of his eyes. The taunt skin across his cheekbones. The clenching of his fists by his sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy questioning is annoying him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe actually has the audacity to be annoyed in this situation. But then, can I really expect any more from him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, when Forbes is this way, I will do anything to appease him. Anything to calm him. But right now my sole aim is to anger him more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know why, or what I want out of this apart from him gone from my life for good, but I will do whatever it takes now to make that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilt my head to the side, appraising him as I ask this question. I’m genuinely interested to know the answer because honestly, it doesn’t make sense to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forbes, you wanted to move in here with me. Wouldn’t that have slightly hampered your ability to have sex with other women?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” He’s smug in his statement. And it makes me feel less than worthless. He folds his arms across his chest. “It’s just simply time for us to move onto the next stage in our relationship. But my extra-circular activities will remain the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I knew he was a cold-hearted bastard, but now I’m seeing a whole brand new bastard. I guess there are more sides to Forbes Chandler than I had realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap my arms around myself. I need to feel some form of warmth. “So you have these girls and me. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirks. “Because I can. And there is no separate now, Mia. You will be a part of it too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy expression drops. “What?” The words wobble from my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m pretty sure I know what he’s getting at—not that I know much about sex, but I’m not dumb. I just don’t want to believe it. He’s never shown any interest in anything like that before. We’ve always had straight forward vanilla sex. He’s never even taken me from behind like he did that girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You. Will. Be. A. Part. Of. It.” He addresses me as though speaking to a child. “You’ll let me fuck them here in our apartment whenever I want. You’ll sit out here and listen to me fuck them. And sometimes…” He steps closer. “You’ll participate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No. No. No!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so.” Is that me speaking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis features tighten. He takes a step forward. I can see his hands twitching by his sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sidestep around the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will do as I tell you, Mia. You’re mine to do with as I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe belt cracked across my behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is in control here, Mia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are, Daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my eyes to his face. Forbes might be handsome, but he’s never looked uglier than he does right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you hit those girls like you do me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see surprise flicker across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though we are both very clear on the fact that Forbes hits me … I’ve never actually said the words out loud before. They feel odd to have said, but also empowering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he answers, his voice cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the empowerment I held so briefly dissipates and I want to cry. The ugly type of cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe beats me because he can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I allow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I’m weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why me?” I ask. I know why, but the sadistic part of me wants to hear him confirm it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moves closer until he is right in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t move this time. I stand my ground, even though my legs are shaking to the point that I’m surprised I’m actually still standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf my act of strength surprises him, he doesn’t let it show. He leans down, getting in my face. His hot breath burns my skin. I can still smell that girl on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to vomit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you’re mine, Mia.” His voice sounds like a hiss. “You belong to me. You’re my other half. My little … easily controllable … fucked-up other half.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might have known this already, but that doesn’t stop it from hurting. I hide the burning flinch of pain I feel because I don’t want him to have the pleasure of knowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifts his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis pleases him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTouching my cheek with the barest of touches, he runs his fingers across my skin and tucks my long hair behind my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really are beautiful,” he murmurs, brushing his fingers through my hair and down my back. Then he roughly grabs a hand full of my hair, yanking my head back. My eyes water from the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and I are the same, you know.” His voice is low and vengeful. “Pretty on the outside, but all kinds of fucked up on the inside. I wanted you, Mia, for the same reason you wanted me. Because like knows like. The abused becomes the abuser. Or, in your case, the abused just stays abused.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA veil lifts from my eyes. How did I not see it before?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStereotypical pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForbes has lived my childhood. To what degree, I don’t think I’ll ever know. But he’s lived through the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid his father beat him too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly feel awash with sadness for him. An ache for the child he was. For the childhood that was stolen from him as mine was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I look up at the man before me, and that sorrow instantly turns to rage. White hot rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows how it feels, yet he does it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could have stopped the cycle. Just loved me. I would have loved him back without question. I would have given him all of me. My heart. Together, we could have healed each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead, all he gave me was a co-dependent, hate fueled, abusive relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I’m just left with an empty chasm, lined with that hatred, and bitter resentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my mouth to tell him this … then it hits me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have walked away … maybe not walked, but run. I should have run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe simple truth is that I took the only way I knew … I carried on being the old me. The one who Oliver created, instead of trying to find a new Mia. The real Mia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I was afraid to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger for my own failings burst in my chest … swelling … compressing me from the inside out. I feel as if I’m going to explode under the pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI somehow manage to find my voice. “I want you to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruel laughter bursts from him. “You breaking up with me, Mia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes everything in me, but I force myself to meet his eyes. “I’d say I’ve got good reason to, wouldn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs my face, pinching my cheeks hard, then shoves my head back. He wraps his hand around my upper arm, yanking me straight back to him. I collide hard with his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, let me get this straight – I get to smack you around whenever I feel like it, but the moment you catch me with my dick in some cheap slut, you’re apparently done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince from the pressure of his fingers digging into my arm, but I speak through the pain. “It’s got nothing to do with you having sex with that girl. This is me finally waking up. Something I should have done a long time ago. I won’t continue to be your punching bag, Forbes. And I definitely won’t become your whore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs in my face. His voice chilly, he says, “You’ve been my whore from the moment I met you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happens when you dress like a whore, Mia?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip through the lashing, unable to speak through the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Answer me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body jumps from the force of his voice. Sweat trickled down the side of my face, like the tears I wanted to shed. “I-I get treated like o-one, D-Daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly right. You’re finally starting to learn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in me snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare hard into Forbes’ eyes. “I’m no one’s whore! Now get the hell out of my apartment! I’m done with you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage engorges his features, making him barely recognizable. In all this time, I’ve never seen him this angry, this far gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should be terrified. I’m not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Done with me?” he spits in my face. “You think it’s that fuckin’ easy? I’m going nowhere! And neither are you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slams his lips against mine at the same time as he restrains my hands by my sides. The next thing I know, my back is pressed against the wall, his body hard on mine, caging me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel his quick erection dig in my hip, and my senses instantly tell me where this is going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart plummets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh god, no. Not this. Anything but this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve been degraded, humiliated and beaten. But never raped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s not taking this from me. I have to fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughable thing is, I don’t know how to fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear is bubbling my blood, adrenaline spiking my senses, so I do the only thing I can think of. I bite down on his lip until I taste blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You fuckin’ bitch!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slaps me hard. I expect it, but not the punch that follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head ricochets off the wall. Pain explodes everywhere. Light swims my vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForbes grabs me and lifts me off my feet, then slams me up against the wall. I cry out from the pain it sends hurtling through my already bruised ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShoving my skirt up, his hand goes down my panties while his other pins my throat, squeezing hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers press painfully into my flesh. One violating me. The other stealing my breath. Yet all I can think is: Why did I wear a skirt this morning? Why didn’t I pick pants? If I’d picked pants, it would have made this harder for him. Maybe gave me an out. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trouble/page-4.html","bookId":2000,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:33:29 PM"}
