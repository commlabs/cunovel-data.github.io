You should\u0027ve warned me, Addy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say a thing. Just tear my gaze from the black and white photograph on the billboard and head for the virtual mosh pit of bodies stretching out in front of us. My heart is slamming furiously against my ribs as I push up on my tiptoes and try to see over the crowd, see the live version of what Lisa and I have been staring at for a good five minutes. But it\u0027s impossible. Inked bodies with stilettos and mohawks block my view of the man-the attraction-in the center. As I hear the buzzing sound of a tattoo needle at work, I suddenly wish I had worn heels and a color other than beige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be five hundred people here,\" Lisa says, awe threading her voice. \"Just to watch him work. Is he famous or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very,\" I say as we walk around the circle of spectators, trying to find a way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa is much more appropriately dressed than I am for a tattoo convention, in a pink miniskirt and tight black t-shirt that shows off her small but firm rack. More than a few guys have noticed her already, and maybe even a girl or two-something I know she loves probably more than she should. The girl is a terrible flirt, and really stands out with her long mane of nearly white blond hair and crystal blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he tattoo celebrities and rockers and models and people like that?\" she asks, searching the crowd for an opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I hear,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m clearly offering as little information as possible on what I know about Rush\u0027s life. And the frown Lisa keeps throwing my way lets me know it\u0027s starting to piss her off. A fact I can live with as I\u0027m really not up for telling her how closely I follow him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is bullshit.\" She grabs my hand. \"We\u0027re going to cut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, Lis.\" I don\u0027t want to cause a scene. Really don\u0027t want Rush to see me yet. Not when he can walk in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa turns those pale blue eyes on me. The ones that say, \u0027Hey, girlie, I just drove six hours from L.A. to be here with you. We both know why. And I\u0027m not hanging in the back when the action is up front.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, of course, is all in my mind. What she actually says is, \"This is it, Addy. You\u0027ve been working this problem for five years now. Do you want to see him or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust the thought of going face to face with Rush again makes me nauseated as hell. I fist my shaking hands and press them to my sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know this can\u0027t be easy,\" Lisa continues. \"But I\u0027m with you a hundred percent, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I manage to get out before another wave of nausea hits me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a plan,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me the plan, Addison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa is my best friend, and the one person on earth who has my back. And it\u0027s odd because we\u0027re complete opposites. We met the second week of classes our freshman year at UC Santa Barbara, and instantly clicked. Same English major, same desire to live off campus. This good girl from a wealthy family who wanted to be bad, and me, a girl who grew up with nothing, and was tossed around from place to place, but always dreamed of a different life. A stable life. A real life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The plan is,\" I say, wetting my lips because they\u0027ve gone so dry they hurt. \"We go up to him after the demonstration. You chat up his handler, while I try and get him alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocks her head to the side. \"Did the plan sound better in the car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" I go off, half laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grins. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe try to move closer, deeper into the crowd, but before we make it to the third tier a couple of girls shoulder us back. They glare at us, copping some major attitude, thinking we\u0027re trying take their spot. Which we kind of are, so we back off again. I\u0027m not nearly as badass as I used to be. Back in the day I probably would\u0027ve gotten in their faces, shared some words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther down, we spot a fissure in the throng and hurry toward it. Lisa heads in first, her body language all determined now, ready to take on any chick even if she has a legitimate reason to be pissed at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t get close to him without a special pass,\" I hear a girl say to her friend as we snake through. \"But they say it\u0027s only for taking a picture with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you serious?\" the other girl says. \"He\u0027s not doing any more ink today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just this one piece. He normally doesn\u0027t go to conventions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck,\" the girl said on a groan. \"I\u0027ve been on his waiting list for six months. I thought this would be my chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you get to take a picture with him maybe you can convince him to get you in sooner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman pressed her breasts together and grinned. \"I do have two very powerful methods of persuasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa leans in and whispers in my ear. \"First of all, gross. Second, we need to get you a picture with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. A picture is the last thing I want from Rush. I have plenty. Of him. Of us. What I want-what I need-is to be able to get a few minutes alone with him. To apologize for what I did five years ago. The concept sounded so simple, but so far he\u0027s rejected my every attempt. Calls, letters, even trying to get on the waiting list at his tattoo shop, Wicked Ink. He wants nothing to do with me. And I don\u0027t blame him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a complete fluke that someone at school was talking about the Las Vegas tattoo convention, and getting some ink done before graduation in six weeks. I didn\u0027t think Rush would be there. He seems to never work outside his shop. But when I heard he would be, I packed up the car, pretended I didn\u0027t have finals bearing down on me and convinced Lisa to ride shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a sudden shift in the crowd, and Lisa and I bump into each other. Everyone seems to be moving forward like an ocean wave. Then I see a woman being helped up onto a chair. She\u0027s young, early twenties like me, really pretty, very tatted up and dressed like a 1950\u0027s pin-up girl. Her dark eyes scan the crowd and she brings a microphone to her cherry-red lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Assholes,\" she says in the sweetest of tones, her voice booming over the din of hard-driving music and buzzing needles. \"He says he\u0027ll take one more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a clap of thunder, the crowd goes nuts. My heart flies into my throat with the intensity. Hands shoot into the air, tickets clasped in their fingers, fluttering like a mass of yellow butterflies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman grins wickedly, and her diamond nose piercing flashes in the lights. She\u0027s got some serious charisma. Like the kind that not only brings guys to their knees, but makes them want to crawl around on the floor for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" she says real drawn out-like. \"He wants a virgin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe disappointment is instant. As I try to figure out what the girl is talking about, all around me, both men and women-but frankly, a lot more women-toss around the stink face and shake their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So...\" Ms. Pin-Up says. \"Any ink virgins here today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hands go up, and to my utter shock and horror, one of them is Lisa\u0027s. And though I\u0027m relieved we\u0027re all talking about virginal tattoos here, my eyes cut to her instantly. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she laughs, her face pink and excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your hand down,\" I hiss. \"Before they-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\" Ms. Pin-Up calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I even turn back, I know the girl is pointing at Lisa. Eyes wide, my crazy-assed best friend bites her lip, then grabs my hand. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do this,\" I said, my old nemesis nausea creeping back to stake claim to my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too late, Addy.\" She sounds completely giddy, like her brain has turned into Skittles. \"Besides, here\u0027s your way in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This wasn\u0027t the plan,\" I argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck the plan, Addy. Sometimes you just have to jump.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m about to tell her that getting in the car and driving to Vegas, not telling anyone, no hotel room, is jumping, but Ms. Pin-Up is staring at us expectantly. Along with about a hundred other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on up here, sweetheart,\" she calls, motioning for Lisa to step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god, oh my god,\" Lisa squeals softly, pulling me with her, squeezing my hand so hard I flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, instead of blocking our way, the crowd parts, Red Sea-style, and in seconds we\u0027re in the front of the pack. Lisa drops my hand and follows the woman, leaving me there in my conservative beige skirt and pale blue top to stare at the guy I haven\u0027t seen in five years. The guy who has never once left my thoughts, no matter how hard I\u0027ve tried to push him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach rolls so painfully I feel like I might pass out. Back in high school, Rush Merrick was a shockingly good-looking kid. Tall, lean, badass attitude. Sexy brown hair, eyes so green they looked like leaves in the sun. But now he\u0027s something else. And frankly, the photograph on the wall behind me, the one Lisa had drooled over, doesn\u0027t do him justice. He\u0027s utterly and totally breath-stealing. And I get the crowd now. I get the women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he speaks to Ms. Pin-Up, my eyes move over him, up and down. He\u0027s even taller now, still lean, but with cords and waves of muscle that make my hands twitch involuntarily. I fist them again, inviting carpal tunnel, trying to force away the impulse to touch him. But instead my mouth starts to water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s wearing really simple clothes, but on him they\u0027re sexy as shit. A black tank top that shows off his ripped muscles and sleeves of vibrant tattoos, jeans that hang on his lean hips, black combat boots. And as I scale his hotness one more time it occurs to me that though he still has a boy\u0027s wicked grin, he\u0027s a man everywhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa steps forward, her face as pink as her miniskirt. I\u0027ve never seen her so timid and girlie, and I kind of want to slap her. \u0027What about the fucking plan?\u0027 I want to yell. Then I hear the voice that used to make my toes curl-and my heart beat twice as fast-rise above the din.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You my virgin skin?\" he asks her, his eyes doing a sexy half-lidded thing that I remember was usually followed up by a bone-melting kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes at my resurrected eleventh grade self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may have virgin skin,\" Lisa tells him, her voice shaking slightly. \"But that\u0027s the only virgin thing on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, a low rumble in his chest. And my breath is stuck inside my lungs-possibly permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa grins really wide. \"In fact, I think I might be pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth falls open, and that hostage breath is released. Okay, slapping isn\u0027t going to cut it. Lisa is clearly having a Crazy Town moment that may require pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, doll,\" Rush says, glancing over at Ms. Pin-Up like maybe they should start screening the volunteer flesh. \"We don\u0027t ink anyone who might be knocked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd boos en masse, and in that moment I\u0027m trying to figure out a way to get Lisa and sprint for the back of the convention center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like we need another virgin,\" Ms. Pin-Up calls. \"And if you\u0027re a true virgin, even better. No one with a bun in the oven, people, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Lisa calls out. \"My friend\u0027s a virgin. Hey, Addison, come here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat slams into my body and I can\u0027t feel my limbs. Heads turn to me, eyes narrowed, and there\u0027s nothing I want more than to get the hell out of here and plan Lisa\u0027s very ugly, very painful demise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about the fucking plan, whore?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Rush turns, and his eyes lock to mine, and I\u0027m rooted to the floor. Even if I wanted to move, I don\u0027t think I could. It\u0027s been so long, and he\u0027s so beautiful. His lips look dark and full, surrounded by a night or two\u0027s worth of stubble. And his hair is longer than I\u0027ve ever seen it, the dark brown edges licking his hard jawline. But it\u0027s his eyes-always been his eyes-that make my insides tremble. They\u0027re so green and so filled with hostility as he stares at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants me nowhere near him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa\u0027s on her way over, her expression wary. \"Okay, okay,\" she says when she reaches me. \"I know you hate me right now, but that plan wouldn\u0027t have worked. I\u0027ll be right here. Watching you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pregnant?\" I grind out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. \"It\u0027s not entirely out of the realm of possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to totally suck as a mother,\" I say halfheartedly as my feet are released from the invisible concrete and I walk past her, toward the guy I used to want more than I wanted a real family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watches my every step, his eyes moving down my body, taking in my clothes, my shoes. I know exactly what he sees and what he\u0027s thinking. \u0027What the hell happened to you? Where\u0027s your boyfriend, Ken Doll? Why the fuck can\u0027t you take a hint and leave me alone?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we\u0027re face to face. I\u0027m standing in front of him, and he smells so good and looks so fierce, and I think I might be dizzy because the last time it was like this, I betrayed and humiliated him in front of an entire room full of people. My best friend. My only friend. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/first-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-1/page-1.html","bookId":1915,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:02 PM"}
