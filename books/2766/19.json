I have to remind myself not to think about Avi and focus on the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid of the recoil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re lying down, so you won\u0027t feel so much of it. Line up your target,\" he tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI line up the paper that seems way too far away for me to hit with a bullet less than the width of my pinky finger. \"Done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe places his fingers over mine. They\u0027re strong and soft and I wish my body wouldn\u0027t tingle with excitement from him being near me. I\u0027m so afraid that I\u0027ll never be able to fully get over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeeze my eyes shut and control my breathing. Unfortunately, my pulse is racing. But that\u0027s because Avis body is pressed up against mine. His strong hands on mine remind me of the times he touched me intimately. I try and put those thoughts out of my mind as I say, \"Ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exhale. Hold it... \" His finger presses on mine and the rifle fires. The recoil definitely pushes my shoulder back, but not as hard or as bad as I feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up my head, now just a few inches away from Avis. \"Oh. My. God. That was awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a few minutes ago you said you weren\u0027t a gun person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not. You know, when they\u0027re used for aggression or war. But just shooting a target is so cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi scratches his temple as if he isn\u0027t quite sure how to say what he\u0027s about to say. \"Umm... I hate to break the news to you, but you didn\u0027t actually hit your target. You hit Jessica\u0027s. Her bullet went left of her target and ended up in the haystacks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean back and watch as Jessica brags about hitting her target. She analyzes her precision with the range binoculars as if she\u0027s a sharpshooter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Maybe this time I shouldn\u0027t shut my eyes when I pull the trigger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027d probably help your aim.\" I can see him trying to hide his laugh with a cough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi watches as I aim again. I control my breathing and shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I hit it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles at me. \"No. It went low. You overcompen-sated for the recoil too much by lowering the barrel. Try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep firing until my magazine is empty. I hit the target a bunch of times. I still think guns are dangerous and scary. But in a controlled environment like this, it\u0027s not so bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we shoot two more magazines full of live ammunition, and I\u0027ve finally learned to hit the target consistently, we\u0027re taught how to clean and care for our weapon. Because we\u0027re just trainees and not real, full-time Israeli soldiers, we have to hand in our magazines. Unless we\u0027re on the range, our issued rifles won\u0027t be anywhere near live ammo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your rifle in your possession at all times unless instructed otherwise,\" Ronit tells us. \"And watch your weapon closely. Liron or I might sneak up on you and take it in the middle of the night. If you don\u0027t wake up and we end up with your weapon, you\u0027ll have to do pushups come morning. Whether you keep it under your pillow or next to you in bed is up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip my Ml6. I feel the smooth barrel and ridged handgrip. Not my first choice in sleeping partners, that\u0027s for sure. But since I have to sleep with it, I might as well give it a name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge II.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shoot that rifle like a warrior woman, Amy,\" Nathan says. \"I think Avi has rubbed off on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t feel like a warrior woman in the evening, after showers and I\u0027m sitting on my bed wondering how I\u0027m going to sleep with George II. The cold, hard black metal with traces of grease doesn\u0027t match my pink pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChecking out how the other girls are sleeping with their guns, I notice most of them are placing them under their pillows. If I want a crick in my neck in the morning, putting the rifle under my pillow would be a great idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want a sore neck in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I slide my arm under my pillow to sleep every night (it\u0027s hereditary; my dad does it, too), I figure George II will be better off if I sleep hugging him. I pull the covers up and lie on my pillow. Pulling George II closer, I hug him tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Avi could see me now, hugging a black rifle tight enough so that Liron or Ronit can\u0027t steal it away from me in the middle of the night, he\u0027d probably be proud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just wish it was Avi I was hugging instead of a big piece of metal. If only I could hug Avi tight enough so no girl could steal him away from me, I\u0027d be happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, life doesn\u0027t work that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your mom told you life isn\u0027t fair, she wasn\u0027t kidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day we\u0027re off to the obstacle course again. Avi isn\u0027t with us, so we\u0027re without a team leader. Liron said Sergeant B-S called him into his office, and nobody has seen him since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetermined to master the monkey bars, I take a deep breath when it\u0027s my turn and swing my body from one bar to the next. My team cheers me on... even Tori, who has lost a tiny bit of her edge. We\u0027ve fallen behind because of me, but when I finish the monkey bars without help and everyone claps for me, I catch a genuine smile on Tori\u0027s face as she congratulates me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe still lose the race to Liron\u0027s team, but not by much. I think our team has finally become a cohesive unit, bolstered and strengthened by each other. When we all give high fives to each other, I catch sight of Avi standing next to Sergeant B-S. They both have very serious expressions on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi tells us we did a good job, then pulls me aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re gonna tell me I should have gone up that rope by myself, I just couldn\u0027t,\" I tell him. \"Next time I\u0027ll try. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not about the rope, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s definitely concerned about something. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts your safta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grandma? I swallow hard, thinking the worst. She has cancer, but I thought she was doing okay. Was I wrong? \"Is...is she okay?\" I hardly get the words out because there\u0027s a lump in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father called. She was taken to the hospital last night and he thinks you should go there. Just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just in case oduhati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What exactly did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sergeant Ben-Shimon gave me a forty-eight hour leave and use of a car. Come on, we can talk about it on the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say my goodbyes to everyone in my unit. Even though Avi and I are abandoning them, Sergeant B-S says he\u0027ll take over as team leader for the next forty-eight hours until Avi comes back. My farewell is filled with tears, because I\u0027m not coming back. And while I hated being here, I loved it too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes me less than a half hour to pack up. Avi accompanies me to the bittan and doesn\u0027t leave my side the entire time. In the car, we\u0027re finally alone--without military restrictions or rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what did my dad say?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said not to panic until they know more. He just wanted you with the family in case it\u0027s something serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if she\u0027s dying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start thinking the worst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s like telling my dog Mutt not to smell crotches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks sideways at me as he drives. \"Is that why you think the worst of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kissed Liron more than once. I didn\u0027t make it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I admitted to kissing Liron. When you kissed Nathan, I heard you out and we got past it. Why won\u0027t you hear me out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI might as well tell him the truth. \"Because I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of the truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course. The truth hurts most of the time. I have a history of pushing people away in an effort to avoid the truth. \"Yeah,\" I tell him. \"I\u0027m afraid of the truth. I think of you being attracted to someone else, and I feel sick. And when I visualize you kissing someone else, the pain is just too great. I thought you, of all people, would never disappoint me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look out the window, trying to avoid looking right at Avi. Admitting how much his betrayal has affected me makes me vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been waiting for some hint that you want to fight for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m done fighting,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an occupational hazard for you. You\u0027re a soldier, trained to fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you want, Amy? You want to be enemies? Friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friends sounds good. You know, what we are without the dating part. That way, I have no expectations.\" Maybe Noah has it right... no expectations means you don\u0027t get hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi takes a deep breath. \"If just being friends is what you want, I\u0027ll give you that. But when you\u0027re ready to fight for more, let me know. Because nothing is as intense as when we\u0027re together. Admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I admit it. But who says intense is best?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me. And you, if you\u0027d just open your eyes long enough to realize we might not be the most perfect couple, but were better together than apart. Truth is, I\u0027m afraid of losing you,\" he blurts out. \"I know this probably isn\u0027t the best time to bring it up, but we don\u0027t have many chances to be alone. Nathan isn\u0027t the one--you know that. Sure, he talks a lot. Each word out of me is a struggle sometimes. But you and I... Amy...\" He hesitates, and I can just feel him trying to get the right words out to express his feelings. For a guy who hardly ever talks in public, expressing emotion out loud is harder than shooting a flea a hundred meters away. \"We\u0027re just right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is, I don\u0027t think my heart can handle another Avi breakup. I\u0027m programmed to be emotional; I can\u0027t help it. For better or worse, my attitude and \"drama queen-ness\" defines who I am. Avi, on the other hand, is emotionally and drama-challenged. And although I came on this boot camp program in order to see him, maybe it was God\u0027s way of hinting that we\u0027re just too different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m always going to be afraid a smarter girl or a prettier girl is going to lure you away from me. Listen, I don\u0027t blame you for being attracted to Liron. She\u0027s beautiful, she can scale walls, climb ropes, and she carries a rifle. If I liked girls, I\u0027d go for her too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just hear me out, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy resolve is weakening fast. I have the childish urge to cover my ears with my palms and sing la, la, la, la, la, la so I don\u0027t hear what happened between Avi and Liron. But I guess I can\u0027t hide from the truth forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Avi. Tell me why you kissed Liron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes the truth hurts... but you can\u0027t let it consume your life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone can take lessons in life from the Israelis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re driving north toward Tiberias. Every time I look out the window, I see Israelis doing the same things we do back home. I see kids playing on playgrounds, teens playing soccer, and people eating at restaurants. I wonder why Israelis don\u0027t act like they\u0027re living in a war zone. How can they be so strong-willed? How can they know the truth --that some of the countries surrounding them would like nothing better than to destroy their country--and still live carefree lives?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brace myself for the truth of what happened between Avi and Liron. Listen, I\u0027m half Israeli myself. I can act like an Israeli and tackle any obstacle that comes my way. At least I think I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now probably isn\u0027t the best time to talk about it, with your safia in the hospital, but we might not get another chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least it\u0027ll get my mind off of wondering what\u0027s wrong with her. Go ahead, Avi. I need to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Survival training was a total mind game,\" he tells me. \"Lack of sleep, being blindfolded and finding out what it was like to be captured by terrorists, watching actual footage of Jews being brutally murdered just because they were Jewish or Israeli. Some of the bodies were so mutilated you wondered if they were killed by humans or beasts. You question your faith in God, because why would He let those things happen? You end up puking your guts out. You get so sad that every guy, no matter how tough, breaks down and cries like a baby. Then anger and a craving for revenge replaces the sorrow. Fury seeps from every pore of your body. I was so exhausted there were times I had no clue if my thoughts were my own, and at times I was so enraged I wanted to rush out and kill every terrorist single-handedly.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-19.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
