Remington doesn’t want to know, and I don’t want to find out from a doctor and spoil it accidentally for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” Riley yells from the other section. “What are you guys going to call it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemington’s shoulders are hunched as he leans over and studies something Pete is showing him on his phone, and I don’t think he’s even listening to me, but I still say, “If it’s a boy, I haven’t been able to think of anything. But I have the perfect name if it’s a girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yeah, what?” Riley asks, leaning back on his arms, curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Iris,” I say softly. Remington instantly turns to look at me, and the intimacy of his gaze bores and burns through me like a wave of lust and love crashing through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like Iris,” he says gruffly, nodding approvingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes Pete a lot more effort to get Remy to concentrate again on whatever Pete was showing on his phone, for Remington keeps looking at me across the plane. I can’t concentrate on what Diane says either, for I keep looking back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just feels wrong to have all these seats between us, my iPod tucked in my bag, and my guy so far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans as far back in his seat as possible, and across the plane aisle, he stretches his arm and opens his large hand. I link my fingers through his, and then it feels right again. He keeps checking out his man stuff, and I keep talking with Diane about baby stuff, his hand holding mine across the aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAS PETE AND I settle down in the Austin Underground, I have the misfortune of spotting two of Scorpion’s goons watching us from across the ring. I blink in surprise and immediately scan the crowd for Nora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t find her anywhere, and when my attention drifts back to the goons, I find that their attention is still on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the guys has a shaven head, and the other proudly wears a scorpion tattoo on his cheekbone, just like his boss used to before Remington carved it out the day he went for Nora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of her fraternizing with Scorpion and his minions makes me wretched, and the thought unfortunately also comes with the sensation of a thousand legs crawling on my skin. I’m torn between the multiple urges: to vomit, to run away, and to march over to these thugs and demand they tell me where my sister is. I feel like a compass gone crazy and I don’t know what to do, where to point, or how to react, so I instead sit here and keep watching them—feeling very much like a little baby doe, even if Pete sits beside me, armed to the teeth with little gadgets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the two men slowly rise and start working their way around the ring, the realization that they’re heading straight for us makes my lungs constrict. My heart kicks fiercely into my rib cage while my rioting insides fall completely still in dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTense in his plastic chair, Pete whispers, “They’re probably going to watch Scorpion fight later—or they’re scouting Remington. Check how he’s fighting, if there’s any visible injury. Please, for the love of god, don’t do anything, and ignore them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch the pair stop before us with a sinking in the pit of my stomach. “Don’t move, Brooke,” Pete warns under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiercely aware of the now nearly six-month-old baby in my round little stomach, I force my eyes down to the cement floor while my blood vessels dilate inside me. My legs shake as I curl my hands protectively around our baby, whose heart we’ve already heard and who I want as far, far away from these men as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut these are two of the jerks who tried to provoke Remington into fighting at a club last season, and pretending I don’t see them when I can actually smell their stench goes against all my instincts to kick their insteps and smash their nuts in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Remy’s bitch. Want to give us a little kiss?” one of them sneers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage and impotence well inside me as the rows of seats start filling up around us, and I force myself to keep my eyes on their feet and hope they’ll go away, or that Pete will finally grow some bigger balls and do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suggest you two get lost,” Pete says calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not talking to you, skinny, we’re talking to the whore. She don’t remember her pussy got as wet and sopping as a seal when the boss made her kiss him? Right at this very moment your little sister is getting fucked well and hard by the boss, right in front of all his other girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head snaps back up as my body flushes in humiliation. Shaking in my seat, I clench my teeth and fist my hands at my sides as I wish for a couple of bottles to crack across their skulls. “Go back to the hole you crawled out from and tell your asshole boss that Riptide is gonna bury him this year!” I grit out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brooke,” Pete grabs my elbow in warning while the two assholes laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want us to tell him you said that? Remy’s newest whore?” The bald one spits on the ground, a centimeter from my feet. “Do you—bitch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m warning you guys to leave,” Pete repeats, rising to his feet and reaching into his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m full force defense mode, and my blood is pumping as I flip out my middle finger at them. “By all means. Tell him to fuck off and that he’ll soon regret not leaving my sister alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Josephine grabs the guys by the backs of their shirts, her voice deceptively calm as she asks, “Looking for a real woman, gentlemen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete pulls me up from my seat and drags me down the row while my heart pumps with such violence, I can barely breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that about?” Pete spins me around, his eyes aflame in indignation. “A little bit of pepper spray in my pocket make you feel all freaking feisty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pete, you’re a daffodil. Why didn’t you use it? They were breathing down our necks!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brooke, a little subtlety, please! You can’t provoke these dudes! If they come back when Remington is fighting and he sees they’re within two feet of you, he’ll leave the ring and be disqualified, and that’s the last shit we need. . . .” He trails off, drags in a deep breath, and scowls at me. “What did he tell you to do just now in the locker room? Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember Remington’s request clearly, and instantly my voice drops. “To sit tight in my seat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well then! He might like that you’re a little firecracker, but I don’t want you going off on my watch, and I certainly don’t want to get burned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pete, Remy wouldn’t like me to sit with my head bent while those two bozos called me names. I am certain he wouldn’t expect me to do nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He does not expect you to do nothing—which is why he appointed me to try to keep things under control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he were you, he would’ve done something, and if I weren’t pregnant, so would I !”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not fucking Riptide, Brooke. Look at me!” Pete signals at himself in his black jacket and tie. “I admit I’m not pregnant myself, and I could’ve used one of these little toys I have on me on them, but that would raise all kinds of red flags so that when Rem came out, he’d notice something was up around you and drop the fight. It’s not always about attacking. Sheesh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pete, I’m sorry, I get it. Let’s go sit—I’m just glad they’re gone,” I say, and we both exhale as we head back to our seats and settle down to watch, but my hands still shake with the adrenaline pumping through my veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room is swarmed with people by the time the first fight is announced through the speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome, welcome, ladies and gentlemen . . .” I hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise and excitement surround us as we watch fighters come and go. Seeing all that blood again, hearing the crushing sounds of bone against bone, begins to make me anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy . . . oh god. Just thinking about how he could bump into Scorpion in the locker rooms spikes my nervousness to the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m breathing in and out when Pete tells me, “You know what, Brooke? He told me he didn’t want anyone looking at you, so you’re right—he would’ve wanted me to take them as far away from you as possible, immediately. But I can’t take it so literal, dude. I’m trying to keep things calm around here. Please understand I have to be the cool head here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand, Pete, but you,” I exaggeratedly say, “are like a loaded gun without a trigger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re in direct negotiations with Scorpion, Brooke,” he tells me then, under his breath. “The last thing I want is to aggravate the situation, or it’ll only cost Remington more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” My eyes widen. “Do you know anything about Nora?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only that this time Remington is taking care of things—and you’re to be left completely out.” He purses his lips meaningfully and nods, and I can’t even argue, for just then Remington is called out, his name exploding through the speakers and around the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir, bring out Riptide for these people!” the announcer yells, and the crowd roars, “RIPTIDE!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart skips a beat, my awareness immediately shifting to focus on the one flash of red approaching the ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis fight night is so meaningful. Not only because we heard that Scorpion was disqualified for using brass knuckles at a fight the night before and because Remington is in first place point-wise by a lot of points, but because I know that Austin is the place where he was born—where he, in his head, believes he was rejected. But not by this crowd. Oh, no. Never by this crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arena reverberates with bloodthirsty screams as Remy hops into the ring, bringing all the color to that blank and boring space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he goes through tonight with no loss, then we’ll be leaving Scorpion way behind. All good news,” Pete tells me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod in excitement, my eyes focused on nothing else but Remy now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiley and Coach take their places at the corner while Remington removes his RIPTIDE robe and hands it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile his opponent is called up, Remy raises his arms and grins to his public, then he points at me—and the people roar. “Brooke, Brooke, Brooke,” they begin chanting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, and I’m red-cheeked with the sudden knowledge that everyone here knows about me now. His adoring fans all know I’m Riptide’s pregnant girlfriend, so what the hell. I wave like a dope and send him a kiss, and I love the way he grabs it and slams it to his mouth. I think that’s what the people were asking for when they chanted Brooke, because the instant his arm swings out to grab my kiss in the air and slam it down, the crowd goes wild, and we laugh in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new fighter gets into the ring, lacking any of the fanfare of Remy’s entrance, and the fight begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemington is especially playful with the younger fighters. They seem to expect him to be powerful, but not so fast, and I can see it drives them insane. He feints a lot, gives them a little play, and then he finishes them off without mercy—to the delight of his crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight he goes through twelve fighters and ends up soaked and slightly bruised on his left side. When we head back to the rental house, he starts drilling Pete as soon as he hits the large living room that separates into long halls, each leading to a separate room. “Everything okay on the sidelines?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-real-2/page-37.html","bookId":2737,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM"}
