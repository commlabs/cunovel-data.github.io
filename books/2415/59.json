The sounds of pandemonium echoed through the darkness as frenzied tourists and musicians shoved their way toward the exit and disappeared up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors were never sealed, Brüder realized to his horror. Containment has failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 94\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Langdon was not a runner, but years of swimming made for powerful legs, and his stride was long. He reached the corner in a matter of seconds and rounded it, finding himself on a wider avenue. His eyes urgently scanned the sidewalks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s got to be here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain had stopped, and from this corner, Langdon could clearly see the entire well-lit street. There was nowhere to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet Sienna seemed to have vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon came to a stop, hands on his hips, panting as he surveyed the rain-soaked street before him. The only movement he saw was fifty yards ahead, where one of Istanbul’s modern otobüses was pulling away from the curb and powering up the avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Sienna jump on a city bus?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed far too risky. Would she really trap herself on a bus when she knew everyone would be looking for her? Then again, if she believed nobody had seen her round the corner, and if the bus had been just pulling away by chance, offering a perfectly timed opportunity …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAffixed to the top of the bus was a destination sign—a programmable matrix of lights displaying a single word: GALATA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon rushed up the street toward an elderly man who was standing outside a restaurant under an awning. He was nicely dressed in an embroidered tunic and a white turban.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me,” Langdon said breathless, arriving before him. “Do you speak English?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” the man said, looking unnerved by the urgency of Langdon’s tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Galata?! That’s a place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Galata?” the man replied. “Galata Bridge? Galata Tower? Galata-port?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon pointed to the departing otobüs. “Galata! Where is the bus going!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in the turban looked after the departing bus and considered it a moment. “Galata Bridge,” he replied. “It departs the old city and crosses the waterway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon groaned, his eyes making another frantic pass of the street but seeing no hint of Sienna. Sirens blared everywhere now, as emergency response vehicles tore past them in the direction of the cistern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s happening?” the man demanded, looking alarmed. “Is everything okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon took another look at the departing bus and knew it was a gamble, but he had no other choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir,” Langdon replied. “There’s an emergency, and I need your help.” He motioned to the curb, where a valet had just delivered a slick, silver Bentley. “Is that your car?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need a ride,” Langdon said. “I know we’ve never met, but something catastrophic is happening. It’s a matter of life and death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe turbaned man stared into the professor’s eyes a long moment, as if searching his soul. Finally he nodded. “Then you’d better get in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Bentley roared away from the curb, Langdon found himself gripping his seat. The man was clearly an experienced driver and seemed to enjoy the challenge of weaving in and out of traffic, playing catch-up with the bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him less than three blocks to position his Bentley directly behind the otobüs. Langdon leaned forward in his seat, squinting at the rear window. The interior lights were dim, and the only things Langdon could make out were the vague silhouettes of the passengers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay with the bus, please,” Langdon said. “And do you have a phone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man produced a cell phone from his pocket and handed it to his passenger, who thanked him profusely before realizing that he had no idea whom to call. He had no contact numbers for Sinskey or Brüder, and calling the WHO’s offices in Switzerland could take forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do I reach the local police?” Langdon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One-five-five,” the man replied. “Anywhere in Istanbul.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon dialed the three numbers and waited. The line seemed to ring forever. Finally a recorded voice answered, conveying both in Turkish and English that due to high call volume, he would need to hold. Langdon wondered if the reason for the call volume was the crisis at the cistern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunken palace was now probably in a state of total pandemonium. He pictured Brüder wading out in the lagoon and wondered what he had discovered out there. Langdon had a sinking feeling he already knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna had gotten into the water before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp ahead, the bus’s brake lights flashed, and the transport pulled over to a curbside bus stop. The Bentley’s driver pulled over as well, idling about fifty feet behind the bus, providing Langdon a perfect view of the passengers getting on and off. Only three people disembarked—all of them men—and yet Langdon studied each carefully, fully aware of Sienna’s skills for disguise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes shifted again to the rear window. It was tinted, but the lights inside were now fully illuminated, and Langdon could see the people on board more clearly. He leaned forward, craning his neck, holding his face close to the Bentley’s windshield as he searched for Sienna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease don’t tell me I gambled wrong!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the rearmost part of the vehicle, facing away from him, a pair of slender shoulders sloped up to the back of a shaved head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could only be Sienna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the bus accelerated, the interior lights faded once more. In the fleeting second before it disappeared into darkness, the head turned backward, glancing out the rear window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon lowered himself down in the seat, into the shadows of the Bentley. Did she see me? His turbaned driver was already pulling out again, tailing the bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road was descending toward the water now, and up ahead Langdon could see the lights of a low-slung bridge that stretched out over the water. The bridge looked completely deadlocked with traffic. In fact, the entire area near its entrance looked congested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spice Bazaar,” the man said. “Very popular on rainy nights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man pointed down to the water’s edge, where an incredibly long building sat in the shadow of one of Istanbul’s more spectacular mosques—the New Mosque, if Langdon were not mistaken, judging from the height of its famed twin minarets. The Spice Bazaar looked larger than most American malls, and Langdon could see people streaming in and out of its enormous arched doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alo?!” a tiny voice declared somewhere in the car. “Acil Durum! Alo?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon glanced down at the phone in his hand. The police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, hello!” Langdon blurted, raising the receiver. “My name is Robert Langdon. I’m working with the World Health Organization. You have a major crisis at the city cistern, and I’m tailing the person responsible. She’s on a bus near the Spice Bazaar, heading for—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One moment, please,” the operator said. “Let me connect you with dispatch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, wait!” But Langdon was on hold again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bentley’s driver turned to him with a look of fear. “A crisis at the cistern?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon was about to explain when the driver’s face suddenly glowed red, like a demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrake lights!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver’s head whipped around and the Bentley skidded to a stop directly behind the bus. The interior lights flickered on again and Langdon could see Sienna as plain as day. She was standing at the back door, yanking repeatedly on the emergency stop cord and banging to get off the bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw me, Langdon realized. No doubt Sienna had also seen the traffic on Galata Bridge and knew she could not afford to get caught in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon opened his door in a flash, but Sienna had already bolted from the bus and was sprinting into the night. Langdon tossed the cell phone back to its owner. “Tell the police what happened! Tell them to surround this area!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe turbaned man gave a frightened nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And thank you!” Langdon shouted. “Teşekkürler!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, Langdon dashed down the hill after Sienna, who was running directly toward the crowds milling around the Spice Bazaar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 95\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIstanbul’s three-hundred-year-old Spice Bazaar is one of the largest covered marketplaces in the world. Built in the shape of an L, the sprawling complex has eighty-eight vaulted rooms divided into hundreds of stalls, where local merchants zealously hawk a mind-boggling array of edible pleasures from around the world—spices, fruits, herbs, and Istanbul’s ubiquitous candylike confection, Turkish delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bazaar’s entryway—a massive stone portal with a Gothic arch—is located on the corner of Çiçek Pazari and Tahmis Street, and is said to witness the passage of more than three hundred thousand visitors a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, as Langdon approached the swarming entrance, he felt as if all three hundred thousand were here at that very moment. He was still running hard, his eyes never leaving Sienna. She was now only twenty yards ahead of him, racing directly toward the bazaar’s gateway and showing no signs of stopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna reached the arched portal and came up hard against the crowd. She snaked through the people, clawing her way inside. The moment she crossed the threshold, she stole a glance backward. Langdon saw in her eyes a frightened little girl, running scared … desperate and out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sienna!” he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she plunged into the sea of humanity and was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon dove in after her, bumping, pushing, craning his neck until he spotted her weaving down the bazaar’s western hallway to his left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurgeoning casks of exotic spices lined the way—Indian curry, Iranian saffron, Chinese flower tea—their dazzling colors creating a tunnel of yellows, browns, and golds. With every step, Langdon smelled a new aroma—pungent mushrooms, bitter roots, musky oils—all wafting through the air with a deafening chorus of languages from around the world. The result was an overwhelming rush of sensory stimuli … set against the unceasing thrum of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThousands of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wrenching feeling of claustrophobia gripped Langdon, and he almost pulled up before gathering himself again and forcing his way deeper into the bazaar. He could see Sienna just ahead, pushing through the masses with adamant force. She clearly was taking this ride to the end … wherever that might be for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Langdon wondered why he was chasing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor justice? Considering what Sienna had done, Langdon could not begin to fathom what kind of punishment awaited her if she were caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo prevent a pandemic? Whatever had been done was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Langdon pushed through the ocean of strangers, he suddenly realized why he wanted so badly to stop Sienna Brooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly ten yards ahead, Sienna was headed for an exit door at the end of the western arm of the bazaar. She stole another quick glance behind her, looking alarmed to see Langdon so close. As she turned again, facing front, she tripped and fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna’s head snapped forward, colliding with the shoulder of the person in front of her. As he went down, her right hand shot out, searching for anything to break her fall. She found only the rim of a barrel of dried chestnuts, which she seized in desperation, pulling it over on top of her and sending a landslide of nuts across the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Langdon three strides to reach the spot where she had fallen. He looked down at the floor but saw only the toppled barrel and the chestnuts. No Sienna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shopkeeper was screaming wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere did she go?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon spun in a circle, but Sienna had somehow vanished. By the time his gaze landed on the western exit only fifteen yards ahead, he knew that her dramatic fall had been anything but accidental.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon raced to the exit and burst out into an enormous plaza, also crowded with people. He stared into the plaza, searching in vain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirectly ahead, on the far side of a multilane highway, Galata Bridge stretched out across the wide waters of the Golden Horn. The dual minarets of the New Mosque rose to Langdon’s right, shining brightly over the plaza. And to his left was nothing but open plaza … packed with people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of blaring car horns drew Langdon’s gaze ahead again, toward the highway that separated the plaza from the water. He saw Sienna, already a hundred yards away, darting through speeding traffic and narrowly avoiding being crushed between two trucks. She was headed for the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Langdon’s left, on the banks of the Golden Horn, a transportation hub bustled with activity—ferry docks, otobüses, taxis, tour boats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon sprinted hard across the plaza toward the highway. When he reached the guardrail, he timed his leap with the oncoming headlights and safely bounded across the first of several two-lane highways. For fifteen seconds, assaulted by blinding headlights and angry car horns, Langdon managed to advance from median to median—stopping, starting, weaving, until he finally vaulted over the final guardrail onto the grassy banks of the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he could still see her, Sienna was a long way ahead, eschewing the taxi stand and idling buses and heading directly for the docks, where Langdon saw all manner of boats moving in and out—tourist barges, water taxis, private fishing boats, speedboats. Out across the water, city lights twinkled on the western side of the Golden Horn, and Langdon had no doubt that if Sienna reached the other side, there would be no hope of finding her, probably ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Langdon finally reached the waterfront, he turned left and dashed along the boardwalk, drawing startled looks from tourists who were queued up waiting to board a flotilla of gaudily decorated dinner barges, complete with mosquelike domes, faux-gold flourishes, and blinking neon trim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLas Vegas on the Bosporus, Langdon moaned, powering past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw Sienna far ahead, and she was no longer running. She was stopped on the dock in an area cluttered by private powerboats, pleading with one of the owners. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inferno-robert-langdon-4/page-59.html","bookId":2415,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:25 AM"}
