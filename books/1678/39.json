There’s not as much blood as there was in New Mexico, and Eight lived through that. I should be able to heal this, right? It should work. It has to work. But this one is right on his heart, straight through. I press my hands across the puncture and will my Legacy to kick in. I did it before. I can do it again. I have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happens. I feel cold all over, but it’s not the iciness of my Legacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I could lie down next to Eight here in the muck and just shut out everything that’s going on around me. I’m not even crying—it’s like the tears have gone out of me and I just feel hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a few yards away, Five is shouting but my mind can’t process what he’s saying. The blade he used to stab Eight has retracted back into its wrist-mounted sheath. His hands are on his head, like he can’t believe what he’s just done. At the base of the tree, Nine has fallen silent, in a state of shock. If only he’d shut up moments ago and not egged Five on. Six is finally struggling back to her feet, looking groggy, trying to make sense of the new scar on her ankle. Everything has fallen apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was an accident!” Five is babbling. “I didn’t mean to do that! Marina, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be quiet,” I hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when I hear the dreaded hum of a Mogadorian ship’s engine. The tall grass around us begins blowing wildly as the sleek silver vessel starts descending from the sky. This was all just a setup orchestrated by Five, so of course he’d have backup waiting in the wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean over and touch a gentle kiss to Eight’s cheek. I want to say something, to tell him what an amazing person he was, how much better he made this terrifying life we’re forced to lead. “I’ll never forget you,” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a hand on my shoulder. I whip around to find Five standing over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t have to be this way,” he’s saying, pleading with me. “This was a horrible mistake, I know that! But everything I said is the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s insane. Insane to touch me. I can’t believe he’d even have the audacity to do that after what he just did. “Shut up,” I warn him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t win, Marina!” he continues. “You’re better off joining with me. You—you—” Five stammers as his breath mists in front of his mouth, the humidity around us cut by a sudden chill. His teeth chatter. “What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in me snaps. I’ve never felt anger like this before and it’s almost comforting. The icy feeling of my healing Legacy spreads through me, but it’s different somehow; freezing and bitter and dead. I’m radiating cold. Near Five and me, the murky swamp water crackles as the surface turns instantly to ice. The plants within my radius begin to wither, drooping under the flash freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ma-Marina? Stop . . .” Five, hugging himself to keep warm, takes a step away from me. His feet nearly go out from under him as he slips on the ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this new Legacy coursing through me, I act on pure furious instinct. I jerk my hand upwards and the ice takes shape beneath Five, a jagged icicle forming from the ground and thrusting upwards. He’s not quick enough to get out of the way and the icicle stabs straight through his foot, pinning him to that spot. Five screams, but I don’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive pitches forward and grabs at his impaled foot, just as another icicle juts up from the ground. It strikes Five right in the face. If it was any larger, it would’ve probably killed him. Instead, it merely takes out one of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive falls to the frozen ground awkwardly, his foot still impaled. He clutches at his face, screaming. “Stop it! Please, stop it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s a monster and he deserves this. But no. I can’t do it. I’m not like him. I won’t kill one of my own people in cold blood, even after what he’s done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marina!” Six shouts. “Come on!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mogadorian ship has landed and its doors are opening. Over by the tree, its branches now sagging under the weight of fresh ice, Six has thrown Nine over her shoulder. She holds her hand out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take one last look at Five. He holds both his hands over his face, grasping at his ruined eye. He’s crying, the tears turning to frost on his cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I see you again, you traitorous bastard,” I yell, “I’ll take the other fucking eye!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive makes a weak gurgling sound. Pathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m about to run to Six, but stop. At my feet, encased in a solid chunk of ice, is Eight’s body. As I realize what I’ve done, the air around me begins to warm up. I kneel down and press my hands to the sheet of melting ice that separates me from Eight. I want to take him with us, to keep him away from the Mogadorians and lay him to rest like he deserves, but there’s no time to wait for the ice to melt. Six is shouting at me and the Mogs are closing in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I whisper, feeling numb all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI race over to Six and grab her outstretched hand. We turn invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI SNAP AWAKE AND SIT UP RAMROD STRAIGHT IN a bed that isn’t my own. I know immediately that I’m back in reality, the searing pain of a new scar burning into my ankle enough to wake me up. But wait—that nightmare wasn’t supposed to be real, I shouldn’t have actually gotten a scar. And yet, I can feel the burned skin, stinging and raw, the pain more than skin deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat part of the nightmare was real—we’ve lost someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t have time to think things through, barely even have time to assess my situation. Sam is shouting at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“JOHN! GET DOWN!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a Mogadorian standing in front of the bedroom window—a broken window, cold air blowing in from outside. When did that happen? He’s aiming a cannon at me. My instincts take over and I roll to my left, just as the Mog shoots the space where seconds ago I was comatose. From the floor next to the bed, I shove the Mog with my telekinesis. He flies backwards, out the window and into the empty air, and plummets to the street below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s bedlam, the chaos in the real world more intense than in Setrákus Ra’s vivid nightmare. The bedroom has been completely torn apart by blaster fire. Sarah is standing in the doorway, using a broken bookshelf for cover. With one arm she cradles Ella’s still unconscious body and with the other she haphazardly sprays machine gun fire into the hallway. Beneath the gunfire, with my enhanced hearing, I can hear Mogadorians swarming through the penthouse. There’s so many of them, yet for some reason it doesn’t seem like Sarah’s taking any return fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s because she’s holding Ella, I realize. Setrákus Ra wants—I can’t believe I’m even thinking this, haven’t even had time to process what it means—his heir brought in alive. That’s why the Mogs aren’t shooting at Sarah; they’re afraid to hit Ella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam is on the floor next to me. He’s cradling Malcolm, who has a massive blaster wound in his midsection. His breathing is shallow and he’s barely conscious; it doesn’t look like he has long left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell happened here?” I shout to Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They found us,” Sam replies. “Someone betrayed us.” I remember seeing Five in that Mogadorian uniform and I immediately know the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s everybody else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They went to the Everglades for the mission.” Sam points at my leg, his eyes wide and frightened. “I saw your ankle light up. What—what does that mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can answer, I hear Sarah scream. Her gun is making an empty clicking sound and, realizing that she’s empty, the Mogs have descended on her. One of them reaches through the doorway and buries a dagger deep into her shoulder. She falls to the ground, grasping her shoulder as another Mog reaches in and yanks Ella violently from Sarah’s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI light up my Lumen, but it’s too dangerous to launch a fireball while the Mogs are holding Ella. They’re out of range quickly, disappearing down the hallway in retreat. I reach out with my telekinesis and drag Sarah over to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right?” I ask, quickly looking over the wound in her shoulder. It looks bad, but not fatal. Sarah looks stunned and relieved to see me awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John!” she exclaims, and yanks me in close with her good arm. It’s not even a half-second hug, Sarah shoving me away, realizing the danger. “Go! You have to stop them!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leap to my feet, ready to tear off after the retreating Mogadorians. I stop myself, looking down at Sam and his father. Malcolm is still alive, but fading fast. The way Sam crouches over him, holding his hand, it reminds me of that night at Paradise High School when I was powerless to stop Henri from dying. I could save him, I realize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealing Malcolm would mean letting the Mogs escape with Ella, though. It would bring Setrákus Ra closer to what he wants—a future that I still don’t entirely understand, but one where Ella rules over humanity alongside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam looks up at me, his cheeks wet with tears. “John! What’re you waiting for? Go help Ella!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of that Sam I saw in the nightmare, how tired and beaten down he looked, his spirit gone out of him. I think of how badly it hurt me to lose Henri. I can’t let my friend go through all that, not after he and Malcolm have just found each other again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetting Ella go, the future I could be dooming her to—no, there will be time to stop that later, I tell myself. I have to help Malcolm now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kneel back down and press my hands to Malcolm’s stomach and his wound begins to close slowly beneath my touch. Finally, some color begins to return to Malcolm’s face, and his eyes open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam is staring at me. “You let them take her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I made a choice,” I reply. “They won’t hurt her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How—how can you know that?” Sarah asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because Ella—” I shake my head. “We’ll save her. We will stop them. All of us, together, I swear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam grabs my shoulder. “Thank you, John.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I’m finished with Malcolm, I turn my attention to healing Sarah. The wound in her shoulder is clean. She brushes her fingers against my cheek while my Legacy is working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened to you?” she asks. “What did you see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, not wanting to talk about the vision until I’ve really had time to figure out what’s happened. Unlike Sam, I don’t think Sarah noticed the new scar appear on my ankle, and I don’t want to bring that up either. It’s quiet now—the Mogs have retreated with Ella—but we still need to get out of here. There’s no way the cops missed this battle. I just want to get Sarah healed and all of us somewhere safe. “Looks like you kicked some ass while I was out,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We did our best,” she replies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah’s wound all healed up, I glance around. “We need to move. Where’s BK?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Sarah and Sam exchange a grim look. My heart drops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He went to the roof to hold them off,” Sam says. “He didn’t come back.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-fall-of-five-lorien-legacies-4/page-39.html","bookId":1678,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:59 AM"}
