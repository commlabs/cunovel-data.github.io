She had people coming to call, and she wanted to talk to them about James, of course,\" Diana said to Lyon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well, that\u0027s when Christina asked your mother if her heart had died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" Lyon announced, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t either,\" Rhone answered. \"Anyway, your mother said that since James had died, her heart was also dead… whatever in God\u0027s name that means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon smiled then. He couldn\u0027t help himself. \"My mother is a professional mourner, Rhone. You know that well enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was,\" Rhone drawled out. \"Christina had gotten your mother down into the entryway by this time. Your aunt, Diana, and I were standing there, watching the two ladies, wondering what was going on. Then Christina explained it all to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s going to kill Mama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Diana, that isn\u0027t what she said,\" Rhone said. He patted her shoulder, then turned to grin at Lyon again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rhone, will you get on with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina told your mother that where she came from—and God only knows where that is—an old warrior who was broken in spirit and in heart would go into the wilderness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, to find a nice, secluded spot in which to die, of course. Needless to say, your mother didn\u0027t take kindly to being called an old warrior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon stared at the ceiling a long minute before daring to look at his friend again. He was dangerously close to laughing. \"No, I don\u0027t suppose she would,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, part of it is Mama\u0027s own fault,\" Diana interjected. \"If she hadn\u0027t agreed that her heart was broken, Christina wouldn\u0027t have insisted on taking her with her. She told Mama she\u0027d help her find a lovely spot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was good of her,\" Lyon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lyon, Mama hadn\u0027t had her chocolate yet. She hadn\u0027t had her maids pack any of her possessions, either. Christina told her it didn\u0027t matter. One didn\u0027t have to pack when one was going to die. Those were her very words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother started shouting then,\" Rhone announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rhone wouldn\u0027t let me interfere,\" Diana whispered, \"and Aunt Harriett was laughing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until your mother was inside the carriage,\" Rhone commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she shouting James\u0027s name?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well… no, of course not,\" Diana muttered. \"What has that got to do with anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Rhone nor Lyon could answer her. They were too busy laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Lyon several minutes before he could speak again. \"I guess I\u0027d better get back to Lyonwood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if Christina hides Mama somewhere in the countryside and won\u0027t tell you where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really believe Christina would harm your mama?\" Rhone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Diana whispered. \"But she sounded as though it was the most natural thing for… an old warrior to do.\" Diana let out a loud sigh. \"Christina has some unusual notions, doesn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s bluffing, Diana. She\u0027s pretending to give our mother what she wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lyon, would you like me to ride along with you to Lyonwood?\" Rhone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon could tell by the gleam in his friend\u0027s green eyes that he was up to mischief. \"Why do you offer?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could help you search the estate,\" Rhone drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very amusing,\" Lyon snapped. \"Now see what you\u0027ve done? Diana\u0027s crying again. You deal with it, Rhone. I don\u0027t have time. Come down to Lyonwood this weekend with Aunt Harriett and Diana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon strolled over to the doorway, then called over his shoulder, \"If I haven\u0027t found your mother by then, Diana, you can help search.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone contained his smile. \"He\u0027s only jesting, sweetheart. Now, now, let me hold you, love. You can cry on my shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon closed the door on Rhone\u0027s soothing voice. He shook his head in vexation. He\u0027d been so wrapped up in his own life, he hadn\u0027t realized Rhone was falling in love with Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhone was a good friend… but a brother-in-law… Lyon would have to adjust to that possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina wouldn\u0027t be surprised by the attraction. No, she\u0027d been the one to instruct Rhone on his destiny, Lyon recalled with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, destiny. He decided it was now his destiny to go home and kiss his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desire to take Christina into his arms, to make slow, sweet love to her, made the journey back to Lyonwood seem much longer than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was just setting when Lyon rode toward the circle drive in front of his house. He squinted against the sunlight, trying to make out the sight he thought he was seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he rode closer, he recognized the man dragging his shoes down the steps. It was Elbert. What was he doing there? And what in God\u0027s name was he doing with Lyon\u0027s boots? Lyon was close enough to see his dozens of shoes and boots lined up on the steps, the walkway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon dismounted, slapped his horse on the hindquarters as a signal to take to the stables, then called out to Christina\u0027s former butler. \"Elbert? What are you doing with my shoes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The madam\u0027s orders, my lord,\" Elbert answered. \"Didn\u0027t know a man could own so many boots,\" he added. \"Been at this task near an hour now. Up the stairs and down the stairs, then up—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elbert? Give me the reason why,\" Lyon interrupted, his voice irritated. \"And what are you doing at Lyonwood? Did Christina invite you to visit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hired me, sir,\" Elbert announced. \"I\u0027m to be Brown\u0027s assistant. Did you know how worried she was about me? She knew I wouldn\u0027t last with the old bat. Your misses has a good heart. I\u0027ll do my part, my lord. I won\u0027t be shirking me responsibilities to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina did have a good heart. His gentle wife knew Elbert wouldn\u0027t be able to find work with anyone else. He was simply too old, too feeble. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll do fine, Elbert,\" Lyon said. \"Glad to have you on staff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, my lord,\" Elbert returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon noticed Brown standing in the open doorway then. His butler looked upset. \"Good afternoon, my lord,\" Brown called out. \"It is so very good to have you back,\" he added. His voice sounded strained to Lyon, relieved as well. \"Did you see your shoes, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not blind, man. Of course I saw them. Would you care to explain what in thunderation is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your wife\u0027s orders,\" Brown announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Past wife,\" Elbert interjected with a cackle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon took a deep breath. \"What are you talking about?\" He addressed his question to Brown, believing his young butler would make more sense than the old man snickering with laughter behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re being divorced, my lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown\u0027s shoulders sagged. He knew his lord wasn\u0027t going to take the news well. \"Divorced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cast out, my lord, pushed aside, forgotten, dead in her heart—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get your meaning, Elbert,\" Lyon muttered in exasperation. \"I\u0027m aware of what the word divorce means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon continued into the house. The old servant shuffled after him. \"Those were her very words. My mistress is divorcing you the way her people do. She said it was quite all right to get rid of a husband. You have to find someplace else to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I what?\" Lyon asked, certain he hadn\u0027t heard correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown\u0027s insistent nod indicated he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re cast out, pushed aside—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, Elbert, cease your litany,\" Lyon demanded. He turned back to Brown. \"What is the significance of the shoes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They signify your departure, my lord,\" Brown said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler tried not to stare at the incredulous look on his master\u0027s face. He was in jeopardy of losing his control. He stared at the floor instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me get this straight in my mind,\" Lyon muttered. \"My wife believes the house belongs to her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your mother, of course,\" Brown blurted out. \"She\u0027s keeping her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown was biting his lower lip. Lyon thought he might be trying not to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Lyon drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbert tried to be helpful once again. \"It\u0027s the way her people do,\" he interjected, his voice gratingly cheerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is my wife?\" Lyon asked, ignoring Elbert\u0027s comments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t wait for his servants to answer him but took the steps two at a time to reach the bedrooms. A sudden thought made him pause. \"Did she cut her hair?\" he called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She did,\" Elbert shouted before Brown could open his mouth. \"It\u0027s the way of it,\" Elbert insisted. \"Once the hair\u0027s cut—well, then you\u0027re as good as dead to her. You\u0027re set aside, cast—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve gotten her message,\" Lyon shouted. \"Brown, bring my shoes inside. Elbert, go sit somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lord?\" Brown called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do the French really follow these laws?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon contained his smile. \"Did my wife say it was the law?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she told you she was from France?\" he asked his butler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it must be true,\" Lyon announced. \"I would like a bath, Brown. Leave the shoes until later,\" he added before turning back to his destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon smiled. There were times when he forgot just how young and inexperienced Brown was. Of course, he\u0027d been lied to by someone who radiated innocence and sincerity. Christina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wife wasn\u0027t waiting for him in their bedroom. He really hadn\u0027t expected her to be there. The sun still gave sufficient light for her to stay outdoors. Lyon doubted she\u0027d return to the house until darkness forced her to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon walked over to the windows to look out at the setting sun. It was a magnificent sight, and one he\u0027d never taken the time to notice until he\u0027d married Christina. She had opened his eyes to the wonders of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the wonder of love. Yes, he did love her, so ferociously it almost frightened him. If anything happened to her, Lyon didn\u0027t know how he\u0027d be able to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat odious thought wouldn\u0027t have intruded on his peace of mind if he hadn\u0027t been so concerned about Christina\u0027s reunion with her father. Lyon was more than uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe believed he\u0027d try to kill her. Richards hadn\u0027t been able to tell Lyon much about Christina\u0027s father, but the fact that Stalinsky had been involved in the Brisbane affair, with such shameful results, worried Lyon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow simple it would be if Christina would trust him, confide in him. Lord, he felt as if he was being asked to fence with an enemy with a blindfold tied around his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEqual measure. Wasn\u0027t that what he wanted from Christina?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth hit him like a blow. He\u0027d demanded from his wife what he\u0027d been unwilling to give her. Trust. Yes, he wanted her absolute trust, yet he hadn\u0027t let her know how much he trusted her. No, he told himself with a shake of his head, his sin was worse. He hadn\u0027t opened his heart to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina had only questioned him once about his past. When they were on their way to Lyonwood, she\u0027d asked him to tell her about his first wife, Lettie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answers had been abrupt. He\u0027d let her know the subject wasn\u0027t one he would discuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t asked him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, he was getting equal measure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened behind him. Lyon glanced over his shoulder and saw the servants carrying the tub and pails of steaming water into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned back to the landscape and was in the process of drawing off his jacket when he saw Christina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath caught in his throat. The sight was more magnificent than the sunset. Christina was riding bareback. The gray stallion she\u0027d chosen was racing across the grounds with such speed his legs were a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rode like the wind. Her golden hair flew out behind her. Her back was as straight as a lance, and when she directed her mount over the hedge that separated the wilderness from the immediate grounds, Lyon started breathing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina was far more skilled than he was. That fact became obvious as he continued to watch her. He was arrogantly pleased, as if her skill somehow reflected on him. \"She\u0027s my lioness,\" he whispered, excusing his reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so incredibly graceful… and he had offered to teach her how to ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother incorrect assumption, Lyon realized. As incorrect as believing he would actually gain an apology from her for yesterday\u0027s folly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon was chuckling to himself as he stripped off his clothes. He ignored his servants\u0027 worried glances. He knew they weren\u0027t used to hearing him laugh. Then he stretched out in the long tub, his shoulders propped against the back. Brown was occupied getting fresh clothing ready for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take care of that,\" Lyon told his butler. \"You may leave now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown started for the door, then hesitated. When he turned around to look at his employer, his expression showed his concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lord, I would never presume to intrude upon your private affairs, but I was wondering if you\u0027ll be honoring your wife\u0027s decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon had to remind himself that Brown was very young and hadn\u0027t been in his household long enough to know his lord\u0027s ways well. He\u0027d never have asked such a ridiculous question otherwise. \"Why, of course, Brown,\" Lyon drawled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll let her divorce you?\" Brown blurted out, clearly stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe she already did divorce me,\" Lyon answered with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler wasn\u0027t at all happy with that announcement. \"I shall miss you, my lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s keeping you, too?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown nodded. He looked miserable. \"My lady explained that we are part of her family now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s keeping the full staff, my lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon started laughing. \"I really wish you\u0027d stay,\" Brown blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit worrying, Brown. I\u0027m not going anywhere,\" Lyon announced. \"As soon as my wife walks into the house, send her to me. If she can divorce me so easily, then there must be a quick way to remarry again. This little problem will be resolved by nightfall, I promise you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God,\" Brown whispered. He hurried out of the room, closing the door behind him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-38.html","bookId":1792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:35 PM"}
