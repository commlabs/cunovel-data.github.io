I could hear the creak of the boards, smell the sea. I could smell the blood of those who manned the ship. And I knew that it was a galley because I could hear the rhythm of the oars under the low rumbling of the giant canvas sails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t open my eyes, couldn\u0027t make my limbs move. Yet I was calm. I didn\u0027t thirst. In fact, I experienced an extraordinary sense of peace. My body was warm as if I had only just fed, and it was pleasant to lie there, to dream waking dreams on the gentle undulation of the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen my mind began to clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that we were slipping very fast through rather still waters. And that the sun had just gone down. The early evening sky was darkening, the wind was dying away. And the sound of the oars dipping and rising was as soothing as it was clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes were now open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was no longer in the coffin. I had just come out of the rear cabin of the long vessel and I was standing on the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed the fresh salt air and I saw the lovely incandescent blue of the twilight sky and the multitude of brilliant stars overhead. Never from land do the stars look like that. Never are they so near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were dark mountainous islands on either side of us, cliffs sprinkled with tiny flickering lights. The air was full of the scent of green things, of flowers, of land itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the small sleek vessel was moving fast to a narrow pass through the cliffs ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt uncommonly clearheaded and strong. There was a moment\u0027s temptation to try to figure out how I had gotten here, whether I was in the Aegean or the Mediterranean itself, to know when we had left Cairo and if the things I remembered had really taken place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this slipped away from me in some quiet acceptance of what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius was up ahead on the bridge before the mainmast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked towards the bridge and stood beside it, looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wearing the long red velvet cloak he had worn in Cairo, and his full white blond hair was blown back by the wind. His eyes were fixed on the pass before us, the dangerous rocks that protruded from the shallow water, his left hand gripping the rail of the little deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt an overpowering attraction to him, and the sense of peace in me expanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no forbidding grandeur to his face or his stance, no loftiness that might have humbled me and made me afraid. There was only a quiet nobility about him, his eyes rather wide as they looked forward, the mouth suggesting a disposition of exceptional gentleness as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo smooth the face, yes. It had the sheen of scar tissue, it was so smooth, and it might have startled, even frightened, in a dark street. It gave off a faint light. But the expression was too warm, too human in its goodness to do anything but invite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmand might have looked like a god out of Caravaggio, Gabrielle a marble archangel at the threshold of a church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this figure above me was that of an immortal man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the immortal man, with his right hand outstretched before him, was silently but unmistakably piloting the ship through the rocks before the pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waters around us shimmered like molten metal, flashing azure, then silver, then black. They sent up a great white froth as the shallow waves beat upon the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew closer and as quietly as I could I climbed the small steps to the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius didn\u0027t take his eyes off the waters for an instant, but he reached out with his left hand and took my hand, which was at my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarmth. Unobtrusive pressure. But this wasn\u0027t the moment for speaking and I was surprised that he had acknowledged me at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows came together and his eyes narrowed slightly, and, as if impelled by his silent command, the oarsmen slowed their stroke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was fascinated by what I was watching, and I realized as I deepened my own concentration that I could feel the power emanating from him, a low pulse that came in time with his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could also hear mortals on the surrounding cliffs, and on the narrow island beaches stretching out to our right and to our left. I saw them gathered on the promontories, or running towards the edge of the water with torches in their hands. I could hear thoughts ringing out like voices from them as they stood in the thin evening darkness looking out to the lanterns of our ship. The language was Greek and not known to me, but the message was clear:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lord is passing. Come down and look: the lord is passing. And the word \"lord\" incorporated in some vague way the supernatural in its meaning. And a reverence, mingled with excitement, emanated like a chorus of overlapping whispers from the shores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was breathless listening to this! I thought of the mortal I\u0027d terrified in Cairo, the old debacle on Renaud\u0027s stage. But for those two humiliating incidents, I\u0027d passed through the world invisibly for ten years, and these people, these dark-clad peasants gathered to watch the passing of the ship, knew what Marius was. Or at least they knew something of what he was. They were not saying the Greek word for vampire, which I had come to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we were leaving the beaches behind. The cliffs were closing on either side of us. The ship glided with its oars above water. The high walls diminished the sky\u0027s light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few moments, I saw a great silver bay opening before us, and a sheer wall of rock rising straight ahead, while gentler slopes enclosed the water on either side. The rock face was so high and so steep that I could make out nothing at the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oarsmen cut their speed as we came closer. The boat was turning ever so slightly to the side. And as we drifted on towards the cliff, I saw the dim shape of an old stone embankment covered with gleaming moss. The oarsmen had lifted their oars straight towards the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius was as still as ever, his hand exerting a gentle force on mine, as with the other he pointed towards the embankment and the cliff that rose like the night itself, our lanterns sending up their glare on the wet rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we were no more than five or six feet from the embankment -- dangerously close for a ship of this size and weight it seemed -- I felt the ship stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Marius took my hand and we went across the deck together and mounted the side of the ship. A dark-haired servant approached and placed a sack in Marius\u0027s hand. And together, Marius and I leapt over the water to the stone embankment, easily clearing the distance without a sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back to see the ship rocking slightly. The oars were being lowered again. Within seconds the ship was heading for the distant lights of a tiny town on the far side of the bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius and I stood alone in the darkness, and when the ship had become only a dark speck on the glimmering water, he pointed to a narrow stairway cut into the rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go before me, Lestat,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt good to be climbing. It felt good to be moving up swiftly, following the rough-cut steps and the zigzag turns, and feeling the wind get stronger, and seeing the water become ever more distant and frozen as if the movement of the waves had been stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius was only a few steps behind me. And again, I could feel and hear that pulse of power. It was like a vibration in my bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rough-cut steps disappeared less than halfway up the cliff, and I was soon following a path not wide enough for a mountain goat. Now and then boulders or outcroppings of stone made a margin between us and a possible fall to the water below. But most of the time the path itself was the only outcropping on the cliff face, and as we went higher and higher, even I became afraid to look down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, with my hand around a tree branch, I looked back and saw Marius moving steadily towards me, the bag slung over his shoulder, his right hand hanging free. The bay, the distant little town; and the harbor, all this appeared toylike, a map made by a child on a tabletop with a mirror and sand and tiny bits of wood. I could even see beyond the pass into the open water, and the deep shadowy shapes of other islands rising out of the motionless sea. Marius smiled and waited. Then he whispered very politely:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must have been spellbound. I started up again and didn\u0027t stop until I reached the summit. I crawled over a last jut of rocks and weeds and climbed to my feet in soft grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigher rocks and cliffs lay ahead, and seeming to grow out of them was an immense fortress of a house. There were lights in its windows, lights on its towers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarius put his arm around my shoulder and we went towards the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt his grip loosen on me as he paused in front of the massive door. Then came the sound of a bolt sliding back inside. The door swung open and his grip became firm again. He guided me into the hallway where a pair of torches provided an ample light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw with a little shock that there was no one there who could have moved the bolt or opened the door for us. He turned and he looked at the door and the door closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slide the bolt,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered why he didn\u0027t do it the way he had done everything else. But I put it in place immediately as he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s easier that way, by far,\" he said, and a little mischief came into his expression. \"I\u0027ll show you to the room where you may sleep safely, and you may come to me when you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear no one else in the house. But mortals had been here, that I could tell. They\u0027d left their scent here and there. And the torches had all been lighted only a short time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went up a little stairway to the right, and when I came out into the room that was to be mine, I was stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a huge chamber, with one entire wall open to a stonerailed terrace that hung over the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turned around, Marius was gone. The sack was gone. But Nicki\u0027s violin and my valise of belongings lay on a stone table in the middle of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA current of sadness and relief passed through me at the sight of the violin. I had been afraid that I had lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were stone benches in the room, a lighted oil lamp on a stand. And in a far niche was a pair of heavy wooden doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to these and opened them and found a little passage which turned sharply in an L. Beyond the bend was a sarcophagus with a plain lid. It had been cleanly fashioned out of diorite, which to my knowledge is one of the hardest stones on earth. The lid was immensely heavy, and when I examined the inside of it I saw that it was plated in iron and contained a bolt that could be slipped from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral glittering objects lay on the bottom of the box itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I lifted them, they sparkled almost magically in the light that leaked in from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a golden mask, its features carefully molded, the lips closed, the eye holes narrow but open, attached to a hood made up of layered plates of hammered gold. The mask itself was heavy but the hood was very light and very flexible, each little plate strung to the others by gold thread. And there was also a pair of leather gloves covered completely in tinier more delicate gold plates like scales. And finally a large folded blanket of the softest red wool with one side sewn with larger gold plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized that if I put on this mask and these gloves -- if I laid over me the blanket -- then I would be protected from the light if anyone opened the lid of the sarcophagus while I slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t likely that anyone could get into the sarcophagus. And the doors of this L-shaped chamber were also covered with iron, and they too had their iron bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet there was a charm to these mysterious objects. I liked to touch them, and I pictured myself wearing them as I slept. The mask reminded me of the Greek masks of comedy and tragedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of these things suggested the burial of an ancient king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left these things a little reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came back out into the room, took off the garments I\u0027d worn during my nights in the earth in Cairo, and put on fresh clothes. I felt rather absurd standing in this timeless place in a violet blue frock coat with pearl buttons and the usual lace shirt and diamond buckle satin shoes, but these were the only clothes I had. I tied back my hair in a black ribbon like any proper eighteenth-century gentleman and went in search of the master of the house. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-lestat-the-vampire-chronicles-2/page-48.html","bookId":2210,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM"}
