Bruises like that usually earn you a week\u0027s worth of extra credit in P\u0026amp;E. But Macey didn\u0027t want to hear those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was just as well, because I didn\u0027t want to say them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I helped her into her school sweater wondering:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7. Did I think Macey was okay? (Because I was the only one who seemed to be asking it.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime in the night our school had reversed itself. The Code Red was over. The Senator and his entourage were gone. Bookshelves and paintings had spun around again, and in the Hall of History, Gilly\u0027s sword was gleaming in its protective case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything seemed right. Everything seemed normal. Then I heard a voice I hadn\u0027t heard in a very long time say, \"Hey, squirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom calls me kiddo. My friends call me Cam. Zach called me Gallagher Girl. But no nickname in history has ever had the same effect on me as \"Squirt.\" I suddenly had the urge to spin around really, really fast and eat cotton candy until I was sick. But instead I just said, \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone grew up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sixteen,\" I said, which was about the dumbest thing ever, but I couldn\u0027t help it. Even geniuses have the right to be dumb sometimes. I felt Bex and Liz come from the Grand Hall to stand beside me. \"Everyone, this is\"—I gazed up at her, wondering how she could look almost exactly the same when almost everything in my life was different—\"Aunt Abby?\" It came out like a question, but it wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me,\" my aunt said as she turned to Bex, \"you must be a Baxter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex beamed. It didn\u0027t matter that the two of them had never met before. My aunt didn\u0027t wait on introductions. Which was just as well—Bex never waited on anything. \"So how\u0027s your dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s great,\" Bex said with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby winked. \"Do me a favor and tell him Dubai at Christmas is no fun without him,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside me, I could practically feel Bex\u0027s mind spinning out of control, wondering about Dubai in December. But Abby didn\u0027t offer details; instead she just turned to Liz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh,\" Abby said as she examined the fresh cut on her chin. \"Paper clip?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz\u0027s eyes got even wider. \"How did you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby shrugged. \"I\u0027ve seen things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought back to Mr. Solomon\u0027s cabin. Whenever he and my mother spoke about the things they\u0027d seen and done, I wanted to hide from the details of their lives. But as Abby spoke, we hung on every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Fibs still have that stash of the SkinAgain prototype in the lab?\" my aunt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that a little\"—Liz started—\"strong?\" (Which might have been a bit of an understatement, since I know for a fact the Gallagher Academy developed SkinAgain after an eighth grader fell into a vat of liquid nitrogen.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby shrugged. \"Not if you mix it with a little aloe. Rub some of that on, and no way that leaves a scar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously?\" Bex and Liz asked at the exact same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby leaned into the light. \"Does this look like the face of a woman who survived a knife fight in Buenos Aires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery girl in the foyer (by then there were quite a few) craned to look at her flawless, porcelain skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not a good idea, Ms. McHenry,\" my aunt said, startling her admirers. I turned and saw Macey reaching for the front doors, and realized Abby had sensed her without even turning around. And just that quickly her skin stopped being the most amazing thing about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t do breakfast,\" Macey said. (Which was a lie, but I didn\u0027t say so.) \"I\u0027m going for a walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of the word \"breakfast,\" the girls in the foyer seemed to remember that they\u0027d spent an entire summer without access to our chef\u0027s Belgian waffles. They filtered out, one by one, until it was just me, my three best friends in the world, and the woman who had taught me how to use a jump rope to temporarily paralyze a man when I was seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped closer to Macey. \"The security division noted two helicopters in the vicinity this morning— probably paparazzi looking for pictures of you—but until we\u0027re sure…\" She eased between her protectee and the door. \"You can\u0027t go outside. I\u0027m sorry.\" She added that last part later, like an afterthought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that why you\u0027re here?\" Macey reminded her and stepped toward the door again, but Abby casually cut her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, that\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\" Abby pointed to her feet and leaned against the door. It might have been a casual gesture from another person, in another place. But as I looked from my aunt to Macey, I realized they were both strong. Both smart. Both used to being the prettiest girl in the room. The last time I\u0027d had a feeling like that, it had involved Dr. Fibs\u0027s lab and two chemicals that are both potent, and volatile, and don\u0027t really like being put together under pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rule number one, ladies,\" my aunt said. \"Get careless…get caught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she walked away, Bex grabbed my arm and mouthed, \"She\u0027s bloody awesome!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, without turning around, Abby called, \"I bloody know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the morning was something of a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey was in the junior level Countries of the World class, so she sat right beside me as Mr. Smith talked for forty-five minutes about the pros and cons of getting your cosmetic surgery at CIA-approved facilities. (Evidently, the work is very high quality, but since they don\u0027t technically \"exist,\" the insurance paperwork is a nightmare!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Dabney gave a nice, relaxing refresher course on the basics: i.e. identifying every piece in a twenty-piece place setting (and the corresponding best methods in which each utensil could be used as a weapon).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings seemed perfectly normal as we started down the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrand Staircase and Liz headed toward Dr. Fibs\u0027s lab in the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See ya!\" she called, which was okay. I\u0027d gotten used to the idea that Liz was destined for the research-and- operations track while Bex and I were training for a life in the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until I heard Macey say, \"See you at lunch,\" that I remembered she was still behind the rest of us, academically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she set off for the freshman-level encryption course taught by Mr. Mosckowitz, Bex and I moved into the small passage beneath the Grand Staircase and stepped before a gilt-framed mirror. A thin laser beam scanned our faces, reading our retinal images. The eyes of the painting behind us flashed green, and a mirror slid aside, revealing the elevator to the most secret classrooms of the most secret school in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t feel a rush. I wasn\u0027t thinking about pop quizzes or how Mr. Solomon looked that one time when we were doing wilderness reconnaissance exercises and he rolled up his sleeves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I just said, \"Bex,\" and waited for my best friend\u0027s \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried about Macey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Bex asked, pressing her palm against the glass on the inside of the elevator. \"She seems fine to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed my palm beside my best friend\u0027s. \"That\u0027s what worries me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex is black and I\u0027m white. She\u0027s beautiful and I\u0027m plain. She grew up in London and I spend my summers on a ranch in the middle of nowhere. She was born for fight and I was born for flight. But the way she looked at me reminded me that Bex and I are alike in all the ways that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know something that\u0027ll make you feel better,\" she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked as the elevator around us rumbled to a start. My palm burned hot and I jerked my hand from the glass. An odd light unlike anything I\u0027d ever seen before filled the car around us, and through an eerie purple glow, my best friend smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re about to see Sublevel Two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0027re the first Gallagher Girl since Gilly herself to find and use the passageway behind the third-floor corridor that contained a million dollars worth of confederate coins, you might start thinking that the Gallagher mansion can\u0027t possibly surprise you anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you\u0027d be wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car stopped. I knew the doors were about to slide open and reveal the most covert place we had ever seen. I held my breath, waiting. Then suddenly the car jerked backward, throwing us against the doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam,\" Bex said as we hurtled at least a hundred feet further underground. \"Is this supposed to be—\" she started, but suddenly we were plunging downward again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe halted. \"PRESENT DNA, PLEASE,\" a mechanical voice rang through the car. A narrow slot appeared in the stainless-steel shell. It was exactly finger-size, so I reached out to touch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch!\" I cried. A small pin had pricked me. Then it disappeared, and a fresh needle replaced it. A small drop of blood bubbled at the top of my finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way,\" Bex said, shaking her head emphatically. (And that\u0027s how I learned that the girl who once bragged she\u0027d taken on an arms dealer in a sword fight in Cairo one spring break was actually afraid of needles.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"PRESENT DNA, PLEASE,\" the voice demanded again, this time sounding slightly less patient, so Bex put her finger in just as the car stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors slid open…and I knew that nothing about Sublevel One had prepared me for Sublevel Two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been almost exactly a year since Bex and I had first laid eyes on Sublevel One. There the walls were made of stainless steel and frosted glass. Our footsteps had echoed. I\u0027d always brought a sweater. Everything about it was cool and modern, like stepping inside the future—our future. But stepping inside Sublevel Two was…not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround me, other elevator doors were sliding open; other girls with bleeding fingers were stepping onto creaking, wide-planked oak floors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceiling was a jigsaw puzzle of thick stone and heavy beams, and as I reached out to touch the rock walls, I realized there were no seams. No mortar. Just an indeterminable amount of limestone and earth separating us from the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy classmates stirred and turned, too busy taking in the dimly lit space to notice the man who stepped out of the shadows and said, \"Welcome to Sublevel Two.\" He turned and started down the gently sloping floors, leading us in a steady spiral. \"I\u0027d highly recommend paying attention, ladies,\" Mr. Solomon instructed. \"First day is the last day you get a guide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorridors branched away from the spiraling walkway in a maze of stone. We passed arching doorways, and the incline grew steeper. One wide corridor was labeled, simply, storage, but the doors that lined the hall were marked with everything from f, false flag operations; h, hitler, attempted assassinations of. I\u0027d always heard about secrets being locked in stone, but I\u0027d never seen it with my own eyes until then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked for what felt like five minutes. The air around us was damp and cool, and yet something told me that even in the dead of winter or heat of summer the temperature would never vary more than three degrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then finally Joe Solomon came to a stop. As we stepped onto a floor of solid stone, I looked back up the spiraling walkway—at the corridors that branched like a maze—and suddenly I pitied the enemy agent who was ever foolish enough to try to penetrate this store of covert knowledge. And finally I smiled, wondering what on earth (or beneath it) could possibly lay in store on Sublevel Three. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-8.html","bookId":2748,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM"}
