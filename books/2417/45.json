Miranda followed my stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked between grave markers—most of them flat plaques, mirrored gray granite that reflected the sky perfectly. The mottoes on the tombstones were trilingual— Latin and Spanish and English. The decorations were something totally different—somewhere between ancient Aztec and modern WalMart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph turned toward us as we walked up. His thick round glasses looked cut from the same material as the Mylar balloons and the tombstones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was difficult to tell whether he looked at Miranda or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Vato,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe waited for a while, not saying anything else while Mama Arguello completed saying the rosary over the grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I didn\u0027t realize where we were, what part of the cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I noticed how close together the grave markers were, that each space was no more than two feet wide. They went on like that, row after row, for what looked like a good half acre. Nearby was another marble Jesus, this one surrounded by kids. The Spanish inscription: Suffer the Children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe decorations around us were sprinkled with Halloween candy, toys, flower arrangements shaped like lambs. Mama Arguello finished her prayers and then took the cluster of balloons from Ralph and tied it on a stake in the grass. The engraving on the marker said: \"Jose Domingo Arguello, b. Aug. 8, 1960, d. Aug. 8, 1960. In recuerdo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hook on the stake had frayed knots from past years of balloons—all babyblue ribbons, some perhaps decades old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMama Arguello smiled and gave me a hug. She smelled of marigolds—a pungent scent like perfume from a jewellery box buried for a hundred years. Then Mama Arguello hugged Miranda, telling her in Spanish that she was glad we could come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t really matter that Mama Arguello didn\u0027t know Miranda. Mama A. had stopped caring about things like that about the time she stopped being able to see. Her glasses, Ralph assured me, were just for show. With or without them, the world for Mama had long ago become a series of blurry spots and lights. It was now mostly about smells and sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with me,\" she told Miranda. She dug her pudgy brown fingers into Miranda\u0027s forearm. \"I have some tea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looked uncertainly back at me, then at Ralph. Ralph\u0027s grin couldn\u0027t have made her feel any easier. The old woman led her back to the Cadillac, where she started unloading things into Miranda\u0027s arms—a thermos, a picnic basket, two pots of flowers, a large wreath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph made a small laugh. When he looked down at the tomb marker his smile didn\u0027t waver at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My older brother,\" Ralph told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Jose Domingo. An old man\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered how many hours Jose had lived, what he thought up there in heaven of the thirtyplus years of infant\u0027s gifts and balloons he\u0027d been receiving at his grave site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got more family here?\" I asked Ralph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph waved his hand toward the east, like it was his real estate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take us two days, me and Mama. Start here and work our way around. Yvette\u0027s right over there. We have lunch with her, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYvette. Kelly Arguello\u0027s mother. I exchanged looks with Ralph, but he didn\u0027t have to tell me about Kelly not being here, or about what he thought of her defection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched Miranda struggling with the ofrendas Mama Arguello kept handing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMama was giving her directions in Spanish, telling Miranda stories she couldn\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda began smiling. At first it was strained, grieved. Then Mama told her about who a particular bottle of whiskey was for, a real cabron, and Miranda laughed despite herself, almost spilling a plate of cookies balanced in the crook of her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The chica\u0027s in trouble?\" Ralph asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I think she might be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him what had been happening. Ralph shook his head. \"Pinche rednecks. Pinche Chavez. You don\u0027t see him out here today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you help, Ralphas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph looked at his brother\u0027s tombstone, then reached down and yanked out a piece of crabgrass at the edge of the marble. He threw it behind him carelessly. The weed landed on one of the unadorned graves, behind him. \"This lady mean something to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, tried to form an answer, but Ralph held up his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget I asked, vato. How long I known you, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom another person, it would\u0027ve irritated me. From Ralph, the statement was so honest, the grin that went with it so blatantly amused, that I couldn\u0027t help but crack a smile. \"A long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda came back, burdened down with gifts for the dead but more at ease now, smiling tentatively. She followed Mama Arguello as she led the way to the next ancestor. Miranda looked back at me and asked, \"Coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went to visit Yvette, about half an acre away. Her tombstone was an upright piece of white marble, rough finished around the edges. The stone was almost engulfed in a large pyracantha bush that hung its branches down in the shape of an octopus. Each branch was thick with red berries the size of bird shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the drive from her grave, a new hole was being dug. The riderless backhoe had scooped out a perfect coffinsized trench in the lawn and was now standing there, abandoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the backhoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda helped Mama Arguello spread a blanket next to the grave and set out some paper plates of cinnamon toast and cups of steaming tea that smelled like lemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold air swept the steam from the tea. Mama set out a plate and a cup for Yvette\u0027s grave, then began telling the tombstone how well Kelly was doing in college. Ralph listened without comment. Miranda was shaking her head, looking across the cemetery at similar scenes here and there, at different grave sites. There were tears on her cheeks again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today is better,\" Ralph told her. \"Tomorrow—loco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorse than Fiesta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda brushed her hand under her eye, dazed. \"I\u0027ve lived in San Antonio my whole life—I never—\" She shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph nodded. \"Which San Antonio, eh?\" A few feet away, a family unloaded from a long black town car. The grandmother had wraparound sunglasses and walked stiffly, like this was her first time out of the nursing home in a long time. She was escorted by a woman with orangeandbrownstreaked hair and a pink sweat suit and lots of jewellery. A couple of teenage girls followed, each with an expensive warmup suit and a smaller version of mom\u0027s hairdo and jewellery ensemble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked to a grave where the colours were white and green, the wreath a flowery Oakland A\u0027s logo. On the tombstone was a flowerframed picture—a teenage boy in an open coffin, his face the same colour as the white satin, his A\u0027s jersey on, his hair combed and his pencil moustache trimmed and a look of pride sculpted on his dead face. Gangbanger. Maybe fifteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ralph has a rental house nearby,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve used it before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda looked beyond the cemetery, into the surrounding neighbourhood of rundown stores and multicoloured oneroom houses. The tears were still coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRalph started laughing quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody you know would ever look here,\" I said. \"That\u0027s the whole point. You stay with Ralph, you\u0027ll be safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda thought about that, then looked at Mama Arguello, who was offering her some lemon tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Miranda said. And then, like her timer had run out, she curled her head against her knees and shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMama Arguello smiled, not at all like she knew what we were talking about, then she told Yvette\u0027s tombstone how nice it was to have visitors, how fresh the pan muerte tasted this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e50\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got back to 90 Queen Anne a gold foil package the size of two glass bricks was sitting on the porch. The card said: This will look perfect on your desk at UTSA. Good luck today. Happy Birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother\u0027s writing. She made no mention of my failure to come to her Halloween/bythewayit\u0027sTres\u0027birthday party the night before. Inside the wrapping was the Riverside Chaucer, new edition. A seventyfivedollar book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took it inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at some tentative notes I\u0027d made two mornings ago for the demo class I was about to do. After last night, the whole idea seemed absurd, trivial—and oddly comforting. Students were going to attend classes today. Assistant professors were going to yawn and drink coffee and stumble through boring routines and most of them wouldn\u0027t even smell like house fires. They wouldn\u0027t see blackened bones every time they closed their eyes. They wouldn\u0027t catch themselves humming songs by the recently murdered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a kind of dread, I realized I wanted the class to go well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Johnson was of course sleeping on the outfit I needed to wear, so I did the tablecloth trick. Robert Johnson flipped, got to his feet, and glared at me. It took me five minutes and a full roll of Scotch tape to remove the black hair from the white shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive more minutes to tie the tie with Robert Johnson helping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that it\u0027s a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demo lesson did go well, I guess. I chose \"Complaint to His Purse\" and did the most radical things I could remember from graduate seminars—break the class into small groups, ask them to read the poem aloud while holding their wallets, ask them to write a modernday interpretation. We had a few laughs comparing Chaucer to a phone solicitor, then trying to find a Middle English phrase that was the equivalent of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"suck up.\" Most of the students didn\u0027t even fall asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my dress clothes I probably looked like I had slept on the floor the night before and spent my morning in a cemetery, but that was okay. Most of the students looked that way too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Mitchell shook my hand a lot in the hallway afterward and told me how he was sure I\u0027d get the job. The other professors filed out without saying anything. They frowned just as much as they did during my earlier interview. Maybe tracing the etymology of \"suck up\" had been too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove out of the UTSA visitor parking lot feeling tingly and hollow. I was halfway down I10, doing an impossible seventy miles per hour, before I even realized I had gotten on the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the first exit, pulled the VW into a strip mall parking lot, and shut the ignition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to get my heartbeat under control. I didn\u0027t have much luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t place the feeling right away—sort of like an electric generator spinning in my intestines. Not going anywhere, not hooked to anything, just making useless electricity. It was a few more minutes before I recognized it as shock. I\u0027d felt this way a year ago, after I\u0027d killed a man. I\u0027d woken up a few nights afterward with this same feeling—disconnected inside, like someone else had just vacated my body and left me the shell. I told myself this was only a college lesson, for God\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started the car again. I decided to take comfort in the mundane and drove next door to Taco Cabana for enchiladas to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got back to 90 Queen Anne my favourite car was parked conspicuously across the street. Deputy Frank had the window down on his black Ford Festiva and was rubbing a finger along the top of his moustache while he read a magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might\u0027ve been a little more obvious if he put wavy hands on his windshield wipers, but only slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI parked the VW and walked across to his car. Frank pretended to ignore me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his passenger\u0027s seat was your normal stakeout gear—junk food, a camera, bottled water, a tape recorder and shotgun mike. He had his suit jacket off so the shoulder holster was in plain view. There was a black briefcase between Frank\u0027s knees. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-45.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
