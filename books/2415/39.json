But does Venice have subterranean lagoons?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None that I know of,” Langdon replied. “But in a city built on water, there are probably endless possibilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if the lagoon is indoors?” Sienna asked suddenly, eyeing them both. “The poem refers to ‘the darkness’ of ‘the sunken palace.’ You mentioned earlier that the Doge’s Palace is connected to the basilica, right? That means those structures have a lot of what the poem mentions—a mouseion of holy wisdom, a palace, relevance to doges—and it’s all located right there on Venice’s main lagoon, at sea level.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon considered this. “You think the poem’s ‘sunken palace’ is the Doge’s Palace?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? The poem tells us first to kneel at St. Mark’s Basilica, then to follow the sounds of trickling water. Maybe the sounds of water lead next door to the Doge’s Palace. It could have a submerged foundation or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon had visited the Doge’s Palace many times and knew that it was absolutely massive. A sprawling complex of buildings, the palace housed a grand-scale museum, a veritable labyrinth of institutional chambers, apartments, and courtyards, and a prison network so vast that it was housed in multiple buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may be right,” Langdon said, “but a blind search of that palace would take days. I suggest we do exactly as the poem tells us. First, we go to St. Mark’s Basilica and find the tomb or statue of this treacherous doge, and then we kneel down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then?” Sienna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then,” Langdon said with a sigh, “we pray like hell that we hear trickling water … and it leads us somewhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the silence that followed, Langdon pictured the anxious face of Elizabeth Sinskey as he had seen it in his hallucinations, calling to him across the water. Time is short. Seek and find! He wondered where Sinskey was now … and if she was all right. The soldiers in black had no doubt realized by now that Langdon and Sienna had escaped. How long until they come after us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Langdon returned his eyes to the poem, he fought off a wave of exhaustion. He eyed the final line of verse, and another thought occurred to him. He wondered if it was even worth mentioning. The lagoon that reflects no stars. It was probably irrelevant to their search, but he decided to share it nonetheless. “There’s another point I should mention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna glanced up from the cell phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The three sections of Dante’s Divine Comedy,” Langdon said. “Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. They all end with the exact same word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna looked surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What word is that?” Ferris asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon pointed to the bottom of the text he had transcribed. “The same word that ends this poem—‘stars.’ ” He picked up Dante’s death mask and pointed to the very center of the spiral text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lagoon that reflects no stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s more,” Langdon continued, “in the finale of the Inferno, we find Dante listening to the sound of trickling water inside a chasm and following it through an opening … which leads him out of hell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFerris blanched slightly. “Jesus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, a deafening rush of air filled the cabin as the Frecciargento plunged into a mountain tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkness, Langdon closed his eyes and tried to allow his mind to relax. Zobrist may have been a lunatic, he thought, but he certainly had a sophisticated grasp of Dante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 64\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurence Knowlton felt a wave of relief wash over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe provost changed his mind about watching Zobrist’s video.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowlton practically dove for the crimson memory stick and inserted it into his computer so he could share it with his boss. The weight of Zobrist’s bizarre nine-minute message had been haunting the facilitator, and he was eager to have another set of eyes watch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will no longer be on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowlton held his breath as he began the playback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen darkened, and the sounds of gently lapping water filled the cubicle. The camera moved through the reddish haze of the underground cavern, and although the provost showed no visible reaction, Knowlton sensed that the man was as alarmed as he was bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera paused its forward motion and tipped downward at the surface of the lagoon, where it plunged beneath the water, diving several feet to reveal the polished titanium plaque bolted to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN THIS PLACE, ON THIS DATE, THE WORLD WAS CHANGED FOREVER.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe provost flinched ever so slightly. “Tomorrow,” he whispered, eyeing the date. “And do we know where ‘this place’ might be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowlton shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera panned left now, revealing the submerged plastic sack of gelatinous, yellow-brown fluid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What in God’s name?!” The provost pulled up a chair and settled in, staring at the undulating bubble, suspended like a tethered balloon beneath the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn uncomfortable silence settled over the room as the video progressed. Soon the screen went dark, and then a strange, beak-nosed shadow appeared on the cavern wall and began talking in its arcane language.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am the Shade …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriven underground, I must speak to the world from deep within the earth, exiled to this gloomy cavern where the bloodred waters collect in the lagoon that reflects no stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this is my paradise … the perfect womb for my fragile child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInferno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe provost glanced up. “Inferno?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowlton shrugged. “As I said, it’s disturbing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe provost returned his eyes to the screen, watching intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beak-nosed shadow continued speaking for several minutes, talking of plagues, of the population’s need for purging, of his own glorious role in the future, of his battle against the ignorant souls who had been trying to stop him, and of the faithful few who realized that drastic action was the only way to save the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever this war was about, Knowlton had been wondering all morning if the Consortium might be fighting on the wrong side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have forged a masterpiece of salvation, and yet my efforts have been rewarded not with trumpets and laurels … but with threats of death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not fear death … for death transforms visionaries into martyrs … converts noble ideas into powerful movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus.

He paced the cubicle for several moments and then turned suddenly. “We need to make contact with FS-2080.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowlton considered the move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFS-2080 was the code name of one of the provost’s trusted contacts—the same contact who had referred Zobrist to the Consortium as a client. The provost was no doubt at this very moment chiding himself for trusting FS-2080’s judgment; the recommendation of Bertrand Zobrist as a client had brought chaos into the Consortium’s delicately structured world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFS-2080 is the reason for this crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe growing chain of calamities surrounding Zobrist only seemed to be getting worse, not merely for the Consortium, but quite possibly … for the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to discover Zobrist’s true intentions,” the provost declared. “I want to know exactly what he created, and if this threat is real.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowlton knew that if anyone had the answers to these questions, it would be FS-2080. Nobody knew Bertrand Zobrist better. It was time for the Consortium to break protocol and assess what kind of insanity the organization might have unwittingly supported over the past year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowlton considered the possible ramifications of confronting FS-2080 directly. The mere act of initiating contact carried certain risks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Obviously, sir,” Knowlton said, “if you reach out to FS-2080, you’ll need to do so very delicately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe provost’s eyes flashed with anger as he pulled out his cell phone. “We’re well past delicate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated with his two traveling partners in the Frecciargento’s private cabin, the man with the paisley necktie and Plume Paris glasses did his best not to scratch at his still-worsening rash. The pain in his chest seemed to have increased as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the train finally emerged from the tunnel, the man gazed over at Langdon, who opened his eyes slowly, apparently returning from far-off thoughts. Beside him, Sienna began eyeing the man’s cell phone, which she had set down as the train sped through the tunnel, while there was no signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna appeared eager to continue her Internet search, but before she could reach for the phone, it suddenly began vibrating, emitting a series of staccato pings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing the ring well, the man with the rash immediately grabbed the phone and eyed the illuminated screen, doing his best to hide his surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” he said, standing up. “Ailing mother. I’ve got to take this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSienna and Langdon gave him understanding nods as the man excused himself and exited the cabin, moving quickly down the passageway into a nearby restroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man with the rash locked the restroom door as he took the call. “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice on the line was grave. “It’s the provost.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 65\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Frecciargento’s restroom was no larger than the restroom on a commercial airliner, with barely enough room to turn around.

The entire landscape was suddenly upside down, and he needed a moment to get his bearings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends are now my enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man loosened his paisley tie and stared at his pustuled face in the mirror. He looked worse than he thought. His face was of little concern, though, compared to the pain in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHesitantly, he unfastened several buttons and pulled open his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forced his eyes to the mirror … and studied his bare chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black area was growing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skin on the center of his chest was a deep hue of bluish black.

He gently touched the tender flesh and winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurriedly, he rebuttoned his shirt, hoping he would have the strength to carry out what he needed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next hour will be critical, he thought. A delicate series of maneuvers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and gathered himself, working through what needed to happen. My friends have become my enemies, he thought again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took several deep, painful breaths, hoping it might calm his nerves.

He took another deep, throbbing breath. You’ve been deceiving people for years, he reminded himself. It’s what you do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteeling himself, he prepared to return to Langdon and Sienna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy final performance, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a final precaution before exiting the restroom, he removed the battery from his cell phone, making sure the device was now inoperative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks pale, Sienna thought as the man with the rash reentered the cabin and settled into his seat with a pained sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is everything okay?” Sienna asked, genuinely concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “Thanks, yes. Everything’s fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently having received all the information the man intended to share, Sienna changed tacks. “I need your phone again,” she said. “If you don’t mind, I want to keep searching for more on the doge. Maybe we can get some answers before we visit St. Mark’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem,” he said, taking his phone from his pocket and checking the display. “Oh, damn. My battery was dying during that call. Looks like it’s dead now.” He glanced at his watch. “We’ll be in Venice soon. We’ll just have to wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive miles off the coast of Italy, aboard The Mendacium, facilitator Knowlton watched in silence as the provost stalked around the perimeter of the cubicle like a caged animal.
