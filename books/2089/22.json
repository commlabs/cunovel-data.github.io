The sun was coming up. \"Too late today. But tonight - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie nodded. \"Tonight we have some fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither one of us noticed Will going into the bathroom, but we saw him come out. He held Jessie\u0027s blood-spattered uniform in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe exchanged glances. I shrugged. He was all hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it look like?\" Jessie headed for her bedroom. I assumed to get dressed. I know I never like to argue while wearing a towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill followed her. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, Slick; it\u0027s not my blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so relieved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t sound relieved. He sounded pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI retrieved my gun and slipped out the door. I didn\u0027t want to listen to them argue. I definitely didn\u0027t want to be around when they made up. Just the thought made my body remember what I\u0027d been doing with Damien about twenty-four hours ago. I wanted to do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I couldn\u0027t only made me want to more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove home as daylight burst over the horizon. I enjoyed sunrise, the end of night. All the dangerous beings with fangs gone to sleep or returned to human form. What wasn\u0027t to like?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time I could remember, I pulled into an empty parking lot. Where was everyone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climbed out of the car, taking my guns along. Upstairs I set the weapons on the table, took a quick look-see around my apartment. Didn\u0027t appear that anyone had been in here lately, except for me. I considered taking a shower and climbing into bed. Then I heard the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe notes flew on the early-morning breeze and shot through my window. Not jazz for a change, but a hoof-stomping country tune. Toby Keith singing about the red, white, and blue. I loved that song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved country music. I liked the slow ones and the fast. I liked the easy southern cadence of the words and the long-drawn-out stories they told.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was playing country music in an empty bar? Only one way to find out. I went downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was open. I stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf-afraid I\u0027d find Cowboy, I wasn\u0027t any happier to see Damien. Well, who had I expected? Elvis?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge boom box perched on a table, a stack of CDs at its side. Damien swept the floor with his back to me. I tried to inch out, but he straightened. \"Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToby was informing the world we\u0027d put a boot in their ass; it was the American way. You can see why I like him. He\u0027s a man after my own heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... can\u0027t.\" I kept moving backward. He turned. The anguish on his face stopped me in my tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Nothing. You\u0027re right. You should go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should, but now I couldn\u0027t. He was upset. Seriously upset. I\u0027d planned to avoid him, as best I could living in his front yard. I\u0027d definitely decided we shouldn\u0027t be alone together. I knew what would happen if he came anywhere near me. I had no self-control around him. I\u0027d already proven that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was hurting, badly. I couldn\u0027t just run upstairs and go to bed. Even if he did turn down the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inched closer. Toby wanted to talk about me, I, number one. I wanted to talk about Damien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad night?\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and returned to sweeping, though the floor seemed pretty damn clean to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. I accomplished what I set out to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"What? Selling more whiskey than rye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, more beer than tequila.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t tell if he was joking or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you still here?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing better to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien and I had a lot more in common than I cared for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up. \"Where did you take off to in such a hurry before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d torn out of here after Jessie\u0027s call, which had followed my horrible daymare. Just the memory of it made me cold and clammy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to meet the sheriff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth. Wow. I could tell it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music changed. Toby was done and a sweet, swaying ballad began. Trisha Yearwood wondered how she could live without him. How would she ever survive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to love this song as well. Until it hit too close to home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Damien stood directly in front of me, without his broom. He was close, invading my space. I took a step back and stumbled over my own two feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand snaked out; his arm pressed against my spine. Now I couldn\u0027t breathe along with Trisha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien - \" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dance with me,\" he whispered. \"Just once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have refused, should have. But he smelled so good - like wind and trees and summertime, with a hint of tobacco that should have been unpleasant but was, instead, tempting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis skin was warm, his breath balmy against my cheek. When he touched me like this I remembered everything that had happened between us. It had been sex, not love, but I could pretend, and right now I needed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI melted against him and we began to move with the music. He was a good dancer, unusual in a man his age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grandfather had shown me the waltz, the polka, the fox-trot. No one knew how to dance like a civilized human being anymore. Except Damien. Someone had taught him, just like my grandfather had taught me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music swelled, seemed to both surround and fill me. My feet moved next to his in perfect rhythm. As I laid my head on his chest, he pressed his cheek to my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t realized how lonely I was. My life was full. Of death, sure, but that\u0027s the way I wanted it. I didn\u0027t have time to miss all I\u0027d lost. Not much anyway. Whenever I did, I moved to another town, shot a dozen more werewolves, and refused to listen to the sobbing little girl in-side of me who missed her mama. I was heap big werewolf hunter; I didn\u0027t get to cry. So why did I want to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause here, in Crow Valley, I had caught a glimpse of what I lacked. Not only friendship but also companionship, love, sex, anything that made life worth living, except killing - which made me one sick cookie. And I called Hector psychotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was being tempted back to another world, and I wasn\u0027t sure I could live in it. Seeing Jessie and Will, so in love, holding Damien close, so sexy and... aroused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened, but he tightened his arms and wouldn\u0027t let me go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" he whispered. \"Don\u0027t leave me yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thick, warm feeling settled just below my heart. I didn\u0027t want to leave. Not him. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was daytime. The werewolves were human again. We were safe - for a little while. And I needed him now. Even more than I\u0027d needed him yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lifted my head. He was watching me with an indecipherable expression on his face. I wasn\u0027t sure what he was thinking. Was I ever?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new song began - a boot-stompin\u0027 two-step. We continued to slow dance as Trisha informed us that her lover could smile like an angel, lie like a rug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad you\u0027re no good,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamien\u0027s lips lifted in the closest thing to a smile I\u0027d ever seen on his face. Was that an omen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he twirled me out, then yanked me back and started a fancy double-step I was barely able to follow. By the time the song ended I was breathing heavily and laughing. Damien stared at me with an odd expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen you laugh like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quit. I had no right to laugh, to smile, or to be happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched the corner of my mouth with his fingertip. \"Don\u0027t stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered, righting the urge to capture his finger in my mouth and nibble. What was the matter with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy and I had had sex, and it had been good. Hector hadn\u0027t been bad, either. Well, what did I expect, fucking the Devil?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Damien... Everything about him exuded sexuality. I couldn\u0027t be in the same room with him and not want him - even before I\u0027d had him. Now that I knew what lay beneath those black clothes, I had a hard time remembering why never again had seemed like a good idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis finger skimmed my jaw, feathered down my neck, slid along my collarbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damien - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never should have touched you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain in his voice, on his face, made me go silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a mistake. But I can\u0027t help wanting you again.\" His hands closed around my upper arms; the grip was just short of painful. \"I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let his head fall forward until our foreheads touched. His hair sifted over my face and I caught the scent of the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if you shoot me.\" His breath tickled the corner of my eye as his hands gentled, and his thumbs stroked the soft, sensitive skin at the inside of my arm. \"I don\u0027t care about much of anything right now except being inside you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I didn\u0027t care about anything else, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head, brushing my lips across his. My tongue flicked out, teasing, taunting, tormenting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tensed. \"Leigh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved how he said my name. Softly, almost reverently, as if the word were torn from somewhere deep within him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to wait. I didn\u0027t want to think. I raised on tiptoe, leaning into him, my fingers busy with the buttons of his shirt, my palms spreading across his chest, satisfying my desire for warmth, strength, sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to feel alive, and in the past two years I hadn\u0027t. Not until I\u0027d met him. As he\u0027d said, it was wrong, but right now I didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to feel his life in me, and I knew exactly how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReplacing my hands with my mouth, I kissed his smooth chest, traced my teeth across his belly, laved a circle around his navel. By the time I reached his waist, I\u0027d unhooked his pants. They slid to the floor just ahead of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leigh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came back to himself long enough to reach for me. I batted his hands away and took him in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never gone dov/n on anyone before, not that I hadn\u0027t heard all about it. I\u0027d been to college.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was smooth, hot, and hard. I roiled my tongue over his tip. He tasted like the earth, the wind, the water. I scraped my teeth gently across his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands on my head, his fingers threaded through my hair, and he showed me the rhythm. Moaning, he thrust into my mouth, faster and faster. I was so excited, I was afraid I\u0027d be too rough. But that didn\u0027t seem to be a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me away and I struggled to take him back. \"Leigh, wait; we should - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI licked him. His breath hissed in, sharp and quick. He glared at me. \"Let\u0027s go up to your room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way I could wait that long. I tugged on his hand until he knelt next to me; then I leaned over and nipped his lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" I whispered. \"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just cleaned the floor, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI startled a laugh out of him. The sound caused my belly to tighten with a hunger that had nothing to do with food. Laughing, he was more beautiful than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to have him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow. Here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yanked off my shirt, then tore at the rest of my clothes. He didn\u0027t help. Instead he watched. Having his sober hazel eyes drift over me in appreciation was nearly as arousing as the touch of his lips and his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearly. When he bent and flicked a nipple with his tongue my legs wobbled and I clung to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait,\" I panted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved away, yanking protection from his pants - did he have a spare condom everywhere? - then lying back on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here.\" He held out his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Why don\u0027t you - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not lying on the floor. Not with me. Not ever. Come here,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the determination on his face, if I wanted him, I could have him. But only like this. Who was I to argue?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI straddled him, took him deep inside. His hands on my hips, he guided me. We were both so close to the edge, it didn\u0027t take long. I watched his face as he came. For an instant I wanted to touch his cheek and kiss the lids of his sad, sad eyes. But I knew better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen my own release took me, hard and fast, a near-painfui explosion that left me gasping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came back to myself I was draped ail over Damien, his body still buried deep within. But that wasn\u0027t the intimacy that made my heart lurch, then thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it was the way he ran his long, clever fingers up and down my back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-22.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
