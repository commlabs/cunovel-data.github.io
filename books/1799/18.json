I’m so worried that it might stress her out, and that’s something she doesn’t need right now. She seems to be so weak lately that she doesn’t need all this laid at her feet. I hate that I didn’t realize how sick she’s really been. I should’ve been coming home more, but every time I called she always said she was fine. It wasn’t until recently that I found out things haven’t really been all that fine after all. And now my father really has some leverage over me—the one thing he can use to control me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m starting to wonder what he has over Law. Law and I have never been super close, both going off to different boarding schools and him being eight years older than me. His life was busy when he worked up in Chicago, and even when I could make it out to see him, he always had his head buried deep into whatever case he was working on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t gotten much time to talk to him since I’ve gotten back. I was being pulled in so many directions, we didn’t have time to catch up. We’re going to have to sit down and work some stuff out because there’s no way I’m going to let Dad keep me from Grandma, and more than likely I’ll need Law’s help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaine sits me on the counter, making me squirm on the cold granite top. “Sorry, Duchess.” He reaches for a shirt hanging off the bar stool at the breakfast bar, sliding it over my head. “I love seeing you naked, but I don’t want you to be cold either.” Leaning in, he takes my mouth in a soft kiss. “You sore?” His eyes go soft, and I can see the concern in his face. “I took you hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never been more perfect.” I smile when I say the words because they’re true. I feel so happy with him. Like I’m home. “And thanks,” I say, looking down at the worn shirt with an old car on it. I love it more than any piece of clothing I have. It’s completely Paine, complete with what looks like an old grease stain. Even better, it smells like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never have to thank me. Taking care of you is what I’m supposed to do.” He runs his thumb across my lip before pulling away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you fancy, Duchess?” he asks, pulling open the refrigerator door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You cook?” I can’t picture him working his way around a kitchen. A car, sure, but making spaghetti? Not so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I’ve got food I can, but I’ve been too busy to get to the store. Someone has had me chasing them all over town.” He turns to smile at me as he pulls eggs and cheese from the fridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s crazy how easy this feels. Like we’ve been doing it forever. Maybe when it’s right, that’s just how it is. I don’t have experience with men, but my grandma told me when you find the right man, you just know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept getting worried that she’s going to ask me if Scott was the one, but she hasn’t. Maybe she just thinks he is. Why else would I agree to marry him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hope you like egg-and-cheese sandwiches. We can run to the store and stock up tomorrow on some stuff. I plan on keeping you in our bed for the next few days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eButterflies take flight in my stomach at the word ‘our.’ He’s acting like I’m never leaving. Maybe I’m not. I don’t think I’ll be able to go home when my dad finds out I’m not marrying Scott.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s all so simple here. I glance around, taking in Paine’s home. It’s warm and cozy. Hardwood floors run throughout, with deep gray-blue walls. The floor plan is open with the kitchen off to the side of the living room, and a big dining room to the other side of the kitchen. A giant fireplace takes up one wall, with silver tiles surrounding it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I’ve always disliked about my family home is that it is too big. I love the idea of being able to cook in the kitchen and still be able to talk to someone lying on the couch. I can easily picture a family here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe in the kitchen cooking dinner, Paine lying on the couch watching a baseball game and talking to me while I cook. The kids at the dining-room table, doing their homework before dinner. It makes me miss something I never knew I wanted. Being here with Paine, it’s all so clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What makes you have that look on your face?” I turn back from my domestic fantasies and study him. If he meant half of what he said when he took me to bed hours ago, then maybe we’re on the same page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many what?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my hands down his tatted-up arms, pulling him closer. He sets a plate down on the counter next to me and wraps his arms around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only three?” he teases, and I’m relieved that the fairy tale I just dreamed up moments ago is so close. I can almost reach out and touch it, or maybe it’s already in my grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s start there. We still have an uphill battle,” I remind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s time to start talking.” He jumps up on the counter with me, handing me one of the sandwiches he just made, and I lay it all out for him while we eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll figure it out. He can’t keep you from seeing your grandma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not so sure. Scott’s the family lawyer, and I have no idea who controls what. I’ve never had to worry about it before, and I know my father has some powerful friends, Paine. I just—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, calm down.” He jumps back off the counter, grabbing my face between his hands. “I promise you. I won’t let him keep her from you. I told you, I’ll give you everything you’ve ever wanted, and if you want to see your grandma, you’ll see your grandma.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mechanic-breeding-2/page-18.html","bookId":1799,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:29:44 PM"}
