She thought they were the most amazing warriors in all the world, save for her husband, of course. The Scots reminded Madelyne of the ancient Spartans because of their stark existence and their fierce loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey treated Duncan as one of their own. Catherine was also happy to welcome Madelyne into her home. Duncan\u0027s sister was very pretty and very much in love with her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne wasn\u0027t able to see Edwythe, though Catherine promised to send a message of greeting to her for Madelyne. Edwythe lived in the highlands, a considerable distance from Catherine\u0027s home, too far, in fact, to go for a visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stayed with Duncan\u0027s relatives a full thirty days\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan remembered his promise to teach his gentle wife how to defend herself. He was patient with her until she reached for her bow and arrows. He left her on her own then, fearing he\u0027d lose his temper if he had to watch her make the same error over and over again. She was consistently off target. Anthony had warned him about that flaw. Madelyne was always three feet, a little less perhaps, above the mark she wished to hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan and Madelyne returned to Wexton fortress the end of August. It was then that they learned of King William II\u0027s death. The accounts were milky, but everyone who had witnessed the tragedy vowed it had truly been an accident. William, with his brother and his friends, had gone hunting in his forest. A soldier shot his arrow toward a stag, it was said, but the king\u0027s neck got in the way. The king died before he hit the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most accepted and least believed account came from an eyewitness who claimed he\u0027d seen the whole of it, from start to finish. He stated that the loyal subject had truly aimed his arrow at the stag, but when the arrow was flying toward the animal, the devil\u0027s red hand suddenly reached up out of the earth. The arrow was caught in the devil\u0027s fist and redirected toward the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe church blessed the account as accurate. Aye, it was written down immediately. Satan had ended the king\u0027s short life, and certainly none of those who witnessed it were responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry immediately claimed the treasury and became king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne was thankful she and Duncan had left court before the tragedy. Her husband was just as angry that he hadn\u0027t been there. He thought he might have been able to save his leader\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither believed the story about the devil\u0027s hand, and neither would admit that Henry might have had something to do with his brother\u0027s accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Madelyne wasn\u0027t as knowledgeable as Duncan in matters of state, she remembered that Henry had suggested to King William that Duncan spend a month with the Scots. She believed he wanted Duncan away from London, believe,. too, that Henry might have given Duncan his life bv sending him away. She never spoke such thoughts to her husband, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerald and Adela were married on the first Sunday of October. Father Berton had only just arrived with his baggage to take up the task of saving Wexton souls. The Earl of Grinsteade had died five days after Madelyne\u0027s wedding ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan had sent soldiers throughout England, searching for Louddon. Since Henry was now king, Louddon was an outcast. Henry had made no pretension about his dislike for Louddon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne believed Louddon had left England. Duncan didn\u0027t argue with her, but he was convinced Louddon was hiding, waiting for his chance for revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA summons arrived requesting that Duncan kneel before his new king and give him his pledge of fealty. Duncan couldn\u0027t refuse the order, yet found he was uneasy leaving Madelyne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat in the hall, the petition from Henry still in his hands, when Madelyne finally came down for breakfast. Duncan had already eaten his midday meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wife looked rested, but he knew in just a few hours she\u0027d need a nap. She tired easily these days. Madelyne tried to hide the fact from Duncan, but he knew she was sick every morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t the least upset over her sickness. No, he waited for her to realize she carried his child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne smiled when she saw her husband sitting in his chair by the hearth. It had turned chilly and the fire beckoned her. Duncan pulled her into his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan, I must speak to you. It\u0027s almost noon and I\u0027ve just gotten out of bed. I believe I\u0027m ill, though I don\u0027t wish to worry you. I did ask Maude for a potion yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did she give it to you?\" Duncan asked. He tried not to smile, for his wife\u0027s expression was close to brooding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne shook her head. She pushed her hair away from her shoulder, hitting Duncan\u0027s chest in her haste. \"No, she didn\u0027t,\" she said. \"She just smiled at me and walked away. What am I to think about that I ask you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan sighed. He was going to have to tell her. \"Will you be very upset if our son has red hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne\u0027s eyes widened and her hand instinctively moved to her stomach. Her voice shook when she finally answered his question. \"She\u0027ll have brown hair, like her mother. And I will be the most wonderful mother, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan laughed and then kissed Madelyne. \"You have taken on my arrogance, wife. You\u0027ll give me a son and that\u0027s the end of this discussion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne nodded, pretending agreement while she pictured the beautiful baby girl she would hold in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so overwhelmed with joy, she thought she might weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t feed your wild animals anymore. I don\u0027t want you going outside the walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my wolf,\" Madelyne teased. She still hadn\u0027t admitted to Duncan that she really thought it was a wild dog. \"Today will be the last time I leave food for him,\" she promised. \"Is that good enough for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why today?\" Duncan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s been exactly one year since I arrived here. You may walk with Anthony and me if you wish.\" She gave a mock sigh. \"I shall miss my wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan saw the sparkle in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will stop feeding him only because you order it, husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe that for one minute,\" Duncan returned. \"You obey me because you feel like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan finally promised to accompany Madelyne. She waited for him but when she\u0027d finished her target practice, the sun was beginning to fade, and Duncan still hadn\u0027t finished his other duties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne collected her arrows, slipped them into the cloth carrier Ned had fashioned for her, and then strapped the carrier on her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony carried the food for her in the burlap sack she always used for the task. She carried her bow, boasting to the vassal that she just might catch at least one rabbit for their dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony thought it impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the crest of the hill, Madelyne took the food from Anthony. She spread the cloth on the ground, kneeling now, and placed the food into a pile. A large bone, fat with meat, topped her pyramid. Since Madelyne knew she wouldn\u0027t be feeding the wild animals any longer, she thought to leave them one last filling treat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony was first to catch the noise behind him. He turned, scanning the trees behind Madelyne, just as an arrow whistled through the air and lodged in his shoulder. The vassal was knocked to the ground. He tried to catch his balance and then saw his enemy raise his bow a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe watchman shouted the warning as soon as Anthony fell. Soldiers lined the walkway along the wall, their arrows raised to their bows. They waited for the enemy to show himself,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan had just mounted his horse. He had thought to please his wife by joining her and carrying her back. He heard the shout, then goaded his horse into a full gallop. His bellow of rage could be heard throughout the fortress. Men ran to their horses to follow their lord,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne knew she didn\u0027t have time to run. A half circle of almost twenty men slowly came from their hiding places behind the trees. She knew, too, that the watchman and the archers wouldn\u0027t be able to see them until they reached the crest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t given any choice. Madelyne reached for one of her arrows, adjusted the indented edge to her bow, and took careful aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recognized the man closest to her. He was one of the three who had testified to Louddon\u0027s lies. She knew then that Louddon was close by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge made her more furious than frightened. She shot the arrow and was reaching for another before the enemy fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan didn\u0027t climb the crest. He rode around the base of the hill, motioning for the others to take the opposite side. He thought to cut off the enemy by placing himself between them and his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin bare minutes Duncan\u0027s soldiers were engaged in battle with the enemy. Madelyne dropped her bow and turned, thinking to help Anthony. The vassal had rolled halfway down the hill but was standing now and slowly making his way back up to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madelyne, get down,\" Anthony suddenly shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard his order, started to do as he commanded, when she was grabbed from behind. Madelyne screamed as she turned, and came face-to-face with Louddon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a crazed look in his eyes. His grip was excruciating. Madelyne stomped her foot down on his, causing him to change balance. Remembering Duncan\u0027s lessons in defense, she slammed her knee into his groin. Louddon went crashing to the ground, pulling Madelyne with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled to her side just as Louddon staggered to his knees. He hit Madelyne with his fist, his aim right below her jaw. The pain proved too intense to endure. Madelyne fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouddon jumped to his feet when Madelyne went limp. He looked to the bottom of the hill, saw his men running away. They deserted him, trying to escape Duncan\u0027s wrath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouddon knew then he couldn\u0027t get away from Duncan this time. \"You\u0027ll watch me kill her,\" he screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan was on foot now. He started running up the hill. Louddon knew he had only seconds left. He frantically searched the ground for his knife. He would plunge it into Madelyne\u0027s heart before Duncan could stop him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouddon shouted with obscene laughter when he spotted his dagger on top of a pile of garbage. He knelt down and reached for his weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made the mistake of touching the food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouddon\u0027s hand rested on the handle of his dagger. He was turning, when a low growl stopped him. The sound intensified until it was earthshaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan also heard the sound. He saw Louddon throw up his hands in front of his face. And then a streak of brown lightning leapt at his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLouddon fell backward, strangling to death on his own blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan motioned to his men to stand where they were. He kept his gaze on the mighty wolf as he slowly reached for his bow and arrow. The wolf stood over Louddon. The animal\u0027s teeth were bared and a low, threatening growl permeated the stillness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan prayed Madelyne wouldn\u0027t wake up. He started forward so he could gain a clear shot at the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf suddenly moved to stand over Madelyne. Duncan stopped breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer scent must have been familiar to the animal, Duncan decided, for the wolf quickly ended his curiosity and went back to the food. Duncan watched the wolf take the bone between his teeth, turn again, and disappear down the other side of the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan threw down his bow and arrow as he ran to his wife. Madelyne was just waking up when he knelt down beside her. He gently lifted her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubbed her jaw, testing her injury. She was able to move it, yet thought it throbbed enough to make her think it should be broken. She realized then that Louddon was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they gone?\" she asked Duncan. She was squeezed so tightly against his chest, she could barely whisper her question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louddon\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne closed her eyes and said a prayer for his soul. She didn\u0027t think it would do him much good, but she said it all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Anthony all right? We must see to his injury, Duncan,\" Madelyne said, trying to struggle out of her husband\u0027s hold. \"He\u0027s wearing an arrow in his shoulder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan stopped shaking. Madelyne was deliberately talking without pause. She knew he needed a few minutes to recover. When he eased up on his hold, Madelyne smiled at him. \"Now is it over?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is over,\" Duncan said. \"Your wolf saved your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you did, love, you will always protect me,\" Madelyne answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madelyne, you misunderstand,\" Duncan said, frowning. \"Your wolf killed Louddon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne shook her head. How like her husband to become fanciful in her moment of fear. She knew he teased her just to lighten her worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you strong enough to stand?\" Duncan asked. \"Do you feel—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am fine. We are fine,\" she amended. She patted her stomach for emphasis. \"I can\u0027t feel her yet, Duncan, but I know she\u0027s safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Duncan helped her to her feet, she tried to look at Louddon. Duncan moved in front of her, effectively blocking her view. \"You needn\u0027t look at him, Madelyne, it would only distress you,\" he told her. Louddon\u0027s throat had been shredded by the wolfs jaws. It was not a sight Madelyne would soon forget if she saw it, Duncan decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony came to stand with them. He looked more incredulous than pained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anthony, your shoulder—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Tis only a flesh wound,\" Anthony said. \"Baroness, you shot one of them right through his heart,\" he stammered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan didn\u0027t believe him. \"It was her arrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men turned to stare at Madelyne. They looked quite astonished. Madelyne was a little irritated by their lack of faith in her ability. For a fleeting second she thought she just might keep silent. The truth, however, won out. \"I was aiming for his foot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Duncan and Anthony thoroughly enjoyed her admission. Duncan lifted Madelyne into his arms and began to walk down the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wolf saved your life,\" he told her once again, thinking to explain the full truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave up. He\u0027d have to explain it all to her later, when her mind wasn\u0027t so stubbornly set on believing he was her savior. \"You\u0027ll never feed the beast again, Madelyne. I\u0027ll see the duty done. The wolf deserves to live an easy life now. He has earned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you stop teasing me, Duncan?\" Madelyne announced, clearly exasperated. \"I\u0027ve been through an ordeal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan smiled. Such a bossy bit of goods she was, and such a delight. He rubbed his chin against the top of her head while he listened to her complain about her new bruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron Wexton was eager to get Madelyne home, as eager, he thought, as Odysseus must have been to get home to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe future belonged to them. Madelyne liked to call him her wolf, but he was only a man, yet a man more powerful than the magical Odysseus. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-49.html","bookId":1841,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:29:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:29:59 PM"}
