And I’m surprised with how I feel about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m okay with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t love the idea but I never stopped to think about how raising a child would affect the lifestyle I lead. I love the club. It’s a big part of me. I don’t want to give that up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo maybe…?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile to myself, pick up my wallet and head out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRawr Raaawr\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn baby, that’s an unpleasant noise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widen as I turn slowly towards the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere stands a smiling Nik, dimple and all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, okay…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little freaked out here. I thought we were over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what’s happening right now but he’s smiling. I swallow hard and shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explain quietly, “I keep forgetting about it. It just needs new batteries and someone to replace them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks towards me and puts his hand on my hips. He lowers his face til his lips meet mine and says against them, “I’ll get my guy to fix it, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart skips a beat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m briefly stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment of allowing my brain to stutter I ask quietly, “Does this mean…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pecks my lips lightly and answers, “Yeah, sweetheart. No kids. Okay with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the beard of Zeus!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief courses through my veins and a familiar warmth spreads outwards from my belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap my arms around his neck and hold him tight. I do this awful laugh cry and don’t even care how stupid I look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss his lips hard and say whisper, “Oh my god!” Cry-Laugh\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I’d lost you.” Kiss-Hiccough- Laugh\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last night was the worst night ever.” Sniffle-Kiss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?” Snort-Kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles and lifts me up. I have no choice but to wrap my legs around his waist. He holds me with one forearm under my ass and the other across my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe replies quietly ,“Got no life without you, baby. You’re it for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI burst into tears and he rocks me. I wrap him up tight as if he might disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t care who’s watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat, Lola, and Mimi all cheer, whoop and laugh around the store. I hear Nat yell out, “Get her out of here, you sly son of a gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my face and he smilingly says, “You got boogers, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh and wipe my nose with my sleeve. That’s the least of my worries right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have Nik! Nik is my man! Again…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to do everything I can to keep him. I love him so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning my forehead against his, I whisper, “Love you so much, Niki.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face softens as he replies, “Love you more, teeny Tina.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavens to glory, thank you God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I went over to Safira and reunited with my girl, we went to lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina sat in my lap. Well, she sat pressed so close to me she practically was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had sushi, stole kisses and held one another. Just appreciating each other after our almost break up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we left we stayed wrapped up in each other til we reached Safira. I kissed Tina long and slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how I got on without her. More importantly, I don’t ever want to be without her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check my wrist watch for the time. 2:11pm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to get to a meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo thirty comes and I arrive at the warehouse the Sixes own better known as the factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe factory is well known amongst gangs in New York. It’s heavily guarded during the day and at night; however, all that keeps it safe is an alarm system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know this because Marcus was killed trying to get papers with this information out of my father’s office. My dad never did give this information to Chaos and I’m not sure why. It would’ve been easy to arrange a raid and steal the drugs they have stored there. However, if Chaos did end up doing that it would’ve started a war between Chaos and the Sixes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that’s why my dad never gave this information away. Dad never was one for a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not stupid enough to come alone to see Uncle Jerm. I bring Ghost with me; people are generally scared of him with good reason. Ghost wouldn’t hesitate to shoot you in the face if he thought his life was in danger. Long gone is the boy who took his licks without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk into the warehouse office and are frisked. This is not unusual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be disrespectful to conceal a weapon at a meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe remove our guns but I know Ghost would never go completely unarmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are escorted by a street thug, better known as a soldier, to Uncle Jerm’s office. I’ve only been here once before, when I was a teenager, but I remember it well. I was petrified the last time I was here. I thought I would take my last breath in this warehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens and Uncle Jerm is standing in front of his desk, smiling with open arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing about Uncle Jerm is you gotta love him. He is lovable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever without a smile or kind word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would tell you he wasn’t cut out for this work but I know some of the things he’s done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stuff of nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe will do anything to protect his boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to the short, sixty year old African American who always wears a suit and tie, hug him and pat his back. Ghost doesn’t hug. He just stands in the corner on watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm pulls back from me and says, “Well, well, well. Looks like the little boy grew into a big man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle. I wasn’t very tall the last time we met. I was just a freakin’ kid. I’m surprised he remembers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, I say, “Uncle Jerm. You look good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pats his belly and replies, “Old lady’s on my back. Cholesterol this and cholesterol that. Won’t let me eat anythin’ anymore. Thinks I’ll have a heart attack or some such shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motions for me to sit which I do. Then he takes his place behind his desk. It’s very similar to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe claps his hands together and says, “So, I believe we have a small problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and respond, “Yes, sir. I think we do. Your boy Omarr broke into my girl’s apartment and did a job on her cat. Ripped its head off and hung it like a Christmas ornament on the back porch. Luckily, the neighbor found it before Tina did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm’s face droops into a frown. He mutters, “I don’t like this. Omarr… Well, he hasn’t been the same since Marcus died.” He straightens and reveals, “Always hated on me for not retaliating. Doesn’t tell me things like he used to. But I heard of your Tina. Chaos seem real pleased you found yourself a girl. Says she real pretty. I’m happy for you, son. You get something good, you hold onto it with both hands, ya hear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee what I mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLovable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and he continues, “Omarr has been extremely disrespectful as of late. He don’t turn up for his shifts. He don’t answer to me anymore.” He leans back and with a sigh says, “He gone rogue, boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Fuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what I was dreading. Omarr isn’t taking orders from Uncle Jerm anymore, which means he’s only answering to himself. This is basically Omarr making his own rules. If Uncle Jerm gets evidence Omarr’s recruiting behind his back, Uncle Jerm will have no choice but to kill him\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhich would be good for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI utter a hesitant, “I see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Jerm nods and says, “Yeah. I know you get me, son. Not much I can do about him right now but I’ll have my boys keep an eye out. Haven’t seen him in days. If I could control this, I would. Terrorizing an innocent girl is not the way the Sixes roll. I hear he wants her. You better up security from your end. If he wants her, he’ll take her. You take care now, ya hear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like that, we’re dismissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t get anything sorted but at least I got some information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooks like the next step is security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s around four when I hear the god-awful bell go off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a little stunned when in strolls Ghost with three other men. Ghost doesn’t even look at us girls as he walks in and out of rooms giving instruction to the men. One man has a note pad and pen and is writing furiously all the while nodding. One man is taking measurements. And the other man almost pushes me out the way to get under the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, excuuuuse me, Rudie McRudeAss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost finally notices that I’m alive and approaches. He says firmly, “Upping your security, T, considering you have…” He looks around Safira then back at me, “none. Getting that goddamn bell fixed, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYippee to the bell. I’m not sure about the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cautiously ask, “Is there a reason I need security in a store I’ve been at for two years without problem?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowls at me and replies, “You got a problem, take it up with Nik. Just followin’ orders, T.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell damn!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around and see men are already drilling holes into my walls and getting dust on some of the clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEeek!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run over to the clothes and rip them off the displays. I dust them off as best I can but I’m sure they’ll need a steam clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face turns into a scowl matching Ghost’s and stalk over to the computer. I log onto the Instant Messenger and type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb: Nik the Dik, u got some ‘splainin 2 do!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately get a reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik123: Okay, baby. Later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh no, he didn’t!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheTomicBomb: Can u pls explain y I have 3 men and Ghost ruining my damn clothes!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik123: Be there in two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s more like it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo minutes later, Nik strides into the studio and starts barking out orders. “Don’t put that there”, “These clothes are very expensive, watch it”, “Fix the damn bell before you do anything else, it’s an emergency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy savior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face has since gone soft. I walk up behind Nik, hug him and press my lips to the middle of his back. I utter a muffled, “Thank you, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands rub mine that are gripped tight around his waist. He replies, “Anytime, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik barks another order, “Don’t put the camera there. It needs to focus on the outside, as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamera?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quietly ask, “Nik, why do I need cameras?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barks another order, “Get the panic button in before the camera.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic Button? What in the Dickens?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m freaking out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper, “Nik, you’re freaking me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns in my arms so I’m hugging his front now. He kisses my brow and responds quietly, “All just precautions, Tina. I don’t think you’re in danger but it’s worth doing all this as a safety measure. You want your girls safe, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLow blow right there, what am I meant to say to that? No?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reply sulkily, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles and says, “Good. CCTV goes straight to our security room which Ghost or Trick will monitor. Panic button makes our security room go bananas. As soon as it goes, we’ll be half a minute away. Tighter than Fort Knox, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must admit that sounds good. It makes me feel safer. But what am I meant to be afraid of?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask cautiously, “How much is all this going to cost, Nik? It looks awfully expensive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik’s face turns serious as he replies, “You ain’t payin’ a dime, baby. Don’t even try to argue with me about it. You wouldn’t need any of this shit if it weren’t for me. I take care of what’s mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart squeezes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a bit sweet. But it must cost in the thousands of dollars. I don’t like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to argue, “But…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNik cuts me off with a deep kiss and immediately my traitorous body responds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo fair you big meanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls away slightly and says firmly, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I guess that’s the end of that argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes an hour to install the cameras, panic button, and new door sensor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurrah!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur doorbell actually goes Ding Dong again. I need to bake a cake to mark this wondrous occasion!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss Nik, pat Ghost’s cheek, and thank the other men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all leave and I slump. I didn’t even do anything and I’m exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmmm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what would happen if I press the panic button right now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around. When I’m certain no one can see me I peek under the counter. My fingers twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know the saying curiosity killed the cat? I’m sure it was written about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slide my fingertips from the top of the counter down and just as I come into contact with the button…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jump two feet into the air when the phone rings. My hand slaps my chest, I breathe heavily and my legs shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeems I’m as skittish as a cat too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI answer and before I say hello I hear, “Don’t even think about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s Ghost!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand tall, frown, and put a hand on my hip. I lie, “I wasn’t going to press it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhost sounds amused as he says, “Uh huh,” then hangs up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make an exasperated sound and stare at the phone. Damn fool of a man hung up on me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up, I scowl right into the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera moves left then right. It looks like it’s shaking its head no!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nerve!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmit it, you got busted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. Totally busted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spend most of the next morning teaching Nat and Lola how to use the new security equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Nat’s finger twitch by the panic button.
