{"id":8399,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. THE PROFESSOR\u0027S FLIGHT.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Professor Lorenzo Riccabocca was not a wise man. It would have been much more to his interest to deal honestly with Philip, paying his share of the profits of the first performance, and retaining his services as associate and partner. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the professor was dazzled by the money, and unwilling to give it up. Moreover, he had the vanity to think that he would draw nearly as well alone, thus retaining in his own hands the entire proceeds of any entertainments he might give.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he met Philip on the road he was well-nigh penniless. Now, including the sum of which he had defrauded our hero and his creditors in Wilkesville, he had one hundred and fifty dollars.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the professor went to bed, he had not formed the plan of deserting Philip; but, on awaking in the morning, it flashed upon him as an excellent step which would put money in his pocket.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He accordingly rose, dressed himself quietly, and, with one cautious look at Philip—who was fast asleep—descended the stairs to the office.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Only the bookkeeper was in the office.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are stirring early, professor,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” answered Riccabocca, “I generally take a morning walk, to get an appetite for breakfast.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My appetite comes without the walk,” said the bookkeeper, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If Mr. de Gray comes downstairs, please tell him I will be back soon,” said Riccabocca.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The bookkeeper readily promised to do this, not having the slightest suspicion that the distinguished professor was about to take French leave.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When Professor Riccabocca had walked half a mile he began to feel faint. His appetite had come.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish I had stopped to breakfast,” he reflected. “I don\u0027t believe De Gray will be down for an hour or two.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was too late to go back and repair his mistake. That would spoil all. He saw across the street a baker\u0027s shop, just opening for the day, and this gave him an idea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He entered, bought some rolls, and obtained a glass of milk, and, fortified with these, he resumed his journey.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had walked three miles, when he was over-taken by a farm wagon, which was going his way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He hailed the driver—a young man of nineteen or thereabouts—ascertained that he was driving to Knoxville, and, for a small sum, secured passage there.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This brings us to the point of time when Philip and Mr. Gates drove up to the hotel at Knoxville.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can see the professor,” said Philip, in eager excitement, when they had come within a few rods of the inn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where is he?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is in the office, sitting with his back to the front window. I wonder what he will have to say for himself?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So do I,” said the landlord curiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shall we go in together?” questioned Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; let us surprise him a little. I will drive around to the sheds back of the hotel, and fasten my horse. Then we will go round to the front, and you can go in, while I stand outside, ready to appear a little later.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Philip thought this a good plan. He enjoyed the prospect of confronting the rogue who had taken advantage of his inexperience, and attempted such a bold scheme of fraud. He didn\u0027t feel in the least nervous, or afraid to encounter the professor, though Riccabocca was a man and he but a boy. When all was ready, Philip entered through the front door, which was open, and, turning into the office, stood before the astonished professor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The latter started in dismay at the sight of our hero. He thought he might be quietly eating breakfast ten miles away, unsuspiciously waiting for his return. Was his brilliant scheme to fail? He quickly took his resolution—a foolish one. He would pretend not to know Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, Professor Riccabocca,” Philip said, in a sarcastic tone, “you took rather a long walk this morning.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The professor looked at him vacantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Were you addressing me?” he inquired.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir,” answered Philip, justly provoked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I haven\u0027t the pleasure of your acquaintance, young man.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish I hadn\u0027t the pleasure of yours,” retorted Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you come here to insult me?” demanded Riccabocca, frowning.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I came here to demand my share of the money received for the entertainment last evening, as well as the money paid for the hall, the printer, and bill-poster.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You must be crazy!” said Riccabocca, shrugging his shoulders. “I don\u0027t know you. I don\u0027t owe you any money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you mean to say we didn\u0027t give an entertainment together last evening at Wilkesville?” asked Philip, rather taken aback by the man\u0027s sublime impudence.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My young friend, you have been dreaming. Prove what you say and I will admit your claim.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Up to this point those present, deceived by the professor\u0027s coolness, really supposed him to be in the right. That was what Riccabocca anticipated, and hoped to get off before the discovery of the truth could be made. But he did not know that Philip had a competent witness at hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Gates!” called Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The portly landlord of the Wilkesville Hotel entered the room, and Riccaboeca saw that the game was up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Gates, will you be kind enough to convince this gentleman that he owes me money?” asked Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think he won\u0027t deny it now,” said Gates significantly. “He walked off from my hotel this morning, leaving his bill unpaid. Professor Riccabocca, it strikes me you had better settle with us, unless you wish to pass the night in the lockup.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Professor Riccabocca gave a forced laugh.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, Mr. de Gray,” he said, “you ought to have known that I was only playing a trick on you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I supposed you were,” said Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I don\u0027t mean that. I was only pretending I didn\u0027t know you, to see if I could act naturally enough, to deceive you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why did you desert me?” asked Philip suspiciously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I started to take a walk—didn\u0027t the bookkeeper tell you?—and finding a chance to ride over here, thought I would do so, and make arrangements for our appearance here. Of course, I intended to come back, and pay our good friend, the landlord, and give you your share of the common fund.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Neither Gates nor Philip believed a word of this. It seemed to them quite too transparent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You may as well pay us now, Professor Riccabocca,” said the landlord dryly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope you don\u0027t suspect my honor or integrity,” said Riccabocca, appearing to be wounded at the thought.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Never mind about that,” said Mr. Gates shortly. “Actions speak louder than words.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am quite ready to settle—quite,” said the professor. “The money is in my room. I will go up and get it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There seemed to be no objection to this, and our two friends saw him ascend the staircase to the second story. Philip felt pleased to think that he had succeeded in his quest, for his share of the concert money would be nearly seventy dollars. That, with the balance of the money; received from Farmer Lovett, would make over a hundred dollars.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They waited five minutes, and the professor did not come down.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What can keep him?” said Philip.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then one of the hostlers entered and caught what our hero had said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A man has just run out of the back door,” he said, “and is cutting across the fields at a great rate.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He must have gone down the back stairs,” said the clerk.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In what direction would he go?” asked Philip hastily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To the railroad station. There is a train leaves in fifteen minutes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What shall we do, Mr. Gates?” asked Philip, in dismay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Jump into my buggy. We\u0027ll get to the depot before the train starts. We must intercept the rascal.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015/83355.html","bookId":276,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:31:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:31:04 AM"}
