{"id":8943,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII","content":"Captain Protheroe walked on rapidly across the dark field-path which led to the little hamlet of Mallet. It was already late, and he did not wish to keep his friends in suspense longer than was needful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly he paused, as he became aware of a confused clamour of sounds proceeding from the direction in which, he was going, but only for a moment, then with a sudden misgiving he commenced to run rapidly forward through the darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cottage where the fugitives were to await him lay on the outskirts of the hamlet, separated from the cluster of other cottages by some fields, and the sounds, now becoming more distinct, came from that direction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A confused murmur of voices met his ears, punctuated by a succession of heavy blows of musket-butts (so he rightly guessed) upon the cottage door; then followed the crash of a door falling, more shouting, above which he could distinguish a voice raised loud in authority, and then the clash of two encountering swords.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A moment later he reached the gateway of the croft within which the cottage stood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There he found a group of peasants, held in check, in spite of much shouting and menacing gestures, by a small body of mounted troopers. Nearer the cottage were some unmounted men, those evidently who had been responsible for the attack upon the door, one or two of whom carried lanterns, and by the combined light this afforded, and that which streamed from the dismantled doorway, there was revealed to Captain Protheroe the incident which formed the central feature of the picture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the doorway of the cottage two men were fighting. The swordsman with his back to the doorway was Sir Ralph. With white set face, and his breath coming in quick gasps, \u0027twas clear he was sore pressed, and wellnigh spent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His opponent, who was slowly but surely driving him to retreat into the passage-way, was a small, dapper little man, in the uniform of an officer of the King\u0027s troops. He fought with a cool precision, and ever and anon as the fight proceeded, he exclaimed admiringly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well thrust, sir, well indeed. Keep back, men, let be. \u0027Tis a fair fight.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a few moments Captain Protheroe stood in amazement, watching this extraordinary scene, then suddenly realising that unless he quickly intervened Ralph must be overcome, he thrust his way past the startled troopers, and ere they could prevent him, seized the little officer round the middle and lifted him aside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The latter, with an exclamation of anger, wrenched himself free, and turned upon the intruder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And by what right, sir——\" he began furiously; but ere he could get further in his speech his hand was seized in a hearty grasp, and Captain Protheroe broke out eagerly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Harrington! Will! You! By all the powers, but luck is with us wherever we go. This is splendid.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Miles Protheroe!\" cried the little man in delight, but restraining himself suddenly, he stared hard at the captain. \"What are you doing here, Protheroe?\" he asked sharply. \"D—— me, I had forgot, you are a rebel, too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the other\u0027s light laugh quickly reassured him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No more a rebel than are these, my friends, here,\" he cried cheerily. \"Look\"—and he handed his passport to Harrington—\"that is all right, isn\u0027t it? By Jove! what a mercy I arrived in time; you were about to make a pretty mess of things, Will.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Plague take that meddlesome pedlar, who brought us out with such a cock-and-bull story as this,\" cried the little officer indignantly. \"Here have I been forced to put your friends—and a lady, too—to most distressing inconvenience and—er—danger, and all to no purpose. Alas! I doubt she will never forgive me. Plague on the fellow! where is he?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the pedlar, who had followed them to the cottage, and having given information had then served as guide to the patrol, was not to be found. He was quick to appreciate that the game again had gone against and had vanished into the night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But what were you after when I arrived, Will?\" asked Captain Protheroe with a laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This gentleman thought fit to hold the doorway, against me. I—I was—-er—about to remove him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he turned politely to Ralph, who had sunk wearily into a seat within the doorway, whence he smiled faintly up at Barbara as she came anxiously from an adjoining room to his side, to ascertain whether he had received any hurt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I must apologise, sir,\" he said with grave politeness, \"for so rudely forcing myself upon your company. \u0027Twas a misconception, which I trust you will pardon. But I fear I can never hope the lady will be equally forgiving.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbara looked up with a bright smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Indeed, sir,\" she said softly, \"we should rather be grateful to you, for the generous manner in which you conducted the attack. We owe you thanks for your courtesy in staying your men from firing upon the house when you discovered I was here, and for your chivalry in insisting upon fighting Sir Ralph single-handed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The little man flushed with pleasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Faith! madame,\" he cried gallantly; \"\u0027twas nothing. However hard pressed a man may be, nothing would excuse discourtesy to a lady. And for the rest, \u0027twas a most enjoyable fight whose interruption is condoned only by the acquaintance thus created.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Protheroe laughed lightly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Zounds! Will, what would the colonel say to your new methods of rebel hunting, eh? He is ever the same, Mistress Barbara; he rides the country with a cumbersome escort, yet doth all the work himself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Harrington again turned to his recent adversary, who still leaned back, with half-closed eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I trust, sir,\" he said anxiously, \"I have not been so excessively clumsy as to wound you in our affray. \u0027Tis a thing I never do, unless mortally.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ralph smiled faintly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rest assured, sir, your hand is still sure.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sir Ralph Trevellyan is but recovering from a fever,\" interposed Barbara gently; \"the encounter hath exhausted him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am well enough, Barbara,\" exclaimed Ralph, struggling to his feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Indeed, you are not,\" she answered firmly. \"Sit still while I fetch some water.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But now Captain Harrington was all contrition. He flew for water, he sent his men for wine. He hovered over Barbara with most assiduous attentions, while she ministered to her exhausted companion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What may I do now?\" implored the little officer, when Barbara had finished her task; \"what may I do to further atone for my mistake? Where are you bound for now, eh?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We are on our road to Durford; it lies north of Taunton, you know; but we can hardly set out to-night. Is there any place hereabouts fit to spend the night in?\" asked Captain Protheroe doubtfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My quarters are but five minutes\u0027 distance from here,\" cried Captain Harrington eagerly; \"if I dared hope to be so greatly honoured.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no,\" cried Barbara quickly; \"indeed, we cannot take your rooms.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Alack! madame, I feared \u0027twas too great an honour to hope for,\" sighed the little man mournfully. \"After my error, too. And yet, if it might have been——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nay, sir,\" interposed Barbara, somewhat puzzled how to meet such unexpected humility. \"If you will indeed be so generous——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It will be the best thing we can do,\" interposed Captain Protheroe. \"And to-morrow, perchance, you can lend us mounts as far as Durford.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Willingly, willingly,\" was the eager reply.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then let us be off. Where is Nannie?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m here, Master Miles,\" answered the old lady, calmly entering from the adjoining room where she had been soothing the terror of the bed-ridden owner of the cottage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah! that\u0027s well. We must be moving. Set the old fellow\u0027s mind at ease and come along. You shall come back to him to-morrow, an you choose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All was quiet when they came out of the cottage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Straight along that path, Miles!\" cried Captain Harrington eagerly, pointing out the direction; \"you can\u0027t miss the way. I will escort the lady.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not so,\" answered Captain Protheroe resolutely, putting Barbara\u0027s cloak about her; \"I will escort Mistress Barbara. You can best lead the way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Harrington glanced for a moment at the speaker, then with a deep sigh, and a mournful shake of the head, he shrugged his shoulders, and taking Ralph\u0027s arm, turned along the path towards the village.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Alack!\" he muttered to himself, \"Alack! The early bird!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mistress Barbara,\" pleaded Captain Protheroe, as they followed the others along the narrow way, \"Mistress Barbara, you have not said one word to me since I arrived.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I had nothing to say,\" she answered, smiling. Then she added softly, \"I knew you would come.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with that he strove to be content.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1875/54247.html","bookId":805,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:51:14 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:51:14 AM"}
