You Letherii have initiated a campaign of extermination. Had we Edur elected to cross that threshold, would you not have called us barbarians in truth? You do not hold the high ground in this conflict, no matter how you seek to justify your actions.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Overseer,’ Bivatt said coldly, ‘I care nothing about justifications, nor moral high ground. I have been a soldier too long to believe such things hold any sway over our actions. Whatever lies in our power to do, we do.’ She gestured at the destroyed encampment around them. ‘Citizens of Lether have been murdered. It is my responsibility to give answer to that, and so I shall.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And who will win?’ Brohl Handar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We will, of course.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Atri-Preda. You will lose. As will the Awl. The victors are men such as Factor Letur Anict. Alas, such people as the Factor view you and your soldiers little differently from how they view their enemies. You are to be used, and this means that many of you will die. Letur Anict does not care. He needs you to win this victory, but beyond that his need for you ends… until a new enemy is found. Tell me, do empires exist solely to devour? Is there no value in peace? In order and prosperity and stability and security? Are the only worthwhile rewards the stacks of coin in Letur Anict’s treasury? He would have it so-all the rest is incidental and only useful if it serves him. Atri-Preda, you are in truth less than an Indebted. You are a slave-I am not wrong in this, for I am a Tiste Edur who possesses slaves. A slave, Bivatt, is how Letur Anict and his kind see you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tell me, Overseer, how would you fare without your slaves?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Poorly, no doubt.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned about and walked back to her horse. ‘Mount up. We’re returning to Drene.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And these dead citizens of the empire? Do you leave their bodies to the vultures?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In a month even the bones will be gone,’ Bivatt said, swinging onto her horse and gathering the reins. ‘The whittle beetles will gnaw them all to dust. Besides, there is not enough soil to dig proper graves.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are stones,’ Brohl Handar noted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Covered in Awl glyphs. To use them would be to curse the dead.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, so the enmity persists, so that even the ghosts war with each other. It is a dark world you inhabit, Atri-Preda.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down at him for a moment, then said, ‘Are the shadows any better, Overseer?’ When he made no reply, she said, ‘On your horse, sir, if you please.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ganetok encampment, swollen with the survivors of the Sevond and Niritha clans, sprawled across the entire valley. Beyond to the east loomed vast dun-hued clouds from the main herds in the next few valleys. The air was gritty with dust and the acrid smell of hearth fires. Small bands of warriors moved back and forth like gangs of thugs, weapons bristling, their voices loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutriders had made contact with Redmask and his paltry tribe earlier in the day, yet had kept their distance, seemingly more interested in the substantial herd of rodara trailing the small group. An unexpected wealth for so few Awl, leaving possession open to challenge, and it was clear to Redmask as he drew rein on a rise overlooking the encampment that word had preceded them, inciting countless warriors into bold challenge, one and all coveting rodara and eager to strip the beasts away from the mere handful of Renfayar warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, he would have to disappoint them. ‘Masarch,’ he now said, ‘remain here with the others. Accept no challenges.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No-one has come close enough to see your mask,’ the youth said. ‘No-one suspects what you seek, War Leader. As soon as they do, we shall be under siege.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you fear, Masarch?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Dying? No, not any more.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you are a child no longer. Wait, do nothing.’ Redmask nudged his horse onto the slope, gathering it into a collected canter as he approached the Ganetok encampment. Eyes fixed on him, then held, as shouts rose, the voices more angry than shocked. Until the nearer warriors made note of his weapons. All at once a hush fell over the encampment, rippling in a wave, and in its wake rose a murmuring, the anger he had first heard only now with a deeper timbre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDray dogs caught the burgeoning rage and drew closer, fangs bared and hackles stiff. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-72.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
