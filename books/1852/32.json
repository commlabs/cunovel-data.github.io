You weren\u0027t hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe caring in his eyes stunned her. \"I knew you\u0027d save me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you be knowing that?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you care, Alec Kincaid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had imitated his burr perfectly. Alec nodded, pleased with her answer. He stood up, keeping her head tucked under his chin. He noticed the crowd of soldiers when he turned to walk down the hil .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s none the worse for her mishap,\" he called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie tried to pul away just a little so she could nod to his men, but Alec slammed her back against his chest in a hug as fierce as a bear\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inadvertently squeezed another cough out of her, too. The man simply didn\u0027t know his own strength, she thought happily. He didn\u0027t know his actions were so tel ing, either. She could feel the tremors in his arms. And when she\u0027d been waiting for him to save her, it was her name she\u0027d heard him bel owing. He was beginning to love her, if only just a little, whether he was will ing to admit it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat realization made her forget all about her brush with death. \"You took your sweet time coming after me, Kincaid,\" she reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hel I did,\" he countered with a grin. \"I ran like Satan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not so insignificant to you after all , am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer her until they\u0027d reached the castle doors. \"No, you\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized after a long minute that he wasn\u0027t going to give her any more than that. But all the same, she was enormously happy with him. One bite at a time, she reminded herself. That was how she\u0027d boasted to Father Murdock she could eat a giant bear, and that was how she was going to conquer Alec Kincaid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed again, though this time over her own foolishness. Why had it taken her so long to realize she needed his love as much as he needed hers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be laughing now, Lady Kincaid?\" Gavin asked. He saw the doors opened for them, then followed the pair inside. \"I\u0027m stil shaking with anger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was laughing because I\u0027ve just realized something quite important,\" Jamie answered. \"It\u0027s not going to be one bite at a time, you see, but one kiss at a time. There is a marked difference. And that\u0027s the only explanation you\u0027l be getting out of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The smoke has obviously affected her mind,\" Alec interjected, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you so angry, Gavin?\" Jamie asked. She glanced over Alec\u0027s shoulder to see the soldier\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be thinking this is all my fault, can you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Gavin could respond, Jamie turned back to Alec. \"The wind caused my mishap, husband. It was so strong, it pushed the door right into my backside. It was high, all right,\" she continued when both men looked as if they didn\u0027t believe her. \"The howling noise was eerie, too. Do you know it sounded as though someone was laughing at me? Alec, why are you looking so doubtful? Don\u0027t you believe me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe you,\" Alec told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know it wasn\u0027t your fault, milady,\" Gavin interjected. \"The door was…\" He didn\u0027t finish his explanation when he caught Alec\u0027s signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The door was what, Gavin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stuck. It was stuck,\" he blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, it surely was,\" Jamie agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gavin, go and order a bath for Jamie. Then return to the hil and begin questioning the servants. Surely one of them will have a few important answers for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec carried Jamie behind the screen and gently placed her on his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After your bath, you\u0027l stay in bed the rest of the day,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Jamie? Because you need to recover,\" Alec explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already recovered,\" Jamie argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had to shake his head over her attitude. \"You should be weeping now, lass, not smiling so sweetly up at me. Don\u0027t you know how soft you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must stay in bed because I\u0027m… soft? Alec, that doesn\u0027t make a bit of sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat there on the side of the bed, her face streaked with dirt, her hair tangled, her soot-marred hands folded demurely in her lap; she sat there looking absolutely beautiful to him. The servants marched in with buckets of water. Jamie gave each one a cheerful greeting. She not only remembered their names but also the names of their husbands and children. Alec was impressed. Her memory was really quite remarkable. When she asked each woman about her kin, she was letting her know how much she valued her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women, he noticed, gave Jamie just as much affection in their greetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, even dour-faced old Hessie, the main cook, was smiling at her mistress. \"Wil you be up to directing the men with the… kitchen work?\" she asked, after giving her laird a timid look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie held her smile. \"He noticed the hole, Hessie,\" she whispered. \"And I have no intention of putting off the work. I\u0027l —\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027l take over that duty,\" Alec announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked extremely pleased with him. He wondered then if that wasn\u0027t her goal all the while. \"Angus can direct the soldiers,\" Alec stated, \"after I\u0027ve explained what I want done.\" He\u0027d stressed the word \"I\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein his announcement, but he could tel by Jamie\u0027s smile that she stil thought she was getting her own way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hole will be boarded up until the hall is finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hal ? I don\u0027t understand,\" Jamie confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want the kitchen directly attached,\" Alec countered. \"The smoke from the cooking will fil the hall by noon. We\u0027l make a covered hall way to connect the two buildings. Does that satisfy you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe guessed it didn\u0027t satisfy her when she gave him a suspicious look. \"How long will this hall way be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not long,\" he heard himself promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, pleased now. \"There, Hessie,\" she announced. \"I told you Alec would see the rightness in this change.\" She noticed her husband\u0027s frown and hurried to add, \"Al of his clan is important to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to Alec and added, \"I\u0027ve told Hessie that your soldiers and your servants deserve equal status in your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did surprise her then. \"That is true,\" he said. \"You needn\u0027t have told Hessie,\" he added with a nod toward the servant. \"She understands her value.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servant immediately straightened her shoulders with pride. Then she bowed to her laird and hurried to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have your bath now, wife, before the wind turns your water to ice,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had kept his smile firmly in place, yet when he was again on the other side of the screen, he quit his pretense. He started pacing in front of the hearth while he tried to reason through this atrocity. Someone had actually tried to kil his precious Jamie. If he hadn\u0027t gotten there in time… If he\u0027d stayed inside the stables just a few minutes more…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec? No one saw a damn thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec stopped pacing when Gavin called out to him. \"Lower your voice,\" he ordered. \"I don\u0027t want Jamie overhearing any of this talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s already overhearing,\" Jamie called out from behind the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec let his exasperation show, then beckoned Gavin closer. \"Jamie, don\u0027t listen,\" he called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t help listening,\" she called back. \"Have you noticed, Alec, the horrible lack of privacy? I asked Father Murdock if he thought I could move our things up to one of the bedrooms above the stairs, husband. Did he mention that request to you yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have asked me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were busy,\" she shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She sure as hel doesn\u0027t sound as if she just went through a fire, does she, Gavin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a lot stronger than we think she is,\" he told his lord quietly. \"Father Murdock might be right, after all .\" Gavin had kept his voice low so his mistress wouldn\u0027t overhear him. His bid to exclude her didn\u0027t work, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course Father Murdock is right, Gavin,\" Jamie sang out. \"He\u0027s a man of God, if you\u0027l remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jamie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec, I\u0027l close my ears to your conversation just as soon as you give me your answer. Surely you can see the wisdom in my request. We could be moved upstairs before—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? well , yes, of course,\" she called out Alec grinned. She hadn\u0027t meant to move upstairs by herself after all . He told himself he never actually believed she\u0027d entertained such a vile thought of having her own quarters. Stil , she hadn\u0027t properly explained her plan, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027l move upstairs tomorrow,\" he called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Alec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A wife doesn\u0027t thank her husband. Now, have your bath without interrupting me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had made his tone as harsh as he could manage. Jamie\u0027s laughter indicated it hadn\u0027t been harsh enough, however. His shoulders slumped with disappointment. \"Tel me what you learned,\" he ordered Gavin as he leaned back against the mantel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry had a long conversation with Jamie, then went back to his duties. As you know, our blacksmith\u0027s hearing is anything but sound. He said he was bent over his worktable and didn\u0027t notice anyone coming or going. I questioned all the others, Alec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And…?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin shook his head. \"They\u0027d gone for their nooning meal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone must have seen—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alec, the hil was all but deserted,\" Gavin interrupted. \"Why don\u0027t you want to tel Jamie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want her to worry,\" Alec admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She needs to be on her guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we\u0027l be on our guard for her. Once we\u0027ve found out who it was, then I\u0027l tel her. She isn\u0027t going to be left alone again. When I can\u0027t be by her side, either you or Marcus will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin nodded. \"I don\u0027t want her frightened, either,\" he whispered. \"She has come to mean a great deal to me,\" he admitted. \"I cannot believe this treachery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one of our own,\" Alec stated. \"And when I find him…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie\u0027s voice reached the men then. She was singing to herself while she had her bath, a rather bawdy English bal ad it was, which drew smiles and raised eyebrows from her appreciative audience. \"She acts as though nothing out of the ordinary has taken place,\" Alec remarked, shaking his head over that odd fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand why she wants her bedroom upstairs,\" Gavin said.\" \u0027Tis the truth, milord, you can hear every little sound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec nodded. \"Keep everyone outside the hall ,\" he ordered. He moved away from the hearth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going, Alec?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To bed?\" Gavin repeated, looking incredulous. \"It isn\u0027t even noon yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec turned around and gave his second-in-command a most exasperated look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See that I\u0027m not disturbed,\" Alec stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin finally understood. The soldier grinned as he walked toward the entrance. His intent was to stand guard in front of the double doors. \"Have a fair rest, Alec,\" he called out, the laughter in his voice quite obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie had finished her bath and had just stood up in the tub when Alec came strol ing around the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she saw him, she let out a loud gasp and sat back down. She tried to cover her br**sts by bringing her knees up and leaning forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any clothes on,\" she informed him, stating the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never paused in his stride. Jamie suddenly found herself hauled up against his chest. He turned with her in his arms. Before she could even think to ask him what in heaven\u0027s name he was doing, he had her flat on the bed. She didn\u0027t have time to blush. Alec trapped her hands above her head and covered her with his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t kiss her but seemed content to grin down at her with that rascal\u0027s look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer br**sts were warmed by his bare chest, her thighs heated by his own heavy ones, and she couldn\u0027t seem to stop rubbing her toes against his bare legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d taken his boots off. That thought registered in her befuddled mind just as the realization he might want to make love to her hit. \"Alec, are you thinking what I think you\u0027re thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wearing my plaid now,\" he countered. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not wearing anything,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, you are. Your back is covered by the plaid blanket and I\u0027m covering your front with my plaid. Yes, you\u0027re wearing my plaid all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t fault that reasoning. \"Is this how you think to get me to rest, husband?\" she asked, a teasing lilt in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Her disappointment couldn\u0027t have been more obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will rest,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not at all tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will be.\" He nudged her legs apart and settled himself between her thighs. \"You\u0027l be very tired when I\u0027ve finished with you. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was looking a little too arrogant, to her way of thinking. She pul ed her hands away from his easy grip and put them around his neck. \"You\u0027l be just as tired, husband, when I\u0027ve finished with you. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might have managed a smile, but the passion in her was already affecting him. Her eyes had turned a deep violet. Her legs were moving restlessly against him. When she moved so she could keep him pressed more intimately against her, he let out a low growl of desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nibbled at her lips, just to make her frustrated, then slowly drew her full lower lip inside his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, tel ing him without words how much she liked what he was doing to her. His hands moved to cup the sides of her face to keep her just where he wanted her while he took his sweet time ravishing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to make slow love to her, no matter how much she provoked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips were so soft, so pliant, and when his tongue finally sank deep inside her warm mouth, she started to make those sexy little whimpers in the back of her throat. He stroked, plundered, gave, and took, until Jamie was pul ing on his hair with her demand for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds she gave him made him forget his good intentions. The sleek thrusts of his tongue made her bolder. He placed wet, hot kisses along her neck, drawing shivers from her. She caressed his shoulders, his back, his buttocks, drawing tremors from him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-bride-lairds-fiancees-1/page-32.html","bookId":1852,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:43 PM"}
