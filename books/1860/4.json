{"id":81785,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe Worst Ending Imaginable\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing that Nikki does a big unit on Hemingway every year, I ask for one of Hemingway\u0027s better novels. \"One with a love story if possible, because I really need to study love - so I can be a better husband when Nikki comes back,\" I tell Mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mom returns from the library, she says that the librarian claims A Farewell to Arms is Hemingway\u0027s best love story. So I eagerly crack open the book and can feel myself getting smarter as I turn the first few pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I read, I look for quotable lines so I can \"drop knowledge\" the next time Nikki and I are out with her literary friends - so I can say to that glasses-wearing Phillip, \"Would an illiterate buffoon know this line?\" And then I will drop some Hemingway, real suave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the novel is nothing but a trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole time, you root for the narrator to survive the war and then for him to have a nice life with Catherine Barkley. He does survive all sorts of dangers - even getting blown up - and finally escapes to Switzerland with the pregnant Catherine, whom he loves so much. They live in the mountains for a time, in love and living a good life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHemingway should have ended there, because that was the silver lining these people deserved after struggling to survive the gloomy war.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead he thinks up the worst ending imaginable: Hemingway has Catherine die from hemorrhaging after their child is stillborn. It is the most torturous ending I have ever experienced and probably will ever experience in literature, movies, or even television.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am crying so hard at the end, partly for the characters, yes, but also because Nikki actually teaches this book to children. I cannot imagine why anyone would want to expose impressionable teenagers to such a horrible ending. Why not just tell high school students that their struggle to improve themselves is all for nothing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to admit that for the first time since apart time began, I am mad at Nikki for teaching such pessimism in her classroom. I will not be quoting Hemingway anytime soon, nor will I ever read another one of his books. And if he were still alive, I would write him a letter right now and threaten to strangle him dead with my bare hands just for being so glum. No wonder he put a gun to his head, like it says in the introductory essay. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silver-linings-playbook/page-4.html","bookId":1860,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:00 PM"}
