{"id":108065,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\u003cp\u003eSeymour takes me to my car and tries to follow me back to Mayfair. But I speed away at a hundred miles an hour. He is not insulted, I\u0027m sure. I warned him I\u0027m in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go to my mansion by the sea. I have not described it before because to me a house is a house. I do not fall in love with them as do some mortals. The house is on twenty acres of property, at the top of a wooded yard that reaches from my front porch all the way down to the rocky shore. The driveway is narrow and winding, mostly hidden. The house itself is mainly brick, Tudor style, unusual for this part of the country. There are three stories; the top one has a wide view of the sea and coast. There are many rooms, fireplaces and such, but I do most of my living in the living room, even though it has wide skylights that I have yet to board up. I do not need a lot of space to be happy, although I have lived in mansions or castles since the Middle Ages. I could be quite happy living in a box. I say that as a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy tastes in furniture are varied. At present I surround myself with lots of wood: the chairs, the tables, the cabinets. I sleep on a bed, not in a coffin, a grand mahogany affair with a black lace canopy. I have gathered art over the centuries and have a vast and expensive collection of paintings and sculptures in Europe, but none of it in America. I have gone through phases where art is important to me, but I am not in one now. Still, I have a piano wherever I go. I play almost every day, and with my speed and agility, I am the most accomplished pianist in the world. But I seldom write music, not because I am not creative, but because my melodies and songs are invariably sad. I do not know why--I do not think of myself as a sad vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, though, I am an anxious vampire, and it has been centuries since I felt the emotion. I do not like it. I hurry into my home and change and then rush back out to my car. My concern is for Ray. If it is Yaksha after me, and I have little doubt now, then he may try to get to me through Ray. It seems a logical course to me based on the fact that Yaksha probably first became aware of me through Ray\u0027s father. I now suspect Yaksha has been observing me since I first\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evisited Mr. Riley\u0027s office. But why he didn\u0027t attack immediately, I don\u0027t know. Maybe he wanted to study the enemy he hadn\u0027t seen for so long, to probe for weaknesses. Yet Yaksha, more than any living or nonliving being, already knows where I am vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am still in shock that he is alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive to Ray\u0027s house and leap to the front door. I half expect to find him gone, abducted. For a moment I consider not ringing the doorbell, but to just barge in. I have to remind myself that Ray is not Seymour, capable of accepting anything that comes along. I knock on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePat surprises me when she answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girlfriend is not happy to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" Pat demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have come to see Ray.\" Pat must have called Ray\u0027s house while he was at my place, probably several times. She must have called not long after he came home. He probably invited her over to pacify her concerns. But she does not look that pacified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s asleep,\" Pat says. She starts to slam the door in my face. I stick out my arm. She tries to force it shut. Naturally, she is not successful. \"Get out of here. Can\u0027t you tell when you\u0027re not wanted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pat,\" I say patiently. \"Things are not as they appear. They are much more complicated. I need to see Ray because I believe he is in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot tell you, not easily. I have to talk to Ray and I have to talk to him now.\" I put my eye on her. \"Please do not try to stop me. It would not be a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cowers under my stare. I move to press her farther, but it becomes unnecessary. Upstairs, I hear Ray climb out of bed. I wait a few seconds, then call out his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ray!\" I say. I hear his steps quicken. We both do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s mine,\" Pat mutters as we wait for Ray to arrive. She is sad, seemingly defeated already. Instinctively she knows I have a power she does not, beyond my beauty. Her love for him is genuine, I can see that, a rare thing in a girl her age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have hope,\" I say sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay appears. He has on sweat pants, no top. \"What\u0027s going on?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of things. I need to talk to you, alone.\" I glance at Pat. \"If that would be all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes are damp. She lowers her head. \"I can just go,\" she mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay puts a hand on her shoulder. \"No.\" He gives me a sharp glance. I have to be careful. \"Tell me what it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to do with your father,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is concerned. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am stubborn. \"I must tell you alone.\" I add, \"I\u0027m sorry, Pat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay rubs her back. \"Go upstairs to bed. I\u0027ll be up in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePat shakes her head, giving me a look as she leaves. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we are alone, Ray wants me to explain myself. \"You told me you wouldn\u0027t hurt Pat,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My coming here could not be helped. I have not been entirely honest with you, Ray. I think you suspect that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You tampered with the file on my father\u0027s computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I turned on the computer, I noted the size of the file. It was large. When I returned, most of it had been deleted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. \"That file was about me. Your father was investigating me. He was hired by some people to do so, one man in particular. This man is dangerous. Tonight he sent some people to abduct me. I managed to get away. I believe he may come after you next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he knows you are my friend. I believe he has been watching me today and tonight. Also, even though this man hired your father, your father did not part company with him on the best of terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The people who came for me tonight told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, they came for you? Were they armed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how did you get away from them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They made a mistake, and I am resourceful. I do not want to get into all of that now. What is important is that you come with me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going anywhere until you tell me where my father is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitate. It is not easy for me to lie to those I love. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay is suspicious. His sense of the truth, and therefore of lies, is remarkable. \"Do you think my father is in danger?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hears the truth in that word. \"We should call the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I grab his arm. \"The police cannot help us. You have to come with me. Trust me, Ray. I can tell you more once we are at my house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What will we do at your house that we can\u0027t do here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will see,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay consents to accompany me. He goes upstairs to say goodbye to Pat. I hear her crying, and wonder if she will not shed a stream of tears in the days to come. I could be wrong. I could be bringing Ray into danger, not away from it. I scan up and down the street but see nothing. Yet I feel eyes on me, powerful eyes such as my own. I wonder if I am not reaching for Ray because I am afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe afraid to die alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay reappears in a few minutes, dressed. We go to my car. He has not seen it before and marvels that I have a Ferrari. We drive toward my mansion and he wonders why we are not going the same way as before. I tell him I have two houses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am very rich,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that one of the reasons my father was investigating you?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Indirectly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you spoken to my father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two and a half days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At his office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay is annoyed. \"You didn\u0027t tell me. Why did you speak to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He called me into his office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to be more careful than ever. \"He wanted to tell me that I was being investigated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted to warn you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe so. But--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t fully understand who had hired him, the nature of the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you know this man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. From a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He changes his name often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you?\" Ray asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy is full of surprises. I reach over and touch his leg. \"You are worried about your father. I understand. Please try not to judge me too harshly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are not being completely honest with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you what I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you say my father is in danger, what exactly do you mean? Would this man kill my father?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has killed in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe space inside the car is suddenly cramped. Ray hears beyond my words. \"Is my father dead already?\" he asks quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to lie, I have no choice. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrive at my house. No one has come while I was away, I can tell. I activate the security system. It is the most elaborate available on the market. Every wire of every section of fence around my house is now heavily electrified. There are motion sensors and laser beams and radar tracking the perimeter. I know it will not stop Yaksha for a second if he wishes to come for me. At a minimum he has twice my strength and speed. In reality I think he is much more powerful than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay wanders around my house, taking in the sights. He pauses and looks out over the ocean. A waning moon, half full, hangs over the dark shadow of the water. We face west, but behind us, in the east, I detect a hint of dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What next?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want to do next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faces me. \"You are waiting for this man to come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps. He could come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said something about arming yourself. Do you have guns here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But I\u0027m not going to give you one. It would not help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you some kind of expert with guns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is exasperated. \"Who the hell are you, Sita? If that is even your real name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is my real name. Few people know it. It is the name my father gave me. The man I am talking about--he is the one who murdered my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we call the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This man is very powerful. He has almost unlimited resources. The police would not be able to stop him if he wants to hurt us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how are you going to stop him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are we here? Why don\u0027t we just get in the car and drive away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis question is an interesting one; it has a certain logic to it. I have considered the option since disposing of Slim. Yet I do not believe that I can run successfully from Yaksha, not once he has got me in his sights, which he obviously does. I do not like to postpone the inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can drive away if you want,\" I say. \"You can take my car and go home. Or you can take my car and drive to Los Angeles. That might be the best thing for you to do. I can tell you for a fact that while you are here you are in extreme danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why did you bring me here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn away. \"I do not know why. But I think--I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This man--his real name is Yaksha--he knows you are my friend. You are part of the equation that deals with me--in his mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn back to Ray. \"He has been watching me since I saw your father, I\u0027m sure of it. But he has not come for me personally. Oh, he sent his people after me, but that is not the same thing, not to him and not to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that I afford you some protection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly. More, I think he is curious about my relationship with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not make friends easily. He knows that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay sighs. \"I don\u0027t even know if I am your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words sting, more than the bullet I was hit with earlier in the night. I reach out and touch his face. Such a beautiful face, so like Rama\u0027s, even though they do not look that much alike. Their essence is similar. Maybe Krishna was right. Maybe their souls are the same, if there are such things. I doubt I have one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I care more for you than I have cared for anyone in a long time,\" I say. \"I am much older than I look. I have been more lonely than I have been willing to admit to myself. But when I met you, that loneliness eased. I am your friend, Ray, even if you do not want to be mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares at me, as if he, too, knows me, then lowers his lips to kiss my hand that touches him. His next words come to me as if from far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes I look at you and you do not look human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re like something carved from glass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old but always new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you are a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he does not ask me if I am a vampire. He knows better. He knows I will tell him the truth, and he does not want to hear it. He kisses my hand again, and I lean forward to kiss his lips. Long and deep--he does not smother this time and I am glad. He wants to make love, I can tell, and I am very glad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start a roaring blaze in the living room fireplace, many logs piled high. There is a rug from ancient Persia on top of the wall-to-wall carpeting in front of the fire; it is where I sometimes sleep, when the sun is high. I bring in blankets and pillows. We undress slowly; I let Ray take off my clothes. He touches my body, and I kiss his from head to foot. Then we lie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown together and the sex is a wonder to him, as well as to me. I am careful not to hurt him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when he is asleep, I go for an automatic weapon in the attic. I load the clip carefully, making sure all the parts are well oiled, ready for use. Then I return to Ray\u0027s side and put the weapon under my pillow. Ray is exhausted; I stroke his head and whisper words that will cause him to sleep away the entire day. I suspect Yaksha will not come until the following night--a fresh night for a fresh slaughter. It would be his way. I know my gun will not stop him. I have only Krishna\u0027s promise to protect me. But what is the promise of a God I don\u0027t even know if I believe in?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet one thing is certain. If Krishna was not God, he was the most extraordinary human who ever lived. Even more powerful than all the vampires combined. I think of him as I lie beside Ray, and I wonder about my feelings of love for the boy. If they are just my longing for the face of Krishna hidden inside him. I do remember Krishna\u0027s face well. It was a face that would be impossible to forget even after five thousand years. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-vampire-the-last-vampire-1/page-8.html","bookId":2511,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:47 PM"}
