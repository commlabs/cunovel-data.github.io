Brooke “Little Firecracker” Dumas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI promised her a church wedding. And a church wedding is what she’ll get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I swear if you frown any harder at the door, it’s going to collapse under your stare,” my PA, Pete, calls from the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing around to where he and Riley have been watching me pace around the living room of Brooke’s old Seattle apartment. Apparently those two are amused as fuck by me. Dipshits. I don’t see what’s so amusing. Turning back to the bedroom door, I continue pacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the life of me, I can’t imagine what’s taking her so long. It’s been exactly fifty-eight minutes since she locked herself up in our bedroom to get ready, when Brooke—my fucking Brooke—usually gets dressed in five.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, it’s her wedding day. Chicks take a lot of time to get prepped.” Riley thrusts his arms out in the air in a gesture that implies That’s life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like you’re an expert now,” Pete jabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the dress!” Melanie, Brooke’s best friend, says, exploding out of the master bedroom with a trail of white stuff that looks like a veil. “It has all these buttons . . . and what are you three doing here anyway? Remington, I talked to Brooke about it. You guys should leave and we’ll meet you at the altar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s fucking ridiculous,” I say, laughing. But when Melanie keeps staring at the three of us, and especially me, with an expression someone might use on a couple of dogs they want to scat, I scowl and head to the bedroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI curl my fingers around the doorknob and speak through the closure slit. “Brooke?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remy, please don’t come in here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come to the door, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I hear shuffling, I press closer to the edge and drop my voice so the dipshits on the living room couch don’t hear. “Why the fuck can’t I see you right now, baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this entering and exiting the room by Melanie, with me separated by a locked door from my soon-to-be wife? I don’t like it. And separated despite the fact that she’s supposed to be getting dressed for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess because I want you to see me walk up to you,” she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, that voice, right there. Makes me want to throw the door down and kiss the hell out of her, then do stuff to her under that dress she’s trying to put on—the things that husbands do to their fucking wives. “I will see you walk up to me, baby, I just want to see you now too. Open the door and I’ll do your buttons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can undo them later and then do me.” The cheeky statement is followed by a soft “Gaaah,” like someone—a very little someone—is amused about something on the other side of this door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, Riptide,” Melanie says as she returns, and waves me away from the door. “You boys should head out to church. We’ll see you there in thirty minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl when she slides inside the bedroom like a goddamn worm through a tiny slit, preventing me from so much as glimpsing Brooke. Using much the same method, the much-larger Josephine steps out with something squirming against her chest. My son looks at me from the crook of her arm and falls still; his lips are curled in such a way that he almost wears the same amused expression Pete and Riley do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes the hand he’s got stuck inside his mouth and slaps it flat and wet to my jaw. “Gah!” he says, then squirms and flings himself to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching him, I nuzzle his stomach and growl, which elicits another “Gaaaaaah!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I lift my head to look into his eyes, he’s fucking delighted. And so am I, but I growl again like I’m not and grumble at him, “You think I’m funny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gaaah!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes are all mischief. His head is smaller than my palm as I cup it and buzz the fuzz on the top of his head. My four-month-old, Racer, the son Brooke gave me? He’s the most perfect thing I’ve ever done in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never thought I’d have something like him. Now my life revolves around this dimpled squirrel, who pukes on all my fucking T-shirts, and my Brooke. And, god, where do I start with her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete slaps my back with a loud thunk. “All right, dude, you heard them. And watch it—he’s going to get all that baby stuff on your suit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClamping my jaw, I pat Racer’s head and he grins at me. He has one dimple, not two. Brooke says it’s because he’s only half mine. I contest he’s all mine, and so is she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling back at him, I return him to Josephine, who assures me, “Go peacefully, Mr. Tate, I’ve got this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s supposed to be a bodyguard, but I don’t know what the hell she is now. She strolls outside with Racer and does some nanny work too. He sticks his fingers into her hair and pulls and she even seems to like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a glance at the kitchen clock, I level my gaze at her. “I want her there in fifteen minutes,” I say, and she nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA limo is waiting for my bride, but Riley’s got the keys to Melanie’s convertible, parked just outside without the top down. We all leap inside. I drop down on the front passenger seat and then stare up at the window of our temporary apartment. I can’t understand what the big fuss is about wedding-dress buttons. As far as I’m concerned, I should ride, in the car, with my wife, to the fucking church, where we marry. Period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rem. It’s not like she’s going to leave you standing at the altar, man,” Riley says, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I know,” I whisper, turning back around. But sometimes I just don’t know. Sometimes all my chest feels knotted and I think about waking one morning to find Brooke and my son gone, and dying is too easy to describe what I want to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty-eight minutes, she’ll be walking up to the altar in white, just for you,” Pete says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare out in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrooke has been excited about this all month. Wondering if this, if that, if a cake, if not a cake. I’d say yes to anything that made her voice more excited, and she’d kiss me like I like. So now she seems in control, getting dressed, ready for her day, and I feel like a mess because she’d said she didn’t mind us driving together to the church. And then her best friend put stupid-girl ideas in her head. I ride alone. To a church I never go to. To marry my wife. She’s right behind us, but I’m not good. I’m fucking anxious and this is an anxiety that would have been appeased if she’d opened the door and just looked at me with those gold eyes—my mind would have gone still and all the roiling in my chest would have gone quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s not happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I have twenty-seven infernal minutes to go . . . and my mind is playing tricks on me like it does when it starts swinging like a pendulum, and the only way I can seem to stop it is with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTapping my foot, I stroke the ring in my hand. Then I pull it off and it helps to see her name on its inscription: TO MY REAL, YOUR BROOKE DUMAS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePAST\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE DAY I SAW HER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seattle crowd roars as I come trotting out onto the Underground walkway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar at the end and directly in my line of vision, the ring awaits. Twenty-three feet by twenty-three feet, four ropes parallel on each side, four fucking posts, and that’s about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat ring is a home to me. When I’m not on it, I miss it. When I train, I think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery step I take in its direction pumps me up and gets me going. My veins dilate, my heartbeat works to feed my muscles. My mind sharpens and clears. Every inch of me readies to attack, defend, and survive—and give these people the thrill they’re all yelling for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remy! I love you, Remy!” I hear them yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll suck your cock for you, Remy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“REMY, POUND ME, REMY!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remington, I want your Riptide!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStretching out my fingers, I grab the top rope and jump over it into the ring, taking a look at the people surrounding me. The lights are shining. My name is on everyone’s lips. And all their excitement and anticipation spins around me in a fun little whirlwind. They’re yelling and waving pink shit at me. They want me up here. Right here. Just me, some asshole opponent, and our fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whip off my robe and hand it to Riley, my friend and Coach’s second, while people rise to their feet and scream louder as I turn to acknowledge the crowd. They’re all standing. All looking at me like I’m their God of War and tonight is the night I will give them vengeance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fucking love it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fucking love those yells, the women screaming about the kind of shit they want me to do to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remy! Remy!” a crazy-sounding female shouts at the top of her lungs. “You’re so fucking hot, Remy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn in amusement, and my gaze runs down the crowded aisle and snags on her. The one with long mahogany hair, and amber eyes, and pink, plump lips that immediately part in shock. I feel stupefied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy instincts kick in, and I take in the stranger with one quick sweep. She’s young, athletic, and dressed demurely, but there’s nothing demure about the way she runs her wide, disbelieving eyes all over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly god, I feel like she’s just run her tongue all over my cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her eyes lock on mine, I raise a brow in a question, silently asking her, Did you just shout at me or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cheeks flood a nice shade of pink, and I realize it was her friend who yelled, her friend who pales compared to her. This one doesn’t strike me as the kind to be courting the attentions of someone like me. But she’s got all my hunter buttons engaged, and now I want her and I’m going to have her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wink at her, but I can instantly tell she’s not feeling playful. She looks appalled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kirk Dirkwood, the Hammer, here for all of you tonight!” the guy with the microphone yells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips curl as I turn to watch Dirkwood hop into the ring and remove his cover, and I flex my arms and curl my fingers until my knuckles pop out. My body feels good—every muscle is warm and ready to contract. I know I’m good as fuck, but I want this girl to know it. I’m feeling very, very possessive, and I don’t want her to look at anyone but me. I want her to see I’m the strongest, the fastest. Hell, as far as I know, I want her to think I’m the only man in the whole damn world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk is big and slow as a snail. He throws the first punch, but I can see it coming from the moment he even starts thinking about moving. I duck and come back with a punch that knocks him to the side and rocks his balance. She’s watching me, I know it. The heat in her gaze makes me fight harder and faster. Hell, I own this ring. I love everything about it. I know its dimensions, the feel of the canvas under my feet, the heat of the lights on me. I have never lost a single Underground fight. People know that no matter how badly I get beat up, I always get back up and finish the battle on my terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut tonight? I feel immortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd starts chanting my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“REMY . . . REMY . . . REMY.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s my ring. My crowd. My fight. My fucking night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I hear that voice again. Not her, but the woman she came with. “Ohmigod, hit him, Remy! Just knock him dead, you sexy beast!” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/remy-real-3/page-1.html","bookId":2738,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:37:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:37:43 PM"}
