Diane looked at it in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s who you are.\" \"You\u0027re wrong,\" Kelly said. \"That\u0027s what I do, Mrs. Stevens. It\u0027s not who I am.\" She turned and walked into the lobby, and an exasperated Diane followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Chinese clerk was seated behind a desk in the small hotel lobby, reading a copy of the China Post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would like a room for the night,\" Diane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk glanced up at the two elegantly dressed women and almost said aloud, Here? He rose. \"Certainly.\" He took a closer look at their designer clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That will be a hundred dollars a night.\" Kelly looked at him, shocked. \"A hun-?\" Diane said quickly, \"That will be fine.\" \"In advance.\" Diane opened her purse, took out some bills, and gave them to the clerk. He handed her a key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Room ten, straight down the hall, on the left. Do you have luggage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s coming,\" Diane told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you need anything, just ask for Ling.\" Kelly said, \"Ling?\" \"Yes. She\u0027s your chambermaid.\" Kelly gave him a skeptical look. \"Right.\" The two women started down the dreary, dimly lit hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You paid too much,\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a safe roof over your head worth?\" \"I\u0027m not so sure this place is such a good idea,\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will have to do until we think of something better. Don\u0027t worry. Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley will take care of us.\" When they reached number ten, Diane unlocked the door and they stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small room looked and smelled as though it had been unoccupied for a long time. There were twin beds with rumpled bedcovers and two worn chairs next to a scarred desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly looked around. \"It may be small, but it sure is ugly. I\u0027ll bet it\u0027s never been cleaned.\" She touched a cushion and watched the dust rise. \"I wonder how long ago Ling passed away.\" \"It\u0027s only for tonight,\" Diane assured her. \"I\u0027m going to phone Mr. Kingsley now.\" Kelly watched as Diane went to the telephone and called the number on the card that Tanner Kingsley had given her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call was answered immediately. \"Tanner Kingsley.\" Diane sighed in relief. \"Mr. Kingsley, this is Diane Stevens. I\u0027m sorry to bother you, but Kelly Harris and I need your help. Someone is trying to kill us and we have no idea what\u0027s going on. We\u0027re on the run.\" \"I\u0027m very glad you called, Mrs. Stevens. You can relax. We just found out what\u0027s behind all this. You won\u0027t have any more problems. I can assure you that from now on, both you and Mrs. Harris will be perfectly safe.\" Diane closed her eyes for an instant. Thank God. \"Can you tell me who-?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you all about it when I see you. Stay where you are. I\u0027ll have someone there to pick you up in thirty minutes.\" \"That\u0027s-\" The connection was broken. Diane replaced the receiver and turned to Kelly, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good news! Our problems are over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say?\" \"He knows what\u0027s behind all this and he says from now on, we\u0027re safe.\" Kelly gave a deep sigh. \"Great. Now I can go back to Paris and start my life over again.\" \"He\u0027s sending someone to pick us up in half an hour.\" Kelly looked around the dingy room. \"It will sure be hard to leave all this.\" Diane turned to her and said wistfully, \"It\u0027s going to be strange.\" \"What is?\" \"Going back to a life without Richard. I can\u0027t imagine how I\u0027ll be able to-\" \"Then don\u0027t,\" Kelly snapped. Don\u0027t take me there, lady, or I\u0027ll fall apart. I can\u0027t even think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark was my whole life, my only reason for living?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane looked at Kelly\u0027s emotionless expression and thought, She\u0027s like a lifeless work of art-beautiful and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKELLY WAS SEATED on one of the beds, her back to Diane. She closed her eyes against the pain inside her and slowly?slowly?slowly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe WAS WALKING along the Left Bank with Mark, chatting about everything and nothing. Kelly felt that she had never been so completely comfortable with anyone before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said to Mark, \"Tomorrow evening there\u0027s a gallery opening if you\u0027re interested in-\" \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry, Kelly. Tomorrow night I\u0027m busy.\" Kelly felt an unexpected stab of jealousy. \"Going on another date?\" She tried to keep her tone light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No. I\u0027m going alone. It\u0027s a banquet-\" He saw the look on Kelly\u0027s face. \"I-I mean it\u0027s just a dinner for scientists. You\u0027d be bored.\" \"Would I?\" \"I\u0027m afraid so. There-there will be a lot of words you\u0027ve probably never heard before and-\" \"I think I\u0027ve heard them all,\" Kelly said, piqued. \"Why don\u0027t you try me?\" \"Well, I don\u0027t really think-\" \"I\u0027m a big girl. Go ahead.\" He sighed. \"All right. Anatripsology?malacostracology?aneroidograph ?term ag-\" \"Oh,\" Kelly said, taken aback. \"Those kinds of words.\" \"I knew you wouldn\u0027t be interested. I-\" \"You were wrong. I am.\" Because you\u0027re interested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE BANQUET WAS held at the Hotel Prince de Galles and turned out to be a major event. There were three hundred people in the ballroom, among them some of the most important dignitaries of France. One of the guests at the front table where Kelly and Mark were seated was an attractive man with a warm, engaging personality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Sam Meadows,\" he said to Kelly. \"I\u0027ve heard a lot about you.\" \"I\u0027ve heard a lot about you,\" Kelly replied. \"Mark says you\u0027re his mentor and best friend.\" Sam Meadows smiled. \"I\u0027m honored to be his friend. Mark is a very special person. We\u0027ve worked together for a long time. He\u0027s the most dedicated-\" Mark was listening, embarrassed. \"Would you like some wine?\" he interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe master of ceremonies appeared onstage, and the speeches began. Mark had been right about the evening being uninteresting for Kelly. Technical scientific prizes were being awarded, and as far as Kelly was concerned, the speakers could all have been talking in Swahili. But Kelly watched the enthusiasm on Mark\u0027s face, and she was glad she was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the dinner plates had been cleared, the president of the French Academie des Sciences appeared onstage. He began by praising the scientific accomplishments that France had made in the past year, and it was not until the end of his speech, when he held up a gold statuette and called out Mark Harris\u0027s name, that Kelly realized that Mark was the star of the evening. He had been too modest to tell her. That\u0027s why he tried to talk me out of coming. Kelly watched Mark get up and go onstage as the audience warmly applauded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never said a word to me about this,\" Kelly told Sam Meadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeadows smiled. \"That\u0027s Mark.\" He studied Kelly a moment. \"You know he\u0027s madly in love with you. He wants to marry you.\" He paused and said pointedly, \"I hope he doesn\u0027t get hurt.\" And as Kelly listened, she felt a sudden rush of guilt. I can\u0027t marry Mark. He\u0027s a dear friend, but I\u0027m not in love with him. What have I been doing? I don\u0027t want to hurt him. It\u0027s better if I stop seeing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can never give a man what he would expect from a woman. How am I going to tell-?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"HAVE YOU HEARD a word I\u0027ve said?\" Diane\u0027s angry voice shook Kelly out of her reverie. The beautiful ballroom disappeared, and she was in a crummy hotel room with a woman she wished she had never met. \"What?\" Diane said urgently, \"Tanner Kingsley said someone\u0027s going to pick us up here in half an hour.\" \"You told me that. So?\" \"He didn\u0027t ask where we were.\" \"He probably thinks we\u0027re still at your apartment.\" \"No. I told him that you and I are on the run.\" There was a moment of silence. Kelly\u0027s lips pursed into a long, silent \"Oh.\" They turned to look at the clock on the bedside table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE CHINESE CLERK glanced up as Flint entered the lobby of the Mandarin Hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw Flint\u0027s smile and returned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My wife and her friend just checked in here. My wife is a blonde. Her friend is a hot black chick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat room are they in?\" \"Room ten, but I\u0027ll have to announce you. You\u0027ll have to teleph-\" As he picked up the telephone, Flint raised a.45-caliber Ruger pistol equipped with a silencer and put a bullet in the clerk\u0027s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint shoved the body behind the counter and started down the hall, the gun at his side. When he reached number ten, he stepped back, took two steps forward, shouldered the door open, and stepped into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was empty, but through the closed bathroom door, Flint could hear the sound of a shower running. He walked over to the bathroom door and shoved it open. The shower was turned on full force, and the closed curtains were gently swaying. Flint fired four shots into the curtains, waited a moment, then pulled them open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no one there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN A DINER across the street, Diane and Kelly had watched Flint\u0027s SUV arrive and then had seen him go into the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God,\" Kelly had said, \"that\u0027s the man who tried to kidnap me.\" They waited. When Flint came out a few minutes later, his lips were smiling, but his face was a mask of fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly turned to Diane. \"There goes Godzilla. What\u0027s our next false move?\" \"We have to get out of here.\" \"And go where? They\u0027re going to be watching the airports, train stations, bus depots? Diane was thoughtful for a moment. \"I know a place where they can\u0027t touch us.\" \"Let me guess. The spaceship that brought you here.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-25.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
