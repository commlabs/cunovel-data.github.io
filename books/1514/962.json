Proceeding to wave his sleeve, the glowing cauldron transformed into a streak of light, before drilling into his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big brother Lin Dong!” upon seeing this spectacle, happiness instantly erupted flashed across Mu Lingshan’s big eyes, who was getting somewhat restless, while guarding him outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong smiled at Mu Lingshan. After he saw that nothing amiss had occurred, he faintly heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. After all, there were already quite a number of treasure hunters in this cave dwelling. If they were to discover that Lin Dong had obtained the purest thunderbolt core, it would be quite troublesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big brother Lin Dong, have you dealt with that demonic corpse?” looking at Lin Dong’s back, Mu Lingshan asked after she realized that the silvery corpse that had caused them quite a bit of trouble, was no longer there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I’ve helped that senior to dispel the Yimo Qi within his body. However, he’s just a remnant soul. After his will scattered, he disappeared from this world.” Lin Dong replied, nodding his head while showing a smile to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big brother Lin Dong is truly formidable.” Mu Lingshan happily smiled. She was clear that the demonic corpse possessed strength comparable to an Advanced Profound Death State expert. If they were to cross blows, it would be quite troublesome for the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got lucky, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong replied with a smile as he rubbed Mu Lingshan’s little head. What he said was indeed true. If it was not for the fact that Zuo Fei still had a sliver of consciousness left, it would be impossible for him to dispel the Yimo Qi within his body with such ease. Even though he had the three great divine treasures, if an expert at Advanced Profound Death Stage went all-out and fought with him, he would not have the time to activate and manipulate his divine treasures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where should we go now? Mu Lingshan scanned her surroundings with her big eyes before asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s head straight to the deepest part of this cave dwelling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s gaze headed straight toward the end of this vast and expansive land. He had obtained the location of the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol from Zuo Fei. Obviously, the Thunder Hall should be the place where all the top experts within the cave dwelling would be gathering at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong said while waving his hand. They had already spent half a day over here. If they did not hurry, the Nine Serene Gate, Mysterious Sky Hall as well as the other experts would have already reached the Thunder Hall. Although Lin Dong wasn’t worried about them being able to discover the Thunder World first, it’s always best to be cautious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those fellows shouldn’t be aware that the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol is in this cave dwelling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong muttered to himself. If the Nine Serene Gate and the Mysterious Sky Hall were to know about it, regardless of how strange the Sky Lightning Sea Region is, they will use every means to try to send even stronger experts over. At that time, it would no longer be young men like Pang Hao and Liu Xiangxuan leading the pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter muttering to himself, Lin Dong didn’t continue to waste any more time. His body moved before he transformed into a streak of light, shooting forwards. Behind him, Mu Lingshan followed closely behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way towards the Thunder Hall, there were quite a few places that appeared to have treasures hidden within. Furthermore, there were quite a few experts converging in those places. However, Lin Dong did not stop. Instead, he headed straight for the depths of the cave dwelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he rushed along with this mindset, his efficiency was substantially improved. When nightfall left and the horizon started to light up, Lin Dong was able to faintly discern that the sky in this region had dimmed down and darkened. A few storm clouds hovered in the sky. Faintly, one could hear claps of thunder resounding across, rumbling as they rang across this vast and expansive land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The lightning energy in here...is getting increasingly berserk…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the crown of a giant tree, Lin Dong’s figure appeared in a flash. Raising his head, he stared at the dark sky covered with storm clouds. He could feel a pressurising sensation radiating from it. This caused the Yuan Power within one’s body to revolve slower. The lightning energy within the depths of this cave dwelling was undoubtedly much more berserk than the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big brother Lin Dong, the number of experts in the vicinity is increasing...” After scanning her surroundings with her big eyes, Mu Lingshan said to Lin Dong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing her words, Lin Dong faintly nodded his head. He was also able to sense quite a few powerful auras within this region. Those auras were undoubtedly much more tyrannical that those experts he had met previously. Furthermore, their objective was clear, the Thunder Hall in the depths of the cave dwelling...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ve decided to show themselves, huh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong muttered to himself softly. He already knew that there were exceptionally powerful elites hidden amongst those who were drawn to this cave dwelling. However, a large number of them had previously maintained an extremely low profile. Now, after arriving at their destination, those experts would naturally begin to reveal themselves...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go. The Thunder Hall isn’t far from here...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong said while pursing his lips. It did not matter how many experts were drawn by this cave dwelling. After all, he will definitely obtain the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol. For the sake of obtaining it, Lin Dong had spent years of blood, sweat and hard work. Step by step, he had finally arrived at his destination. It was no easy journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon saying his words, Lin Dong and Mu Lingshan shot forward once again. However, this time , they didn’t continue on for long. After approximately two hours, they slowly came to a halt. Following which, their eyes brought along some astonishment, as they surveyed the vast land before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a vast and expansive stretch of silvery earth, whose edges cannot be fathomed. On the surface of the ground, if one was to look carefully, one would see lightning coursing through just like snakes slithering about. When seen from afar, it appeared like a gorgeous and magnificent lightning sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this juncture, the stretch of lightning sea earth was covered with deep gulches. Those gulches were approximately ten kilometres deep, with their bottoms seeming unfathomable. Furthermore, they appeared in fantastic oddities of every description, and didn’t seem to be naturally formed. They looked more like … scars left by an earth shakingly battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A terrifying great battle must have taken place here in the past.” Staring at those deep gulches that seemingly tore the land apart, a tinge of shock flashed across Lin Dong’s eyes as he softly commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was not mistaken, the main players in this great war should be the Lord Thunder Emperor and the King Yimo mentioned by Zuo Fei… It was truly difficult to imagine a fight between two individuals at that level. It reached the stage in which they could easily destroy the land with a flip of their palms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? Where’s the Thunder Hall?” Scanning her surroundings with her big eyes, Mu Lingshan suddenly spoke out doubtfully. She was unable to find the so-called hall within this desolated and ruined land. Everything here, and even the mountains that originally existed, seemed to have been reduced into dust due to that great battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s eyes also swept across his surroundings. With a faint thought, he slowly raised his head and looked towards the sky above the land. Thick storm clouds were hovering at that spot. Boundless and enormous fluctuations were faintly discernable as they radiated from that spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Thunder Hall isn’t on the ground, but within the storm clouds…” Looking at the storm clouds floating in the sky, a faint smile appeared on Lin Dong’s face as he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s actually in the sky?” Upon hearing Lin Dong’s reply, amazement flashed uncontrollably within Mu Lingshan’s crystal like eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong nodded his head, before gradually floating up. In a straightforward fashion, he flew towards the stretch of storm clouds, with Mu Lingshan following closely behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they drew closer to the stretch of storm clouds, the peals of thunder coming from within grew increasingly deafening. The stretch of sky was permeated by a berserk lightning energy, with lightning bolts coursing through the clouds just like slithering snakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s figure finally appeared outside of the stretch of storm clouds. Turning his attention towards the clouds, he saw that on the storm clouds, stood a lightning hall, which was grand beyond words, quietly floating on the storm clouds. The ancient loftiness radiating out of it was capable of shaking the hearts of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the Thunder Hall, huh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the giant hall towering above the storm clouds, Lin Dong involuntarily sucked in a deep breath of air. Thick flames of blazing passion erupted out from the depths of his eyes just like a flood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol laid in the Thunder World therein!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter so many years, Lin Dong had finally reached here...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s rising emotions were quickly restrained by him. Giving his surroundings a sweep, he discovered that there were already quite a few figures hovering above the storm clouds surrounding the Thunder Hall. Obviously, they were experts that had rushed over from various locations. Furthermore, all of them had intrepid auras radiating out of them, clearly demonstrating that none of them were pushovers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin those storm clouds, Lin Dong predictably spotted some familiar figures as well. The entire division of the Nine Serene Gate as well as the Mysterious Sky hall had all arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lin Dong’s gaze swept past, Pang Hao seemed to have discovered it. Immediately, his face turned gloomy. From the looks of it, never did he imagine that Lin Dong would actually be able to survive after being pursued by that demonic corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon spotting Lin Dong, an astonished look appeared within the beautiful eyes of Liu Xiangxuan, before she stared at the former. Since he was able to escape from the hands of an advanced Profound Death Stage demonic corpse, this indicated that he was no ordinary individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaced with their gazes, Lin Dong only gave a smile, before retracting his gaze. All of a sudden, with a turn of his head, he turned and looked towards a different direction within the storm clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree men stood in the air within that stretch of storm clouds. At the moment, the three of them were staring at him with sadistic smiles on their faces. All three of them were wearing black and white robes, with the black and white coloured intertwining, akin to the fusion of Yin and Yang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, upon seeing the special robes, Lin Dong’s expression instantly turned gloomy. An inexplicable killing intent rose like floodwaters within his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe palms within his sleeves slowly clenched up. A malevolent intent slowly erupted from his eyes as he gently looked down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe will never ever forget this pattern for his entire life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yuan Gate!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-959\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-961\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-960","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:55 AM"}
