He awoke to her smothering him with kisses and brushed futilely at her, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was so worried,\" she said breathlessly. \"The sun was coming up and we had to leave. Dr. Philippi swore you would be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, I am,\" Tucker grumbled, embarrassed at the affection with the two Vampire men so close. \"C\u0027mon, let\u0027s get this show on the road. I reckon we should be on our way to New Mexico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call ahead to Madame B. We can stay there tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw,\" Tucker responded. \"We ain\u0027t stopping. It\u0027ll be harder to find us if we\u0027re always moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Philippi kindly offered his Land Rover to the expedition. They were loading what little supplies Dr. Philippi could provide, aseptic cartons of blood and clean clothes, into the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lizzie, it will be wonderful to spend such uninterrupted time with you,\" Sully was rambling. \"I just know I\u0027ll lose you altogether once we get to New Mexico. There will be a line to see you and I\u0027ll never get more than five minutes of your time,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully cooed, holding her arm. Tucker glared at his back and Lizzie, laughing, looked back to catch his anger. She was briefly puzzled, then realization dawned and she sighed and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sully, it\u0027s nice to see you too, but don\u0027t think you get to monopolize me on our little trip. I want to spend as much time with Tucker as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully looked mystified and hurt as Lizzie tilted her head toward Tucker, who was mad enough not to notice. Sully nodded and smiled, then waited for Tucker and caught his arm. Tucker looked at him like he was a walking disease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully pursed his lips and wiggled his hips. \"Now, my sweet cowboy, don\u0027t get your rooster feathers all in a tussle. If anyone should be jealous, it should be our Queen.\" Lizzie giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo emphasize his statement, Sully slid his hand over Tucker\u0027s ass, giving it a quick squeeze, and saying, \"I\u0027m a hen, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker pushed him away, horrified, and might have lashed out, but Sully, with his supernatural agility, was already ten feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blew Tucker a kiss. Lizzie came to stand next to Tucker. She wagged her finger at Sully in mock seriousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s sold goods, Sully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker nodded his head furiously, grabbed her hand and slapped it on his ass, where Sully\u0027s had just been. \"I surely am sold goods,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just having fun with you, Tucker,\" Lizzie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That ain\u0027t funny,\" he said, but realized how misplaced his jealousy had been, and they all laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the time it took for Tucker to get a chew in and Lizzie to find a cup of coffee, a group of eager young Vampires pulled a small trailer into the parking garage. They hitched it to the Land Rover and loaded into it a pair of coffins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like one?\" Dr. Philippi asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, no. I think I\u0027ll pass,\" Tucker answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They really are restful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks, but answer me a question. Why do you use them anyways? Seems like just being in a dark room is good enough protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is, but the coffins are an extremely convenient way to allow our humans to move us during the day, if necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, carrying what seems to be a dead man in a bag or a cardboard box is usually reason enough to be stopped by the authorities,\" Dr. Philippi replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker spit onto the pavement, yawned, and opened the back door. \"I think I\u0027ll do like my Adamite ancestors have done for the last hundred years - sleep in the back seat.\" Rex hopped in ahead of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027ll take the wheel for now,\" Sully said. He opened the door for Lizzie then walked around and slid behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Although, I much prefer coaches to cars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Versailles was a different world,\" Dr. Philippi said as he waved and walked into the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin minutes, they had bid their farewells and left the skyline of Manhattan behind. Tucker sat in the back seat with his shotgun across his lap. They all breathed a sigh of relief when the Land Rover passed the city limits. Only then did Tucker relax and stretch out. Under the system they worked out, Lizzie and Sully could \"sleep\" by day, while Tucker drove. At nightfall, Tucker could sleep in the back seat while they drove. This first night, Lizzie quickly traded places with Rex and lay beside Tucker. Rex sat in the passenger seat with the window open, comparing wordlessly with Sully the strange and wondrous scents of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t feed in front of Tucker. Lizzie could tell by the look on his face that it still didn\u0027t sit right with him. Not that she was feeding on humans yet. She couldn\u0027t bring herself to take that step, much to Sully\u0027s consternation. Dr. Philippi had provided plenty of blood, jokingly taking credit for the ancient practice of bloodletting, but watching her feed on the little pouches still left Tucker pale and rattled. As for larger animals, the savagery of the act upset him, but not as much as Sully\u0027s little outings into the night. His forays were definitely not after animals, given that most of them occurred in metropolitan areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they stopped at a rest area, Sully took Tucker aside. \"Tucker, I know you love her, which is why we have to talk. She has to feed soon, on a human. Her soul depends on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker leaned on the car hood and spit, silently gathering his thoughts. At last he spoke. \"If you think I\u0027m going to encourage her to kill someone, you got a long spell to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has to in order to survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now listen here. Against my better interests, I\u0027m starting to like you. But don\u0027t tell me what she needs to survive. She was doing just fine before you and your kind mucked everything up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully sighed, a heaviness filled his limbs. \"My kind had nothing to do with it. We tried our best to let her live a normal life. We tried, we really did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That may be true, but you failed. Things are bad now, but I cannot, with a clear conscience, turn her into a murderer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you guys talking about?\" Lizzie asked, materializing from the shadows of the restroom. She was dabbing crimson from the corner of her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t I believe you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, let\u0027s get rolling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles fell behind them in this fashion, and time. Soon enough, the motion of travel became the standard. Such was the case when Tucker awoke in the back seat, surprised by the stillness, the lack of motion and the quietness of being parked by the side of the road. He stretched and stepped out into the cool morning, the sun barely up and, as yet, ineffective. Rex jumped out and pissed on the tire, yawned, and stretched lazily. Tucker sighed heavily and thought about breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter checking on Sully and Lizzie in the trailer, he took over the daytime driving shift. Pushing the car another fifty miles along, he found a little town with an equally little restaurant, and went in for a cup of coffee and a plate of biscuits and gravy. Not bad, he thought, must be getting farther West. He pulled the map out and spread it on the table, tracing with his finger their route thus far. They were making good time and so far, no sign of trouble. He looked longingly at the state of Wyoming. He made a decision, probably not his best, and after paying the bill, crawled back behind the wheel. Rex sat in the front seat and Tucker used the button to lower the power window on the passenger side. \"Smell that, boy? I think it\u0027s time for a little detour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of that day, the car and its load were no longer on a direct route to New Mexico. Later, when the sun set, and Tucker heard Sully and Lizzie rattling around in the trailer, he pulled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully crawled into the front seat and looked at the odometer. \"My, you\u0027ve been busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker nodded. \"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully opened the map and clicked on the cargo light. \"Where are we now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker sucked in his breath and stabbed his finger down. \"I\u0027d say right around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, but, that\u0027s... we\u0027re going the wrong way We\u0027re going north.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. Thought maybe we should swing through LonePine. Just for a day or two. See Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they\u0027ll look for us there. They\u0027ll be waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like they won\u0027t be waiting in New Mexico. Figured this might throw them off a little. Besides, I can\u0027t leave Dad up there alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just unacceptable. Too risky Tell him, Lizzie. We can\u0027t take chances like this. Tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizzie, still outside the car, looked at Tucker with shining eyes. \"I\u0027d love to see LonePine again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully snorted in disbelief. \"But darling, it\u0027s just not safe. Am I the only one with any sense left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sully, it\u0027s important to Tucker, and he\u0027s important to me. I\u0027m going with him. You don\u0027t have to come along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not come along? My Lord, my God, Lazarus would have my head. I have not been going to that ridiculous little church for nearly three decades now to miss out on the best part of this assignment,\" he said indignantly, then continued in a soothing voice,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lizzie, dearest, you must think beyond yourself now. You have tremendous power and Lazarus is very anxious to see you. I hardly think that a detour to that ramshackle little ghost town,\" he winced and looked at Tucker, \"quaint as it might be, is critically important at this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizzie\u0027s eyes seemed to suddenly catch the moonlight, as they flashed defiantly at Sully. \"Let\u0027s get something straight. Nothing, I mean nothing, will come between Tucker and me. Got that?\" Sully nodded, taken aback by the vehemence of her words, and by the fact that she had begun to levitate slowly off the ground until she was forced to hold the door handle as an anchor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker stared in open-mouthed awe, then grinned from ear to ear. \"Reckon we\u0027re heading to LonePine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully swallowed audibly, then hurriedly studied the map. \"This looks like the quickest route,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker smiled. \"Don\u0027t you just love a road trip? Always unpredictable.\" He crawled in the back seat and Lizzie crawled on top of him, giggling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSully looked at Rex and rolled his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy midafternoon the next day, Tucker pulled across the Wyoming border and gave a little whoop of joy as he did. A passing truck driver blew his airhorn and waved, and Tucker breathed deep, happy to be back in a place where people were naturally friendly and there was room for deep breaths. Not much driving time was left before they got to LonePine and he thought maybe he could get them there before they awoke. He pulled on his denim jacket so he could leave the window, down and enjoy the mountain air, cooling quickly as the afternoon stretched toward evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pleasant reveries were interrupted by the harsh sound of a siren. A quick check of the rear-view mirror revealed a police car, lights blazing. The driver, Tucker realized, looked just like Melissa Braver\u0027s little brother Bart. He was just a kid when Tucker had spent time over at the Braver\u0027s. Used to ride to the Dairy Queen for ice cream, most of which Bart had managed to drip on the seat of Tucker\u0027s truck. Smiling at the memories, Tucker pulled the car and trailer over to the side of the road, but the tenor of their reunion was quickly defined as different than Tucker had expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker,\" he called out in a business-like voice, \"keep your hands up where I can see them and remain in the truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBart pulled his standard-issue police automatic out of the holster and pointed it toward the driver\u0027s side window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker opened the door and started to climb out. \"Bart, what the hell do think you\u0027re doing? It\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response, Bart cocked the hammer in a traditional Western greeting and things became substantially more tense. \"If you take another step I swear to God I\u0027ll put a bullet in your knee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker raised his hands, eyes wide. \"Bart, have you lost your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but it seems you have. Now turn around and put your hands on the hood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did. Rex was sitting on the front seat, watching curiously through the open door. \"Hey Rex,\" Bart said, \"how you doing, boy?\" Rex thumped his tail. Bart kicked Tucker\u0027s feet farther apart, keeping the muzzle of his auto leveled at belt-buckle height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his free hand up Tucker\u0027s legs, around his waist, and under his arms until it bumped into the Casull. Bart\u0027s whole body tensed and he gingerly pulled it free and dropped it, giving it a kick with his boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ, Bart, take it easy. That\u0027s Dad\u0027s gun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBart poked his pistol into his ear. \"Take it easy? I ain\u0027t screwing around here, Tucker. I don\u0027t want to have to shoot you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want that either, Bart. Just tell me what the hell this is about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your hands behind your back.\" He slapped the cuffs on. \"What\u0027s going on is you\u0027re wanted for questioning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Questioning, for what? What the hell\u0027s going on? Can I turn around now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He holstered the piece and stepped back to regard him. \"Murder. Seems you got into a little bit of trouble out in New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sure did. But I didn\u0027t kill nobody. Not people, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to our bulletins, you\u0027re wanted for questioning in the disappearance of one Elizabeth Vaughan. She\u0027s plumb vanished and folks at her work are getting a mite concerned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit. Of course she disappeared, but she ain\u0027t dead. Well, she is dead, technically But I didn\u0027t kill her. Julius did. Even though she ain\u0027t dead. This ain\u0027t coming out right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Maybe you should wait for a lawyer. For the time being, let\u0027s just say you\u0027re under arrest. And anything you say...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... can be used against me. I know, I know, I watch TV, too. But she ain\u0027t really dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker, you can\u0027t be kind of dead,\" Bart said. Then he leaned against the truck and put a chew in and started petting Rex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I used to think, Bart. But things ain\u0027t so clear anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said slowly as he spit, \"they\u0027re pretty clear in the eyes of the law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aww, Bart. How long I known you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever since you started squirreling around with my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bart, listen to me. You know I ain\u0027t a murderer. I didn\u0027t kill my girlfriend. I didn\u0027t kill anyone. Anyone that wasn\u0027t already dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Tucker for a while. \"I think maybe I\u0027ll take a look at your load.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of an impartial observer with a badge and a gun finding two corpses made Tucker wince. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea, Bart. And don\u0027t you need a search warrant or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just arrested you, Tucker. You ain\u0027t got no rights.\" Rex came out good naturedly and followed Bart to the back of the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was still perched dangerously far from the rim of the mountains, and Tucker hung his head and prayed for the earth to turn a little faster. Just my luck, he thought. By the time Lizzie and Sully arose, he\u0027d be in lockup, Julius would send his legions, and his little trip home would be the end of them all. He hunkered down by the tire, the cuffs pulling against his wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBart unlatched the back door and it swung open. He sucked in a breath and whistled it out. Sometimes the sight of a coffin will do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker, you better start talking.\" There wasn\u0027t anything to say, so he just listened to the thud of boot heels climbing in, felt the truck shift under the weight and heard the scrape of one of the coffins being opened. \"C\u0027mon back here, Tucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m mighty comfortable here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I insist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled up and walked around the corner. \"Do me a favor, Bart. Just keep it out of the sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There ain\u0027t no sun, it\u0027s done set,\" said Bart, and Tucker realized, gratefully, that he was right. He prayed that Lizzie wasn\u0027t going to sleep in tonight. He and Rex watched as Bart opened the coffin wider. \"Jesus Christ,\" he exclaimed. \"This must be your girlfriend. She\u0027s real pretty, Tucker.\" He held his fingers to her neck to search for a pulse. \"And real dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRex jumped up on his hind legs and licked her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can explain this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do it down at the station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker looked forlornly at the night sky. \"I\u0027d rather do it right here.\" Bart shrugged and pointed at the squad car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the car, Bart listened politely and attentively to everything Tucker had to say When he got to the part about Vampires, Bart smiled and nodded and even acted interested. Tucker stretched the story out as long as he could, even going back a couple of places to emphasize certain things about Vampires, all the while waiting for Lizzie to make an appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, he ran out of words. Bart smiled patiently and started the engine. \"Bart, what\u0027re you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taking you to jail.\" He pulled the radio loose and held it up to his mouth. \"Dispatch, this is 112.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead, Bart,\" the radio crackled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just picked up...\" There was a tapping on the window, like a raven gently rapping. Bart looked up into the beautiful face of Lizzie, smiling down into the squad car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you two are almost done, we really should get going,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus H. Christ,\" Bart shrieked and the radio slipped from his hand. \u0027She\u0027s dead. She\u0027s dead,\" he stammered. \"There wasn\u0027t no pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bart, you broke up, Bart,\" dispatch crackled. \"Please repeat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker slumped forward in the seat and sighed with relief. \"I told you, Bart. I told you she was dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she\u0027s so dead, how come she\u0027s standing right there?\" he stammered. Lizzie smiled and waved, shielding her eyes from the headlights. Bart paled considerably and Tucker raised his wrists up, nodding toward the handcuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I go now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell am I supposed to write this up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBart and Tucker huddled together in the cab of his squad car, trying to come up with a plan. Lizzie leaned regally but impatiently against the Land Rover. At last Bart drove off, leaving Tucker standing beside the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About time. You want me to drive?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker rubbed his wrists and looked cross. \"Took your own sweet time getting out of bed. I could\u0027ve been hauled off to jail by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a bed, honey, it\u0027s a coffin. Besides, I figured he was a friend of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, sweetheart, everyone around here is a friend of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he was going to pretend none of this had ever happened. He said he was going back to the station and break that rule about cops drinking on duty. He said we had three weeks before he called the FBI. And he also said you was real pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? That\u0027s sweet. I\u0027m just glad Sully didn\u0027t come out. I can only imagine what he would have thought then.\" Hearing his name, Sully slammed the trailer shut and wandered over to the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening, Tucker, how was your day? You must be exhausted, all that driving.\" He took a deep breath. \"Smell that air. It\u0027s so invigorating, so wonderfully pine scented. Where are we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker crawled back behind the wheel, muttering. \"We\u0027re outside of LonePine. God\u0027s country. And I call it God\u0027s country because until only recently, there wasn\u0027t no Vampires here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker.\" Lizzie gave him a nudge in the ribs. If Sully heard, he chose to ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter New York, LonePine looked small and lonesome in comparison. The lights of the main street, those that were still on as they pulled into town at nearly 10:30, were few and far between. There was no traffic, other than between the town\u0027s two bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker\u0027s eyes glazed over and Lizzie took his hand and gave it a squeeze. \"Ain\u0027t it beautiful?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s something, all right,\" Lizzie said. \"Looks just the same as the first time I saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something to be said for things staying the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swiveled to face him, the conversation taking a turn for the worse. \"Change is good,\" she said, cutting him a hard look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever said that probably had it pretty bad to begin with,\" Tucker suggested, still unaware of the underlying discussion they were having.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe they just didn\u0027t realize things could get better.\" She let go of his hand as he reached for the gear stick to slow down for the turn onto Dad\u0027s road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that only applies to people who are bored,\" Sully chimed in. \"You know, if you\u0027re bored, any kind of change seems exciting and new. For example, I have been alive for what, twelve hundred years, and I am constantly amazed that I have yet to grow bored. Of course, I am always trying to find new things to keep my interests up...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis conversation with himself lasted so long, Tucker began to wonder if Vampires needed oxygen. Lizzie stared icily ahead as they pulled up in front of Dad\u0027s. Tucker felt a vague sense of making a mistake, that he needed to say something to reassure her, but decided that, as close as they were, she should be able to tell that he was sorry and hadn\u0027t meant anything and was just tired from driving all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to Dad\u0027s house cracked open and the barrel of his old ten-gauge goose gun poked out. \"Tucker, that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ain\u0027t a Vampire now, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you are, I\u0027m gonna shoot you right now. I didn\u0027t raise my kid to be no Vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what exactly is wrong with being a Vampire?\" Lizzie asked as she appeared beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, Lizzie,\" he said, the gun barrel dipping. \"I didn\u0027t mean nothing by that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should hope not,\" Sully added as he crawled out of the truck. \"We\u0027re not all like those awful Vampires you met before. Some of us are quite civilized and rather enjoyable to be around. And I must say, I love your cabin. It\u0027s so charming. It reminds me of this little hunting chalet I used to stay at in Austria whenever the Viscount and I went after stag or fox. It was remarkably warm and on those lovely Austrian nights...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker,\" Dad said, \"who\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Mr. Sully A friend of Lizzie\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does he ever shut up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only in the daytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and opened the door, motioning them in. \"Well, come on in. Coffee\u0027s on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reckon it\u0027s been on for a week now. I almost hate to ask, but do you have any of them beans you promised?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMANHATTAN COMPOUND\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctober 18, 11:10 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this stage in his life, Lazarus did not particularly enjoy the sophisticated veneer of city life. While he had rarely visited this Manhattan compound in the past, he had on occasion been pulled to New York by its easy hunting. Thus, he had the comfort of coming to a place he at least understood well. He wished his task here was one of a reunion of old friends, rather than of confrontation. Had things gone differently 700 years ago, that might be the reality. Lazarus rang the bell. The door creaked open warily. A man that Lazarus did not recognize, but clearly a Vampire, poked his head through the narrow slit between door and frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" the young Vampire asked menacingly He was rough-looking, unshaven with greasy black hair. Downright ugly, thought Lazarus, as he considered Julius\u0027 low standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish to see Julius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to hell,\" the greasy Vampire responded and started to shut the door. In less than an instant, Lazarus pulled it off the hinges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young Vampire stood motionless, suddenly afraid. \"You are one of us,\" he whispered, \"I thought you were Adamite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your master\u0027s training has always been woefully inadequate. Why were you unable to sense me?\" Julius\u0027 underling did not respond. \"Never mind, it\u0027s none of my concern,\" said Lazarus. \"Run along and fetch Jenkins for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenkins no longer has any responsibility in this household.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus felt his cold blood chill further. Jenkins no longer in a position of power? Something was seriously amiss. His patience exhausted, he pushed the young upstart aside and walked into the compound. The Vampire had enough sense to push the alarm buttons so that as Lazarus entered the gardens, he was immediately surrounded by a dozen Vampires, accompanied by several brutish Adamites, all heavily armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus was merely annoyed. It had been too long since his last visit and obviously these minions had not been told that there was another Vampire as powerful and strong as Julius. From their perspective, he imagined, he was simply a fat old man breaking into the fortress, someone they thought they could have a bit of blood-sport with. He sighed deeply. The events of the last few days had tired him, the plane ride had been particularly bumpy, and he was not in the mood for a full-scale fight. Oh well, he thought, best to get it over quickly. How lovely the poppies are, he thought, and how unusual to be blooming at this time of year. But the flower beds were in dire need of weeding, the beautiful pale-orange treasures were nearly choked to death. He bent to touch their delicate petals, deeply disappointed that this once extraordinary garden was in such a state of disrepair. As he drank in the scent, his senses blossomed, fully heightened and aware of the group of mercenaries moving steadily toward him, jaunting and threatening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnexpectedly, but very welcome to Lazarus, the leader of the posse group suddenly fell on his knees and touched his forehead to the ground. The rest of the guards looked on in amazement, then quizzically followed suit as their leader screamed at them in terror to kneel or be certain of never being resurrected again. Thank goodness, thought Lazarus, immensely relieved. He would be able to avoid at least one fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenkins emerged from the house. He was very drawn, his skin hanging loosely over his face, his once-sparkling eyes now weary and blank. Upon seeing Lazarus, he was momentarily reinvigorated, but it lasted only an instant before the weight of his own flesh seemed to press him down closer toward the earth, his back bowed in submission to his body\u0027s demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus moved quickly to his side, recognizing the signs. \"Jenkins. Why is he doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine it\u0027s because I am becoming too old and no longer am of much use to the family. I expect that this is in fact what happened to my father as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Julius always kills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s generally been true, but he is instead choosing to feed on me only once a day, very briefly, and never enough to kill me. Not yet, at least. He has relieved me of all other duties. He claims he has no time for the hunt and wishes to be certain of the quality of blood he is consuming. During his feeding ecstasy, he mumbles about preparing his flesh for new power.\" Jenkins labored to finish his last words, breathless with fatigue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he said anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange words that I cannot understand. Mostly about Miss Vaughan and her blood, a new world order. I wish I was able to tell you more but it is very difficult for me to maintain consciousness during the feeding. He does occasionally mention Elita, cursing that she is of the serpent line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jenkins, please forgive me. I never thought that Julius would stoop to using those in our service and under our protection for such a purpose. I would not have posted you here had I thought it would come to this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I served you well, did I not? I helped her escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have done more than I ever expected. We are all in your debt. And now I wish to repay you. Leave now. I will ensure that you have safe passage to the door. One of my men will take you to Dr. Philippi who will bring you back to health, to Adamite health. Then you shall have anything you desire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no wish or need other than to serve. It is my fate, my choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be honored to have you in my personal service in New Mexico.\" For an instant, it looked as if Jenkins would cry, then he collected himself and started to move toward the compound\u0027s exit. \"One more thing, Master Lazarus. Julius fainted during the turning of Miss Vaughan.\" Quietly, he turned and walked away. Lazarus watched until he was outside the compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have given him to you. You needn\u0027t have stolen him,\" said a voice quietly from behind. Lazarus turned to find Julius smiling at him. \"I\u0027ve known for some time that he remained loyal to you. It was a personal game, seeing if I could sway him.\" He stepped closer and motioned for the prostrate Vampires to rise and disperse. \"All this power sometimes makes existence a bit tedious and we, you and I that is, must invent games to entertain ourselves.\" Julius smiled demurely. \"Alas, I realized I was not to win this one. Adamites can be so stubborn. So I changed the rules, changed the entire nature of the game. He has served me well these last few weeks. So few Adamites today lead such healthy lives. His blood is of a rare quality.\" Julius was glowing, his lips full and red, his skin radiantly pale, his hair dark and silky, his body trim and fit. Lazarus felt a pang of jealousy. How did the Vampire stay so damned thin? As if reading his mind, Julius said, \"And you, you\u0027ve gotten fat. How amusing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus rolled his eyes in response and then said, \"Let\u0027s go inside, Julius. We have much to talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, Lazarus, I can sum it up in just a few words, and I\u0027d prefer to do just that, to minimize the time I must spend in your presence. Correct me if I\u0027m wrong. Our Queen has managed to make contact with you and is on her way to your compound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou, in your quaint, chivalrous manner have decided to protect her. And you are here to threaten me in hopes of avoiding a showdown. Am I right so far?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus didn\u0027t answer. He expected that it might be better to find out how much Julius knew before responding. History had taught him that Julius had always been a bit of a show-off. It had gotten him into trouble in the past and, perhaps, would do so now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall take your silence for assent, dear chap. But you shall fail.\" At this, Julius\u0027 tone turned acidic and his eyes burned with rage. \"You beat me once before. I did not anticipate your displeasure with my plans. I won\u0027t make that mistake again. You have hidden her from me these last three decades out of spite, pure spite. Nevertheless, despite the intentions of you and her insipid mother, I have in fact succeeded in turning her. Thus, my pathetic, fat Vampire friend, you failed in the most critical part of her protection. All that is left is drinking her menses and she becomes totally irrelevant. You can have her when this is done. Do with her as you wish, make her your consort, eliminate her, I don\u0027t care. But be forewarned, nothing will stop me in my quest for her blood. It has been ordained. I am fulfilling the prophecy of Revelations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will kill you first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous! You have been unsuccessful for centuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You misunderstand. I have never tried to kill you. Until now, you have posed no real threat. You have been nothing more than a game for me, too. A means to combat eternal boredom. You have served a useful entertainment purpose. Now, however, I, too, am changing the rules. The stakes are too high. The accumulation of your atrocities merits your destruction. You have surrounded yourself with the very evil we are ordained to absorb. You have sickened the word of Susej,\" Lazarus said quietly but with depth of conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" screamed Julius, enraged. \"I have upheld his word while you have weakened it, infected it with the foolishness of the Adamites. We are not meant to balance good and evil for the sake of the Adamite world, the Adamites exist for our desires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood is weak. Evil is strong. In the final battle, we will, we must vanquish the Adamite world. With the Queen\u0027s blood, I shall have the power to do just that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if Julius had spat out his rage with the fury, he suddenly became very calm, self-possessed. \"You pathetic man. You who are not even of the line of Susej, but a mere pawn of Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus shook his head. \"My Father\u0027s house is a great house, as noble and as powerful as yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shall not stop me in this. You may have once, when I was young and foolish. But I have learned my lesson. This I have planned for the past 700 years while you, you slept in ignorance. Your Western solitude has softened you, left you weak.\" He pointed at Lazarus\u0027 prominent belly. \"Proof that my plan is already implemented.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will hide her from you until the menses pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot hide her from me. I can smell her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean you can smell her? Vampires can only smell Adamite evil, or its absence in Vampires, not specific individuals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a power that came during the turning. At first, it was weak, and it did not help me in locating her when she escaped previously But in the last few days it has become very strong. I expect that it will continue to do so, and that by the time of her menses, I\u0027ll be able to find her anywhere in the world. While I certainly have no need of proving this fact to you, I shall do so simply for my own amusement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know where they are this exact moment. Sully will not make it to New Mexico. At least, not if he remains by her side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus was immediately worried for Sully, but knew it would do no good to let Julius know this. Slow thoughts crept into his mind. Had he let sentiment get the better of him? He had loved Constance, and by extension Lizzie. He had optimistically, and now he feared, naively, thought Lizzie could live without detection. He realized now that he had made a fatal mistake in not turning her himself. He had allowed Julius to gain powers that he did not have. He said none of this, of course. He did have Lizzie physically and of her own volition, or at least he would very soon. That would count for something, and Julius had fainted during the turning. Was there a chink in his powerful armor that would allow Lazarus to dispense with him without harming anyone else in the process?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She will be under my protection and will not under any circumstances be released to you,\" Lazarus said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will allow her to stay with you until two days before her blood starts. Then I shall come for her. With my army.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will not succeed. If I must, I will kill her myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulius scoffed. \"Come now, we both know that you won\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you forgotten the past so easily?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulius laughed heartily before responding. \"No, no, you need not remind me. Those events are forever etched in my mind. But you know as well as I that you have regretted that action ever since. You may have killed the only other woman to have this power in the last 700 years, but how it has haunted you. Elizabeth is different. She represents a chance for you to redeem yourself. You love her. You didn\u0027t even know the other one, despite the fact that she was your own daughter.\" Julius paused to gauge Lazarus\u0027 response to this painful memory, taking great pleasure in the emotional distress he was causing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued in his reminiscences. \"MaryAnne was such a sweet child, such a surprise that you birthed the power, you and your little messiah. She was so young, such gloriously golden eyes. I could have easily molded her to my will. She would have been an excellent figurehead. Her blood would have given me the world. I remember that night vividly You were still powerful, not yet flabby. The locals fled in terror as you and your men descended on the caves. I was caught unaware. When you sucked her dry of her blood just hours before it had the power, how she cried out to you, begging you to spare her. I even told you who the mother was and still you drained her as I watched helplessly. She didn\u0027t even know why. She had no idea that she had the power of uncreation in her blood; but then, neither did you. MaryAnne. You do remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your assumption that I have any interest in reliving the past is grossly unfounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulius laughed again and began to mimic the voice of the girl long ago killed. In a soft whisper he brought the memory vividly to life in Lazarus\u0027 mind. \"Please, don\u0027t kill me. What have I done wrong? I want to serve you. I will love you if you\u0027ll let me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus glared at Julius. Both knew that the murder of MaryAnne had been the greatest crisis in Lazarus\u0027 life. In those days, Lazarus had lived differently with greater decadence. He had kept a harem, small but adequate, and while he was very kind to the women and their offspring if they had any, he felt no bond. Julius had, unknown to Lazarus, taken a girl child from one of the women, the only girl child born of that line at the 700-year mark, raised her and then turned her at age thirty Lazarus had not even known that such a child had been born in his dominion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, in a way, he had as much at stake as Julius. Julius wanted Lizzie\u0027s blood in order to create an empire. Lazarus wanted Lizzie\u0027s blood to prove that he had not killed his daughter in vain, that he had not spent the last few centuries watching a crazy Vampire who threatened the world only in his imagination. He wanted Julius to be something worthy of opposition, worthy of the amount of energy their conflict had demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In an odd way, I thank you for murdering that innocent nymph,\" continued Julius finally. \"Back then, the world was still moralistically naive. I would have gotten very little support when I began the process of assuming control. Now, with the shift in morality away from religion and family, I will have no problem attracting Adamites into my service.\" Julius laughed. \"Just think of it. The silly young things will be clamoring to have me turn them into Vampires. It will be far more - what\u0027s the word - cool, than a nose ring. The Adamitic world is so imbued with apathy Anything to excite their pathetic lives. As I told your dear Elizabeth, the time is right, and I shall seize it. Who knows, if I tarry, perhaps during that time a new and charismatic leader will emerge in the Adamitic world, giving everyone a reason to live again and giving me one headache after the next. It is so much easier to have willing victims, don\u0027t you think, Lazarus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready, Lazarus was tiring of this game. He had changed in response to those events 700 years ago, had considered many things, had brought together strands of experience earned through many centuries into a wisdom, an understanding of the world and the morality necessary for its survival. Waiting Julius out had always been difficult to do; now it was even harder to listen to his infantile posturing, but he guessed that soon Julius would tip his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way, you couldn\u0027t kill Elizabeth Vaughan, even if you wanted to. Her power could be greater than either of us. She just doesn\u0027t know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ancient voices speak through her. I heard them at the turning. Ask her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus did not respond, but his mind was reeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My moment has come, Lazarus. Nothing will stop me. I will come for her, this I swear, and I will take her and I will destroy anything that stands in my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will never get inside my fortress. I have an army at the ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, don\u0027t insult the very notion of army My war machine is built of former Adamites who were by nature bloodthirsty and ruthless, and those of the Serpent tribe. Yours is a gathering of poets and judges. Who do you think will win?\" Julius laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, he turned and walked inside the house saying over his shoulder as he walked, \"And really, Lazarus, lose the weight. You look ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazarus turned and walked slowly toward the outer wall. The trip had been worth it. As he expected, Julius\u0027 ego had caused him to reveal his entire strategy, a tendency he had repeated through the ages, a flaw in all his plans. The ancient voices? They had not spoken through him since the time of his initial resurrection nearly two thousand years ago. As far as he knew, Julius had never heard them and did not understand their purpose or power. That is why he had fainted, Lazarus was sure of it. Only Susej, himself, and now Lizzie, had heard them. The voices would know what to do, they would be able to guide Lizzie. The voices to the past, he hoped, would be considerably stronger than his army of poets. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cowboy-and-vampire/page-25.html","bookId":2496,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:41 PM"}
