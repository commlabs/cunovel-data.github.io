{"id":21276,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"That autumn he had sown catch-crops of Italian rye grass, which gave the stock a good early winter feed. He had grown sharper in his dealings with the land, he knew how to take it at a disadvantage, snatch out a few roots. Every inch of the farm was now at work, for every blade of grass now counted. He had even dug up the garden, casting aside rose-bushes, sweet-peas, and dahlias for dull rows of drum-head cabbages, potatoes, kale, and beans. And manure ... there was manure everywhere, lying under the very parlour windows, sending up its effluvium on the foggy winter air till it crept into even the close-shut bedroom, making Naomi conscious of Reuben in her dreams.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was inclined to be sulky in those days. She disliked the smell of manure, she disliked being made to dream of Reuben, towards whom she now felt a vague hostility. What business had he to go and saddle her with another child? Surely she had enough—four boys and a girl. What business had he to make her languid and delicate just when she needed all her health for the ailing Fanny? He was so unsympathetic about Fanny, too, one really might think he did not care what the poor little creature suffered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Naomi began to complain about him to the neighbours. She joined in those wifely discussions, wherein every woman plaintively abused her own man, and rose at once in fury if another woman ventured to do so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Backfield he scarcely takes any notice of me now—always thinking about his farm. Talks of nothing but hops and oats. Would you believe it, Mrs. Ditch, but he hardly ever looks at this dear little Fanny. He cares for his boys right enough, because when they\u0027re grown up they\u0027ll be able to work for him, but he justabout neglects his girlie—that\u0027s what he does, he neglects her. The other night, there she was crying and sobbing her little heart out, and he wouldn\u0027t let me send for the doctor. Says he can\u0027t afford to have the doctor here for nothing. Nothing, indeed!...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So Naomi would maunder to her acquaintance; with Reuben she confined herself to hints and innuendoes. Sometimes she complained to Mrs. Backfield, but her husband\u0027s mother was unsympathetic.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You d?an\u0027t know when you\u0027re in luck,\" she said as she thumped the dough—\"nothing to do but bath and dress the children, and yet you grumble. If you had to work like me—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know why you do it. Make Backfield get a girl to help you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And pay eight shillings a month when he wants the money so badly! No, if a woman can\u0027t work fur her son, I d?an\u0027t see much good in her. Some women\"—rather venomously—\"even work fur their husbands.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know well enough he won\u0027t let me work for him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I never said as you ought to work fur him—all I said wur as you shouldn\u0027t ought to grumble.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A loud wail from Fanny in her cradle drove the retort from Naomi\u0027s lips. She sprang from the arm-chair where she had been resting, and ran heavily across the room to the baby\u0027s side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the matter, my darling? Come to mother, little Miss Fanny. Oh, I know something\u0027s wrong with her, or she wouldn\u0027t cry so. She\u0027s got such a sweet temper really.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She picked the child out of the cradle, and began to walk up and down the room, rocking it in her arms. Fanny\u0027s wails grew louder, more long-drawn, and more plaintive.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben came in, and his brows contracted when he saw what his wife was doing. There was a slight moisture on her forehead, and she strained the child violently to her breast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come, Naomi, put her down. It\u0027s bad for you to carry her about like this.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Reuben, I\u0027m sure she\u0027s ill. Can\u0027t we send Beatup over for the doctor?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, we can\u0027t. There\u0027s naun the matter wud her really. She\u0027s always crying.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Naomi faced him almost spitefully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If one of the boys had hurt his little finger you\u0027d have doctor in at once. It\u0027s only because it\u0027s Fanny. You don\u0027t love her, you——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now none o\u0027 that, missus,\" said Reuben roughly—\"you put the child back in her cradle, and go and lie down yourself. I d?an\u0027t want to have to fetch doctor in to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Naomi had not acquired the art of flouting him openly. She tearfully put Fanny into her cradle, and lay and sulked on the sofa for the rest of the evening.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That night she dreamed that her new baby was born, and that Reuben had taken away Fanny and given her to Beatup. Beatup was carrying her down to the pond to drown her as he drowned the kittens, and Naomi stood in the garden with immovable weights on every limb listening to the despairing shrieks of her little girl. They were dreadful shrieks, not like a baby\u0027s at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They still sounded when Naomi woke. She sat up in bed, uncertain as to whether she were dreaming or not. Then from Fanny\u0027s little bed beside the big one came something terrible—a low long wail like an animal\u0027s dying into a moan. It seemed as if her heart stopped[Pg 97] beating. She felt the sweat rush out all over her body. The next minute she was out of bed, groping for Fanny in the darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She found her and lifted her in her arms; once more that dreadful wailing moan came from the little body, mingling this time with a snore from Reuben. Naomi, still grasping Fanny, managed to light a candle. The child\u0027s face was deadly white and drawn in a strange way, while her lips were blue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Reuben!\" shrieked Naomi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did not wake. Worn out with hard work and his anxiety about his farm, he still slept heavily, rolled in the blanket. A sick insane rage seized Naomi. She sprang on the bed, tore the clothes off him, shook him, beat him, pulled his hair, while all the time she grasped the now silent Fanny convulsively between her left arm and her breast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My child\u0027s dying. Get up, you brute. Fetch the doctor. My child\u0027s dying!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a moment Reuben was bewildered with his sudden waking, but he soon came to himself at the sight of his wife\u0027s distorted face and the inanimate lop-headed baby. He sprang up, pulled on his trousers, and in two minutes had bundled the half-conscious but utterly willing Beatup out of his attic, and sent him off on the fastest horse to Rye. Then he came back into the bedroom. Naomi was sitting on the floor, her hair falling over her shoulders, the baby unconscious on her lap.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give her to me, child—let me look.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no—get away,\" and Naomi once more caught up Fanny to her breast.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll go and fetch mother.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Backfield arrived in a washed-out bed-gown. A fire was lit and water put on to boil. Fanny\u0027s, however, did not seem just an ordinary case of \"fits\"; she lay limp in her mother\u0027s arms, strangely blue round the mouth, her eyes half open.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, what is it?—what is it?\" wailed Naomi—\"can\u0027t we do anything? Oh, why doesn\u0027t the doctor come?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly the baby stiffened on her lap. The limbs became rigid, the face black. Then something rasped in its throat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bring the water!—Bring the water!\" screamed Naomi, hardly knowing what she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Backfield poured the water into a basin, and Naomi lifted Miss Fanny to put her into the steaming bath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s no use,\" said Reuben. He knew the child was dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Naomi insisted on putting Fanny into the basin. She held her up in it for a moment. Then suddenly let her drop, and fell forward, wailing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben and Mrs. Backfield tried in vain to soothe her, and put her back to bed. She was like a mad woman. She who had always been so timid and gentle, peevish at the worst, now shouted, kicked and raved.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ve killed her! it\u0027s your doing ... you\u0027re a murderer!\" she screamed at Reuben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He lifted her bodily and laid her on the bed. But she was still half insane—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hate you! I hate you!\" she cried, and threw herself about.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the doctor arrived an hour later, his services were needed after all. For Naomi gave birth to a little boy at dawn.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59397.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
