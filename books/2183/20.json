{"id":100009,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s uproar when Bec suggests Beranabus might still be alive in some form. Grubbs accuses her of living in a dreamland. Meera gently suggests that she\u0027s in denial, that she needs to accept the ancient magician\u0027s death. But Bec stubbornly pushes her case, and as she elaborates, our skepticism fades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe know souls can be separated from bodies-that happened to me in Lord Loss\u0027s kingdom years ago, when I entered the Board. In the past, a soul couldn\u0027t survive a body\u0027s death, but things have changed. Death is claiming souls and using them. We\u0027ve no way of knowing if a captured soul remains conscious or not. But if they do... if Beranabus has made a study of Death from the inside and uncovered its secrets... maybe he can tell us how to kill it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s probably a wild shot in the dark. Grubbs certainly thinks so and says that it\u0027s a waste of time, but the rest of us believe it\u0027s worth trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before we can set off in pursuit of a dead man, we have the living to take care of. The new window is almost open. In another few hours, dozens of demons will be streaming across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Grubbs fetches his werewolves and Meera rustles up battle-hardened soldiers, I slot patches of light together. Dervish and Kirilli are resting-Dervish looks shattered, Kirilli scared. Bec\u0027s watching me. Something about her gaze makes me feel uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must have been amazing,\" she says. \"Your trip to the stars and beyond sounds incredible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I grunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering...\" She coughs. \"I\u0027d like to touch you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I squeak, startled, thinking she wants to kiss me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can absorb your memories if we touch,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" I chuckle at my mistake. Then I grow serious. \"Why do you want to take my memories?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not take,\" she says. \"Share. I want to see everything you saw. The lights, the worlds, the Crux. If you grant me access, I can see all that you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it matter if I show you or not?\" I snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks surprised by my harsh tone. \"Well, of course I\u0027m curious,\" she says, stammering a bit. \"But apart from that I have perfect recall. If you share with me, I might spot something that slipped your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it,\" I sniff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it can\u0027t do any harm, surely, if I just...\" She reaches out, then stops as I glare at her. Letting her hand drop slowly, her expression darkens. \"You\u0027re hiding something from us. Just like Grubbs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw that too?\" I hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone sees it. Something happened between him and Juni that he doesn\u0027t want us to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think it might be?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve no idea. But I think I know what you\u0027re holding back. You look hostile. I\u0027ve done nothing to make you dislike me, so you must be... afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not afraid of you,\" I sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not. But you\u0027re nervous... more than that... suspicious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fidget uncomfortably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Old Creatures said the pieces of the Kah-Gash have been influenced by the hosts they\u0027ve inhabited,\" Bec says thoughtfully. \"If my piece of the Kah-Gash was in Lord Loss for thousands of years...\" Her expression clears. \"You don\u0027t trust me. You think I might betray you, or that my piece of the Kah-Gash might trick us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you say for sure that it won\u0027t?\" I ask quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBec starts to respond hotly, then pauses. \"Actually no,\" she admits. Then she looks at me piercingly. \"But can you make any guarantees? Can Grubbs? You don\u0027t know where your pieces were before, or why they ended up in you. Maybe we\u0027ll all be played for fools.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" I nod slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBec smiles thinly. \"Go on watching me, Kernel. I don\u0027t mind. But I\u0027ll be watching you too. And Grubbs. I don\u0027t think any of us can be trusted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" I say glumly, then return her smile. \"And we\u0027re the ones who are supposed to save the world? I don\u0027t like our chances!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me neither,\" she laughs, and we grin at each other, united by our uncertainties, paranoia, and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could stop the mage before he opens the window, but then we wouldn\u0027t have a chance to test ourselves. I don\u0027t like the course we\u0027re taking-people will probably die-but there\u0027s no other way. If we want to learn about the Kah-Gash before we go looking for the Shadow, we have to fight. We could cross to the demon universe and test it there, but that would mean unleashing the Kah-Gash in an area of total magic. If the weapon\u0027s on the side of the Demonata, that would hand it the perfect opportunity to break free of any confines we might seek to impose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stick close to me,\" Grubbs growls. I\u0027m on his left, Bec on his right. Meera, Kirilli, the werewolves, and soldiers are behind us. Dervish is a bit farther back, observing. I sense the window forming. Just minutes to go. The mage is working inside a nearby building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not going for a full union,\" Grubbs says. \"Just a partial link.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure we can do that?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Grubbs says. \"I\u0027m the trigger. I can control it. Follow my lead, don\u0027t react when you feel my magic mingling with yours, and everything will be coolio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI share a troubled glance with Bec-she doesn\u0027t like this either-but before I can say anything the window opens and demons scurry out of the building. There are dozens of scaly, bloody, multiheaded monsters, oozing pus and slime, slithering down the steps, smashing through windows, hunting for victims. A river of nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing new. I faced worse with Beranabus. I\u0027m more concerned about the werewolf between me and Bec than I am by the demons bearing down on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrubbs stares at the Demonata, eyes narrow and glinting yellow. His fangs grow an inch, his lips stretching with them. He grabs hold of my hand and Bec\u0027s. Energy spirals up my arm. I tense against it but then the voice of the Kah-Gash murmurs to me. It\u0027s all right. Don\u0027t fight. No harm will come of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t entirely trust that inner voice, but even if I wanted to reject the union, I couldn\u0027t. The magic within me warms to Grubbs\u0027s and I feel power well up from nowhere. The shock of it makes me gasp. My skin crackles and my fingers dig into Grubbs\u0027s huge paw. My legs go weak, then steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re drawing power from all around, from the earth, people, demons, the sky. Everything\u0027s linked. There are connecting lines everywhere, between humans, objects, the Demonata, the stars. The Kah-Gash was here before any of us, holding the sixty-four zones of the original universe together. And it still binds us in place-it just doesn\u0027t define the universes as tightly as it used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it could. With the power coursing through me now, I could quench the sun by snapping my fingers, and open a tunnel between universes. Make myself ruler of all worlds, people, and demons. Limits exist only in the mind. As the Kah-Gash, I\u0027d set those limits, not be bound by them. I could-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just kill these demons and leave it at that,\" Grubbs says, shattering my dreams of universal dominance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink, coming out of the spell I was under, amazed by how swiftly I gave in to temptation. Grubbs and Bec might not be the jokers in the pack. Maybe I\u0027m the weak link, the one the Kah-Gash can exploit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0027s no time for self-doubt. The demons are almost upon us. Our werewolves are howling and the soldiers are readying their rifles. Another second or two and all will be chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrubbs roars and I feel the magic of the Kah-Gash draining from me-from Bec too. Grubbs is the focal point through which the power is channeled. No way of fighting it now. The energy that we\u0027ve sucked in explodes through Grubbs, mixed in with his roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stream of raw power envelops the demons and stops them cold. Their eyes bulge as they choke in a net of magic. We hold them in place a moment, as easily as we\u0027d trap a colony of ants by lowering a jar over them. Then Grubbs blows on them the way he\u0027d blow on a feather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demons shoot backwards, through the walls of the building, then through the window between universes. The startled mage is blasted through as well, torn to shreds with most of the demons. When the area is clear, the stream of energy fans out and crackles across the face of the window. It glows brightly, then crumples, and the patches of light which were used to create it flood back to us along with the magic. The stream swirls around us, breaking up into vortex-like tendrils. Then Grubbs lets go of my hand and Bec\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power dwindles in seconds and the lights drift away. It\u0027s like nothing ever happened-apart from the huge hole in the front of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" Grubbs says, flexing his fingers and staring at them. \"That was great.\" He looks up at us and grins. \"Let\u0027s find more demons and do it again!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of hours later, in a hotel suite even grander than the last we stayed in, Grubbs is still itching to pick another fight, but Bec insists we should focus on Beranabus. The pair are arguing heatedly. I\u0027ve kept quiet. Dervish, Meera, and Kirilli say nothing either. We chipped in during the early stages of the argument, but for the last hour it\u0027s been pretty much Grubbs and Bec yelling at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget about crossing,\" Grubbs shouts, towering over the small, slender girl. \"I say we wait for them to come. With the power of the Kah-Gash, we\u0027ll drive them back every time. They\u0027ll soon realize they can\u0027t win and head off for softer pickings on other worlds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that\u0027s acceptable?\" Bec retorts, not intimidated by the grotesque, wolfen teenager. \"We pass them along and let others suffer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Meera said, we only care about this world,\" Grubbs huffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave me out of this,\" Meera snaps, but both ignore her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Death?\" Bec jeers. \"Will you repel the Shadow when it attacks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Death might be more powerful than the Demonata, but the Kah-Gash can trump it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Bec says. \"Death is the ultimate power. If we don\u0027t strike now, it will grow stronger and come to find us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrubbs shrugs. \"Do I look worried?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBec smothers a curse. \"You were all for attacking earlier. You wanted to go for Death like a dog after a rat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was before you brought Beranabus into the equation. I\u0027d still go if you only wanted to have a crack at the Shadow. But you want to free a dead man. That\u0027s what this is really about. Your beloved Bran turned coward at the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Bec screeches and appeals to the rest of us. \"Has he gone mad? Do any of you know what-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beranabus was afraid,\" Grubbs interrupts. \"That\u0027s why he told you to send Kernel after him. It wasn\u0027t so he could study Death from the inside and learn its secrets. He realized his soul might be trapped and he didn\u0027t want to spend eternity in the grasp of the Shadow. He hoped Kernel could get him out. You know that\u0027s true. You knew it from the moment you suggested the idea of rescuing him. Tell me I\u0027m wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBec says nothing. Her face was red with anger moments before, but now the flush fades. Her lower jaw trembles. She looks ashamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is personal,\" Grubbs growls, facing us like a lawyer addressing a jury. \"She\u0027s not thinking about beating Death. She only wants to set Beranabus free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with that?\" Meera asks quietly. \"He was her friend. You\u0027d do the same for Dervish in that position. So would I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t,\" Kirilli pipes up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No surprise there,\" Dervish mutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too dangerous,\" Grubbs yells. \"I liked Beranabus but I\u0027m not going to risk everything to save his soul. Hell, he might not even be there. Maybe Death didn\u0027t claim him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It did,\" I say softly. \"I\u0027ve been studying the lights while you were arguing, concentrating on Beranabus. A few started flashing as soon as I focused on him, and more have joined them. It\u0027s not like when I search for someone living, but if his soul hadn\u0027t been absorbed by the Shadow, no lights would flash at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, it took his soul. So what?\" Grubbs shrugs. \"How many of you want to risk a rescue? Who cared about the mad old buzzard that much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks around the room. Kirilli instantly shakes his head. Meera nods firmly to show she\u0027s on Bec\u0027s side. Dervish looks uncertain. \"We owe him,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We owe a lot of people,\" Grubbs grunts, \"but we can\u0027t always repay our debts. You taught me that. A Disciple doesn\u0027t risk his life to save a few people, not when the fate of billions is at stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I think we have a real chance of hurting the Shadow, I\u0027ll jump at it. But if we\u0027re just going over there to free Beranabus\u0027s soul.... That\u0027s not right. Beranabus wouldn\u0027t have thought so either-not until he crumbled at the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if he didn\u0027t?\" I ask angrily. \"I spent more time with him than any of you. I never saw him ask for favors. He was the most selfless person I knew. What if he really did hope to learn something that might help us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not willing to take that chance,\" Grubbs says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a fool,\" Bec shouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Grubbs sniffs. \"But it looks like we have a tie, three votes for each. You, Meera, and Kernel want to ride to the rescue. Kirilli and I have more sense. And Dervish...\" He looks to his uncle for a final answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish sighs. \"I agree with Grubbs. We can\u0027t let personal feelings cloud our judgment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it was personal for you?\" I softly challenge him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not,\" Dervish says wearily. \"If Grubbs was in that position, I\u0027d do all I could to free him. But he isn\u0027t, so there\u0027s no point-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill-E,\" Bec stops him. Dervish turns slowly, left eyelid ticking, but she isn\u0027t looking at him. She\u0027s staring at me. \"Is it Bill-E?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liar!\" Grubbs howls, raising a huge, shaggy fist. \"How dare you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I searched for him after I looked for Beranabus,\" I say quickly. \"I was running tests, searching for others I knew who\u0027d died, like Mrs. Egin, Logan Rile, Sharmila. I came up blank on all of them. Then I thought of Bill-E and a few lights flashed, the way they flashed for Beranabus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re lying...\" Grubbs growls, fingers clenched tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step forward. I\u0027m shaking like a rattlesnake\u0027s tail but I speak clearly. \"If you think I\u0027d say this to trick you, you don\u0027t know me at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrubbs stares into my eyes. He wants to find deception, but he can\u0027t, because I\u0027m telling the truth. His shoulders slump and he backs away. He shares a scared look with Dervish, who\u0027s been hit just as hard by the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBec could crow but she doesn\u0027t. She merely waits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I killed him to free him,\" Grubbs finally croaks. \"It was the hardest thing I\u0027ve done. I murdered my own brother. I wouldn\u0027t have done that to save the world, the universe, or anything else. But I couldn\u0027t bear to let him live in torment at the hands of the Demonata. I killed him to spare his suffering, to set him free. Now you\u0027re telling me I didn\u0027t, that the Shadow has him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears of blood trickle from Grubbs\u0027s eyes. Raising a hand, he wipes them away, then covers his face with his hand and moans softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to free them,\" Bec says. She crouches by his side and reaches out to embrace him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch me!\" he barks, pulling away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly,\" she smiles. \"I absorbed your secret when we linked outside. I know what Juni predicted. But I don\u0027t believe her. She\u0027s insane. You would never do what she claimed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrubbs cries out and wraps his arms around the little girl, hugging her like a doll, weeping while we stare at the pair of them, bewildered. When he finally stops crying, he releases Bec and grins shakily at her, then casts his gaze over the rest of us, his features firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show of hands. Who\u0027s going to help me and Bec kick some Shadow ass?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive arms rise immediately.
