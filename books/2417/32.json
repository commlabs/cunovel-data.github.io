I\u0027m sceptical about the place in Denton but I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s still got the lake property.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went by Parks and Wildlife. Les has a freshwater sailboat registered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whistled. \"You\u0027re pushing for a bonus, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of paperchasers overlook Parks and Wildlife. I normally wouldn\u0027t have tried it myself so early in the process. Usually you start with the obvious and work your way toward the obscure. Fortunately in this case, Kelly worked differently. Her procedure was dictated more by where all the government offices in Austin fell on her bus line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t a big boat,\" she told me. \"A twentyfive footer. He didn\u0027t need to get it registered but it looks like he did anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Les\u0027 bedroom, about the labelled shoe boxes that filled his closet, even his illegal drugs and his scams on women all neatly categorized and filed away. Maybe the bastard had been a little too organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He bought the boat at Plum Cove, Medina Lake. I made some calls, got an address for the drydock space he\u0027s been renting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found a pen wedged in the crack behind the ironing board/phone alcove and wrote down the information. \"Good stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. At least nobody else has asked about the boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pen froze above the paper. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was at DMV, the clerk recognized the name Les SaintPierre from a few weeks ago. It\u0027s an unusual name. He commented that Les must be in a lot of trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems I was the second person from the State Attorney that month looking through his records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e34\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother was squatting in her neighbours’ back J￡\\ yard, painting faux wisteria vines on a pine fence. ^^ To get to her I had to step carefully in my dress shoes through a minefield of pie tins filled with various colours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing purple overalls and a fuchsia Night in Old San Antonio Tshirt, both speckled with acrylic. The air was warm and stagnate with fumes and Mother was sweating almost as much as the open Pecan Street Ale bottle on the steppingstone next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe greeted me without looking up. She swirled her brush to form a cluster of pale purple petals. There was a fingerprint the exact same colour on the side of her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know they sell plants now,\" I said. \"You can just buy them in stores.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother suppressed a giggle. I think that was my first indication maybe she\u0027d been sitting in the heat and the paint fumes too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s trompe l\u0027oeil, Jackson.\" Then she lowered her voice. \"The Endemens are paying me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at the Endemens\u0027 house. Mr. Endemen, a scruffy retired newspaperman, was sitting at his typewriter at the diningroom table. He was trying hard to look busy, but he kept sneaking sideways glances at us through the picture window. He was frowning, like the view hadn\u0027t improved since I\u0027d arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t tell,\" I promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother finished her petals and looked up at me. She did a double take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ...\" She raised her eyebrows. \"I\u0027m sorry, I thought you were my son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you look wonderful dear. What happened to your chin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a bruise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. She had noticed something else too— that pheromonal afterglow that only mothers and girlfriends can detect, that aura which told her I had been Up To Something the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever conclusions she came to she kept to herself. She looked down at my ensemble while she stirred her brush through a pie tin. \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d\u0027ve chosen the brown tie, but it\u0027s nice. I suppose conservative is best for an interview.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A woman in purple overalls is giving me fashion tips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"I\u0027m very proud of you. Would you like to take a medicine pouch for luck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually I was hoping to borrow the Audi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother tightened her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached past me for her beer bottle. I stepped back so she wouldn\u0027t get paint on my black slacks. After she took a sip of Pecan Street Ale she looked up and down the fence at her work so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Endemen wants grape vines along the top,\" she mused. \"I think that\u0027s too much with the wisteria, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. \"You get paid per plant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"Artistic question. I shouldn\u0027t have asked you. I hope you want the Audi just to drive to UTSA?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave her my best innocent look. \"No ... I have some work to do afterward. It would be better if I didn\u0027t use my own car for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some work,\" she repeated. \"Dear, the last time you borrowed my car for some work...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027ll pay you back for any repairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not really the point, Jackson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I trade cars with you or not, Mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put down her paintbrush, then wiped her hands on a rag. She pulled her key chain out of her bib pocket with two fingers. \"My hands are sticky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the key off the chain. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother leaned in close to the fence and traced out a new curl in her vine. Mr. Endemen kept typing in the dining room, looking out the window from time to time to see if I\u0027d gone away yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" Mother said, \"are you nervous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refocused on her. \"About the interview?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sweat,\" I said. \"Sitting around with a bunch of professors won\u0027t be the worst thing that\u0027s happened to me this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother smiled knowingly. \"Don\u0027t worry. You\u0027ll do fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at my face again. For a minute I thought she might bring out a Kleenex, dab it on her tongue, and wipe my cheeks like she used to do when I was five. \"I hope we\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You having your traditional costume party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought, after all these years, that I could keep the resentment out of my voice. I\u0027m not sure I managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"It doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t make it a double celebration, Jackson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do my best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll come,\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I left she was still deliberating whether or not to go with the grape vines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe neighbourhood private security guy cruised past the front yard as I was opening my mother\u0027s white Audi sedan. He saw my dress clothes and for the first time in two years he didn\u0027t slow down or look at me suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an Indian medicine pouch waiting for me on Mother\u0027s dashboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e35\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that went just fine,\" David Mitchell told me. \"Come in, come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWJ His office was on the third floor of the Humanities \u0026amp;c Social Sciences Building, just down the hall from the interview room. On the office door was a Peanuts cartoon of Lucy in the psychiatrist\u0027s booth with the little DOCTOR is IN sign. Professor Mitchell, a man on the cutting edge of humour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis work space was messy but cozy, filled with crammed bookshelves and dented filing cabinets and dying potted plants. There was a Macintosh computer setup as big as a Hyundai against the back wall. A poster for the Houston Renaissance Festival above that. More Lucy and Linus cartoons were Scotchtaped around the room like hastily applied BandAids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell offered me a seat and a Diet Pepsi from his private stash. I accepted the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said. \"Now that we\u0027ve grilled you, perhaps you have some questions of your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded his head encouragingly. He\u0027d done that all the way through the formal interview while his three colleagues—two elderly Anglo men and one Latino— stared at me and frowned and asked me over and over again what exactly I\u0027d been doing since my postgraduate work. When they\u0027d shaken my hand at the end of the hour they\u0027d all looked worried, like they should\u0027ve worn surgical gloves. Maybe Mother was right. Maybe the brown tie had been a bad choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked Mitchell some questions. Mitchell nodded his head a lot. He had silver hair and silver sideburns that were trimmed into the shape of fins from a 1950s automobile. His features were pinched and angular and his eyes were beady like a weasel\u0027s. A nice weasel. A good ole weasel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell gave me some background on the teaching position that had opened up in the department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently old Dr. Haimer, who as far as anyone could remember had been teaching medieval literature since it was titled \"Contemporary Authors,\" was finally retiring, midterm. Last week, in fact. His two teaching assistants had resigned in protest, leaving Haimer\u0027s classes in the hands of other T.A.s and a few American Lit professors who probably thought Marie de France was some kind of bicycle race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Medieval just isn\u0027t a very popular field,\" Mitchell told me. \"Usually we\u0027d have plenty of lecturers waiting to fill the position in an emergency, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did Haimer leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell shook his head. \"He opposed the establishment of more separate ethnic studies programs. Said it was fragmenting, that the curriculum should have one inclusive canon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell looked grave. \"He had good intentions. The fact is he said what was on a lot of our minds. But his vote was the only open dissent in the faculty senate. Word got out to the students. Boycotts started, protests on the Patillo, signs that read RACIST. Not the sort of public relations the provost wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why me? You don\u0027t need another white guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitchell stared at me like I\u0027d just made an inside joke. \"Of course. The committee would prefer someone— \u0027of diverse gender and ethnicity,\u0027 I think is the going term.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, letting a little more distaste show. \"I\u0027ll have to speak with Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGutierrez about that in the committee meeting, I\u0027m sure, but let\u0027s talk about qualifi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecations, son. We need someone who knows the field, someone with a good background who can relate to the students. Someone young, a teacher more than a publisher. Technically it would only be for the rest of the year—a visiting assistant professor\u0027s position—until a more extensive hiring search can be conducted. But still, once you\u0027re in, once you make connections on the faculty—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded more encouragement, letting me get the picture. I got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked a little more about the interview process, about when I might come back to teach a demo class if the committee decided to go the next step. I wasn\u0027t holding my breath for that, but I said I could stay available. Mitchell nodded, content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the folder I\u0027d given him and ran down my credentials and training from Berkeley. He started shaking his head and smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re bilingual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spanish and English. Middle English. Some classical Spanish and Latin, enough AngloNorman to get the dirty jokes in the fabliaux.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whistled silently and closed the folder. \"You completed a fiveyear program in three years. These letters of recommendation are extremely strong. How is it after all that you got into ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked for a polite word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thug work?\" I offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. \"Let\u0027s go with \u0027investigations.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just luck. And the fact that the only job I could get with my Ph.D. at the time was tending a bar on Telegraph Avenue. And the fact that a friend of mine introduced me to someone, a criminal lawyer who sort of—took me in.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-32.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
