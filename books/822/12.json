{"id":19198,"no":12,"title":"RED-HEADED WINDEGO","content":"Big Baptiste Seguin, on snow-shoes nearly six feet long, strode mightily out of the forest, and gazed across the treeless valley ahead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hooraw! No choppin\u0027 for two mile!\" he shouted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hooraw! Bully! Hi-yi!\" yelled the axemen, Pierre, \"Jawnny,\" and \"Frawce,\" two hundred yards behind. Their cries were taken up by the two chain-bearers still farther back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is it a lake, Baptiste?\" cried Tom Dunscombe, the young surveyor, as he hurried forward through balsams that edged the woods and concealed the open space from those among the trees.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, seh; only a beaver meddy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Clean?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Clean! Yesseh! Clean\u0027s your face. Hain\u0027t no tree for two mile if de line is go right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good! We shall make seven miles to-day,\" said Tom, as he came forward with immense strides, carrying a compass and Jacob\u0027s-staff. Behind him the axemen slashed along, striking white slivers from the pink and scaly columns of red pines that shot up a hundred and twenty feet without a branch. If any underbrush grew there, it was beneath the eight-feet-deep February snow, so that one could see far away down a multitude of vaulted, converging aisles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Our young surveyor took no thought of the beauty and majesty of the forest he was leaving. His thoughts and those of his men were set solely on getting ahead; for all hands had been promised double pay for their whole winter, in case they succeeded in running a line round the disputed Moose Lake timber berth before the tenth of April.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Their success would secure the claim of their employer, Old Dan McEachran, whereas their failure would submit him perhaps to the loss of the limit, and certainly to a costly lawsuit with Old Rory Carmichael, another potentate of the Upper Ottawa.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At least six weeks more of fair snow-shoeing would be needed to \"blaze\" out the limit, even if the unknown country before them should turn out to be less broken by cedar swamps and high precipices than they feared. A few days\u0027 thaw with rain would make slush of the eight feet of snow, and compel the party either to keep in camp, or risk mal de raquette,—strain of legs by heavy snow-shoeing. So they were in great haste to make the best of fine weather. Tom thrust his Jacob\u0027s-staff into the snow, set the compass sights to the right bearing, looked through them, and stood by to let Big Baptiste get a course along the line ahead. Baptiste\u0027s duty was to walk straight for some selected object far away on the line. In woodland the axeman \"blazed\" trees on both sides of his snow-shoe track.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Baptiste was as expert at his job as any Indian, and indeed he looked as if he had a streak of Iroquois in his veins. So did \"Frawce,\" \"Jawnny,\" and all their comrades of the party.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The three pines will do,\" said Tom, as Baptiste crouched.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good luck to-day for sure!\" cried Baptiste, rising with his eyes fixed on three pines in the foreground of the distant timbered ridge. He saw that the line did indeed run clear of trees for two miles along one side of the long, narrow beaver meadow or swale.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Baptiste drew a deep breath, and grinned agreeably at Tom Dunscombe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"De boys will look like dey\u0027s all got de double pay in deys\u0027 pocket when dey\u0027s see dis open,\" said Baptiste, and started for the three pines as straight as a bee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tom waited to get from the chainmen the distance to the edge of the wood. They came on the heels of the axemen, and all capered on their snow-shoes to see so long a space free from cutting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was now two o\u0027clock; they had marched with forty pound or \"light\" packs since daylight, lunching on cold pork and hard-tack as they worked; they had slept cold for weeks on brush under an open tent pitched over a hole in the snow; they must live this life of hardship and huge work for six weeks longer, but they hoped to get twice their usual eighty-cents-a-day pay, and so their hearts were light and jolly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Big Baptiste, now two hundred yards in advance, swinging along in full view of the party, stopped with a scared cry. They saw him look to the left and to the right, and over his shoulder behind, like a man who expects mortal attack from a near but unknown quarter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the matter?\" shouted Tom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Baptiste went forward a few steps, hesitated, stopped, turned, and fairly ran back toward the party. As he came he continually turned his head from side to side as if expecting to see some dreadful thing following.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The men behind Tom stopped. Their faces were blanched. They looked, too, from side to side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Halt, Mr. Tom, halt! Oh, monjee, M\u0027sieu, stop!\" said Jawnny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tom looked round at his men, amazed at their faces of mysterious terror.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What on earth has happened?\" cried he.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Instead of answering, the men simply pointed to Big Baptiste, who was soon within twenty yards.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is the trouble, Baptiste?\" asked Tom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Baptiste\u0027s face was the hue of death. As he spoke he shuddered:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Monjee, Mr. Tom, we\u0027ll got for stop de job!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Stop the job! Are you crazy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you\u0027ll not b\u0027lieve what I told, den you go\u0027n\u0027 see for you\u0027se\u0027f.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"De track, seh.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What track? Wolves?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If it was only wolfs!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Confound you! can\u0027t you say what it is?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Eet\u0027s de—it ain\u0027t safe for told its name out loud, for dass de way it come—if it\u0027s call by its name!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Windego, eh?\" said Tom, laughing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll know its track jus\u0027 as quick\u0027s I see it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you mean you have seen a Windego track?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Monjee, seh, don\u0027t say its name! Let us go back,\" said Jawnny. \"Baptiste was at Madores\u0027 shanty with us when it took Hermidas Dubois.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yesseh. That\u0027s de way I\u0027ll come for know de track soon\u0027s I see it,\" said Baptiste. \"Before den I mos\u0027 don\u0027 b\u0027lieve dere was any of it. But ain\u0027t it take Hermidas Dubois only last New Year\u0027s?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That was all nonsense about Dubois. I\u0027ll bet it was a joke to scare you all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Who\u0027s kill a man for a joke?\" said Baptiste.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you see Hermidas Dubois killed? Did you see him dead? No! I heard all about it. All you know is that he went away on New Year\u0027s morning, when the rest of the men were too scared to leave the shanty, because some one said there was a Windego track outside.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hermidas never come back!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll bet he went away home. You\u0027ll find him at Saint Agathe in the spring. You can\u0027t be such fools as to believe in Windegos.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you say dat name some more!\" yelled Big Baptiste, now fierce with fright. \"Hain\u0027t I just seen de track? I\u0027m go\u0027n\u0027 back, me, if I don\u0027t get a copper of pay for de whole winter!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wait a little now, Baptiste,\" said Tom, alarmed lest his party should desert him and the job. \"I\u0027ll soon find out what\u0027s at the bottom of the track.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dere is blood at de bottom—I seen it!\" said Baptiste.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, you wait till I go and see it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No! I go back, me,\" said Baptiste, and started up the slope with the others at his heels.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Halt! Stop there! Halt, you fools! Don\u0027t you understand that if there was any such monster it would as easily catch you in one place as another?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The men went on. Tom took another tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Boys, look here! I say, are you going to desert me like cowards?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hain\u0027t goin\u0027 for desert you, Mr. Tom, no seh!\" said Baptiste, halting. \"Honly I\u0027ll hain\u0027 go for cross de track.\" They all faced round.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tom was acquainted with a considerable number of Windego superstitions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s no danger unless it\u0027s a fresh track,\" he said. \"Perhaps it\u0027s an old one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fresh made dis mornin\u0027,\" said Baptiste.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, wait till I go and see it. You\u0027re all right, you know, if you don\u0027t cross it. Isn\u0027t that the idea?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, seh. Mr. Humphreys told Madore \u0027bout dat. Eef somebody cross de track and don\u0027t never come back, den de magic ain\u0027t in de track no more. But it\u0027s watchin\u0027, watchin\u0027 all round to catch somebody what cross its track; and if nobody don\u0027t cross its track and get catched, den de—de Ting mebby get crazy mad, and nobody don\u0027 know what it\u0027s goin\u0027 for do. Kill every person, mebby.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tom mused over this information. These men had all been in Madore\u0027s shanty; Madore was under Red Dick Humphreys; Red Dick was Rory Carmichael\u0027s head foreman; he had sworn to stop the survey by hook or by crook, and this vow had been made after Tom had hired his gang from among those scared away from Madore\u0027s shanty. Tom thought he began to understand the situation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Just wait a bit, boys,\" he said, and started.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You ain\u0027t surely go\u0027n\u0027 for cross de track?\" cried Baptiste.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not now, anyway,\" said Tom. \"But wait till I see it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When he reached the mysterious track it surprised him so greatly that he easily forgave Baptiste\u0027s fears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If a giant having ill-shaped feet as long as Tom\u0027s snow-shoes had passed by in moccasins, the main features of the indentations might have been produced. But the marks were no deeper in the snow than if the huge moccasins had been worn by an ordinary man. They were about five and a half feet apart from centres, a stride that no human legs could take at a walking pace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Moreover, there were on the snow none of the dragging marks of striding; the gigantic feet had apparently been lifted straight up clear of the snow, and put straight down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Strangest of all, at the front of each print were five narrow holes which suggested that the mysterious creature had travelled with bare, claw-like toes. An irregular drip or squirt of blood went along the middle of the indentations! Nevertheless, the whole thing seemed of human devising.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This track, Tom reflected, was consistent with the Indian superstition that Windegos are monsters who take on or relinquish the human form, and vary their size at pleasure. He perceived that he must bring the maker of those tracks promptly to book, or suffer his men to desert the survey, and cost him his whole winter\u0027s work, besides making him a laughing-stock in the settlements.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The young fellow made his decision instantly. After feeling for his match-box and sheath-knife, he took his hatchet from his sash, and called to the men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go into camp and wait for me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he set off alongside of the mysterious track at his best pace. It came out of a tangle of alders to the west, and went into such another tangle about a quarter of a mile to the east. Tom went east. The men watched him with horror.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s got crazy, looking at de track,\" said Big Baptiste, \"for that\u0027s the way,—one is enchanted,—he must follow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He was a good boss,\" said Jawnny, sadly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the young fellow disappeared in the alders the men looked at one another with a certain shame. Not a sound except the sough of pines from the neighboring forest was heard. Though the sun was sinking in clear blue, the aspect of the wilderness, gray and white and severe, touched the impressionable men with deeper melancholy. They felt lonely, masterless, mean.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He was a good boss,\" said Jawnny again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tort Dieu!\" cried Baptiste, leaping to his feet. \"It\u0027s a shame for desert the young boss. I don\u0027t care; the Windego can only kill me. I\u0027m going for help Mr. Tom.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Me also,\" said Jawnny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then all wished to go. But after some parley it was agreed that the others should wait for the portageurs, who were likely to be two miles behind, and make camp for the night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soon Baptiste and Jawnny, each with his axe, started diagonally across the swale, and entered the alders on Tom\u0027s track.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It took them twenty yards through the alders, to the edge of a warm spring or marsh about fifty yards wide. This open, shallow water was completely encircled by alders that came down to its very edge. Tom\u0027s snow-shoe track joined the track of the mysterious monster for the first time on the edge—and there both vanished!\n\u003cbr\u003e BAPTISTE AND JAWNNY LOOKED AT THE PLACE IN THE WILDEST TERROR\n\u003cbr\u003e BAPTISTE AND JAWNNY LOOKED AT THE PLACE IN THE WILDEST TERROR\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Baptiste and Jawnny looked at the place with the wildest terror, and without even thinking to search the deeply indented opposite edges of the little pool for a reappearance of the tracks, fled back to the party. It was just as Red Dick Humphreys had said; just as they had always heard. Tom, like Hermidas Dubois, appeared to have vanished from existence the moment he stepped on the Windego track!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The dimness of early evening was in the red-pine forest through which Tom\u0027s party had passed early in the afternoon, and the belated portageurs were tramping along the line. A man with a red head had been long crouching in some cedar bushes to the east of the \"blazed\" cutting. When he had watched the portageurs pass out of sight, he stepped over upon their track, and followed it a short distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A few minutes later a young fellow, over six feet high, who strongly resembled Tom Dunscombe, followed the red-headed man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The stranger, suddenly catching sight of a flame far away ahead on the edge of the beaver meadow, stopped and fairly hugged himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Camped, by jiminy! I knowed I\u0027d fetch \u0027em,\" was the only remark he made.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish Big Baptiste could see that Windego laugh,\" thought Tom Dunscombe, concealed behind a tree.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After reflecting a few moments, the red-headed man, a wiry little fellow, went forward till he came to where an old pine had recently fallen across the track. There he kicked off his snow-shoes, picked them up, ran along the trunk, jumped into the snow from among the branches, put on his snow-shoes, and started northwestward. His new track could not be seen from the survey line.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Tom had beheld and understood the purpose of the manoeuvre. He made straight for the head of the fallen tree, got on the stranger\u0027s tracks and cautiously followed them, keeping far enough behind to be out of hearing or sight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The red-headed stranger went toward the wood out of which the mysterious track of the morning had come. When he had reached the little brush-camp in which he had slept the previous night, he made a small fire, put a small tin pot on it, boiled some tea, broiled a venison steak, ate his supper, had several good laughs, took a long smoke, rolled himself round and round in his blanket, and went to sleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hours passed before Tom ventured to crawl forward and peer into the brush camp. The red-headed man was lying on his face, as is the custom of many woodsmen. His capuchin cap covered his red head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tom Dunscombe took off his own long sash. When the red-headed man woke up he found that some one was on his back, holding his head firmly down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Unable to extricate his arms or legs from his blankets, the red-headed man began to utter fearful threats. Tom said not one word, but diligently wound his sash round his prisoner\u0027s head, shoulders, and arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He then rose, took the red-headed man\u0027s own \"tump-line,\" a leather strap about twelve feet long, which tapered from the middle to both ends, tied this firmly round the angry live mummy, and left him lying on his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then, collecting his prisoner\u0027s axe, snowshoes, provisions, and tin pail, Tom started with them back along the Windego track for camp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Big Baptiste and his comrades had supped too full of fears to go to sleep. They had built an enormous fire, because Windegos are reported, in Indian circles, to share with wild beasts the dread of flames and brands. Tom stole quietly to within fifty yards of the camp, and suddenly shouted in unearthly fashion. The men sprang up, quaking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s the Windego!\" screamed Jawnny.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You silly fools!\" said Tom, coming forward. \"Don\u0027t you know my voice? Am I a Windego?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s the Windego, for sure; it\u0027s took the shape of Mr. Tom, after eatin\u0027 him,\" cried Big Baptiste.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tom laughed so uproariously at this that the other men scouted the idea, though it was quite in keeping with their information concerning Windegos\u0027 habits.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then Tom came in and gave a full and particular account of the Windego\u0027s pursuit, capture, and present predicament.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But how\u0027d he make de track?\" they asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He had two big old snow-shoes, stuffed with spruce tips underneath, and covered with dressed deerskin. He had cut off the back ends of them. You shall see them to-morrow. I found them down yonder where he had left them after crossing the warm spring. He had five bits of sharp round wood going down in front of them. He must have stood on them one after the other, and lifted the back one every time with the pole he carried. I\u0027ve got that, too. The blood was from a deer he had run down and killed in the snow. He carried the blood in his tin pail, and sprinkled it behind him. He must have run out our line long ago with a compass, so he knew where it would go. But come, let us go and see if it\u0027s Red Dick Humphreys.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Red Dick proved to be the prisoner. He had become quite philosophic while waiting for his captor to come back. When unbound he grinned pleasantly, and remarked:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re Mr. Dunscombe, eh? Well, you\u0027re a smart young feller, Mr. Dunscombe. There ain\u0027t another man on the Ottaway that could \u0027a\u0027 done that trick on me. Old Dan McEachran will make your fortun\u0027 for this, and I don\u0027t begrudge it. You\u0027re a man—that\u0027s so. If ever I hear any feller saying to the contrayry he\u0027s got to lick Red Dick Humphreys.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he told them the particulars of his practical joke in making a Windego track round Madore\u0027s shanty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hermidas Dubois?—oh, he\u0027s all right,\" said Red Dick. \"He\u0027s at home at St. Agathe. Man, he helped me to fix up that Windego track at Madore\u0027s; but, by criminy! the look of it scared him so he wouldn\u0027t cross it himself.
