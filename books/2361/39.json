An ambulance attendant accompanied by two uniformed policemen went through the swinging doors and approached the supervisor behind the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have an order here to pick up a Rubio Arzano,\" one of the policemen said. He handed over the document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe supervisor looked at it and frowned. \"I don\u0027t think I have the authority to release him. It should be handled by the administrator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe supervisor hesitated. \"There\u0027s a problem. He\u0027s away for the weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not our problem. There\u0027s our release order, signed by Colonel Acoca. Do you want to call him and tell him you won\u0027t honor it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said hastily. \"That won\u0027t be necessary. I\u0027ll have them get the prisoner ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf a mile away, in front of the city jail, two detectives emerged from a police car and entered the building. They approached the desk sergeant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men showed his badge. \"We\u0027re here to pick up Lucia Carmine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant looked at the two detectives in front of him and said, \"No one told me anything about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the detectives sighed. \"Goddamned bureaucracy. The left hand never tells the right hand what it\u0027s doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see that release order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe detectives handed it to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colonel Acoca signed it, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you taking her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madrid. The colonel is going to question her himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he? Well, I think I\u0027d better check it out with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no need to do that,\" the detective protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mister, we\u0027ve got orders to keep a tight grip on this lady. The Italian government is having an orgasm over getting her back. If Colonel Acoca wants her, he\u0027s going to have to tell me himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wasting time, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a lot of time, amigo. What I don\u0027t have is another ass if I lose mine over this.\" He picked up the phone and said, \"Get me Colonel Acoca in Madrid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ!\" the detective said. \"My wife is going to kill me if I\u0027m late for dinner again. Besides, the colonel\u0027s probably not even in, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone on the desk rang. The sergeant reached for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice said, \"I have the colonel\u0027s office on the line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant gave the detectives a triumphant look. \"Hello. This is the desk sergeant at the police station in Aranda de Duero. It is important that I speak to Colonel Acoca.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the detectives looked at his watch impatiently. \"\u0026amp;iexcl;Mierda! I have better things to do than stand around and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello. Colonel Acoca?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice boomed out over the phone. \"Yes. What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have two detectives here, Colonel, who want me to release a prisoner into your custody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucia Carmine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they show you an order signed by me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. They - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what the fuck are you bothering me for? Release her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just thought - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think. Follow orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant swallowed. \"He - er - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a short fuse, hasn\u0027t he?\" the detective grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant rose, trying to retain his dignity. \"I\u0027ll have her brought out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the alley in back of the police station, a small boy was watching a man on the telephone pole disconnect a clamp from a wire and climb down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" the boy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man ruffled his hand through the boy\u0027s hair. \"Helping out a friend, muchacho. Helping out a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hours later, at an isolated farmhouse to the north, Lucia Carmine and Rubio Arzano were reunited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcoca was awakened by the telephone at three A.M. The familiar voice said, \"The Committee would like to meet with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Colonel. A limousine will pick you up in one hour. Be ready, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe replaced the receiver and sat on the edge of the bed, then lit a cigarette and let the smoke bite deep into his lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA limousine will pick you up in one hour. Be ready, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would be ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went into the bathroom and examined his image in the mirror. He was looking into the eyes of a defeated man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so close, he thought bitterly. So close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Acoca began to shave, very carefully, and when he was finished, he took a long, hot shower, then selected the clothes he was going to wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly one hour later, he walked to the front door and took a last look at the home he knew he would never see again. There would be no meeting, of course. They would have nothing further to discuss with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, black limousine waiting in front of the house. A door opened as he approached the car. There were two men in front and two in back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in, Colonel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath and entered the car. A moment later, it sped away into the black night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s like a dream, Lucia thought. I\u0027m looking out the window at the Swiss Alps. I\u0027m actually here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJaime Miro had arranged for a guide to see that she reached Zurich safely. She had arrived late at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, I\u0027ll go to the Bank Leu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought made her nervous. What if something had gone wrong? What if the money was no longer there? What if...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the first light of dawn inched over the mountains, Lucia was still awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes before nine, she left the Baur au Lac hotel and stood in front of the bank, waiting for it to open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA kindly-looking middle-aged man unlocked the door. \"Come in, please. I hope you haven\u0027t been waiting long?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a few months, Lucia thought. \"No. Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ushered her inside. \"What can we do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake me rich. \"My father has an account here. He asked me to come in and - and take it over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it a numbered account?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I have the number, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B2A149207.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"One moment, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched him disappear toward a vault in back. The bank was beginning to fill with customers. It\u0027s got to be there, Lucia thought. Nothing must go -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was approaching her. She could read nothing in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This account - you say it was in your father\u0027s name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart sank. \"Yes. Angelo Carmine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her a moment. \"The account carries two names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid that mean she would not be able to touch it? \"What - \" She could scarcely get the words out. \"What\u0027s the other name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucia Carmine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that instant, she owned the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe account amounted to a little more than thirteen million dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you like it handled?\" the banker asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you transfer it to one of your associated banks in Brazil? Rio?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. We\u0027ll send you the documentation by messenger this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was that simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia\u0027s next stop was at a travel agency near the hotel. There was a large poster in the window advertising Brazil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s an omen, Lucia thought happily. She went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I would like two tickets to Brazil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no extradition laws there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not wait to tell Rubio how well everything was going. He was in Biarritz waiting for her call. They would be going to Brazil together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can live in peace there for the rest of our lives,\" she had told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow everything was finally set. After all the adventure and the dangers...the arrest of her father and brothers and her vengeance against Benito Patas and Judge Buscetta...the police looking for her and her escape to the convent...Acoca\u0027s men and the phony friar...Jaime Miro and Teresa and the gold cross...and Rubio Arzano. Most of all, dear Rubio. How many times had he risked his life for her? He had saved her from the soldiers in the woods...from the raging waters at the waterfall...from the men in the bar at Aranda de Duero. The very thought of Rubio warmed Lucia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned to her hotel room and picked up the telephone, waiting for the operator to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will be something for him to do in Rio. What? What can he do? He\u0027ll probably want to buy a farm somewhere out in the country. But then what would I do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn operator\u0027s voice said, \"Number, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia sat there staring out the window at the snow-covered Alps. We have two different lives, Rubio and I. We live in different worlds. I\u0027m the daughter of Angelo Carmine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Number, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s a farmer. That\u0027s what he loves. How can I take him away from that? I can\u0027t do that to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe operator was getting impatient. \"Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia said slowly, \"No. No, thank you.\" She replaced the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly the following morning, she boarded a Swissair flight to Rio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was alone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-39.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
