He needed to make sure the passwords hadn\u0027t changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn\u0027t why he\u0027d waited for her, why he\u0027d picked up dinner and lit candles and put on her favorite music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been hoping for the courage to tell her the truth. He thought if he looked straight into her eyes, he could confess what he had been sucked into, how hopelessly entangled he\u0027d become. He would explain that his motive had been pure—he just wanted to save his daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma would understand instantly. She\u0027d grip his hands across the table, her face beautiful and compassionate in the candlelight. She wouldn\u0027t condemn him, wouldn\u0027t call him a monster. She\u0027d talk the problem through with him until he figured out another way to save Mallory, and himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be so different than it had been with Ann—that last horrible argument of their marriage, when he\u0027d tried to tell her about the letters from Samuel, only to have the conversation deteriorate into one more shouting match about why Ann should quit her job, why they should put Mallory in another school, get her away from Race. Finally, his patience had snapped—his years of frustration and rage discharged in a single brutal slap across his wife\u0027s jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere could be no forgiveness for that. No second chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce you lose control, women never trust you again. Norma had made that clear tonight, with the fear in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the computer screen, the wireless connection accessing a bank account halfway around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitterness tasted like cheap whiskey on his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy the fuck not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe calls had all been made. The setup was perfect. All it took now was a single e-mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He ain\u0027t going away,” Pérez had warned him that afternoon. “You throw more money at this Samuel, play his easy fuck—you think he\u0027ll ever leave you alone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez had been loading his gun at the kitchen table, pushing nine-millimeter cartridges into the magazine with the care of a pharmacist counting pills. “All I need is two plane tickets, Boss. I got a friend can help. We get the girl back, teach this Chadwick a lesson. Then you call this son-of-a-bitch Samuel\u0027s bluff. He shows his face, I blow him the fuck away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez\u0027s plan had appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t the real reason John was hesitating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hated to admit it, but he had begun to see the wisdom in what Ann had done, calling Chadwick. At least Mallory was out of danger. At least she was far away from the Montroses. And after all these years, dreaming of destroying Ann, now that it was within his reach, he found it hard to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn could close the laptop, drive home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police he could handle. He had started pulling strings already on the Talia Montrose problem, letting a few well-placed friends in Oakland know that a certain homicide sergeant needed help distinguishing a concerned citizen from a suspect. The only person to fear was Samuel. And what could Samuel do to him—expose his past sins? That meant nothing to him anymore, as long as his daughter was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen asked for a prompt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long would it take—ten minutes? Less. He had planned so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the Bay, the Sausalito ferry was coming back from its final evening run. He imagined his father at the Embarcadero docks, forty years ago, sitting on his toolbox, wiping the grease off his forehead with the back of his hand while he waited for the boat. He would be bone-tired, having worked repairs since six in the morning, but he\u0027d still have energy to sit with John, tell him stories about the Pacific War. When the ferry docked, he would have exactly ten minutes, from 7:50 to 8:00, to do a final check on the engine before sending it back across the Bay, where it would dock in Sausalito for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That boat is no fool,” his father would tell him, tousling John\u0027s hair so he would smell like engine grease for a week. “Works here, but sleeps up north with the rich folk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would flash his crooked teeth, the front two broken in a bar fight years ago, but John would see the sadness in his eyes, the spirit that had been broken when John\u0027s mother left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn had promised himself he would never turn into his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would be one of those rich folk across the Bay. He would keep his family together. As a boy, he assumed that if he just managed the first part, the second part would take care of itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took out his cell phone, stared at the number that had been sent with the last letter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCall when it\u0027s done, the letter said. The number will only work one time. Punch in 12 23. Then hang up. I will call you back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12/23. John wasn\u0027t blind to the meaning of that. It had been Katherine Chadwick\u0027s birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dialed as he\u0027d been told, then hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he was expecting it, the sound of the return call made him jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, John.” The voice was distorted. It could\u0027ve been a man or a woman or a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, John was finally talking to the ghost—the one who had turned his life into hell all these years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m not going through with it,” John said. “Do what you want. You won\u0027t get a dime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a rushing, distorted sound in the background—maybe a highway, or a river. John wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost said, “You think you\u0027re safe from me, John? You think I\u0027ve forgiven you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t care anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s brave. You know what your daughter did today?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She\u0027s out of your reach, you bastard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She ate one slice of bread,” the ghost said. “Drank some river water. She screamed at her instructors in the obstacle course, got put in a sack, John. A big burlap thing with a chain through it. Duct tape on her mouth. They locked her in a small room with no windows for two hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn sank to his knees, the phone pressed against his ear, his forehead bowing toward the pavement that smelled of pigeon crap and rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can get to her anytime, John. Do anything I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll his confidence drained away. Mallory was a little girl again, shivering in a huge black recliner, waiting for him to rescue her, her eyes accusing him for being gone so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” he said. “Leave her alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have your instructions, John. You\u0027re going to cooperate. You know it\u0027s for the best. That is what we all want, isn\u0027t it? We all want a happy ending. Don\u0027t we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My daughter—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She\u0027s asleep now. In a little cinder block cabin. She\u0027s shivering. No heat. She\u0027s hungry. They yell at her every morning, noon, and night. If you had custody, you could sign your name to some papers and have her home. Or do you want me to take care of her for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m online now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s good. The problem is, you used up your one call. Do what I told you. I\u0027ll be in touch. And John—you don\u0027t have any leeway left. Understand me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn looked up at the screen of his laptop—the screensaver etching orange curlicues in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of his father\u0027s eyes, as bright as shattered glass, staring out at the lights of Sausalito as if they were patches of ship wreckage, burning on the Okinawan Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen John began to type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kindra Jones—Chadwick,” Hunter said. “Mix it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shook hands, Chadwick trying to hold down his feeling of wariness, thinking about how many times he had replayed this scene with different women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKindra Jones was lithe, athletic, her hair in cornrows. She had perfect Nefertiti features, her long neck inclined slightly forward. Black horn-rimmed glasses, gold stud in her nose and clothes that seemed randomly chosen from dryers at the laundromat—camouflage and corduroy; olive, brown, muddy blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a firm handshake and a cocky smile that Chadwick immediately liked—and then, just as immediately, dreaded, thinking that she was destined to be another coin lost in the wishing well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jones is from California,” Hunter put in. “You\u0027ll get along fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if all Californians were one happy family. But Chadwick nodded politely. “Where from?” he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alameda,” Jones told him. “And Sacramento. And a few other places. Papa was a rolling stone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t old enough to know that song, and the fact she did, almost made Chadwick smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter gave them a quick briefing—the dozen clients he needed to schedule for pickup, twice that many gray and tan levels to process out to the other facilities. Business was good. The escort service couldn\u0027t afford downtime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now, Ms. Jones,” Hunter said, handing her a stack of files to read, “if you would excuse me, I have a few things to go over with Chadwick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you,” Jones said, and her smile suggested she was really looking forward to starting work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was gone, Chadwick said, “Promising.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Hunter said absently. “BA in education. Good recs. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll drive her away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cynic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter pushed aside a paper plate of half-eaten cafeteria food—turkey, cranberry sauce, pumpkin bread. He switched on his main monitor, began rewinding a green-tinted surveillance tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick said, “You left the staff party pretty early.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter waved the comment aside. “Come here. I want you to see this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick pulled a chair around the side of the desk. He watched the tape rewind—ghostly figures moving backwards, bars of silver static.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruth was, he\u0027d been glad to leave the party himself. It had been the first time he\u0027d seen his ex-partner Olsen since she\u0027d quit escorting. He wasn\u0027t good at avoiding people, even when it was clear that was what Olsen wanted. She\u0027d stood chatting with a group of other counselors, wearing her new white uniform, trying not to make eye contact with him, which wasn\u0027t easy. Given her basketball player\u0027s stature, the two of them had easily been the tallest people at the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There,” Hunter said, stopping the tape and letting it run forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera angle was Black Level Clearing Three—looking down from a tree branch just outside the barracks. It was a night-vision shot, so everything in the picture glowed. Black Level students were being mustered in for dawn exercises. The instructor was Frank Leyland. Counselors shouldn\u0027t have been on duty yet—they usually didn\u0027t join the fun until after morning drills—but Chadwick recognized Olsen. She stood with her back to a mesquite tree, her blond hair and white fatigues blurred in the film like a bleach stain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallory Zedman stumbled out of the barracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn assistant instructor was right behind her—yelling, though there was no sound. Mallory kept turning away from him, refusing to get in line. Then Olsen came up, put her hand on Mallory\u0027s shoulder, said something. Mallory reluctantly got into formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeyland paced back and forth, issuing orders, lecturing—like any morning inspection. Then Mallory detached herself from the line. She stepped toward Olsen with something in her fist, something that glinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlsen didn\u0027t see her coming until Mallory was on top of her. Then it was too late. Mallory\u0027s arm flashed and then she ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChaos in the line. The kids broke in every direction. Olsen staggered, clutching her shoulder. The assistant instructor ran to Olsen\u0027s aid. Leyland started after Mallory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter hit the pause button, froze Leyland mid-stride, canted forward like an Olympian statue. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-22.html","bookId":2423,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM"}
