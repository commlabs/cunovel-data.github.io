I’m just saying he’s not off the suspect list.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll take Dirk,” Jackson said quietly. “Probe into his past and find out about his every movement over the past month and, more important, the past few days. Find out exactly where he was when Helen went missing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was at the Dragonslayer,” Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi cleared his throat. “He was with Bootsie, Sullivan, Macy, Aldous, your buddy Roger English and others when Helen was there. Which is the last time she was seen. They all said they’d seen her. But we don’t know now just how long any of those people were there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby was silent again. Malachi saw that Kat and Angela were watching her with sympathy; it was a difficult thing to learn that those you believed in might not be all that they seemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Savannah is filled with ships, boats, yachts—and ship’s captains,” Abby said stubbornly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We realize that, and we’ve been pulling names and working on investigating ships, their schedules and their crews. But, so far, the victims we know have something in common,” Jackson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Abby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They all made meal purchases at the Dragonslayer within a few days of their disappearances.” Jackson looked at the sheet in front of him. “Even Rupert Holloway. He ate at the Dragonslayer two nights before he disappeared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby was frustrated. She felt she should be doing more. Perhaps going back to the Dragonslayer, confronting the image of Blue Anderson and demanding he show up, have a conversation with her. She wanted to yell at him and make sure he understood that she needed his help because people had been killed. And if their killer was doing terrible things while pretending to be him, his reputation was being tarnished. He’d been a good pirate—good at piracy and good in that he’d followed a moral code. He didn’t act with wanton cruelty, the way many had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still learning about ghosts, of course. And yelling at one would probably prove as effective as yelling at the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Malachi were at the riverfront. They were due to have another interview with Helen Long in a few hours. In the meanwhile, Jackson had suggested they wander down by the river and get something to eat. She was hungry, since their meals had been irregular over the past few days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dined on bangers and mash at one of her favorite Irish pubs. From their vantage point on the outside patio, they could see one of the reproduction paddle wheelers heading out on the river. Gulls squawked and thronged the walks and the air; tourists ambled in and out of the shops on the riverfront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Paddle wheelers,” Abby said. “Has anyone checked into those?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jackson had the police make thorough sweeps. Not one of the captains or owners refused. They cooperated. I don’t believe we’re looking for a paddleboat. No, we’re looking for a sailing ship,” Malachi said. “Or maybe a rowboat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are we ever going to find it now?” Abby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoever’s doing this must still have been on the river when you saw Helen,” he pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned at that. “I don’t remember seeing any vessels. I saw Helen because...she was a shadow. She was a shadow on the river, but there was movement. I didn’t really think. I plunged in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was lucky you did. Although plunging in without thinking isn’t such a good idea most of the time,” Malachi told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby ignored that. “One day you’ll have to really see this city,” Abby said, changing the subject. “Savannah is so beautiful. We’ve been to Colonial Park Cemetery but Bonaventure is one of the loveliest, most gracious cemeteries I’ve ever seen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was there,” he reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Right. Gus’s funeral,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d actually been there before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh! I’m sorry. A lot of people visit the city, of course, and you’re not that far away, so...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know Savannah like you do,” he said. He swallowed a long drink of iced tea and set his glass down. “Excellent bangers and mash, by the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “They have great Irish music here, too. And you really should have lunch at Mrs. Wilkes’s. Every morning at eleven—and I mean every morning—a crowd forms. It’s 107 West Jones. When you go in, tourist or local, you sit at a big table with strangers and you leave with a bunch of new friends. The food’s superb. Gus and my folks used to take me there when Sema Wilkes was still alive, and she was wonderful.” She took a deep breath. “There are so many historic homes all over Savannah. There’s the Historic Savannah Theater, Juliette Gordon Low’s birthplace, the Massie Heritage Center, and you should take a carriage ride down the streets and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached across the table and touched her hand. “I will do all those things,” he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, wondering why she suddenly felt as if she’d known him for a long time. She really knew so little about him....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept, she knew she wanted to wake up beside him again. She’d be disconsolate if he never touched her again, if she couldn’t study his eyes or the way he smiled. Or watch him when he was working something out—by logic or intuition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby looked down, feeling she’d gushed too much. She didn’t need to be defensive; Savannah was a gem of a city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Virginia is great, too,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “Virginia is great. I love Richmond. The White House of the Confederacy, Hollywood Cemetery and all the old Civil War memorials... My part of Virginia is pretty remote. But I think you’d like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to answer him; she wanted to talk about Virginia, or anything else rather than what was going on between them. But before she could say a word, she was startled by the presence of someone beside their table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Roger English. “Hey, you two okay?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, Roger.” Abby smiled at him. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “Yeah. I shouldn’t admit it, but yesterday freaked me out. I watched the news today and it’s great—you fished Helen Long out of the river last night!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve seen her, Roger, and she’s doing well,” Malachi told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did she solve everything?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s in the hospital, so we’re trying to give her time to feel better before getting her to remember details,” Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger nodded. “Hopefully she’ll have what you need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here?” Abby asked him. “Did you just happen by?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came to meet Bianca for lunch. But she’s late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure she’ll be along in a few minutes,” Abby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really like her,” Roger murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby suddenly heard a mental echo of her own voice. I’m sure she’ll be along in a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she might not be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at Malachi, who was studying Roger. “Why don’t you give her a call, see what’s holding her up?” Malachi suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have. She’s not answering her cell. I tried her bed-and-breakfast, too. Couldn’t reach her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possible explanation seemed to hit Roger as he spoke. His knees gave out; he would’ve fallen if Malachi hadn’t leaped to his feet to bring a chair around for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger stared at the two of them. “He’s got her!” he cried. “Call the police! I’ve got to call the police. You are the police. No, you’re the feds... Oh, God. What do I do, what do I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi already had his phone out. “First, don’t panic. People do run late. Cell phone batteries die. But under the circumstances, we’ll get all the information we have on Bianca to David Caswell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger looked as if he’d been hit by a brick. While Malachi spoke to David on the phone, Abby asked Roger, “Her name is Bianca Salzburg, right? She said she was transferring here from Chicago. Is she from Chicago? This is important, Roger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Salzburg, yes,” Roger answered. “She was born in Chicago and went to Northwestern. She works for a small shipping company that handles delicate items—Pack-A-Gram, it’s called. They’re opening an office in Savannah. She was staying at the old Hayden house. You know the place, Abby. It was owned by Jimmy Hayden until last year when he died. His niece Shelly came back to take over the property and turned it into a B and B. She fixed it up nicely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was little emotion in his voice, he was so distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby thought, but didn’t say, that—like the known victims—Bianca had eaten at the Dragonslayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi ended his call and made another before returning the phone to his pocket. “David’s on it and he’ll be here soon. We’ve reported the situation to our colleagues, as well. Bianca could show up in a few minutes, but we’ll get started on the information we need, just because we’re all concerned these days. So, how late is she, Roger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger glanced at his watch. “Now? Almost forty minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My colleague Angela Hawkins is on her way here to wait with you. Meanwhile, Jackson Crow is hitting the national databases to get all the information we can on Bianca. Let’s hope she shows in a few minutes, apologizing for being late and explaining that she didn’t charge her phone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger jumped to his feet. “Helen! You have to get Helen to tell you what’s going on. I’ll go to the hospital. She’ll talk to me—she’ll tell us what happened. You saved her, right? She owes you, Abby. You have to make her tell you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalachi rose and set his hands on Roger’s shoulders. “Look at me, buddy. You panicking will not help Bianca. We’ve spoken with Helen, and we’ll speak with her again, see if we can’t get some details that might help. But listen to me and try to understand. We can’t force Helen to tell us what she doesn’t know.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-alive-krewe-of-hunters-10/page-31.html","bookId":2284,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:50 PM"}
