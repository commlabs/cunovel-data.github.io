Flashing lights splashed the landscape as a police car pulled onto the shoulder of Storrow Drive. Cops had arrived to assist the crashed cars on Storrow Drive, but it wouldn’t be long before they came over to check out Back Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Myrddin?” I asked Juliet. “Is he still here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That fellow with the jar? Is he the wizard? He’s gone. Disappeared. He moves fast for someone who’s not a vampire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He went into the demon plane.” Mab’s voice issued from beneath the vampire who pinned her. I couldn’t shoot this vampire with the cops right on Storrow Drive, but I yanked him off her and tossed him over a couple of cars. Mab sat up, rubbing her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked terrible. Worse than before, like someone had stolen my aunt and replaced her with an ailing centenarian. Drooping eyelids and puffy bags turned her eyes into slits. Age spots mottled her skin, and wrinkles creased every inch of her face. Her head shook with palsied trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched her chest where her pendant had hung. “Myrddin took the bloodstone with him. We must get it back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will. We know where to find him.” At the fifth and final point to complete the rune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s little time.” Mab’s voice was a mere croak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore sirens were headed our way. Not a good idea to be found at a murder scene. I kicked the decomposing vampire at my feet. Let his friend take the blame. It would send human-paranormal relations back to the Dark Ages—and wouldn’t the Old Ones love that? But there was nothing I could do about that now. I needed to get Mab home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got Mab’s arm around my shoulders and helped her to her feet. She seemed a couple of inches shorter, as though she’d shrunken. She leaned heavily on my arm as we made our way out of the parking lot to Back Street. I lifted her over the body of the human who lay at the entrance. “I thought he was a vampire,” I said. If I’d realized he was human, I wouldn’t have shot him in the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other human servant—what was left of him—lay on the pavement. Myrddin’s magical attack had blasted his head from his body. Fragments of skull, teeth, and brains littered the ground and stuck to cars and trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sirens were getting closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Juliet,” I said. “Take Mab’s other arm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Queen Mab,” Juliet said. “‘Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘No strength to climb without thy help,’” Mab wheezed, taking her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now’s not the time for your Shakespeare game,” I snapped at Juliet. “We have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take me to the taxi,” Mab said. “I need to look inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sirens sounded like they were a block away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mab, there’s no time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t argue with me, child. Do as I say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliet and I carried her to the taxi between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab pulled open the driver’s side door. A body spilled out sideways and lay half in the cab and half on the ground. I stared into the blank eyes of Mack, the taxi driver who’d wanted to bomb Deadtown out of existence. His favorite talkshow ranter shouted from the radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recalled a man hailing the cab down the block from us, when I’d tried to send Mab home. Had that passenger been the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaper? When the taxi crashed, I’d assumed the driver was drunk. I was wrong. He wasn’t drunk—he was under attack. The Reaper had done his work and run off, allowing Myrddin to trap the dead man’s departing life force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered, feeling like a cold gust had blown in from the river. Juliet gasped and stepped back. The sight of human death didn’t usually bother vampires, but I could see why this one might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crescent-shaped slash grinned across Mack’s throat. Symbols had been carved into his face and hands. Blood soaked the front of his sweatshirt. Mab lifted his shirt to reveal another symbol scored deep in his chest, over his heart: the eihwaz rune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own chest burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, as though she’d seen what she’d expected, and pulled Mack’s shirt back down. She straightened—as much as she could in her aged state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took her arm and turned to ask Juliet to take the other. She wasn’t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t anywhere on Back Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliet’s gasp. That sudden cold. A chill lingered in the air, along with the stale smell of ancient grave dust. The Old Ones had snatched Juliet away, and I hadn’t even noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sirens were almost on top of us, and flashing lights splashed across the Berkeley Street intersection. I lifted Mab into my arms, ignoring the pain that gripped my wrist, and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAT THE CHECKPOINT BACK INTO DEADTOWN, THE ZOMBIE guard eyed Mab’s ID. He flicked a glance toward her face, then blinked and stared hard. He looked at the ID then back to Mab. ID, Mab. ID, Mab. He typed into his computer and squinted at the screen. He waited, tapping his fingers on his desk, until the computer beeped. He squinted at the screen again. Once more, he compared Mab’s picture with her actual face. Finally, he shrugged. “You should update your photo, ma’am.” His polite voice held a warning. “It will prevent future delays at the checkpoint.” He handed both IDs back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe photo on the card in my hand, taken yesterday, showed someone who could be the daughter of the woman at my side. With each minute that passed, Mab was aging almost visibly. A dowager’s hump had sprouted between her shoulders, and her spine curved like a shepherd’s crook. She clutched my arm with ropy, liver-spotted hands. She could barely walk; I picked her up again so I could carry her through the streets of Deadtown. She turned her face to my shoulder and let me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the door to my building, though, she insisted I put her down. “I’ll walk across the lobby myself,” she insisted. Even her voice had aged, to a thin, tremulous, almost-whine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde came over to assist us. “Another relative, Ms. Vaughn?” he asked, offering Mab his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” said Mab, all dignity. “We met yesterday. I’m Vicky’s aunt, Mab.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Clyde nearly choked on his mortification. “I . . .” He coughed, swallowed, opened his mouth, closed it, then coughed again. “I do apologize.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab harrumphed and accepted his proffered arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s had a rough night,” I said. “She’ll be better tomorrow.” I sent up a silent prayer to whatever gods might be listening that it would be so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab harrumphed again. She shuffled across the lobby, leaning her whole weight on Clyde and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like me to accompany you upstairs?” he asked, pressing the elevator button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, thank you, Clyde. We’ll be fine,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very good.” When the elevator door opened, he helped Mab inside, then stepped back out into the lobby. The doors closed on his puzzled face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Almost home.” I patted Mab’s arm, hoping the gesture gave more assurance than I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab sighed. The sound seemed to hold all the weariness of the ages. “This place, child, is very, very far from home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN MY APARTMENT, KANE CIRCLED MAB, SNIFFING, GIVING me inquiring looks. I told him I had to get Mab to bed, and he backed off as I helped her into my bedroom. Once she was settled under the covers, Kane came in and sat on his haunches, staring at my aunt. She lay back with her eyes closed. There’s little time, she’d said. Right now, she looked like someone with no more than a few grains of sand left in her hourglass. Kane lifted his muzzle. His nostrils flared, as though he were trying to catch the scent of what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo people I cared about, both so drastically altered. Tears pressed at my eyes, and I pinched myself to make them stop. I couldn’t afford to cry. I had to figure out what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Myrddin stole Mab’s bloodstone,” I told Kane. He cocked his head, asking what exactly that meant. I wanted to know more, myself, but now wasn’t the time to exhaust Mab further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laid a gentle hand on my aunt’s arm. “Mab?” Her eyes fluttered open. They were cloudy with cataracts. “What can I do to help you? Are there herbs I can get? Roxana—the witch—should I bring her back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, child. None of that would help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you shift? Would that bring back your strength?” But even as I asked, I knew that the feeble old woman lying in my bed could never summon the energy for a shift. Mab merely shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, maybe you’ll feel better after you get some rest.” It was the lamest thing I’d ever said in my entire life, but I couldn’t admit there was nothing we could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I taught you better than that, child,” Mab’s thin voice admonished. “Wishful thinking means nothing. Unless you can retrieve the bloodstone, I’m finished. I will continue to age until my body gives out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll get it back.” But how? I didn’t know where Myrddin’s safe house was, and I didn’t know if I could face Myrddin—and his army of Old Ones, vampires, and human servants—alone. Saying I’d get the bloodstone back felt like more wishful thinking. But I needed to try to comfort Mab. “I won’t let Myrddin . . .” I couldn’t finish the sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Won’t let him what, child? Kill me? If only that were all he had in mind.” Her rheumy eyes closed, and her voice, barely audible, trembled with weariness. “Myrddin won’t kill me. He’ll bring me to the very end of life, to the point where death is the only thing still desired. And then he’ll use the bloodstone to imprison me, as I did to him fifteen hundred years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMY HEAD SPUN WITH QUESTIONS, BUT I COULDN’T TROUBLE Mab with them now. She was sleeping; a quiet snoring buzzed from my bedroom. Sitting on the living-room sofa, I listened, cherishing those snores. Each one meant another breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI checked the splint I’d put on my wrist. My kind heals quickly—the pain had already diminished—but it takes time for bones to knit back together. Keeping the wrist immobile would make sure they healed properly. Right now, though, I had more to worry about than a broken wrist. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodstone-deadtown-3/page-42.html","bookId":2611,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:26 PM"}
