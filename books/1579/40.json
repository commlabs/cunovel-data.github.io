He\u0027s in now. He\u0027s in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head in denial. “You should go. It\u0027s just me they know about. You can\u0027t be found with me. That would implicate you, you\u0027d be guilty by association.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m staying with you, Gene.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I\u0027l make a break for the outside. I can make it if I\u0027m quick enough. You come out when you can, if not today, then tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027l meet up at the Dome. As long as they don\u0027t suspect you, you\u0027l be fi ne. It\u0027s just me they\u0027re after.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horrifi c howl rips up the hal way, a screech that rattles the building. A skittering of noises along the wal s. Distant thumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother howl, softer but with more anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly freezes up: I see a realization strike her dead cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stiffens up. With dread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley June turns away from me. When she speaks, her voice is unsteady. She can\u0027t bring herself to look at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gene,” she says, “go to the back. Take a look at the surveil ance monitors, see if you can see what\u0027s going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027l stay here,” she says. A strange pitch to her voice, an oblique light in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head back toward the monitors, curious myself to see what is happening around the Institute. At fi rst, the monitors indicate little movement. Everyone is still sleeping. It\u0027s al gray and still . But a monitor in the corner catches my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s movement. In the foyer, where Phys Ed is writhing on the fl oor, his legs pedaling air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth is stretched open, as if in a silent yawn. But I know it\u0027s not a yawn, nor is it silent. It\u0027s a spine- rattling scream. On the monitor of the banquet hal , snoozing people, still dangling off the chandelier, begin to stir. The chandelier is shaking now. On other monitors, people hanging off air ducts in the corridors are rous-ing, eyes beginning to pop open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gotta go now!” I yel to Ashley June as I spin away from the monitors, making ready to run out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she\u0027s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what to make of her sudden disappearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened to me, I think, but somehow that doesn\u0027t ring true. Something else is going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swing the door open, step away from the Control Center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridor is empty. “Ashley June!” I yel at the top of my lungs, no longer caring if others hear me. The only answer is the sound of my echo reverberating back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a second to waste. I sprint down the corridor, turn down another. After the brightness of the Control Center, the corridor is the black of midnight. If I can get to Phys Ed in the foyer before anyone else, I can take him out. Literal y and fi guratively. That would silence him and buy me time, at least until dusk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly I know that\u0027s where Ashley June is headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the foyer, to take Phys Ed out. She knows I\u0027d never have let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustration heated by a mad tenderness, I race down the second corridor, then push through an exit door leading to the stairwel .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the top, peering down the dark wel , I hear the cries and screams and shouts. The pounding of boots, the slap- dash ricochet of bare feet scrabbling along wal s and stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoors bang open and shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds fl oat up at me haphazardly, echoes bouncing up the wal s and stairs from afar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s too late now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey know. They all know now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, like a cannon shot, doors explode open a few fl ights down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManic skittering of feet on the chrome stairs, the click of long fi ngernails on the metal railings. Heading up. Toward me. A col ective hissing, like a swarm of wasps, fl ies up toward me. Then a primal squeal screeches up the wel , and just like that, they\u0027ve sniffed me out. They\u0027re coming for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn on my heels and run. Back the way I came, back toward the Control Center. They\u0027re coming in fast and furious, their screams bouncing off the wal s around. Just two corridors to run down, just two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m down the fi rst corridor and just turning the corner when I hear the doors to the stairway bang open. Faster, faster— The knob of the door to the Control Center is in my hand. I turn it. It slips in my grip, my palms and fi ngers too slick for traction. I take it in both hands and squeeze it like a vise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door swings open and I fl ing my body through the gap, kicking the door shut as I fl y through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slams shut; a second later, a gigantic boom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esledgehammers the door from the other side. It\u0027s a race to the doorknob now. I leap up, push the lock button. A second later, from the other side, the knob turns, twisting in my hand, then stops against the lock. A terrifi c howl breaks out that rattles the door. Then another boom! They\u0027re body slamming the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reel all the way to the back of the Control Center. The door isn\u0027t going to hold for much longer. Maybe a dozen blows at the most. They\u0027l burst through, a fl ood of alabaster white skin and glistening fangs and bulging eyes hot with mad desire. The sunlight won\u0027t be enough to hold them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d gladly suffer skin boils and temporary blindness for even a droplet of heper blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe video monitors at the back that only moments ago displayed little movement are now a dizzying array of motion. On every monitor, people are leaping through the hal ways in nightgowns and fl annel pajamas, eyes aglow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all know. That I am up at the Control Center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! The bang at the door is louder: more bodies, more force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNails scratch on the other side, howls and cries. And panting, the chortling of the insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab a steel- framed offi ce chair and heave it at the windows. It bounces uselessly off like a ping- pong bal . I spin around, looking for another exit. There is none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery monitor is now blurry with the energy of a col ective beast awakened. all except one: on the third row of monitors, to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething on it captures my attention, not for the action on it, but for the inaction. A solitary fi gure just standing, slightly bent over, writing something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Ashley June. Relief, and an odd sense of pride, fi l s me: she got away. Judging from the pans and pots hanging behind her, she must be in the kitchen. Then I see her suddenly lift her head as if hearing something. I hear it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bloodcurdling squeal that vibrates the very wal s of the building. Ashley June pauses, puts pen back on paper, starts writing. She suddenly stops, looks up, her mouth dropping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s realizing something. A light turning on in her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bends over the paper again, her hand a blur as she writes furiously across the page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoud screams and moans sound up and down the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stops, her face grimacing with indecision. Shaking her head, she throws the pen aside angrily and hastily folds the piece of paper. She runs to a slot in the wal , pul s it open, places the paper inside. The oven? Then she punches at a large button. A light shoots out from the button, il uminating her face. Tears are streaking down her face. Her head tilts upward and a horror crosses her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s hearing it. The howl of desire streaming upward, toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM! This bang is the loudest, denting the door. The top hinge is snapped askew like a broken bone breaking skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt won\u0027t withstand more than a few more hits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is how I will die, I decide. Facing away from the door as it explodes inward, my eyes fi xed on the image of Ashley June on the monitor. Let that be my last vision. Let my death be quick, let my last thought and vision be of Ashley June.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the monitor, she suddenly does something strange. She snatches a knife from a hanging knife rack, a long swirling blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlaces the blade in the palm of her left hand and, before I understand what she\u0027s doing, squeezes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth widens in pain, stretches into a scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I understand. And I scream: “Ashley June!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen, she drops the knife and sprints away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM! The door bends inwardly but holds. Just barely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more hit is all it will take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, suddenly, a fever- pitched wail breaks out on the other side, and I hear a scrabbling of nails on the fl oor and wal s and ceiling. Away from the door. Then silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re all gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the monitor and see Ashley June fl ying down the stairwel , her hair fl owing behind her. She\u0027s leaping from one landing to the next; barely after she\u0027s landed, she\u0027s already leaping for the next landing. She\u0027s headed down, al the way to the Introduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other monitors, I see hordes of people, in a synchronized stampede, racing down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the blood and fl esh of a female virgin heper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey move as one, wordlessly but ferociously, their blurred speed astonishing on the monitors. The pul of gravity gives them even more speed as they fl y down the stairwel .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFal ing like black rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley June races down, panic etched on her face. Each time her feet land, she grabs the rail with her left hand, pivots her body around quickly, and leaps down to the next landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black rain continues to fal , continues to close in on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches the bottom fl oor. Her face is fl ushed, sweat pouring off her and, creating a damp ring of darkness around her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrands of wet hair lie pressed against her face. Her breathing is ragged; she fl ies toward the doors leading into the Introduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey land behind her, a viscous black waterfal crashing down, spraying onto the wal s and fl oor. They go right at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezes through the tiny opening between the doors, mi-raculously opened. A half second later, a dozen of them jump that very spot. Their sheer mass jams them, prevents a single one from slipping through the doors. She has time, maybe a few more seconds of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI switch over to a different monitor. Now I see what she has planned all along. She\u0027s heading for the chamber where the old male heper lived. She sprints past one of the poles, past dark stains in the ground, and toward the manhole- shaped door of the chamber, tilted up and open. Three people— two men and a woman— have slipped through; stark naked, their clothes stripped during the chase, they\u0027re bounding right for her. Their mouths are hideously wide in a scream that, though silent to me through the monitor, must be ear- shattering for Ashley June. Yards out, Ashley June does a running slide right into opening, her arm grasping the bar as she fal s through, pul ing it down. It fal s with a thud, kicking up dust. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-40.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
