The specter chasing Jarlaxle had worked out the drow\u0027s intentions even before the clever dark elf\u0027s dastardly trick had sent the creature on its extra-planar journey. And anything the specters knew, so knew the dracolich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enemies of Hephaestus, Yharaskrik, and mostly of Crenshinibon would congregate there, in the Snowflake Mountains, where a pair of the Ghost King\u0027s specters were already causing mischief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there would be only one more, the human southerner. The Crystal Shard knew he could be found, though not as easily as Jarlaxle. After all, Crenshinibon had shared an intimate bond with the dark elf for many tendays. With Yharaskrik\u0027s psychic powers added to the shard\u0027s, locating the familiar drow had proven as simple as it was necessary. Jarlaxle had become the focus of anger that served to bring the trio of mighty beings together, united in common cause. The human, however tangential, would be revealed soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, to at least one of the three vengeful entities - the dragon - the coming catastrophe would be enjoyable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Yharaskrik, the destruction of its enemies would be practical and informative, a worthy test for the uncomfortable but likely profitable unification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Crenshinibon, which served as conduit between the wildly passionate dragon and the ultimately practical mind flayer, would share in all the sensations the destruction of Jarlaxle and the others would bring to both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Pikel!\" Hanaleisa called when she saw the green-bearded dwarf on a street in Carradoon late the next morning. He was dressed in his traveling gear, which meant that he carried a stick and had a cooking pot strapped on his head as a helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel flashed her a big smile and called into the shop behind him. As the dwarf advanced to give Hanaleisa a great hug, Hanaleisa\u0027s younger brother Rorick exited the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" she called over Pikel\u0027s shoulder as her grinning sibling approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I wanted to come along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then spent the rest of the morning arguing with wizards about the nature of the cosmos,\" Hanaleisa replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doo-dad!\" Pikel yelled, pulling back from the young woman, and when both she and Rorick looked at him curiously, he just added, \"Hee hee hee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has it all figured out,\" Rorick explained, and Hanaleisa nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And do the wizards and priests have it all figured out as well?\" Hanaleisa asked. \"Because of your insights, I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRorick looked down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They kicked you out,\" Hanaleisa reasoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because they couldn\u0027t stand to be upstaged by our little brother, no doubt!\" greeted Temberle, rounding the corner from the blacksmith he\u0027d just visited. His greatsword had taken a nasty nick the previous night when bouncing off the collarbone of the undead bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRorick brightened a bit at that, but when he looked up at his brother and sister, an expression of confusion came over him. \"What happened?\" he asked, noting that Temberle had his greatsword in hand and was examining the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You left Spirit Soaring late yesterday?\" Temberle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Midday, yes,\" Rorick answered. \"Uncle Pikel wanted to use the tree roots to move us down from the mountains, but father overruled that, fearing the unpredictability and instability of magic, even druidic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doo-dad,\" Pikel said with a giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be traveling magically either,\" said Hanaleisa. \"Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel folded his arm and stump over his chest and glared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you camped in the forest last night?\" Temberle went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRorick answered with a nod, not really understanding where his brother might be going, but Pikel apparently caught on a bit, and the dwarf issued an \"Ooooh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s something wrong in those woods,\" said Temberle. \"Yup, yup,\" Pikel agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Rorick asked, looking from one to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brr,\" Pikel said, and hugged himself tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I slept right through the night,\" said Rorick. \"But it wasn\u0027t that cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We fought a zombie,\" Hanaleisa explained. \"A zombie bear. And there was something else out there, haunting the forest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup, yup,\" Pikel agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRorick looked at the dwarf, curious. \"You didn\u0027t say anything was amiss.\" Pikel shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you felt it?\" Temberle asked. The dwarf gave another, \"Yup, yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you did battle - real battle?\" Rorick asked his siblings, his intrigue obvious. The three had grown up in the shadow of a great library, surrounded by mighty priests and veteran wizards. They had heard stories of great battles, most notably the fight their parents had waged against the dreaded chaos curse and against their own grandfather, but other than the few times when their parents had been called away for battle, or their dwarf uncles had gone to serve King Bruenor of Mithral Hall, the lives of the Bonaduce children had been soft and peaceful. They had trained vigorously in martial arts - hand-fighting and sword-fighting - and in the ways of the priest, the wizard, and the monk. With Cadderly and Danica as their parents, the three had been blessed with as comprehensive and exhaustive an education as any in Faerun could ever hope for, but in practical applications of their lessons, particularly fighting, the three were neophytes indeed, completely untested until the previous night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanaleisa and Temberle exchanged concerned looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me!\" Rorick pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was terrifying,\" his sister admitted. \"I\u0027ve never been so scared in my entire life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it was exciting,\" Temberle added. \"And as soon as the fight began, you couldn\u0027t think about being afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t think about anything,\" said Hanaleisa. \"Hee hee hee,\" Pikel agreed with a nod. \"Our training,\" said Rorick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are fortunate that our parents, and our uncles,\" said Hanaleisa, looking at the beaming Pikel, \"didn\u0027t take the peace we\u0027ve known for granted, and taught us - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To fight,\" Temberle interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to react,\" said Hanaleisa, who was always a bit more philosophical about battle and the role that martial training played in a wider world view. She was much more akin to her mother in that matter, and that was why she had foregone extensive training with the sword or the mace in favor of the more disciplined and intimate open-hand techniques employed by Danica\u0027s order. \"Even one who knew how to use a sword well would have been killed in the forest last night if his mind didn\u0027t know how to tuck away his fears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you felt the presence in the forest, too,\" Temberle said to Pikel. \"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to warn the townsfolk, and get word to Spirit Soaring,\" Hanaleisa added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup, yup.\" Pikel lifted his good arm before him and straightened his fingers, pointing forward. He began swaying that hand back and forth, as if gliding like a fish under the waters of Impresk Lake. The others understood that the dwarf was talking about his plant-walking, even before he added with a grin, \"Doo-dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot do that,\" Hanaleisa said, and Temberle, too, shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can go out tomorrow, at the break of dawn,\" he said. \"Whatever it is out there, it\u0027s closer to Carradoon than to Spirit Soaring. We can get horses to take us the first part of the way - I\u0027m certain the stable masters will accompany us along the lower trails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moving fast, we can arrive before sunset,\" Hanaleisa agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But right now, we\u0027ve got to get the town prepared for whatever might come,\" said Temberle. He looked at Hanaleisa and shrugged. \"Though we don\u0027t really know what is out there, or even if it\u0027s still there. Maybe it was just that one bear we killed, a wayward malevolent spirit, and now it\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it wasn\u0027t,\" said Rorick, and his tone made it clear that he hoped he was right. In his youthful enthusiasm, he was more than a little jealous of his siblings at that moment - a misplaced desire that would soon enough be corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably wandering around for a hundred years,\" muttered one old water-dog - a Carradoon term for the many wrinkled fishermen who lived in town. The man waved his hand as if the story was nothing to fret about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh, but the world\u0027s gone softer,\" another in the tavern lamented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, not the world,\" yet another explained. \"Just our part of it, living in the shadow of them three\u0027s parents. We\u0027ve been civilized, I\u0027m thinking!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought a cheer, half mocking, half in good will, from the many gathered patrons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rest of the world\u0027s grown tougher,\" the man continued. \"It\u0027ll get to us, and don\u0027t you doubt it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And us older folk remember the fights well,\" said the first old water-dog. \"But I\u0027m wondering if the younger ones, grown up under the time of Cadderly, will be ready for any fights that might come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His kids did well, eh?\" came the reply, and all in the tavern cheered and lifted tankards in honor of the twins, who stood at the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We survived,\" Hanaleisa said loudly, drawing the attention of all. \"But likely, some sort of evil is still out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn\u0027t foster the feeling of dread the young woman had hoped for, but elicited a rather mixed reaction of clanking mugs and even laughter. Hanaleisa looked at Temberle, and they both glanced back when Pikel bemoaned the lack of seriousness in the crowd with a profound, \"Ooooh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carradoon should post sentries at every gate, and along the walls,\" Temberle shouted. \"Start patrols through the streets, armed and with torches. Light up the town, I beg you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough his outburst attracted some attention, all eyes turned to the tavern door as it banged open. A man stumbled in, crying out, \"Attack! Attack!\" More than his shouts jarred them all, though, for filtering in behind the stranger came cries and screams, terrified and agonized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTables upended as the water-dogs leaped to their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh,\" said Pikel, and he grabbed Temberle\u0027s arm with his hand and tapped Hanaleisa with his stump before they could intervene. They had come to the tavern to warn people and to organize them, but Pikel was astute enough to realize the folly of the latter intention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemberle tried to speak anyway, but already the various crews of the many Carradden fishing boats were organizing, calling for groups to go to the docks to retrieve weapons, putting together gangs to head into the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, people ...\" Temberle tried to protest. Pikel tugged at him insistently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh!\" the dwarf cautioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The four of us, then,\" Hanaleisa agreed. \"Let\u0027s see where we can be of help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey exited alongside a score of patrons, though a few remained behind - fishing boat captains, mostly - to try to formulate some sort of strategy. With a few quick words, Pikel tucked his black oaken cudgel - his magical shillelagh - under his half-arm and waggled his fingers over one end, conjuring a bright light that transformed the weapon into a magical, fire-less torch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than two blocks from the tavern door, back toward the gateway through which they had entered Carradoon, the four learned what all the tumult was about. Rotting corpses and skeletons swarmed the streets. Human and elf, dwarf and halfling, and many animal corpses roamed freely. The dead walked - and attacked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpotting a family trying to escape along the side of the wide road, the group veered that way, but Rorick stopped short and cried out, then stumbled and pulled up his pant leg. As Pikel moved his light near, trickles of blood showed clearly, along with something small and thrashing. Rorick kicked out and the attacking creature flew to the side of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt flopped weirdly back at him, a mess of bones, skin, and feathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bird,\" Hanaleisa gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel ran over and swung the bright end of his cudgel down hard, splattering the creature onto the cobblestones. The light proved equally damaging to the undead thing, searing it and leaving it smoldering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sha-la-la!\" Pikel proudly proclaimed, lifting his club high. He turned fast, adjusting his cooking pot helmet as he did so, and launched himself into the nearest alleyway. As soon as the light of the cudgel crossed the alley\u0027s threshold, it revealed a host of skeletons swarming at the dwarf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemberle threw his arm around his brother\u0027s back and propped him up, hustling him back the way they had come, calling for the fleeing Carradden family to catch up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Pikel!\" Hanaleisa cried, running to support him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled up short as she neared the alleyway, assaulted by the sound of crunching bones and by bits of rib and skull flying by. Pikel\u0027s light danced wildly, as if a flame in a gale, for the doo-dad dwarf danced wildly, too. It was as ferocious a display as Hanaleisa had ever seen, and one she had never imagined possible from her gentle gardener uncle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe refocused her attention back down the street, to the retreating family, a couple and their trio of young children. Trusting in Pikel to battle the creatures in the alley, though he was outnumbered many times over, the woman sprinted away, crossing close behind the family. Hanaleisa threw herself at two skeletons moving in close pursuit. She hit them hard with a flat-out body block, knocking them back several steps, and she tucked and turned as she fell to land easily on her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanaleisa went up on the ball of one foot and launched into a spinning kick that drove her other foot through the ribcage of an attacker. With a spray of bone chips, she tugged her foot out, then, without bringing it down and holding perfect balance, she leaned back to re-angle her kick, and cracked the skeleton in its bony face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill balanced on one foot, Hanaleisa expertly turned and kicked again, once, twice, a third time, into the chest of the second skeleton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sprang up and sent her back foot into a high circle kick before the skeleton\u0027s face, not to hit it, but as a distraction, for when she landed firmly on both feet, she did so leaning forward, in perfect position to launch a series of devastating punches at her foe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith both skeletons quickly dispatched, Hanaleisa backed away, pursuing the family. To her relief, Pikel joined her as she passed the alleyway. Side by side, the two grinned, pivoted back, and charged into the pursuing throng of undead, feet, fists, and sha-la-la pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore citizens joined them in short order, as did Temberle, his greatsword shearing down skeletons and zombies with abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were so many!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead had risen from a cemetery that had been the final resting place for many generations of Carradden. They rose from a thick forest, too, where the cycle of life worked relentlessly to feed the hunger of such a powerful and malignant spell. Even near the shores of Impresk Lake, under the dark waters, skeletons of fish - thousands of them thrown back to the waters after being cleaned on the decks of fishing boats - sprang to unlife and knifed up hard against the undersides of dark hulls, or swam past the boats and flung themselves out of the water and onto the shore and docks, thrashing in desperation to destroy something, anything, alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd standing atop the dark waters, Fetchigrol watched. His dead eyes flared to life in reflected orange as a fire grew and consumed several houses. Those eyes flickered with inner satisfaction whenever a cry of horror rang out across the dark, besieged city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sensed a shipwreck not far away, many shipwrecks, many long-dead sailors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all right!\" Rorick insisted, trying to pull his leg away from his fretting Uncle Pikel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dwarf grabbed him hard with one hand, a grip that could hold back a lunging horse, and waggled his stumpy arm at the obstinate youngster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were back in the tavern, but nothing outside had calmed. Quite the opposite, it seemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel bit down on a piece of cloth and tore off a strip. He dipped it into his upturned cookpot-helmet, into which he\u0027d poured a bit of potent liquor mixed with some herbs he always kept handy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t stay here,\" Temberle called, coming in the door. \"They approach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel worked fast, slapping the bandage against Rorick\u0027s bloody shin, pinning one end with his half-arm and expertly working the other until he had it knotted. Then he tightened it down with his teeth on one end, his hand on the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too tight,\" Rorick complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh!\" scolded the dwarf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel grabbed his helmet and dropped it on his head, either forgetting or ignoring the contents, which splashed down over his green hair and beard. If that bothered the dwarf, he didn\u0027t show it, though he did lick at the little rivulets streaming down near his mouth. He hopped up, shillelagh tucked securely under his stump, and pulled Rorick up before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man tried to start away fast, but he nearly fell over with the first step on his torn leg. The wound was deeper than Rorick apparently believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePikel was there to support him, though, and they rushed out behind Temberle. Hanaleisa was outside waiting, shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many,\" she explained grimly. \"There\u0027s no winning ground, just retreat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the docks?\" Temberle asked, looking at the flow of townsfolk in that direction and seeming none too pleased by that prospect. \"We\u0027re to put our backs to the water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanaleisa\u0027s expression showed that she didn\u0027t like that idea any more than he, but they had no choice. They joined the fleeing townsfolk and ran on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found some organized defense forming halfway to the docks and eagerly found positions among the ranks. Pikel offered an approving nod as he continued past with Rorick, toward a cluster of large buildings overlooking the boardwalk and wharves. Built on an old fort, it was where the ship captains had decided to make their stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fight well for mother and father,\" Hanaleisa said to Temberle. \"We will not dishonor their names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemberle smiled back at her, feeling like a veteran already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey got their chance soon enough, their line rushing up the street to support the last groups of townsfolk trying hard to get ahead of the monstrous pursuit. Fearlessly, Hanaleisa and Temberle charged among the undead, smashing and slashing with abandon.Their efforts became all the more devastating when Uncle Pikel joined them, his bright cudgel destroying every monster that ventured near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite their combined power, the trio and the rest of the squad fighting beside them were pushed back, moving inexorably in retreat. For every zombie or skeleton they destroyed, it seemed there were three more to take its place. Their own line thinned whenever a man or woman was pulled down under the raking and biting throng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd those unfortunate victims soon enough stood up, fighting for the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorrified and weak with revulsion, their morale shattered as friends and family rose up in undeath to turn against them, the townsfolk gave ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found support at the cluster of buildings, where they had no choice but to stand and fight. Eventually, even that defense began to crumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanaleisa looked to her brother, desperation and sadness in her rich brown eyes. They couldn\u0027t retreat into the water, and the walls of the buildings wouldn\u0027t hold back the horde for long. She was scared, and so was he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to find Rorick,\" Temberle said to his dwarf uncle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh?\" Pikel replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t understand that the twins only wanted to make sure that the three siblings were together when they died. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ghost-king-transitions-3/page-7.html","bookId":2189,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:13 PM"}
