People in this small town knew her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo years ago, after she and Arne had become engaged, he had brought her to his parents\u0027 home on Sande. She had been to church, watched a football match, visited Arne\u0027s favorite bar, and gone shopping with Arne\u0027s mother. It broke her heart to remember that happy time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the consequence was that plenty of local people would remember the Olufsen boy\u0027s English fiancee, and there was a serious danger she would be recognized. If that happened, people would start talking, and before long the police would hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis morning she wore a hat and sunglasses, but still she felt perilously conspicuous. All the same, she had to take the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had spent the previous evening in the town center, hoping to run into Harald. Knowing how much he loved jazz, she had gone first to the Club Hot, but it was closed. She had not found him in any of the bars and cafes where young people gathered. It had been a wasted evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis morning she was going to his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had thought of telephoning, but it was hazardous. If she gave her real name she risked being overheard and betrayed. If she gave a false name, or called anonymously, she might spook Harald and cause him to flee. She had to visit in person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be even more risky. Morlunde was a town, but on the small island of Sande every resident knew all the others. She could only hope that islanders might take her for a holidaymaker, and not look too closely. She had no better option. The full moon was five days away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her way to the harbor, carrying her small suitcase, and boarded the ferry. At the top of the gangway stood a German soldier and a Danish policeman. She showed her papers in the name of Agnes Ricks. The documents had already passed three inspections, but nevertheless she suffered a shiver of fear as she offered the forgeries to the two uniformed men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe policeman studied her identity card. \"You\u0027re a long way from home, Miss Ricks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had prepared her cover story. \"I\u0027m here for the funeral of a relative.\" It was a good pretext for a long journey. She was not sure when Arne\u0027s interment was scheduled, but there was nothing suspicious about a family member arriving a day or two early, especially given the hazards of wartime travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be the Olufsen funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Hot tears came to her eyes. \"I\u0027m a second cousin, but my mother was very close to Lisbeth Olufsen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe policeman sensed her grief, despite the sunglasses, and he said gently, \"My condolences.\" He handed the papers back. \"You\u0027re in plenty of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\" That suggested it was today. \"I wasn\u0027t sure, I couldn\u0027t get through on the telephone to check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe the service is at three o\u0027clock this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermia went forward and leaned on the rail. As the ferry chugged out of the harbor, she looked across the water to the flat, featureless island and recalled her first visit. She had been shocked to see the cold, unadorned rooms where Arne had grown up, and to meet his stern parents. It was a mystery how that solemn family had produced someone as much fun as Arne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a somewhat severe person herself, or so her colleagues seemed to think. In that way she had played a role in Arne\u0027s life similar to that of his mother. She had made him punctual, and discouraged him from getting drunk, while he had taught her to relax and have fun. She had once said to him, \"There\u0027s a time and place for spontaneity,\" and he had laughed about it all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had returned to Sande once more, for the Christmas festival. It had seemed more like Lent. For the Olufsens, Christmas was a religious event, not a bacchanal. Yet she had found the holiday enjoyable in its quiet way, doing crossword puzzles with Arne, getting to know Harald, eating Mrs. Olufsen\u0027s plain food, and walking along the cold beach in a fur coat, hand in hand with her lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never imagined returning here for his funeral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe longed to go to the service, but she knew it was impossible. Too many people would see her and recognize her. There might even be a police detective present, studying the faces. After all, if Hermia could figure out that Arne\u0027s mission was being carried on by someone else, the police could make the same deduction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, she now realized, the funeral was going to delay her by some hours. She would have to wait until after the service before going to the house. Beforehand there would be neighbors in the kitchen preparing food, parishioners in the church arranging flowers, and an undertaker fussing about timings and pallbearers. It would be almost as bad as the service itself. But afterward, as soon as the mourners had had their tea and smorrebrod, they would all depart, leaving the immediate family to grieve alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt meant she would have to kill time now, but caution was everything. If she could get the film from Harald this evening she could catch the first train to Copenhagen in the morning, sail to Bornholm tomorrow night, cross to Sweden the following day, and be in London twelve hours later, with two days to go before the full moon. It was worth wasting a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe disembarked onto the quay at Sande and walked to the hotel. She could not go into the building, for fear she might encounter someone who remembered her, so she walked on to the beach. It was not really sunbathing weather - there was patchy cloud, and a cool breeze off the water - but the old-fashioned striped bathing huts had been wheeled out, and a few people were splashing in the waves or picnicking on the sand. Hermia was able to find a sheltered dip in the dunes and disappear into the holiday scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited there while the tide came in and a horse from the hotel pulled the wheeled bathing huts back up the beach. She had spent so much of the last two weeks sitting and waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had met Arne\u0027s parents a third time, on their once-a-decade trip to Copenhagen. Arne had taken them all to the Tivoli Garden and had been his most debonair, amusing self, charming waitresses, making his mother laugh, even getting his dour father to reminisce about schooldays at Jansborg. A few weeks later the Nazis had come and Hermia had left the country, ignominiously she felt, in a closed train with a crowd of diplomats from countries hostile to Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now she was back, seeking out a deadly secret, risking her life and the lives of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe left her position at half past four. The parsonage was ten miles from the hotel, a brisk walk of two and a half hours, so she would arrive at seven. She felt sure all the guests would have left by then, and she would find Harald and his parents sitting quietly in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beach was not deserted. Several times on her long walk she encountered people. She gave them a wide berth, letting them assume she was an unfriendly holidaymaker, and no one recognized her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last she saw the outlines of the low church and the parsonage. The thought that this had been Arne\u0027s home struck her with sadness. There was no one in sight. As she came nearer, she saw the fresh grave in the little cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a full heart, she crossed the churchyard and stood by the grave of her fiance. She took off her sunglasses. There were lots of flowers, she observed: people were always touched by the death of a young man. Grief took hold of her, and she began to shake with sobs. Tears streamed down her face. She fell to her knees and took a handful of the piled-up earth, thinking of his body lying below. I doubted you, she said in her mind, but you were the bravest of us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last the storm abated and she was able to stand up. She wiped her face dry with her sleeve. She had work to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she turned away, she saw the tall figure and domed head of Arne\u0027s father, standing a few yards off, watching her. He must have approached silently, and waited for her to rise. \"Well, Hermia,\" he said. \"God bless you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Pastor.\" She wanted to hug him, but he was not a hugging man, so she shook his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You arrived too late for the funeral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was intentional. I can\u0027t afford to be seen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better come into the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermia followed him across the rough grass. Mrs. Olufsen was in the kitchen, but for once she was not at the sink. Hermia guessed that neighbors had cleared up after the wake and washed the dishes. Mrs. Olufsen was sitting at the kitchen table in a black dress and hat. When she saw Hermia she burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermia hugged her, but her compassion was distracted. The person she wanted was not in the room. As soon as she decently could, she said, \"I was hoping to see Harald.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not here,\" said Mrs. Olufsen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermia had a dreadful feeling that this long and dangerous journey would turn out to have been for nothing. \"Didn\u0027t he come to the funeral?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head tearfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurbing her exasperation as best she could, Hermia said, \"So where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pastor said, \"You\u0027d better sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced herself to be patient. The pastor was used to being obeyed. She would not get anywhere by defying his will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Olufsen said, \"Will you have a cup of tea? It\u0027s not the real thing, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a sandwich? There\u0027s such a lot left over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you.\" Hermia had had nothing all day, but she was too tense to eat. \"Where is Harald?\" she said impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know,\" said the pastor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pastor looked ashamed, a rare expression on his face. \"Harald and I had harsh words. I was as stubborn as he. Since then, the Lord has reminded me how precious is the time a man spends with his sons.\" A tear rolled down his lined face. \"Harald left in anger, refusing to say where he was going. Five days later he returned, just for a few hours, and there was something of a reconciliation. On that occasion, he told his mother he was going to stay at the home of a schoolmate, but when we telephoned, they said he was not there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think he is still angry with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said the pastor. \"Well, perhaps he is, but that\u0027s not why he has disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My neighbor, Axel Flemming, has a son in the Copenhagen police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember,\" Hermia said. \"Peter Flemming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Olufsen put in, \"He had the nerve to come to the funeral.\" Her tone was uncharacteristically bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pastor went on, \"Peter claims that Arne was a spy for the British, and Harald is continuing his work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t lie to you,\" Hermia said. \"Peter is right. I asked Arne to take photographs of the military base here on the island. Harald has the film.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Olufsen cried, \"How could you? Arne is dead because of that! We lost our son and you lost your fiance! How could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Hermia whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pastor said, \"There\u0027s a war, Lisbeth. Many young men have died fighting the Nazis. It\u0027s not Hermia\u0027s fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to get the film from Harald,\" Hermia said. \"I have to find him. Won\u0027t you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Olufsen said, \"I don\u0027t want to lose my other son! I couldn\u0027t bear it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pastor took her hand. \"Arne was working against the Nazis. If Hermia and Harald can finish the job he started, his death will have some meaning. We have to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Olufsen nodded. \"I know,\" she said. \"I know. I\u0027m just so scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermia said, \"Where did Harald say he was going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Olufsen answered. \"Kirstenslot. It\u0027s a castle outside Copenhagen, the home of the Duchwitz family. The son, Josef, is at school with Harald.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they say he\u0027s not there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"But he\u0027s not far away. I spoke to Josef\u0027s twin sister, Karen. She\u0027s in love with Harald.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pastor said incredulously, \"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the sound of her voice when she spoke about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t mention it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would have said I couldn\u0027t possibly tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pastor smiled ruefully. \"Yes, I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermia said, \"So you think Harald is in the vicinity of Kirstenslot, and Karen knows where he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll have to go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pastor took a watch out of his waistcoat pocket. \"You\u0027ve missed the last train. You\u0027d better stay the night. I\u0027ll take you to the ferry first thing in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermia\u0027s voice dropped to a whisper. \"How can you be so kind? Arne died because of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lord giveth, and the Lord taken away,\" said the pastor. \"Blessed be the name of the Lord.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hornet-flight/page-27.html","bookId":2680,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:28 AM"}
