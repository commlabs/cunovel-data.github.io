She was on the front page of every one of them. There were four dozen beautiful red roses in a vase. Jennifer smiled. Adam had found time to send her flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the card. It read: Congratulations. Michael Moretti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intercom buzzed and Cynthia said, \"Mr. Adams is on the line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer grabbed the telephone. She tried to keep her voice calm. \"Hello, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve done it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your client got lucky. Lucky to have you as an attorney. You must be feeling wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinning cases made her feel good. Being with Adam made her feel wonderful. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something important to tell you,\" Adam said. \"Can you meet me for a drink this afternoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s heart sank. There was only one thing Adam could have to tell her: He was never going to see her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes, of course...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mario\u0027s? Six o\u0027clock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave the roses to Cynthia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was waiting in the restaurant, seated at a back table. So he won\u0027t be embarrassed if I get hysterical, Jennifer thought. Well, she was determined not to cry. Not in front of Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell from his gaunt, haggard face what he had been going through, and she intended to make this as easy as possible for him. Jennifer sat down and Adam took her hand in his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary Beth is giving me a divorce,\" Adam said, and Jennifer stared at him, speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Mary Beth who had begun the conversation. They had returned from a fund-raising dinner where Adam had been the main speaker. The evening had been an enormous success. Mary Beth had been quiet during the ride home, a curious tension about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam said, \"I thought the evening went well, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Adam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing more was said until they reached the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like a nightcap?\" Adam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you. I think we should have a talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him and said, \"About you and Jennifer Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a physical blow. Adam hesitated for a moment, wondering whether to deny it or -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve known it for some time. I haven\u0027t said anything because I wanted to make up my mind about what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary Beth, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please let me finish. I know that our relationship hasn\u0027t been - well - all we hoped it would be. In some ways, perhaps I haven\u0027t been as good a wife as I should have been.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing that\u0027s happened is your fault. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Adam. This is very difficult for me. I\u0027ve made a decision. I\u0027m not going to stand in your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her unbelievingly. \"I don\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you too much to hurt you. You have a brilliant political future ahead of you. I don\u0027t want anything to spoil that. Obviously, I\u0027m not making you completely happy. If Jennifer Parker can make you happy, I want you to have her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a feeling of unreality, as though the whole conversation were taking place underwater. \"What will happen to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Beth smiled. \"I\u0027ll be fine, Adam. Don\u0027t worry about me. I have my own plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no need to say anything. I\u0027ve said it all for both of us. If I held on to you and made you miserable, it wouldn\u0027t do either of us any good, would it? I\u0027m sure Jennifer\u0027s lovely or you wouldn\u0027t feel about her the way you do.\" Mary Beth walked over to him and took him in her arms. \"Don\u0027t look so stricken, Adam. What I\u0027m doing is the best thing for everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re remarkable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" She gently traced his face with her fingertips and smiled. \"My dearest Adam. I\u0027ll always be your best friend. Always.\" Then she came closer and put her head on his shoulder. He could hardly hear her soft voice. \"It\u0027s been such a long time since you held me in your arms, Adam. You wouldn\u0027t have to tell me you love me, but would you - would you like to - hold me in your arms once more and make love to me? Our last time together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was thinking of this now as he said to Jennifer, \"The divorce was Mary Beth\u0027s idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam went on talking, but Jennifer was no longer listening to the words; she was only hearing the music. She felt as though she were floating, soaring. She had steeled herself for Adam to tell her he could never see her again - and now this! It was too much to absorb. She knew how painful the scene with Mary Beth must have been for Adam, and Jennifer had never loved Adam more than she did at this moment. She felt as though a crushing load had been lifted from her chest, as though she could breathe again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was saying, \"Mary Beth was wonderful about it. She\u0027s an incredible woman. She\u0027s genuinely happy for both of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s hard to believe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand. For some time now we\u0027ve lived more like...brother and sister. I\u0027ve never discussed it with you, but - \" he hesitated and said carefully, \"Mary Beth doesn\u0027t have strong...drives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027d like to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of it disturbed Jennifer. \"I don\u0027t think I could, Adam. I\u0027d feel - uncomfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If - if you want me to, Adam, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, darling. We\u0027ll go for tea. I\u0027ll drive you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer thought for a moment. \"Wouldn\u0027t it be better if I went alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, Jennifer drove out the Saw Mill River Parkway, headed upstate. It was a crisp, clear morning, a lovely day for a drive. Jennifer turned on the car radio and tried to forget her nervousness about the meeting facing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Warner house was a magnificently preserved house of Dutch origin, overlooking the river at Croton-on-Hudson, set on a large estate of rolling green acres. Jennifer drove up the driveway to the imposing front entrance. She rang the bell and a moment later the door was opened by an attractive woman in her middle thirties. The last thing Jennifer had expected was this shy southern woman who took her hand, gave her a warm smile and said, \"I\u0027m Mary Beth. Adam didn\u0027t do you justice. Please come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam\u0027s wife was wearing a beige wool skirt that was softly full, and a silk blouse opened just enough to reveal a mature but still lovely breast. Her beige-blond hair was worn long and slightly curling about her face, and was flattering to her blue eyes. The pearls around her neck could never be mistaken as cultured. There was an air of old-world dignity about Mary Beth Warner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior of the house was lovely, with wide, spacious rooms filled with antiques and beautiful paintings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA butler served tea in the drawing room from a Georgian silver tea service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had left the room, Mary Beth said, \"I\u0027m sure you must love Adam very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer said awkwardly, \"I want you to know, Mrs. Warner, that neither of us planned - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Beth Warner put a hand on Jennifer\u0027s arm. \"You don\u0027t have to tell me that. I don\u0027t know whether Adam told you, but our marriage has turned into a marriage of politeness. Adam and I have known each other since we were children. I think I fell in love with Adam the first time I saw him. We went to the same parties and had the same friends, and I suppose it was inevitable that one day we would get married. Don\u0027t misunderstand. I still adore Adam and I\u0027m sure he adores me. But people do change, don\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked at Mary Beth and she was filled with a deep feeling of gratitude. What could have been an ugly and sordid scene had turned into something friendly and wonderful. Adam had been right. Mary Beth was a lovely lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very grateful to you,\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m grateful to you,\" Mary Beth confided. She smiled shyly and said, \"You see, I\u0027m very much in love, too. I was going to get the divorce immediately but I thought, for Adam\u0027s sake, we\u0027d best wait until after the election.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had been so busy with her own emotions that she had forgotten about the election.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Beth went on: \"Everyone seems sure that Adam is going to be our next senator, and a divorce now would gravely hurt his chances. It\u0027s only six months away, so I decided it would be better for him if I delayed it.\" She looked at Jennifer. \"But forgive me - is that agreeable with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it is,\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would have to completely readjust her thinking. Her future would now be tied to Adam. If he became senator, she would live with him in Washington, D.C. It would mean giving up her law practice here, but that did not matter. Nothing mattered except that they could be together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer said, \"Adam will make a wonderful senator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Beth raised her head and smiled. \"My dear, one day Adam Warner is going to make a wonderful President.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone was ringing when Jennifer arrived back at the apartment. It was Adam. \"How did you get along with Mary Beth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam, she was wonderful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said the same thing about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You read about old southern charm, but you don\u0027t come across it very often. Mary Beth has it. She\u0027s quite a lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you, darling. Where would you like to be married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer said, \"Times Square, for all I care. But I think we should wait, Adam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until after the election. Your career is important. A divorce could hurt you right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My private life is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - going to become your public life. We mustn\u0027t do anything that might spoil your chances. We can wait six months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t either, darling.\" Jennifer smiled. \"We won\u0027t really be waiting, will we?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-20.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM"}
