My head\u0027s hanging over the edge of the lifeboat, bits of my last meal bobbing up and down in the water beneath me. I know from the memories flooding into me that Dervish is doing the squeezing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s OK,\" I groan as he tenses his arms to try again. \"I\u0027m alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish gently tugs me back over the side. There\u0027s water in the bottom. Kirilli is bailing it out with his hands. But we\u0027re afloat and the lifeboat doesn\u0027t look like it sustained any major damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We thought we\u0027d lost you,\" Dervish says, smiling with relief. \"Kirilli fished you out, but you were motionless...\" He clears his throat and brushes wet hair back from my eyes. The tenderness in his expression warms me more than the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I been unconscious long?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ship...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish helps me sit up and we gaze at the sinking vessel. It\u0027s listing sharply. It can\u0027t last much longer. We\u0027re quite far away from it, but if I squint I can make out the shapes of zombies throwing themselves through the hole in pursuit of us. They don\u0027t last long once they hit the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirilli stops bailing and studies the ship with us. We don\u0027t say a word. It\u0027s a weird sensation, watching something so huge and majestic sink out of sight. It\u0027s as if the ship is a living creature that\u0027s dying. I feel strangely sad for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All those people,\" Dervish sighs as the last section slips beneath the waves in a froth of angry bubbles. \"I wish we could have saved them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beranabus,\" I whisper, fresh tears welling in my eyes. \"Sharmila. Kernel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A costly day\u0027s work,\" Dervish says bitterly. \"And we didn\u0027t even destroy the Shadow. It\u0027ll come after us again. We\u0027ve lost our leader and two of the strongest Disciples. If Lord Loss was telling the truth, Grubbs is probably dead too. Hardly counts as a victory, does it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t know how true that is. I start to tell him what I learnt about the Shadow, but Kirilli interrupts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I left you in the hold,\" he says shiftily, \"I hope you didn\u0027t think I was running off. I just wanted to make sure the stairs and corridors were clear, so we could make a quick getaway together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Dervish murmurs. \"It never crossed our thoughts that you might have lost your nerve and fled like a cowardly rat, leaving the rest of us in the lurch. You\u0027re a hero, Kirilli.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish claps sarcastically and Kirilli looks aside miserably. I put my hands over Dervish\u0027s and stop him. \"Don\u0027t,\" I croak. \"He helped us in the end. We couldn\u0027t have escaped without him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose,\" Dervish mutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirilli looks up hopefully. \"You mean that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d never have shifted this boat ourselves,\" I assure him. \"We needed your magic. If you\u0027d fought in the hold and used up your power, we\u0027d have all died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it worked out for the best,\" Kirilli beams. \"I did the right thing running. I thought so. When I was down there, sizing up the situation, I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t push your luck,\" Dervish growls. Then he narrows his eyes and studies Kirilli closely. \"Are those bite marks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Kirilli says pitifully. He stares at the stumps where his fingers were bitten off. He must have unwittingly used magic to stop the bleeding, scab over the flesh and numb the pain. He\u0027ll be screeching like a banshee once the spell fades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those beasts bit and clawed me all over,\" Kirilli says sulkily, ripping a strip off a sleeve to wrap around the stumps. \"I\u0027m lucky they didn\u0027t puncture any vital veins or arteries. If I hadn\u0027t fought so valiantly, they\u0027d have eaten me alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such a shame,\" Dervish purrs, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Kirilli frowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve seen a few zombie films in your time, haven\u0027t you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One or two,\" Kirilli sniffs. \"I don\u0027t like horror films. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must know, then, that their saliva is infectious. When a zombie bites one of the living, that person succumbs to the disease and turns-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Kirilli cries, dropping the strip of shirt and lurching to his feet. \"You\u0027re joking! You must be!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish shrugs. \"I\u0027m only telling you what I\u0027ve seen in the movies. It might all be nonsense, but when you think about it logically...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Kirilli\u0027s face crumples, Dervish winks at me. I stifle a smile. This isn\u0027t nice, but Kirilli deserves it. Not for being a coward, but for trying to lie. A good scare will do him no harm at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drift for hours. The sun descends. Night claims the sky. After letting Kirilli fret for an hour, Dervish finally told him it was a wind-up. Kirilli cursed us foully and imaginatively. But he calmed down after a while and we\u0027ve been silent since, bobbing about, absorbing the refreshing rays of the sun, thinking about the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all seems hopeless without Beranabus, especially knowing what I do about the Shadow. Mankind has reached breaking point and I can\u0027t see any way forward. I doubt if even Beranabus could have made a difference. There are some things you can\u0027t fight. Certain outcomes are inevitable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirilli has spent the last few minutes examining the lifeboat, scouring it from bow to stern. He returns to his seat with a bottle of water and a small medical box. \"Good news and bad,\" he says, opening the box and looking for ointment to use on his wounds. The healing spell must have passed because he\u0027s grimacing. \"The good news-both oars are on board, there are six bottles of water and this medical box. The bad news-there\u0027s no radio equipment or food, and once we drink the water we can\u0027t replace it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know if the crew of the ship sent a distress signal?\" Dervish asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No idea. Even if they did, would it have penetrated the magical barrier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not,\" Dervish sighs. \"Can I have some water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirilli takes a swig, then passes it across. \"Not too much,\" he warns. \"That has to last.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish chuckles drily. \"It\u0027ll probably last longer than me. My heart could pop any minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me check.\" I place my hand on his chest and concentrate. I can sense the erratic beat of his heart. He\u0027s in very poor condition. He needs hospitalisation or magic. If we could cross to the universe of the Demonata, we\u0027d be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try absorbing power from the air, to open a window, but there\u0027s virtually nothing to tap into and I\u0027m in a sorry state. The moon will lend me strength when it rises, but it won\u0027t be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you trying to open a window?\" Dervish asks softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No joy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be able to later, when I\u0027m stronger,\" I lie. But Dervish sees through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No tears,\" he croaks as I start to cry. \"Don\u0027t waste the moisture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s OK,\" Kirilli says, trying to cheer me up. \"Even if there was no distress signal, the ship\u0027s absence will be noted. The seas are monitored by computers and satellites. Most passengers had mobile phones and were in regular contact with family and work colleagues. They\u0027ll be missed. I bet there\u0027ll be an army of planes, helicopters and ships out here by dawn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if we\u0027ve drifted so far they can\u0027t find us?\" Dervish asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can do without the pessimism, thank you,\" Kirilli protests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish laughs, then his expression mellows. \"Listen,\" he says earnestly, \"if I do croak and help doesn\u0027t come, I want you to use my remains. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I do,\" I frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not much meat on these bones, but it\u0027ll keep you going for-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I shout. \"Don\u0027t be obscene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m being practical,\" he says. \"I\u0027m letting you know I won\u0027t object if-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ll be no cannibalism on this boat,\" I growl. \"Right, Kirilli?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a point,\" Kirilli mutters. \"He wouldn\u0027t just be a food source-humans are seventy per cent water. And we could use his skin for shelter. His bones might come in handy too, if we have to fight off sharks or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s eating anybody!\" I yell, then burst into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Dervish soothes me. \"I was only trying to help. Don\u0027t worry. If you don\u0027t want to eat me, I won\u0027t force you.\" He pulls a crooked expression. \"Does that sound as crazy as I think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh through my tears. \"You idiot! Besides,\" I add, wiping my cheeks clean, \"it doesn\u0027t matter whether we live or die. It might even be better if we perish on this boat. I\u0027m not sure I want to go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Dervish frowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and finally reveal what I learned on the ship. \"I touched the Shadow and absorbed some of its memories. I told Beranabus. That\u0027s why he gambled so recklessly and sacrificed himself. He knew the Shadow couldn\u0027t be defeated, that we couldn\u0027t kill it. Sending it back to the Demonata universe for a while was the best we could hope for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe that,\" Dervish snorts. \"I don\u0027t care how powerful it is. Everything can be killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the Shadow,\" I disagree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie back in the boat and stare at the darkening sky, listening to the waves lap against the sides of the boat. It\u0027s peaceful. I wouldn\u0027t mind if I fell asleep now and never awoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Shadow\u0027s not a demon,\" I explain quietly, and Dervish and Kirilli have to lean in close to hear. \"It\u0027s a force that somehow acquired consciousness. I don\u0027t know how, but it has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A force?\" Dervish scowls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like gravity,\" I explain. \"Imagine if gravity developed a mind, created a body and became an actual entity-Gravity with a capital G, intelligent like us, able to think and plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible,\" Dervish says. \"Gravity\u0027s like the wind or sunlight. It can\u0027t develop consciousness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But imagine it could,\" I push. \"You\u0027ve seen the true nature of the universes. You know magic exists, that just about anything is possible. Imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish takes a moment to adjust his thinking. \"OK,\" he says heavily. \"It\u0027s a struggle, but I\u0027m running with it. Gravity has a mind. It\u0027s given itself a body. And it\u0027s coming after humanity. Is that what you\u0027re telling me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost,\" I smile weakly. \"But it\u0027s not gravity. It\u0027s an altogether different force. More sinister. Inescapable. Every living being\u0027s final companion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tease us with riddles,\" Dervish snaps. \"Just spit it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I already know,\" Kirilli says softly. \"The greatest stage magician ever was Harry Houdini. He was a master escapologist. He could cheat any trap known to man. But there was one thing he couldn\u0027t escape, no matter how hard he tried, and it caught him eventually-the Grim Reaper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh as Dervish stares at me with growing understanding and horror, then close my eyes and cross my hands over my chest. I think about Beranabus, Sharmila, Kernel. Dervish\u0027s weak heart. The trap Lord Loss set for Grubbs. What will happen to Kirilli and me if help doesn\u0027t arrive in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead ends everywhere. The dead coming back to life on the ship. Juni and me returning to life from beyond the grave. The Shadow\u0027s promise to the Demonata, that they\u0027ll live forever once the war with humanity is over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Shadow is ancient beyond understanding,\" I whisper. \"It\u0027s as old as life. It doesn\u0027t have an actual name. It never needed one. But we\u0027ve given it a title. The demons have too. It\u0027s the darkness when a light is quenched, the silence when a sound fades. It takes the final breath from the smallest insect and the mightiest king. It knows us all, stalks us all, and in the end claims us all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-s-shadow-the-demonata-7/page-23.html","bookId":2181,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:53 PM"}
