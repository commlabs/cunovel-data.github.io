He flourished his spear, and countless tiles of white marble rolled up like a mat, with countless stones and rocks being sent swirling in a high speed vortex.

He roared out and then punched himself in the chest. The power of the seventh layer of the ‘Divine Acacia Power’ manically erupted, and finally forced that small bright light out of his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiu!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat flash of light became a three inch long steel needle.

Although Ouyang Shenxiu had no plans of trying to reach the Revolving Core stage, he still treasure his own life beyond all else. Blood essence was immediately able to influence one’s lifespan. Now that he had lost his blood essence, that also meant that he had lost additional years of life!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ouyang Shenxiu is injured.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“And heavily so!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I can’t believe that an extreme Xiantian master was actually injured to this extent by a junior, and even had a portion of his blood essence taken away.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe disciples from the distant small islands were spectating this battle with looks of fear and suspicion on their side. To martial artists from a second-grade sect, Ouyang Shenxiu was one of the top controlling characters of the Seven Profound territory.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough the Seven Profound territory had a single Revolving Core old master, it was said that that old monster was nearing the end of his life. There were even some rumors that he had gone into closed door seclusion to extend his life. With that Revolving Core master unable to attend to any matters anymore, in the minds of many martial artists, Ouyang Shenxiu and those like him represented the top figures of the Seven Profound territory.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut now, Ouyang Shenxiu was actually wounded by a junior!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf he was so fierce at the late Houtian realm, what would happen once he stepped into the Xiantian realm?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe present Acacia Faction martial artists had long turned silent. They looked onstage towards the bleeding Lin Ming who was soaked in blood, and were able to feel a deep fear coming from their hearts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was just too horrifyingly fierce. Just what was that steel needle? Before, everyone had seen a small flash of light attack Ouyang Boyan. But there were also those who didn’t catch it in time. These people only assumed that it was a concealed needle weapon or even a hidden weapon. There were some martial artists that excelled at hidden weapons or even hidden weapons like needles. There were even some martial artists that used hidden weapons and would engage in sneak attacks. But, these sneak attacks weren’t some glorious or correct method, and many martial artists despised those who relied on them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow it seemed as if their guesses were completely different. If this weapon could submerge into a martial artist’s body or even fuse together with the martial artist, then there was only one possibility, and that was that this needle was a manifestation of pure energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What is going on?

They had never seen a Thunder Soul, and they also didn’t know what this Divine Demon Steel Needle was.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming gently stroked the Divine Demon Steel Needle. Because it had just absorbed Ouyang Shenxiu’s blood essence, the crimson snakes of lightning became bright and more vibrant. This was the terror behind the Blood Extinguishing Demon Thunder. Once \u0026nbsp;it drilled into one’s body, no matter what effort was made, it would still equally attract their blood essence. Unless one was able to immediately shake it off, they would permanently lose blood essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUnfortunately, Ouyang Shenxiu had a very deep cultivation, and it took him an instant to stop the Divine Demon Steel Needle. Otherwise, the longer it took, the greater Ouyang Shenxiu’s loss would have been.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDistantly, Ouyang Shenxiu was glaring at Lin Ming, his eyes thickening with a dreadful killing intent!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming!

You have?” Lin Ming sarcastically asked. Ouyang Shenxiu had continuously used the seventh layer of the ‘Divine Acacia Power’. If he hadn’t opened the Heretical God Force, \u0026nbsp;there was no way he would have been able to defend against it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven so, Lin Ming had relied upon the formidable defensive and recovery power of Tempering Marrow in order to exchange damage. He calculated that as long as Ouyang Shenxiu still hadn’t recovered his strength, he wouldn’t be able to make some sort of sneak attack. Otherwise, there was no way that Lin Ming would have managed to emerge with an advantage from the exchange a moment ago.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This Lin Ming is far too arrogant!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAround the square, the Acacia Faction disciples were all clenching their fists.

The Purple Comet Spear in his hands was like a whip as it fiercely slashed out. Because of its extreme speed, even the spear shaft bent. The spearpoint cut through the air, causing a sharp howl that pierced the ears.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSpear and sword collided.

Spear light and sword energy haphazardly intertwined together. Lin Ming’s spear had the Concept of Wind fused into it, and his spear shadow melted into the wind.

Within the lake waters around the main island, the strong gales and intense true essence caused massive columns of water to rise into the air.

Lin Ming had used his own body to forcefully withstand Ouyang Shenxiu’s sword energy? And then he had made a counterattack?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA single spear had sent Ouyang Shenxiu cratering into the ground. What kind of character was Ouyang Shenxiu? But he had actually been struck by a junior and sent slamming into the ground. A fight of this level was too terrifying!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s own situation wasn’t too good. He had relied on the powerful defensive capabilities of his 65% completed Tempering Marrow and withstood Ouyang Shenxiu’s sword energy. But, his meridians had been damaged in many sections and his chest was already stained red with blood. The Heretical God Force could only last for about 10 more breaths of time!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeeing Ouyang Shenxiu stand up, Lin Ming fiercely grit his teeth. He shot forwards, and the Thunder Soul and Flame Essence on his spear connected.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThunderfire Annihilation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang Shenxiu’s two eyes were bloodshot. He grabbed his sword with both hands, and all of that amethyst crystal completely manifested onto the blade of the sword. The absolute limit of the ‘Divine Acacia Power’s’ seventh layer of strength transferred to the sword, slashing down at Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn that moment, it was like a bloody sun rose within the center of the square.
