He thought about the spearmen who always stood at the door to the emperor’s council chamber. He thought about Anako’s maimed porter. Three months passed. So long as he kept silent, Telemakos was safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother came to interrupt him in the middle of his Greek reading, a lesson that he turned up for sporadically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a visitor,” Turunesh said. “Come and attend at once.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is it? What do you mean?” Telemakos dropped his reading on the floor as he jumped to his feet. He hurried to take his mother’s outstretched hand, leaving his long-suffering tutor sighing elaborately as he picked up the discarded scrolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The emperor invites you to a game of santaraj.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelemakos laughed. “Who is it really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The emperor wants to play chess with you,” his mother repeated. “He is waiting for you in your grandfather’s study.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was serious. Telemakos felt panic rising in his throat and swallowed it, holding tightly to his mother’s hand as she led him through the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really play santaraj?” he asked desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is what he said,” Turunesh answered. “So we have laid out Grandfather’s best board and the ivory men from Cathay, and I shall come and serve him coffee when you have finished. Ferem will wait on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was beyond protesting. Telemakos could think of no argument. He felt as though he were being led to execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Ferem waited outside Kidane’s private office. He nodded to Telemakos and held open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelemakos stepped into the room and then lay flat on the floor, his face in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lij Telemakos,” Gebre Meskal said, acknowledging him, “Please get up. Sit with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelemakos obeyed silently. He had no idea what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have not seen you in my court of late,” said Gebre Meskal lightly, “or in my council.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emperor was even younger than Goewin, barely ten years older than Telemakos. Telemakos could remember him as a beardless youth in the days before his coronation, but even then Gebre Meskal had seemed grave and ancient, his ways mysterious, his thoughts unguessable. His clothes were simple, a white kilt and shamma as plain as those Telemakos wore himself; except the emperor’s shamma was clasped with a great cross embedded with emerald, and his head cloth was woven of gold-shot linen and bound with ribbons of gold mesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother has kept me hard at work of late,” Telemakos said; then he felt ashamed not to take responsibility for his own inaction. He added falteringly, “I’ve been neglecting my lessons. I don’t excel at anything; my father deplores my shooting, my mother deplores my Greek.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not demean yourself. Your aunt and my cartographer both speak highly of your skill with maps. Perhaps you will make a ship’s pilot, or a navigator. Has your father taught you to reckon a path by starlight, when you hunt together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Your Majesty,” Telemakos stammered, stunned to receive such a compliment from the emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A good tracker reads the sky as well as the land, and understands the cries of many separate creatures,” Gebre Meskal continued, looking at Telemakos thoughtfully. “You must begin to learn our several tongues. Noba is an excellent language. It comes more easily than Greek to anyone who already has Ethiopic, and the Noba chants are most musical. I shall find you a Noba tutor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. All right,” said Telemakos in surprise. “Thank you, Your Majesty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come, share a game with me,” said the emperor. “Your grandfather tells me you are a fair player.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not believe I am doing this, Telemakos thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rapidly lost half a dozen contests. He did not expect to win, of course, and would not have known what to do with himself if he had won: what are you supposed to do when the emperor invites you to play a game with him, anyway? Pretend you are an idiot, or do your best to show off your intelligence? Telemakos was a mediocre player at best, he knew. He could trounce his father, but that was because Medraut had never mastered the Aksumite opening, when you and your opponent both moved your men at the same time until a piece was taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelemakos was fast, fast; his strategy was to rush everybody to the front, to push as many players as possible across the board as quickly as possible. Gebre Meskal was slow, slow. He waited, waited, waited while his young opponent created elaborately complex scenarios, then brought Telemakos’s intrigues crashing down with one or two patient moves. Oh, why am I doing this, Telemakos wondered, watching the emperor solemnly set the pieces up again. Gebre Meskal’s narrow face was impassive; he showed no sign of either disapproval or triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lij Telemakos,” he said this time, before they began yet another ridiculous trial, “are you able to play the exact game you played last time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you mean, repeat myself? Move the pieces in the same way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelemakos hesitated. “I think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he did, more slowly this time because he knew it was a lost cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Attend,” said Gebre Meskal, and wove one ivory pawn across the board among Telemakos’s men, and took his sovereign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both sat silent, bent over the board. Again Telemakos found himself unable to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you see?” the emperor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot What did you learn, but What did you see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I left my king unguarded.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s so. But that is not what I want you to see. Let’s play this game again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This one game?” It was torment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they did, again. And again Gebre Meskal asked Telemakos, when it was swiftly ended, “What did you see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your pawn,” Telemakos said slowly. “Your only pawn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Many would say he is the lowliest player on the board,” said Gebre Meskal. “Smaller than any other. Yet he has brought down an army.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alone,” said Telemakos. Gebre Meskal handed him back his king. Telemakos turned the piece over, then sat on his hands to keep them from trembling. “It’s just a game,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It can be done,” the emperor said mildly. “Tell your servant I am ready for my coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFerem went for Turunesh, and they returned together with all the equipment for a coffee ceremony. Turunesh would not let Telemakos have any, as usual, so he had to remain sitting on his hands, looking at the floor, while the emperor spoke to his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How have you found the quarantine, Woyzaro Turunesh? Does it affect the noblewomen in the heart of the capital?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not especially,” Turunesh answered. Telemakos noticed that her mild, unhurried manner was similar to Gebre Meskal’s; why then should it be so easy to talk to her, and so impossible to talk to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My father thought to sell his ships, since they may no longer trade on the Red Sea,” Turunesh said. “But we should not see payment until the quarantine is lifted anyway, so we are putting two of the boats in dry dock, and the rest will have to remain at the mercy of their crews. We sent out messages to them, but of course we will not hear back. Possibly our men will find harbor across the sea in Himyar, in your cousin Abreha’s kingdom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands moved automatically through the ritual of making coffee, lighting her burner, sorting the seeds for roasting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I worry for those men in my father’s employ,” Turunesh finished. “But so do I worry for us all, for Aksum. I doubt that I shall suffer any serious hardship myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad,” said Gebre Meskal. “It warms me to know my councilor Blatte Kidane and his daughter are with me. Perhaps you have already heard the news from Deire, where the ban on foreign trade has been taken lightly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeire was Aksum’s most important port after Adulis, White Deire in the far south, beyond the Salt Desert. It was the hub for Aksum’s exported salt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What news?” Turunesh asked politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Contaminated goods were allowed in, weeks ago. Pestilence has consumed Deire.” He paused. “Plague has reached Aksum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurunesh set her earthen pot to boil. Then she hid her eyes behind one hand. She said quietly, “I wish this were not true.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So do I,” said Gebre Meskal, in tones no less calm or matter-of-fact than anything else he had said. “It is an evil truth. But the quarantine holds. Let me tell you of the ruin of Deire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servant began to tiptoe out, Gebre Meskal said sharply, “Please stay. It is no secret. I should like to hear this news shouted among the hornbills from treetop to treetop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emperor paused. There was no sound but the whisper of flames in the coffee burner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Deire is consuming herself,” said Gebre Meskal. “She lies besieged from within, like a burning building that no one can escape, and which no one will enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know I do not want to damage my alliance with Abreha in Himyar. My admiral makes a monthly trip to the Turtle or the Hanish Islands, where he moors alongside Himyar’s flagship and exchanges news with the Himyarites. But we have been cautious not to come near each other in the meetings, and no ship may return to Aksum unless under my naval escort. Other ships may leave Aksum, at any time, with appropriate authorization. They may leave, but they may not return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone has been counterfeiting my authorization, and ships have been allowed to return to Deire. Plague has come with them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelemakos held quiet, listening. He sat straight and polite at first, his eyes on the floor, not even daring to watch his mother make the coffee; but then as he became absorbed in Gebre Meskal’s story he began to watch the butler, Ferem, who had squatted on his heels by the doorway when the emperor commanded him to stay. The old man became more and more bent as the tale went on, until he leaned with his elbows against his knees and his face hidden in his hands. He rocked back and forth on his heels, making a low, keening noise, as though in mourning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we have sent a squadron of the armada to close the port, and soldiers to set a cordon around the city. Deire is guarded by a ring of fire and steel ten miles across. No one shall escape.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They will all die, then,” Turunesh said simply. She filled a cup of steaming coffee and set it before the emperor, and Telemakos marveled at the steadiness of her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We do not want to starve them. We do not want to murder them. They may no longer fish; their port is closed. We deliver tef to their boundaries, milled and ground for baking injera, and we leave it for them. We leave them beer and honey wine, goats and hens, herbs for medication. But they must build their own pyres and dig their own graves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one may leave Deire. A few try; and they are struck down from a distance by the trained spears of my soldiers, and the bodies are set alight with flaming arrows. Nothing shall leave Deire. Deire is lost, that Aksum may be saved. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sunbird-the-lion-hunters-3/page-6.html","bookId":2671,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:39 AM"}
