And now I think we are ready to call upon your uncle. First, however, I have a little scheme in which I shall require your co-operation.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish to test your uncle\u0027s disposition toward you. We are in a position to dictate terms to him. If he shows proper feeling toward his nephew we shall feel disposed to be considerate toward him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [315]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you wish me to do?\" asked Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Call on your uncle and ask him if he can give you a place in his store, or help you to one outside. Of course you wouldn\u0027t accept one, but we shall see what reception he gives you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Into this scheme Ben readily entered. He was no longer a friendless and penniless boy, dependent upon his uncle for the means of living, but rich and his own master.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nicholas Walton was sitting in his counting-room when Ben entered. It so happened that Clarence Plantagenet was just leaving the store as Ben entered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you want?\" he asked, coldly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I should like to see your father.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think he will see you. He is busy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am quite anxious to see him,\" persisted Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you going to ask him to help you?\" said his cousin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; to help me to a place.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am sure he won\u0027t do it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would rather take the refusal from his lips,\" said Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [316]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, well, I suppose you can go and see him if you want to, but you will find that I am right.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think I will see him, then.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Clarence had been intending to go out at once, but it struck him that he would enjoy seeing his poor cousin rebuffed, and he accompanied Ben to the back of the store.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Father,\" he said, as he entered the office, followed by Ben, \"here is Ben Baker, who wants to see you. I told him it would be of no use to ask you for help, but he doesn\u0027t believe me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Walton frowned ominously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, boy,\" he said, frigidly, \"so you have lost your place with Major Grafton?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am convinced that it was on account of misconduct on your part.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is it quite right to condemn me before you have heard anything of the circumstances attending my leaving him?\" said Ben, mildly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I dare say you have some plausible story,\" sneered Mr. Walton; \"but it won\u0027t produce any effect on me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [317]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Still, sir, I will venture to say that I did not leave him on account of any misconduct on my own part.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps it was on account of misconduct on his part,\" said Mr. Walton, with a scornful laugh.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir, it was.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Really, this is very amusing. Now let me know what you want of me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Can you give me a place in your store, sir?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I can\u0027t, or rather I will not,\" answered his uncle, curtly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you use your influence to obtain me a position elsewhere?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I won\u0027t, and I consider you very impudent to prefer the request.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You seem to forget, sir, that I am your nephew.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I chose to forget it, considering the disreputable manner in which you have behaved.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then, you won\u0027t do anything for me, sir?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, decidedly no!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I told you so,\" said Clarence, triumphantly. \"You may as well go to selling papers.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [318]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He can do better than that,\" said a strange voice. \"He can live on the interest of his money.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Clarence and his father started in surprise, as the speaker, Filippo Novarro, entered the office. The merchant, recognizing him, turned pale.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80937.html","bookId":467,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM"}
