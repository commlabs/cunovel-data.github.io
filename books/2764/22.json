He wont tell me where we\u0027re going, though, so I\u0027m nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To meet a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we drive over the barren, dirt road, he looks at me with those dark, mysterious eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You scared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I be?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You should never be scared with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGee, most of the time I am scared to be with him. But mostly it\u0027s because I\u0027m afraid of my own feelings, which are out of control when I\u0027m with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands in my lap and stare out at the beautiful scenery. Who knew rocks and the desert landscape could be so beautiful and so different from the grassy mountains of the moshav.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re listening to Israeli music on the radio, but I need to get rid of my nervous energy. I start my butt exercises. Tighten. Release. Tighten. Release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Avi asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at him and say casually, \"Butt exercises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares at me for a second, then bursts out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not funny,\" I counter. \"If you sit for a long time, your butt\u0027ll look like one great big blob of jelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wouldn\u0027t want that, would we?\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my finger at him. \"Go ahead and make fun of me. You\u0027ll be sorry when you have the biggest butt on the moshav.\" I lean back in the car seat. \"Before you make fun of me you should try it out first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a nice butt.\" Avis lips twitch in amusement. \"Okay, tell me how to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if you\u0027re going to make fun of me.\" I don\u0027t want to make a fool out of myself again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" he urges me. \"I won\u0027t make fun of you. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and realize I\u0027m about to tell a very masculine boy how to do butt exercises. I want to cringe with embarrassment, but he actually looks serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say quickly, \"You just tighten your butt muscles like this and then release. The longer you hold the tightened part, the harder it gets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI attempt to demonstrate the action and feel like a complete dork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then I look over at him and he\u0027s actually trying the exercise. I can tell by the concentrated look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you ever vary it, tightening one cheek then the other?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to suppress a giggle, but I can\u0027t. In fact, I can\u0027t stop laughing as I watch Avi trying to tighten each cheek in rhythm to the music playing on the radio. He\u0027s making fun of himself, emphasizing each movement of his butt along with the rhythm of the song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try it, too, and can\u0027t stop tightening to the beat of the music. It\u0027s contagious, and I\u0027m having one of the best times of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know you could be so funny,\" I tell him, still trying to keep my giggles to a minimum, but having a hard time of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, you caught me off guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be off guard more often,\" I say in a very flirty way and smile at him when he looks over at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and sighs in resignation. \"You\u0027re going to get me in trouble with Ron. I told him I\u0027d take care of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean it. Avi was a royal pain in my butt (pardon the pun) when I first got to Israel. But now that he\u0027s opened up and let me into his personal life, I feel closer to him than I\u0027ve felt to anyone in a long time. Even Mitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I realize now Mitch and I are not compatible. In truth, he probably doesn\u0027t even know me. I keep a wall of my own up so I don\u0027t get hurt. I like Mitch. But I think if he knew me, I mean REALLY knew me, he wouldn\u0027t even consider being my boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? Because I\u0027m high maintenance, for one thing. And second of all I need a strong guy to take my crap and give it right back to me. I guess Avis a little bit like Ron in that respect. Could it be I\u0027m compatible with a guy who\u0027s a mirror image of the Sperm Donor?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turn onto a small, paved road and drive for another fifteen minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we?\" I ask as he parks the car in front of a small house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens his car door. \"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles this great big smile, comes around to my side of the car, and opens my door. I know it\u0027s considered the gentlemanly thing to do, but let\u0027s be honest. I am no lady, and Avi ...we\u0027ll, he\u0027s no gentleman. He\u0027s a rough, rugged Israeli who can whip bales of hay around effortlessly. Just the way I like \u0027em.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step out of the car and survey my surroundings. I was wrong before--at the moshav it\u0027s the North Pole compared to this place in the middle of the desert. I seriously think if I break an egg on the street, it\u0027ll be cooked from the hot sun in less than ten seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are houses in front of me, made of cement, and they\u0027re all the same. By that, I mean the houses are all white. No brick, no paint...just all white cement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who lives here?\" I ask quietly. It\u0027s like a little village in the middle of nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks toward the entrance to one of the primitive houses, and I follow dumbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Palestinians,\" he answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHAT!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would an Israeli take me to a Palestinian persons house? I want to ask questions, but I don\u0027t have enough time because the front door to the house starts to open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA teenager, about our age, opens the door. His skin is darker than mine, about the same shade as Avi\u0027s. In fact, if Avi hadn\u0027t told me this guy was a Palestinian, I would have thought he was Israeli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know current events. You\u0027d have to live in a cave not to know Palestinians and Israelis do not see eye to eye on anything. And that\u0027s putting it mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I watch this Palestinian guy shake Avi\u0027s hand and pull him into a short embrace, once again what I know and who I know is tilted on its axis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tarik, this my friend, Amy Barak. She\u0027s an American.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody\u0027s ever called me Amy Barak before and I\u0027m taken aback. I was born by the name of Amy Nelson because that was my mother\u0027s maiden name. Am I Amy Barak?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome part of me, way deep down, likes the way it sounds. Or maybe I like the way it sounds coming out of Avi\u0027s full lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, it doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m nervous. I do everything in my power not to bite my nails or act as shocked as I feel on the inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tarik smiles, putting me a little at ease. And it\u0027s a real smile, not one of those fake ones people do just to be polite (like Marc does). No, this smile of Tarik\u0027s reaches his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in!\" Tarik says eagerly. \"It\u0027s been a long time, friend,\" he says to Avi as he pats him on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s university hunting?\" Avi asks him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarik chuckles. \"Not worth talking about. Although I did get a letter from UCLA and Northwestern. So tell me, Amy, what brings you here?\" he adds as he leads us to a small room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are pillows in the middle of the floor and lining one wall. Tarik motions for us to sit. I watch Avi as he sits down on an orange pillow and I follow his lead, sitting down on a light blue one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came with my father for the summer,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as a woman, wearing her head covered and in full traditional Muslim attire, brings a tray of fruit and sets it in front of Tarik. She doesn\u0027t say anything, just sets it down and leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarik picks up an orange and hands it to me. \"From our tree outside. I bet it\u0027s better than in America.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Avi, who takes a cluster of grapes off of the tray and starts eating them. Only after I start peeling my orange does Tarik take his own. Is that his custom, to let his guests eat first?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just cant believe I\u0027m sitting in a Palestinians house and he\u0027s feeding an Israeli Jew and an American stranger. With a smile on his face, no less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you two dating?\" Tarik asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only for the summer,\" I chime in as my face gets hot with embarrassment. \"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarik laughs. \"And after the summer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe directs the question to me, but Avi says, \"After the summer she goes back to her country. She\u0027s got a boyfriend back there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, the story gets more interesting now. I think I like these American women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi pops a large, green grape into his mouth. \"Please, Tarik, don\u0027t let her fool you. Amy Isanha taweel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" I say. \"If you\u0027re going to talk about me, speak English so I can defend myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarik looks at me with a mischievous look on his face. \"He says you have a sharp tongue, like a snake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth opens wide and I say, \"I do not. Apologize,\" I tell Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, you should know this guy doesn\u0027t apologize,\" Tarik says. \"It\u0027s not in his nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi chuckles as he pops another green grape into his mouth, finishing the last one. \"Tarik, you should be a lawyer instead of a doctor. You like to argue both sides of an argument, confusing everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShuffles from the door interrupt us as two girls come into the room with cups and a teapot. They set the cups down in front of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are my sisters, Madiha and Yara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGosh, my life is so different from these girls. They smile and bow slightly in greeting and I stand up and do the same although I feel a little underdressed. I wonder what they think of me. I don\u0027t cover my head or wear long robes like they do and I imagine how different our lives are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they leave, I sit back down and take a bite of my orange. It is as sweet as if I licked a spoonful of sugar. Yum!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the sisters leave us alone Avi says to Tarik, \"Amy thinks all Israelis hate Palestinians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing I want to do is start a political discussion with these two and here Avi is, bringing it up. I almost choke on my orange. When I\u0027m finally able to swallow, I open my mouth to say something. Nothing comes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarik leans back and says, \"The Palestinians hold claim to the same land as the Israelis. There\u0027s no way around that fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" Avi continues, \"not every Palestinian hates every Israeli and not every Israeli hates every Palestinian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you guys be friends?\" I ask. I turn to Tarik and say, \"He\u0027s going into the Israeli army!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarik shrugs. \"This is his life, what he must do. Mine is not so different. But my people have chosen to fight in a different way; it\u0027s the only way my people think is effective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody wins,\" I say. \"Why can\u0027t you just come to some kind of agreement and stick with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hopefully in the future things will change,\" Tarik admits. \"To some, peace with the Israelis is not an option. Me? I want peace, but I also want my people to live their lives respectfully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi looks at me and says, \"Many Israelis want the same thing, Amy. Peace, but with the guarantee our women and children can walk in the streets or ride buses without having to worry about their safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what comes first?\" Tarik asks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-22.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM"}
