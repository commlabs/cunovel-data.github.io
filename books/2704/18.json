{"id":73547,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u003cp\u003eKeeper\u0027s Cottage\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was tfee silence that woke Jenna in Keeper\u0027s Cottage the next morning. After ten years of waking every day to the busy sounds of The Ramblings, not to mention the riot and hubbub of the six Heap boys, the silence was deafening. Jenna opened her eyes, and for a moment thought that she was still dreaming. Where was she? Why wasn\u0027t she at home in her cupboard? \\Vhy were just Jo-Jo and Nicko here? Where were all her other brothers?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna sat up quietly so as not to wake the boys who were lying beside her by the glowing embers of the fire downstairs in Aunt Zelda\u0027s cottage. She wrapped her quilt around her as, despite the fire, the air in the cottage had a damp chill to it. And then, hesitantly, she raised a hand to her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was true. The gold circlet was still there. She was still a Princess. It hadn\u0027t been just for her birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll through the previous day, Jenna had had that feeling of unreality that she always got on her birthday. A feeling that the day was somehow part of another world, another time, and that anything that happened on her birthday was not real. And it was that feeling that had carried Jenna through the amazing events of her tenth birthday, a feeling that, whatever happened, it would all be back to normal the next day, so it didn\u0027t really matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t. And it did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna hugged herself to keep warm and considered the matter. She was a Princess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna and her best friend, Bo, had often discussed together the fact that they were in fact long-lost Princess sisters, separated at birth, whom fate had thrown together in the form of a shared desk in Class 6 of East Side Third School. Jenna had almost believed this; it had seemed so right somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough, when she went around to Bo\u0027s rooms to play, Jenna didn\u0027t see how Bo could really belong to another family. Bo looked so much like her mother, thought Jenna, with her bright red hair and masses of freckles, that she had to be her daughter. But Bo had been scathing about this when Jenna had pointed it out, so she didn\u0027t mention it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, it hadn\u0027t stopped Jenna wondering why she looked so unlike her own mother. And father. And brothers. Why was she the only one with dark hair? Why didn\u0027t she have green eyes? Jenna had desperately wanted her eyes to turn green. In fact, up until the previous day, she had still hoped that they might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had longed for the excitement of Sarah saying to her, as she watched her do with all the boys, \"You know, I do think your eyes are beginning to turn. I can definitely see a bit of green in them today.\" And then: \"You are growing up fast. Your eyes are nearly as green as your father\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when Jenna demanded to be told about her eyes, and why they weren\u0027t green yet like her brothers\u0027, Sarah would only say, \"But you\u0027re our little girl, Jenna. You\u0027re special. You have beautiful eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that didn\u0027t fool Jenna. She knew that girls could have green Wizard eyes too. Just look at Miranda Bott down the corridor, whose grandfather ran the Wizard secondhand cloak shop. Miranda had green eyes, and it was only her grandfather who was a Wizard. So why didn\u0027t she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna felt upset thinking about Sarah. She wondered when she would see her again. She even wondered if Sarah would still want to be her mother, now that everything had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna shook herself and told herself not to be silly. She stood up, keeping her quilt around her, and picked her way over the two sleeping boys. She paused to glance at Boy 412 and wondered why she had thought he was Jo-Jo. It must have been a trick of the light, she decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of the cottage was still dark apart from the dull glow cast by the fire, but Jenna had become accustomed to the gloom, and she began to wander around, trailing her quilt along the floor and slowly taking in her new surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cottage was not big. There was one room downstairs; at one end was a huge open fireplace with a pile of gently smoldering logs still glowing on the hot stone hearth. Nicko and Boy 412 were fast asleep on the rug in front of the fire, each wrapped warmly in one of Aunt Zelda\u0027s patchwork quilts. In the middle of the room was a flight of narrow stairs with a cupboard underneath, with the words UNSTABLE POTIONS AND PARTIKULAR POISONS written in flowing golden letters on the firmly closed door. She peered up the narrow stairs that led up to a large darkened room where Aunt Zelda, Marcia and Silas were still sleeping. And of course Maxie, whose snores and snuffles drifted down to Jenna. Or were they Silas\u0027s snores and Maxie\u0027s snuffles? When they were asleep, master and wolfhound sounded remarkably similar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs the ceilings were low and showed the rough-hewn beams that the cottage was built from. All manner of things were hung from these beams: boat paddles, hats, bags of shells, spades, hoes, sacks of potatoes, shoes, ribbons, brooms, bundles of reeds, willow knots and of course hundreds of bunches of the herbs that Aunt Zelda either grew herself or bought at the Magyk Market, which was held every year and a day down at the Port. As a White Witch, Aunt Zelda used herbs for charms and potions as well as medicine, and you\u0027d be lucky to be able to tell Aunt Zelda anything about a herb that she did not know already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna gazed around her, loving the feeling of being the only one awake, free to wander undisturbed for a while. As she walked about, she thought how strange it was to be in a cottage with four walls all of its very own that were not joined to anyone else\u0027s walls. It was so different from the hurly-burly of The Ramblings, but she already felt at home. Jenna carried on with her exploration, noticing the old but comfortable chairs, the well-scrubbed table that did not look as though it was about to roll over and die at any minute and, most strikingly, the newly swept stone floor that was empty. There was nothing on it apart from some worn rugs and, by the door, a pair of Aunt Zelda\u0027s boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peeked into the little built-on kitchen, with its large sink, some neat and tidy pots and pans and a small table, but it was far too cold to linger in. Then she wandered over to the end of the room where shelves of potion bottles and jars lined the walls, reminding her of home. There were some that she recognized and remembered Sarah using. Frog Fusions, Marvel Mixture and Basic Brew were all familiar names to Jenna. And then, just like home, surrounding a small desk covered with neat piles of pens, papers and notebooks, there were teetering piles of Magyk books reaching up to the ceiling. There were so many that they covered almost an entire wall, but unlike home, they did not cover the floor as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dawn light was beginning to creep through the frost-covered windows, and Jenna decided to take a look outside. She tiptoed over to the big wooden door and very slowly drew back the huge, well-oiled bolt. Then she carefully pulled the door open, hoping that it wouldn\u0027t creak. It didn\u0027t, because Aunt Zelda, like all witches, was very particular about doors. A creaking door in the house of a White Witch was a bad sign, a sign of misplaced Magyk and ill-founded spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna slipped quietly outside and sat on the doorstep with her quilt wrapped around her and her warm breath turning to white clouds in the chill dawn air. The marsh mist was heavy and low. It hugged the ground and swirled over the surface of the water and around a small wooden bridge that crossed a broad channel to the marsh on the other side. The water was brimming up over the banks of the channel, which was known as the Mott, and ran all the way around Aunt Zelda\u0027s island like a moat. The water was dark and so flat that it looked as though a thin skin was stretched over its surface, and yet, as Jenna gazed at it she could see that the water was slowly creeping over the edges of the banks and wandering onto the island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years Jenna had watched the tides come and go, and she knew the tide that morning was a high spring tide after the full moon the night before, and she also knew that soon it would start to creep out again, just as it did in the river outside her little window at home, until it was as low as it had been high, leaving the mud and sand for the waterbirds to dip into with their long, curved beaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pale white disk of the winter sun rose slowly through the thick blanket of mist, and around Jenna the silence began to change into the dawn sounds of stirring animals. A fussy clucking noise made Jenna jump in surprise and glance over to where the sound was coming from. To her amazement, Jenna could see the shape of a fishing boat looming through the mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Jenna, who had seen more new and strange things in the last twenty-four hours than she had ever dreamed possible, a fishing boat crewed by chickens was not as much a surprise as it might have been. She just sat on the doorstep and waited for the boat to pass by. After a few minutes the boat appeared not to have moved, and she wondered if it had run aground on the island. A few minutes after that, when the mist had cleared a little more, she realized what it was: the fishing boat was a chicken house. Stepping delicately down the gangplank were a dozen hens, busily beginning the work of the day. Pecking and scratching, scratching and pecking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings, thought Jenna, are not always what they seem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin, reedy birdcall drifted through the mist, and some muffled splashes were coming from the water, which sounded as though they belonged to small and, Jenna hoped, furry animals. It crossed her mind that they might be made by water snakes or eels, but she decided not to think about that. Jenna leaned back against the door post and breathed in the fresh, slightly salty marsh air. It was perfect. Peace and quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boo!\" said Nicko. \"Got you, Jen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nicko,\" protested Jenna. \"You\u0027re so noisy. Shhh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicko settled himself down on the doorstep next to Jenna and grabbed some of her quilt to wrap himself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" Jenna told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Jenna, may I share your quilt? Yes, you may, Nicko. Oh, thank you very much, Jenna, that\u0027s very kind of you. Don\u0027t mention it, Nicko.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then, I won\u0027t.\" Nicko grinned. \"And I suppose I have to curtsy to you now you\u0027re Miss High and Mighty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys don\u0027t curtsy.\" Jenna laughed. \"You have to bow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicko leaped to his feet and, doffing an imaginary hat with a sweep of his arm, bowed an exaggerated bow. Jenna clapped. \"Very good. You can do that every morning.\" She laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Your Majesty,\" said Nicko gravely, stuffing his imaginary hat back on his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder where the Boggart is?\" said Jenna a little sleepily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicko yawned. \"Probably at the bottom of some mud pool somewhere. I don\u0027t suppose he\u0027s tucked up in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d hate it, wouldn\u0027t he? Too dry and clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Nicko, \"I\u0027m going back to bed. I need more than two hours sleep, even if you don\u0027t.\" He extricated himself from Jenna\u0027s quilt and wandered back inside to his own, which lay in a crumpled heap by the fire. Jenna realized that she still felt tired too. Her eyelids were beginning to get that prickly feeling that told her she had not slept long enough, and she was getting cold. She stood up, gathered her quilt around her, slipped back into the half-light of the cottage and very quietly closed the door behind her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magyk-septimus-heap-1/page-18.html","bookId":2704,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:06 AM"}
