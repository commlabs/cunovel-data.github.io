But a dark past and even darker secrets are threatening to bubble over her perfect fa√ßade. She\u0027ll do anything to keep the emptiness inside hidden-which leads her into situations that always end badly. Whenever she hits bottom, there\u0027s only one person who\u0027s there to pull her out: Ethan Gregory. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eEthan set the rules a long time ago: he and Lila are just friends. He doesn\u0027t do relationships. Although his tattooed, bad boy exterior is a far cry from Lila\u0027s pretty princess image, Ethan can\u0027t deny they have a deeper connection than he\u0027s used to. If he\u0027s not careful, he could be in serious danger of becoming attached-and he\u0027s learned the hard way that attachment only leads to heartbreak. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eWhen Lila falls farther than she ever has before, can Ethan continue to help as a friend?
