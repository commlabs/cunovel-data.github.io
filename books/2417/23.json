She was wearing a pullover black shirt and dark slacks, which meant something was up for tonight. Erainya only forgoes the standard Tshirt dress when she knows she\u0027s got some crawling or running or breaking in to do. \"Just leftovers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome kibbeb. Dolmades. Spanakopita. There\u0027s a little melitzanosalata—what\u0027s . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeggplant salad, I guess you\u0027d say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya\u0027s first language was English, but every once in a while she likes to forget how to translate something from Greek. She says thinking in Greek clears her soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem raced to the bedroom to get his sneakers. When he disappeared down the hallway Erainya said, \"You thought things over, honey? About the job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking. I have an interview lined up. For a college position.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya gave me the black eyes. \"I thought you couldn\u0027t stand the idea of a dusty office and a tweed suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that was sour grapes. Nobody ever offered me a dusty office and a tweed suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya slapped air. \"Not that I care—not like I want you back if you won\u0027t work right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not losing my license over you being an idiot, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam Barrera speak to you again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know nothing about Sam Barrera\u0027s cases and I don\u0027t know nothing about what you\u0027re doing on your time off, you understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya glared at the dishrags. \"I\u0027m not going to let that ouskemo tell me what to do, neither. Maybe he\u0027s got some friends in a lot of places. He doesn\u0027t own me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. We were quiet, listening to Jem throw toys and other large heavy objects around his bedroom, apparently looking for just the right fashion statement footwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be good to know some background on a guy named Tilden Sheckly,\" I said. \"About some shipments he\u0027s been processing through his dance hall, especially any connections he might have in Europe. Like for instance if your friend in Customs knew anything—what\u0027s her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Corrie. I didn\u0027t hear any of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed that she hadn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem came back wearing purple Reeboks. He showed me how the heellights flickered when he bounced up and down. He\u0027d also put a Casper the Ghost mask on his head with shafts of his thick black hair sticking out of the eyeholes. I told him he looked great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya started loading up her purse while Jem told me about what his Halloween costume was going to be. The costume apparently had nothing to do with the Casper mask. He told me how many hours and minutes were left until six o\u0027clock Sunday, when he was going trickortreating. Then he told me about the movie he was taking me to—something with marsupials that transformed into cosmic warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya packed her cassette recorder, her Mace canister, her obligatory box of green Chiclets, and five Kleenex folded into triangles. She deliberated over her key chain, rubbing her thumb on the little gold key that opens her gun cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she looked up and realized I was watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes turned hard as obsidian. She stowed the keys in her purse and zipped it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is two hours going to be enough time?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to keep my voice casual, disinterested. Erainya responded the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, honey. Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem gave up explaining the virtues of outer space marsupials to me. He climbed back onto a stool at the kitchen counter and started colouring a picture of Godzilla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Longoria case?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya hesitated long enough to confirm it. \"It\u0027s nothing, honey. Don\u0027t worry about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll just be able to run some checks faster while Jem\u0027s out with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem coloured a red halo around Godzilla\u0027s head, focusing his energy into the tip of his marker with a level of concentration no adult could match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erainya—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cut me off with a look. When she spoke she addressed the top of Jem\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you waste time worrying about the wrong person, honey. I can tell you all about it next week when you\u0027re back at work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErainya muttered something in Greek that sounded like a proverb. She sighed and put her purse on her forearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll meet you back here by nine. And no damn candy at the theatre, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJem complained a little about that, telling her we always got Dots and Red Vines, but he knew better than to push it. He just shut his mouth and let his mother rewrite the rules as ridiculously unfair as she wanted. That\u0027s a lesson everybody learns eventually with Erainya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the movies I dropped Jem off at Erainya\u0027s house and flipped a coin, Compton or Blanceagle. I was half hoping the coin would land on its edge and I could go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead it came up Blanceagle. I headed out for the address I\u0027d seen on Alex\u0027s driver\u0027s license, 1600 Mecca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMecca Street, like its namesake, is a place most people only get to once in their lifetime, only with the help of Allah, and only after many tribulations. Once you do find the road, it twists illogically through the Hollywood Park subdivision, disappearing and then reappearing, following what was once a creek bed through the rolling hills just inside Loop 1604.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took 281 North and gave myself up to the hajj as soon as I exited, praying that someday I\u0027d find Alex Blanceagle\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHollywood Park was showing its age since I\u0027d been there last, almost ten years before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pseudoranch houses that lined the streets were now more weathered, the lawns that had been grafted with fruit trees and turf grass now regressed in spots to the original scrub brush, mesquites, and cactus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn most blocks the pristine look of affluent Gringo land had given way to more downtoearth realities— plastic daisy pinwheels in the yards, porches overflowing with tricycles, windsocks, political signboards, pumpkins, and paper skeletons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlanceagle\u0027s house was in one of the nicer areas, with halfacre lots and expensive castiron mailboxes and the occasional white splitrail fence. The house itself was a twostory affair, half limestone, half cedar siding, set far back from the road. I parked a block down on Mecca, then walked up the gravel driveway toward the front porch, my backpack in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo exterior lights. Dim illumination from behind an upstairs curtain, more from around the side of the house—kitchen window, maybe. I was almost to the porch before I realized that the front door wasn\u0027t really painted black. It was just completely open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood to one side on the porch and let my eyes adjust. Then I moved inside and stood against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man\u0027s living room, lit only by the glow from the hallway on the right and from the staircase on the left. There were two large easy chairs and a mismatching love seat, all ugly and functional. A bigscreen TV and cabinet of stereo equipment. A bookshelf that was mostly filled with CDs stacked sideways. A bar in the corner. A slidingglass door that led out to a back porch. There was also a strange combination of smells that I didn\u0027t like at all—very old cigarette smoke, mildew, dead rat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened. Faint clinking sounds came from down the hallway, from the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should\u0027ve left right then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I walked down the hallway, into the kitchen and into the line of fire of Sam Barrera, senior regional director of ITech Security and Investigations. He was sitting behind the butcherblock table eating a gallonsized bowl of Corn Pops and his little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.22 was pointed at exactly the spot my forehead appeared as I came into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no surprise on his face when he saw me. With his free hand he put down the spoon and wiped a dribble of milk off his chin. He said, \"Drop the backpack. Come in and turn around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Sam. Nice to see you too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did what he told me, very slowly. With a guy who\u0027d been a special agent for the FBI for sixteen years, you\u0027re better off not taking liberties. Sam came around the table and patted me down. He smelled as usual like Aramis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my wallet. I could hear him rummaging through the backpack, setting things out on the counter, then sitting back down behind the table. His Corn Pops hadn\u0027t even stopped crackling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at me,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam was wearing a charcoal threepiece and a maroon tie. The gold rings made his right hand almost too chunky to hold the .22. He gave me his standard frown and hard, glassy eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up my roll of money from Milo Chavez and showed it to me. Then my studio photograph of Les SaintPierre. Then my business card from the Erainya Manos Agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for an explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a tidge bit curious myself,\" I told him. \"Finding a highprofile corporate dick in somebody else\u0027s kitchen, eating their Corn Pops with a spoon and a .22—I don\u0027t come across this scenario often.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hungry. Mr. Blanceagle isn\u0027t going to need them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the ceiling. The smell of dead rat was fainter in the kitchen, but still present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the realization finally hit me, it hit hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know why some things knock a hole in my gut and others don\u0027t. I\u0027ve seen a dozen dead bodies. I\u0027ve seen two people killed right in front of me. Usually it doesn\u0027t get me until much later, in the middle of the night, in the shower. This time, even without Blanceagle in front of me, even considering I\u0027d only met the guy once, some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ething gave way like a trapdoor under my rib cage. The idea of that poor schmuck being upstairs dead, the guy who\u0027d looked so drunk and pathetic and outclassed at Sheckly\u0027s studio who had done me the small favour of calling me a musician to get me out the door—the idea of him being reduced to a rodent smell got to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmbarrassing, with Sam Barrera there. I had to swallow a couple of times, press my hands against the bumpy texture of the kitchen wall behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Upstairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrera nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two days ago,\" I guessed. \"Shot with a Beretta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrera started, a bit uneasy at my guesswork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" I said. \"You passed up a hell of a trainee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll live with it. Go look. I\u0027ll wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost easier than staying there in the kitchen. At least upstairs, if I threw up, I wouldn\u0027t have Barrera looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy feet were heavy on the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed as shallowly as I could but it didn\u0027t help. After only two days dead in a cool house, the smell shouldn\u0027t have been this cloying. Somehow, though, every time I smelled that smell it seemed worse than the time before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex was facedown on a queensized bed in the same clothes he\u0027d worn at the Indian Paintbrush. His left limbs were extended and his right limbs curled into his body, so it looked like he was rock climbing. The sheets were in a state of disarray that conformed to his posture, a clump of fabric gathered in his right hand. Fluids had crusted his face to the bedspread. There were flies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood at the doorway for a long time before I could make my feet cooperate. I forced myself to go closer, look for entrance wounds. There were two—a clean round hole in the back of the beige windbreaker, maybe shot from ten feet away, the other in Blanceagle\u0027s temple with the edges of the flesh starred and splitting, very close range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard to be sure without stripping him, checking for lividity, but I was pretty sure the body hadn\u0027t been moved. He\u0027d walked into his bedroom, somebody behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d shot him in the back. He fell forward onto the bed. They came up and finished it off. Simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the room looked fuzzy, like all the light was bending toward the corpse. I tried to focus on the bedstand, the dresser, to look without touching. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-23.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
