She helped Lily wriggle out of her wet shirt. She untied Lily’s shoes for her, and peeled off her wet socks, then made Lily press her feet up to the vents where the heat had begun to blow. The whole time Lily was limp, obedient, as if all the life had been washed out of her. Heather moved mechanically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be right back,” she told Lily. She felt detached from the words, as though she wasn’t the one speaking. The anger was drumming out the knowledge of everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom, boom, boom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was music coming from the trailer, practically shaking the walls. The lights were on too, although the blinds were down; she could see a figure swaying in silhouette, maybe dancing. She hadn’t noticed before because she’d been too worried about Lily. She kept seeing the little figure huddled underneath the pathetic birch, practically the single tree that Fresh Pines boasted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom told me to go away. She told me to play outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom, boom, boom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was at the door. Locked. From inside, she heard a shriek of laughter. Somehow she fit the key in the lock; that must mean she wasn’t shaking. Strange, she thought, and also: Maybe I could have won Panic after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the door open and stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were three of them: Krista, Bo, and Maureen, from Lot 99. They froze, and Heather froze too. She was seized momentarily by the sense that she’d entered a play and had forgotten all her lines—she couldn’t breathe, didn’t know what to do. The lights were high, bright. They looked like actors, all three of them—actors you see too close. They were too made up. But the makeup was horrible. It looked as though it was beginning to melt, slowly deforming their faces. Their eyes were bright, glittering: doll eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather took in everything at once: the blue haze of smoke. The empty beer bottles, the overflowing cups used as ashtrays, the single bottle of Georgi vodka, half empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the small blue plastic plate on the table, still faintly outlined with the imprint of the Sesame Street characters—Lily’s old plate—now covered with thin lines of fine white powder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of it hit Heather like a physical blow, a quick sock to the stomach. Her world went black for a second. The plate. Lily’s plate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the moment passed. Krista brought a cigarette unsteadily to her lips, nearly missing. “Heather Lynn,” she slurred. She patted her shirt, her breasts, as though expecting to find a lighter there. “What are you doing, baby? Why are you staring at me like I’m a—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather lunged. Before her mother finished speaking, before she could think about what she was doing, all of the rage traveled down into her arms and legs and she picked up the blue plate, crisscrossed with powder like it had been scarred by something, and threw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaureen screamed and Bo shouted. Krista barely managed to duck. She tried to right herself and, staggering backward, managed to land on Maureen’s lap, in the armchair. This made Maureen scream even louder. The plate collided against the wall with a thud, and the air was momentarily full of white powder, like an indoor snow. It would have been funny if it weren’t so horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?” Bo took two steps toward Heather and for a moment, she thought he might hit her. But he just stood there, fists clenched, red-faced and enraged. “What the hell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrista fought to her feet. “Who in the goddamn do you think you are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather was glad that they were separated by the coffee table. Otherwise, she wasn’t sure what she would do. She wanted to kill Krista. Really kill her. “You’re disgusting.” Her voice sounded mangled, like something had wrapped around her vocal cords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get out.” The color was rising in Krista’s face. Her voice, too, was rising, and she was shaking as though something awful was going to detonate inside her. “Get out! Do you hear me? Get out!” She reached for the vodka bottle and threw it. Fortunately, she was slow. Heather sidestepped it easily. She heard shattering glass and felt the splash of liquid. Bo got his arms around Krista. He managed to restrain her. She was still shrieking, writhing like an animal, face red and twisted and awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly all the anger, the writhing snake in Heather’s stomach, released. She felt absolutely nothing. No pain. No anger. No fear. Nothing but disgust. She felt, weirdly, as if she were floating above the scene, hovering in her own body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and went to her bedroom. She checked her top drawer first, in the plastic jewelry box where she kept her earnings. Everything was gone but forty dollars. Of course. Her mom had stolen it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis didn’t bring a fresh wave of anger, only a new kind of disgust. Animals. They were animals, and Krista was the worst of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pocketed the twenties and moved quickly through the room, stuffing things in Lily’s backpack: shoes, pants, shirts, underwear. When the backpack was full, she bundled things up in one of the comforters. They would need a blanket, anyway. And toothbrushes. She remembered reading in a magazine once that toothbrushes were the number one item travelers forgot to pack. But she wouldn’t forget. She was calm, thinking straight. She had it all together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid the backpack onto one of her shoulders—it was so small, she couldn’t fit it correctly. Poor Lily. She wanted to get food from the kitchen, but that would mean walking past her mom and Bo and Maureen. She’d have to skip it. There probably wasn’t much she could use, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the last second she took the rose off her dresser, the one Bishop had made her from metal and wire. It would be good luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hefted the blanket in her arms, now heavy with all the clothing and shoes it contained, and shuffled sideways out of the bedroom door. She’d been worried her mom would try and stop her, but she shouldn’t have been. Krista was sitting on the couch, crying, with Maureen’s arms around her. Her hair was a stringy mess. Heather heard her say, “… did everything . . . on my own.” Only half the words were audible. She was too messed up to speak clearly. Bo was gone. He’d probably split, since the drugs were nothing but carpet crumbs now. Maybe he’d left to get more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather pushed out the door. It didn’t matter. She’d never see Bo again. She’d never see her mother, or Maureen, or the inside of that trailer again. For one second, she could have sobbed, going down the porch steps. Never again—the idea filled her with a relief so strong, it almost turned her knees to water and made her trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn’t cry, not yet. She had to be strong for Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily had fallen asleep in the front seat, her mouth open, her hair feathering slightly in the heat. Finally her lips weren’t blue anymore, and she was no longer shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t open her eyes until they were just bouncing out of the entrance to the Pines and onto Route 22.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heather?” she said in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up, Billy?” Heather tried to smile and couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to go back there.” Lily turned and rested her forehead against the window. In the glass’s reflection, her face was narrow and pale, like a tapered flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather tightened her fingers on the wheel. “We’re not going back there,” she said. Weirdly, the words made the taste of sick come up. “We’re never going back, okay? I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where will we go?” Lily asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather reached over and squeezed Lily’s knee. Her jeans had finally dried. “We’ll figure something out. Okay? We’re going to be just fine.” The rain was still coming down in sheets; the car carved waves in the road, sending liquid rivers sloshing toward the gutters. “You trust me, right?” Heather asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily nodded without turning her face away from the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to be fine,” Heather repeated, and returned both hands to the wheel, gripping tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn’t, she realized, go to Bishop’s or Nat’s. She’d taken her mom’s car and had no intention of returning it, which counted as stealing. And her friends’ houses would be the first place her mom would think of looking when she sobered up and realized what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould she call the police? Would they track Heather down? Maybe her mom would convince them that Heather was a delinquent, and they would try to pin the fire on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no point in worrying about that yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could know. It came down to that. She and Lily would have to be very, very careful for the next few weeks. As soon as they had enough money to leave Carp, they would. And until then, they had to hide. They’d have to hide the car, too, and use it only at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea came to her suddenly: Meth Row. The whole road was cluttered with old cars and abandoned houses. No one would notice one more shitty car parked there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily had fallen asleep again and was snoring quietly. Meth Row looked even bleaker than usual. The rain had turned the pitted road to sludge, and Heather had trouble just keeping the wheel from jerking under her hands. It was hard to tell which houses were occupied and which weren’t, but she finally found a spot next to a storage shed and an old Buick, stripped nearly to its metal frame, where she could angle the car so it was mostly unseen from the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned off the engine. No point in wasting gas. They’d have to be careful about wasting anything now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d be more comfortable in the backseat, but since Lily was already asleep and Heather doubted she would sleep at all—it wasn’t even six o’clock—she reached into the back and shook out all the things from the comforter. Stuff that had only an hour ago been littering their beds, the floor of their bedroom. Their home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomeless. It was the first time the word occurred to her, and she pushed it out of her mind. It was an ugly word, a word that smelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunaways was better, a little more glam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spread the comforter over Lily, careful not to wake her. She found a hoodie in the back and put it on over her shirt, pulled up the hood, cinched the drawstrings tight. Thankfully it was summer and wouldn’t get too cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to her that she should turn her cell phone off too, to conserve battery power. But before she did, she typed out a text to Nat and Dodge. She included Bishop too. Like he’d said, he was in it, one way or another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChanged my mind, she wrote. I’m back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was playing for keeps now. For Lily. Forget the promise she’d made to Nat. The money would be hers, and hers alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, long after Heather had finally drifted off, head back in the front seat of the Taurus—when Nat was curled up in bed with her computer, searching for funny videos—when even the bars were shutting down and the people who wanted to drink were forced to do it outside, or in the parking lot of 7-Eleven—Ellie Hayes was woken up by two masked figures. They hauled her roughly to her feet and handcuffed her wrists in front of her body, as if she were a convict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer parents were gone for the weekend—the players knew what they were doing. Her older brother, Roger, heard the noise and the scuffling and burst into the hall, holding a baseball bat. But Ellie managed to cry out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Panic!” she said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/panic/page-21.html","bookId":1721,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:44 AM"}
