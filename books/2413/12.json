Patiently, he drew lines with a pencil to connect the murder scenes. \"A place for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Umm-hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone opened the refrigerator and complained loudly that their A amp; W had been stolen. No one paid any attention. The staff had been whittled down by the flu and a double homicide near Georgetown University. Someone had taped a cardboard turkey onto one of the windows, but it was the only outward sign of holiday cheer. Ben put a light circle around Tess\u0027s apartment building before he glanced over at Ed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So when are you moving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Depends.\" Ed frowned at the keys, hesitated, then found his rhythm again. \"Have to see if the contract goes through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You having someone killed so you can rent their apartment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Contract of sale. Shit, this typewriter\u0027s defective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sale?\" Ben dropped his pencil and stared. \"You\u0027re buying a place? Buying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\" Ed patiently applied Liquid Paper to his last mistake, blew on it, then typed the correction. He kept a can of Lysol spray at his elbow. If anyone who looked contagious walked by, he sprayed the area. \"You suggested it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but I was only- Buying?\" To cover his tracks, Ben pushed some excess paper into his trash basket on top of the empty can of A amp; W \"What kind of dump can you afford on a detective\u0027s pay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of us know how to save. I\u0027m using my capital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Capital?\" Ben rolled his eyes before folding the map. He wasn\u0027t getting anywhere. \"The man has capital,\" he said to the station at large. \"Next thing you know, you\u0027ll be telling me you play the market.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve made a few small, conservative investments. Utilities mostly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Utilities. The only utilities you know about is the gas bill.\" But he studied Ed with an uncertain eye. \"Where is this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got a few minutes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got some personal time coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd pulled his report out of the typewriter, cast a wary glance over it, then set it aside. \"Let\u0027s take a drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take long. The neighborhood was on the outer and rougher edges of Georgetown. The row houses looked more tired than distinguished. The fall flowers had simply given up for lack of interest, and stood faded among tangles of unraked leaves. Someone had chained a bike to a post. It had been stripped down of everything portable. Ed pulled up to the curb. 1 here it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCautious, Ben turned his head. To his credit, he didn\u0027t groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was three stories high, and narrow, with its front door hardly five paces from the sidewalk. Two of the windows had been boarded up, and the shutters that hadn\u0027t fallen off tilted drunkenly. The brick was old and softly faded, except for where someone had spray painted an obscenity. Ben got out of the car, leaned on the hood, and tried not to believe what he was seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, something. Ed, there aren\u0027t any gutters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half the windows are broken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I might replace a couple of them with stained glass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think the roof\u0027s been reshingled since the Depression. The real one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking into skylights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While you\u0027re at it you ought to try a crystal ball.\" Ben stuck his hands in the pockets of his jacket. \"Let\u0027s have a look inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have a key yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus.\" With a mutter, Ben walked up three broken concrete steps, pulled out his wallet, and found a credit card. The pitiful lock gave without complaint. \"I feel like I should carry you over the threshold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get your own house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall was full of cobwebs and droppings from assorted rodents. The wallpaper had faded to gray. A fat, hard-backed beetle crawled lazily across it. \"When does Vincent Price come down the steps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd glanced around and saw a castle in the rough. \"It just needs a good cleaning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And an exterminator. Are there rats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the basement, I imagine,\" Ed said carelessly, and walked into what had once been a charming parlor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was narrow and high ceilinged, with the openings of what would be two five-foot windows boarded up. The stone of the fireplace was intact, but someone had ripped out the mantel. The floors, under a coating of dust and grime, might very well have been oak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ed, this place-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrific potential. The kitchen has a brick oven built into the wall. You know what bread tastes like out of a brick oven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t buy a house to bake bread.\" Ben walked back into the hall, watching the floor for any signs of life. \"Christ, there\u0027s a hole in the ceiling back here. It\u0027s fucking four feet wide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s first on my list,\" Ed commented as he came to join him. They stood for a moment in silence, looking up at the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not talking about a list. You\u0027re talking about a lifetime commitment.\" As they watched, a spider the size of a man\u0027s thumb dropped down and landed at their feet with a noticeable plop. More than a little disgusted, Ben kicked it aside. \"You can\u0027t be serious about this place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I am. A man gets to a point he wants to settle down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t take me seriously about getting married too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A place of his own,\" Ed continued placidly. \"A workroom, maybe a little garden. There\u0027s a good spot for herbs in the back. A place like this would give me a goal. I figure on fixing up one room at a time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll take you fifty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got nothing better to do. Want to see upstairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen took another look at the hole. \"No, I want to live. How much?\" he asked flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventy-five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seventy-five? Seventy-five thousand? Dollars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real estates at a premium in Georgetown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Georgetown? Christ on a raft, this isn\u0027t Georgetown.\" Something bigger than the spider skuddled in the corner. He reached for his weapon. \"The first rat I see is going to eat this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a field mouse.\" Ed put a soothing hand on Ben\u0027s shoulder. \"Rats stick to the basement or the attic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, do they have a lease?\" But he left his weapon secured. \"Listen, Ed, the realtors and developers push back the borders so they can call this Georgetown and take idiots like you for seventy-five-thousand dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only offered seventy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s different. You only offered seventy.\" He started to pace but ran into a magnificent cobweb. Swearing, he fought himself free. \"Ed, it\u0027s those sunflower seeds. You need red meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You feel responsible.\" Ed smiled, terrifically pleased before he strolled into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t.\" Ben jammed his hands into his pockets. \"Yes, dammit, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the yard. My yard.\" Ed pointed out when Ben trailed after him. \"I figure I can grow basil, some rosemary, maybe some lavender in that little spot right outside the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen saw a patch of knee-high grass nearly wide enough for two swipes of a lawn mower. \"You\u0027ve been working too hard. This case is making us all loony. Ed, listen carefully to these words, see if they ring a bell. Dry rot. Termites. Vermin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to be thirty-six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never owned a house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, everybody\u0027s going to be thirty-six once, but not everybody has to own a house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit, I never even lived in one. We always had apartments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen smelled of decades of grease, but this time Ben said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s an attic. The kind you see in shows where there\u0027re trunks and old furniture and funny hats. I like that. I\u0027m going to do the kitchen first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen stared out at the pitiful clump of grass. \"Steam,\" he said. \"That\u0027s the best way to strip this old wallpaper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Ben pulled out a cigarette and grinned. \"You\u0027re going to need plenty of it. I dated this woman who worked at a paint store. Marli... yeah, I think her name was Marli. She\u0027d probably still give me a discount.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Date anyone who works at a lumberyard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll check. Come on, I have to make a call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped at a phone booth a few miles away. Ben found a quarter and dialed Tess\u0027s office number while Ed went into the 7-Eleven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Court\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective Paris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Detective, just a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a click, then silence, then another click. \"Ben?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you, Doc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\" As she spoke she was clearing her desk. \"Just on my way out to the clinic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time do you finish there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usually five-thirty, maybe six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at his watch and shifted the rest of his schedule. \"Fine. I\u0027ll pick you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t need-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. Who\u0027s on you today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s watching you at the office?\" Ben explained, and tried to find a corner in the phone booth where the wind wouldn\u0027t reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Sergeant Billings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" He cupped his hands around a match as he lit a cigarette, and wished like hell he\u0027d remembered his gloves. \"Have Billings drive you to the clinic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence. In it he heard her temper, and was tempted to smile at it. \"I don\u0027t see any reason why I can\u0027t drive myself to the clinic as I\u0027ve done every week for the last several years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not asking you to see a reason, Tess. I\u0027ve got plenty of them. See you at six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up, knowing she\u0027d hold the phone, and her temper, until she could replace it quietly. She wouldn\u0027t want to do something as childish, and typical, as slamming it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, tess counted backward from five, slowly, then quietly replaced the receiver. She\u0027d hardly set it down when Kate buzzed her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" It took effort not to bite the word off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have another call on line two. He won\u0027t give his name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, I-\" The nerves in her stomach tangled, and she knew. \"I\u0027ll take it, Kate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the slowly blinking button. Her finger was steady when she pushed it. \"This is Dr. Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you in church. You came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" The instructions she\u0027d been given raced through her head. Try to keep him on the line. Keep him calm and on the line. \"I was hoping to see you there so we could talk again. How are you feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were there. Now you understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understand the greatness.\" His voice was calm. A decision reached, faith confirmed. \"The sacrifices we\u0027re asked to make are so small compared to the rewards of obedience. I\u0027m glad you were there, so that you understand. I had doubts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of doubts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the mission.\" His voice dropped, as if even whispering of doubt was a sin. \"But not anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess took a chance. \"Where is Laura?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laura.\" She could hear the tears. \"Laura waits in purgatory, suffering, until I atone for her sins. She\u0027s my responsibility. She has no one but me and the Blessed Mother to intercede for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Laura was dead. Now she could be sure of it. \"You must have loved her very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was the best part of me. We were joined before birth. Now I must make restitution for her before we can be joined after death. You understand now. You came. Your soul will join the others. I will absolve you in the name of the Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t kill again. Laura wouldn\u0027t want you to kill again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence... three, four, five seconds. \"I thought you understood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess recognized the tone, the accusation, the betrayal. She was going to lose him. \"I think I do. If I don\u0027t, I need you to explain things to me. I want to understand, I want you to help me understand. That\u0027s why I want to come talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s lies. You\u0027re full of sin and lies.\" She heard him begin to mumble the Lord\u0027s Prayer before the connection was broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen ben walked back into the squad room, Lowenstein was standing by her desk. She signaled to him, cradling the phone against her ear so her hands would be free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She can\u0027t keep away from me,\" Ben told Ed. He started to slip an arm around her, not aiming for her waist, but for the bag of chocolate-covered raisins on her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He called Court again,\" Lowenstein told him. His hand froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call came through at 11:21.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The trace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" She lifted a pad from her desk and handed it to him. \"They pinned it to that area. Had to be within those four blocks. Goldman said she did real good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, we were just there.\" He tossed the pad back on her desk. \"We might have driven right past him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The captain\u0027s sent out Bigsby, Mullendore, and some uniforms to comb the area and look for witnesses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll give them a hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben. Ben, wait.\" He stopped, turning back with impatience. Lowenstein pressed the mouthpiece of the phone against her shoulder. \"They\u0027re sending up a transcript of the call for the captain. I think you\u0027ll want to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, I\u0027ll read it when I get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ll want to see it now, Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours\u0027 work at the Donnerly Clinic was enough to take Tess\u0027s mind off her own nerves. The patients there ranged from manic-depressive businessmen to street junkies who were withdrawing. Once a week, twice if her schedule permitted, she came to the clinic to work with the staff doctors. Some of the patients she would only see once or twice, others she would see week after week, month after month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave her time there, when she could, because it wasn\u0027t an elite hospital where the rich came when their problems or addictions became too much to cope with. Neither was it a street-side clinic run by idealists on a shoestring. It was a struggling and capable institution which took in the emotionally and mentally ill from all walks of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a woman on the second floor with Alzheimer\u0027s disease who sewed dolls for her grandchildren, then played with them herself when she forgot she had grandchildren. There was a man who thought he was John Kennedy and spent most of his day harmlessly writing speeches. The more violent patients were kept on the third floor, where security was tighter. Thick glass doors were locked and windows were barred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess spent most of the afternoon there. By five she was nearly wrung dry. For the better part of an hour she\u0027d been in session with a paranoid schizophrenic who had hurled obscenities then his lunch tray at her, before he\u0027d ultimately been restrained by two orderlies. Tess had given him an injection of Thorazine herself, but not without regret. He\u0027d be on medication for the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was quiet again, Tess left him to catch a few moments of quiet in the staff lounge. She still had one more patient to see: Lydia Woods, a thirty-seven-year-old woman who had run a household with three children, held down a full-time job as a stock broker, and worked as president of the PTA. She had cooked gourmet meals, attended every school function, and had been named Businesswoman of the Year. The new woman, who could have and handle it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo months before, she had fallen violently apart at a school play. There had been convulsions, and a seizure many of the horrified parents had taken for epilepsy. When she\u0027d been taken to the hospital it was discovered she\u0027d been in a withdrawal as serious as one from heroin addiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia Woods had held together her perfect world with Valium and alcohol until her husband had threatened divorce. To prove her strength, she\u0027d gone cold turkey and had ignored her physical reactions in a desperate attempt to keep her life as she had structured it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, though the physical illness was well under control, she was being forced to deal with the causes, and the results.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess took the elevator down to the first floor, where she requested Lydia\u0027s file. After studying it, Tess tucked it under her arm. Her room was at the end of the hall. Lydia had left the door open, but Tess knocked before going in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curtains were drawn, the room dim. There were flowers beside the bed, pink carnations. Their scent was light and sweet and hopeful. Lydia herself was on the bed, curled up to face the blank wall. She didn\u0027t acknowledge Tess\u0027s presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Lydia.\" Tess set the file on a small table and glanced around the room. The clothes Lydia had worn the day before were heaped in a corner. \"It\u0027s dark in here,\" she said, and moved to the curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess glanced at the figure on the bed. It was time to push. \"I don\u0027t,\" she said simply, then drew the curtain open. When light spilled in, Lydia rolled over and glared. She hadn\u0027t bothered with her hair and makeup. There was a drawn, bitter look around her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is. From what I hear you\u0027ve been spending too much time alone in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what the hell are you supposed to do around this place? Weave baskets with the fruits and nuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might try going for a walk on the grounds.\" Tess sat, but didn\u0027t touch the file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t belong here. I don\u0027t want to be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re free to go any time.\" Tess watched her sit up and light a cigarette. \"This isn\u0027t a prison, Lydia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy for you to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You signed yourself in. When you feel you\u0027re ready, you can sign yourself out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia said nothing, smoking in brooding silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see your husband was in to see you yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia glanced at the flowers, then away. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you feel about seeing him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I loved it,\" she snapped. \"I loved having him come in here to see me looking like this.\" She grabbed a handful of her unwashed hair. \"I told him he should bring the kids so they can see what a pitiful hag their mother is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know he was coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a shower in there. Shampoo, makeup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you the one who said I was hiding behind things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Using prescription drugs and alcohol as a crutch isn\u0027t the same as making the effort to look nice for your husband. You wanted him to see you this way, Lydia. Why, so he\u0027d go away feeling sorry for you? Guilty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe arrow hit home and started the blaze, as she\u0027d hoped. \"Just shut up. It\u0027s none of your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did your husband bring you those flowers? They\u0027re lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLydia looked at them again. They made her want to cry, lose the edge of bitterness and failure that was her defense now. Picking up the vase, she hurled it and the flowers against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom out in the hall where he\u0027d been told to wait, Ben heard the crash. He was out of his chair and heading toward the open door when a nurse stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, sir, you really can\u0027t go in. Dr. Court\u0027s with a patient.\" Blocking his way, she went to the door herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Mrs. Rydel.\" Ben heard Tess\u0027s voice, cool and unruffled. \"Would you bring a dustpan and a mop so Mrs. Woods can clean this up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t!\" Lydia shouted at her. \"It\u0027s my room and I won\u0027t clean it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027d be careful where I walked, so I didn\u0027t cut my feet on the glass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate you.\" When Tess didn\u0027t even wince, Lydia shouted it more loudly. \"I hate you! Did you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I hear you very well. But I wonder if you\u0027re shouting at me, Lydia, or yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who the hell do you think you are?\" Her hand worked up and down like a jack hammer to crush out her cigarette. \"You come in here week after week with your smug self-righteous looks and your pretty, upscale suits and wait for me to strip my soul. Well, I won\u0027t. Do you think I want to talk to some ice maiden who has her life all worked out? Miss Perfect Society who treats basket cases as a hobby then goes to her just-so home and forgets about them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t forget about them, Lydia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess\u0027s voice was quiet, a direct contrast, but in the hall, Ben heard it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You make me sick.\" Lydia heaved herself off the bed for the first time that day. \"I can\u0027t stand the sight of you with your Italian shoes and little gold pins and that \u0027I never sweat\u0027 perfection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not perfect, Lydia, none of us is. None of us has to be to earn love and respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tears started, but Tess didn\u0027t rise to offer comfort. It wasn\u0027t time. \"What do you know about mistakes? What the hell do you know about how I lived? Dammit, I made things work, I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you did. But nothing works forever if you refuse to allow for flaws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was as good as you. I was better. I had clothes like yours, and a home. I hate you for coming in here and reminding me. Get out. Just get out and leave me alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Tess rose, taking the file with her. \"I\u0027ll be back next week. Sooner, if you ask for me.\" She walked to the door and turned. \"You still have a home, Lydia.\" The nurse stood in the doorway, holding the dustpan and mop. Tess took them and set them against the inside wall. \"I\u0027ll have them send down a fresh vase for those flowers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess walked out the door and shut her eyes a moment. That kind of violent dislike, even when it came from illness and not from the heart, was never easy to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess shook herself back and opened her eyes. Ben was there, a few steps away. \"You\u0027re early.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He came to her and wrapped a hand around her arm. \"What the hell are you doing in a place like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My job. You\u0027ll have to wait a minute. I have to enter some things in this file.\" She walked down to the nurses\u0027 station, checked her watch, and began to write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen watched her. Right now she seemed totally unaffected by the nasty little scene he\u0027d overheard. Her face was calm as she wrote in what he was sure was a very professional hand. But he\u0027d seen that one quick unguarded moment when she\u0027d stepped into the hall. Not unaffected, but impossibly controlled. He didn\u0027t like it, just as he didn\u0027t like this place with its clean white walls and blank, miserable faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed the file back to the nurse, in an undertone said a few things he assumed referred to the woman who\u0027d just berated her, then glanced at her watch again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry you had to wait,\" Tess said when she came back. \"I have to get my coat. Why don\u0027t you meet me outside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came out, he was standing at the edge of the grass, smoking steadily. \"You never gave me a chance on the phone to tell you I didn\u0027t want you to bother with all this. I\u0027ve been getting myself to and from the clinic for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped the cigarette and carefully crushed it. \"Why did you take all that crap from her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess drew a long breath before she linked her arm with his. \"Where are you parked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s psychiatrist shit, answering questions with questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes, it is. Look, if she didn\u0027t attack me, I wouldn\u0027t be doing my job. It\u0027s the first time we\u0027ve really gotten anywhere since I\u0027ve started seeing her. Now, where are you parked? It\u0027s cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over here.\" More than happy to leave the clinic behind, he began to walk with her. \"He called you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, right after you did.\" She wanted badly to treat that with the same professional ease she had the patients in the clinic. \"Were they able to trace it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Narrowed it down to a couple blocks. No one saw anything. We\u0027re still working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His Laura is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured that much out.\" He put his hand on the car door, then released it again. \"The same way I figured out you\u0027re his next target.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t grow pale or shudder. He hadn\u0027t expected her to. She simply nodded, accepting, then put her hand on his arm. \"Would you do me a favor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can give it a shot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not talk about it tonight. At all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tess-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please. I have to go to the station with you tomorrow and meet with Captain Harris. Isn\u0027t that soon enough to hash all this over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put cold, ungloved hands on her face. \"I\u0027m not going to let anything happen to you. I don\u0027t care what I have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, lifting her hands to his wrist. \"Then I don\u0027t have anything to worry about, do I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I care about you,\" he said carefully. It was as close to a declaration as he\u0027d ever come with a woman. \"I want you to know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then take me home, Ben.\" She turned her lips into his palm. \"And show me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sacred-sins/page-12.html","bookId":2413,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:02 AM"}
