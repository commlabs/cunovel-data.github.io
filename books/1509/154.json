He focused his power through him, following it as it filled every corner of his body. He watched carefully for signs of injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth this was his third check, and so far he was surprised to find not a hint of trouble. No wounds, no hidden dangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like he was reborn! Without any training or cultivation, he was back to peak condition with only a few hours’ rest. What’s more, he felt like he may have even gotten stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA breakthrough? Once an Adept got to ninth level, each subsequent improvement came with a considerable leap in power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt as though even his Discipline was gentler, that was the greatest indication. Thunderbolt and lightning were well known as among the more destructive and explosive Disciplines. However, as the Adept’s power grew he was able to distill the Discipline in to liquid form. This would stabilize it without sacrificing any power. This was, in truth, the goal he’d been chasing for ages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking the jump from ninth level six rank to ninth level seventh rank was like traversing a glorious threshold. It was important not just due to the effect it had on an Adept on his road to perfection. It was also the bane of many a Talent with dreams of being a Paragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue was indeed happy with the discovery, but he had his doubts about the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phylactery stone embedded in his hand was an s-rank gem, and for good reason. Still it’s benefits did not lie in improving or enhancing an Adept’s powers. So if not the gem, then the Doctor. The young man brought him back from the brink of death, \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e improved his overall ability. But that would be incredible, miraculous in fact. Then could this mean that the jump in power came from him alone? No – no, it couldn’t be that simple. No matter how he tried there were no more answers forthcoming from either the Wine Master or the Doctor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also wasn’t wise or proper to interrogate them further. The Wine Master alone must have expended an obscene number of power gems to come to his rescue. That was the only way he’d able to stride from one planet to another like he claimed. Hell, the only time he’d ever heard of anything like that being performed before was in old stories!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of the how, the fact of the matter was he \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e stronger. And now, that meant things could stabilize. Even better, his physical condition was better than ever. Before, where his meridians glowed with only a dull gold light, now they shone brilliantly. This was a change Lan Jue only expected at around ninth level ninth rank. His bones and organs weren’t spared the metamorphosis either. He felt like he’d not only survived, but came out like a jackpot winner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eKnock knock knock!\u003c/em\u003e The gentle sounds of someone rapping on the door filled the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden aura around Lan Jue slowly dissipated. He stood and pulled open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiuxiu’s pretty face greeted him. When she saw him in his pajamas, her face adopted a sense of concern. “Boss, are you alright?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe answered with a smile. “Take it easy, I’m fine. In fact, I’m better than fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe uncertainty melted from her face, replaced with a sweet smile. “That’s good. The Wine Master asked that I invite you to visit him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue nodded. “Alright, I’ll go meet him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And we got your communicator repaired,” she continued, handing it to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue snapped it to his wrist and beamed her a smile. “Xiuxiu, ever so thoughtful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes glanced down to the screen, where he discovered no small number of messages; Chu Cheng, Hua Li, Wu Junyi, Jin Yan and others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChu Cheng’s message was something about helping Hua Li prepare for his concert – though God only knew what that waste of space was doing to ‘help.’ Wu Junyi was asking over his health, imploring he take a few more days of rest and reorganization before returning to class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHua Li’s message contained specific information concerning the concert. Three days from now, or so the message assured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me go change,” Lan Jue said after reading through them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Uh, and boss… maybe by the way take a shower,” Xiuxiu replied softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh…? Do I have a scent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he ever. In fact, he hadn’t washed himself since getting back from Taihua. He’d been focusing primarily on getting better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe familiar chime of Zeus’ Jewelry Store rang as a refreshed and put-together Lan Jue exited the store. He wore a blue shirt and black pants, and walked down the avenue with an agile gait. The fresh air was revitalizing. He stopped long enough to take a deep, long breath so that it filled every part of him before making his way towards the Gothic Winery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the door open and stepped inside. He was greeted by Eva, who smiled welcomingly. “Ah, we’ve been expecting you, Jewelry Master. The Wine Master is in the tasting room waiting for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright.” He nodded, then made his way inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, the Wine Master was clad in a brown formal suit. He sat quietly at the head of the tasting room’s giant table. A bottle of red wine waited in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue walked to his side without any pomp or ceremony, pulled out a chair, and took a seat. He glowered disappointedly at his host. “Just one bottle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man shot him a disapproving glance. “And when do you plan on delivering that Conti you owe me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue blinked. “Owe you? You were being serious?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think,” came the Paragon’s answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger man chortled sheepishly, revealing a row of pearly white teeth. “I guess I owe so much it’s just not registering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wine Master reacted with a smile of his own. “No rush. In fact, you may just have an opportunity to pay it all back. We’ll talk about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your punishment, of course,” the Wine Master replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Punishment?” Lan Jue was genuinely taken by surprise. “Why am I being punished?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wine Master glowered through his explanation. “Because your antics nearly cost Skyfire Avenue dearly. Do \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e think something like that warrants punishment? The cost in powergems that were consumed for me to teleport to another planet you can owe me, we’ll call it part of the job, but your carelessness almost led to the death of a Skyfire Councilman. That must be answered for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue smirked. “Somehow I feel like I’m going to end up owing you something else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think this is something disregarded to easily,” the Wine Master asked. “Ever since you decided to become a Councilman, you became part of a team. Sometimes being a team member means receiving, but it also means you’re available to back the others up when they need it. Otherwise what’s the point is Skyfire Avenue? Our organization is loosely established, yes, but we help and protect every Adept under our collective wing. As for this recent matter, if you’d have informed us right away of the situation on Skyfire I’d have made my way there at once. You wouldn’t have needed to take that decoction, and all of this trouble could have been avoided [1. He has a damn point, doesn’t he!]. And even more lives could have been saved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue listened in silence, his face becoming serious as the gravity of his decision became clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wine Master went on. “In the future I hope you remember your role. If there is a problem you can’t handle on your own, the first thing you should do is call on the Avenue. We’ll do all we can to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue’s serious countenance broke in to an appreciative grin. “I hadn’t expected someone to almost literally move space and time to deal with this. I honestly didn’t expect the Avenue to react any faster than the East’s reinforcements. I thought the only option was for me to face it on my own. Still you’re right, and in the future I’ll certainly let the Avenue know first thing, if there’s a problem I can’t handle. I’ll accept any punishment you deem necessary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wine Master nodded approvingly. “In this aspect at least, you’re a reputable man. Too impulsive on occasion, but your ability to learn and self-direction are a step above our average member. It\u0027s important that we recognize our own failings, and work to correct them. Once our little discussion is finished, we’ll begin by revoking your status as a Councilman. You’ll be put on suspension. In addition, when the Avenue comes calling for assistance you must offer it unconditionally. If and when that happens, you’ll regain your Council seat upon completion of the task.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well,” Lan Jue agreed without hesitation. “By the way, Wine Master, how is the Doctor doing? Unfortunately, I don’t have any s-ranked gems on hand to offer in payment. It may be a little while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not something you need to worry about just now,” the Wine Master replied. \"The Avenue will see to compensating him for his time and effort. It was necessary for what we needed, and so the Avenue will assume responsibility for the cost in your place. If you still feel the need to repay him, you can when you have a power gem of suitable quality to offer. Or perhaps you can give him a cut of your store’s revenue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue thought about it for a moment. “Allow me to handle this myself. The store is being taken care of largely by Mika and the other girls, and they hold sixty percent of the stock. I can’t simply make a decision without their input. Nor can I expect them to pay my debts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Up to you,” the Wine Master answered. “There are still a few more things we need to discuss which concern you. For instance, the imminent arrival of the Dark Tower and Pontiff’s Castle’s representatives. Our most recent reports suggest the Pontiff \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e Satan might come themselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Lan Jue’s eyes widened at the information, slivers of lightning arcing behind his lids. He hadn’t forgotten the sins of the Pontiff and his people. After all, things on Taihua would have been very different if he hadn’t had been injured in his battle with Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they were coming to his home turf. It was time they had a serious discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wine Master continued. “The Keeper went himself to call on the Pontiff about what happened. Used it to coerce the Castle’s Paragon. The Pontiff came to us afterwards about diffusing the conflict. Is this something you can do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue’s brows furrowed at the thought, clearly pondering the matter. If it wasn’t for the crisis he’d encountered on Taihua, he’d absolutely refuse outright. Lan Jue wasn’t one to hold a grudge, but this was different. They had knowingly laid a trap for one of his family, planned to kill her. If he didn’t seek revenge for something like that, he couldn’t call himself Zeus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after everything that happened – after the Doctor and Wine Master spent so much to save him – his thinking changed. Skyfire Avenue’s needs were more important to him now. He had to think of things from a different point of view, now. What would benefit the Avenue most?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s more, with the events of Taihua behind him it was time to look at all things differently. At the end of the day, the Adepts of the Castle and Tower were all people. There were differences that needed handling, certainly, but in the face of this danger to all of humanity it was a small thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am willing to do this for the Avenue, and defer to the Council’s decision.” Lan Jue nodded firmly, fixing the Wine Master with his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-153\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-155\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-154","bookId":1509,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:06 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:06 AM"}
