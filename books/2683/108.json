Marina looks stunning, effortlessly inhabiting the role that will create a star; Makeup and Costume have done an unbelievable job and her hair is pulled back so tightly and in such an elegant way that I\u0027m practically squirming in my chair and then I\u0027m holding out a hand, guiding her to the table. Delicately she accepts it, as if I were helping her cross a threshold she was wary about but since I\u0027m on the other side-hey, it\u0027s okay. Introductions are made as she\u0027s seated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry I\u0027m late,\" Marina says genuinely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s okay,\" I say. \"We were having a very, very interesting and I ively conversation about...\" Stuck, I have to look over at the Wallaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Californian cuisine,\" Stephen reminds me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Champagne?\" Stephen asks Marina a little too eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Marina says as Stephen pours, and then, trying to insinuate herself immediately into the conversation, asks, \"Are we supposed to be stopping soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In about fifteen minutes,\" Stephen says, placing the champagne back in its bucket. I lift out the bottle and pour myself another glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t anybody find this odd?\" Marina asks, letting the maitre d\u0027 drape a napkin across her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the law of the sea requires vessels to help each other in times of distress,\" Stephen says. \"I don\u0027t think the QE2 is exempt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really not that much of an inconvenience,\" Lorrie says, slowly looking Marina over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how they\u0027ll find that boat in all this fog,\" Marina says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really-there\u0027s fog?\" I ask, having assumed that I had been staring at a giant gray wall but actually it\u0027s a huge window that overlooks the starboard deck. \"Whoa,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, radar is quite sophisticated these-\" Stephen starts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" Lorrie says, staring intently at Marina, \"but do we know each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina studies Lorrie. \"I\u0027m not-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, have we met?\" Lorrie asks. \"You look remarkably familiar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a model,\" I interject. \"Thass why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, it\u0027s not that,\" Lorrie says, then, gently prodding, \"Are you from New York? Could we have met there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe we have,\" Marina says, then smiles and tightly adds, \"But who knows?\" She lifts her champagne flute, brings it to her lips but doesn\u0027t sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I\u0027m sure we have,\" Lorrie murmurs, gazing. \"Positive, in fact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Marina asks with a subtle kind of panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sure we\u0027ve met,\" Lorric insists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where, darling?\" Stephen asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I can\u0027t place,\" Lorrie murmurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you in the States often?\" Marina asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut our waiter arrives and Stephen suggests we order dinner now, before the boat makes its stop, which I\u0027m all in favor of so this night can proceed elsewhere. Marina demurs, saying she really isn\u0027t that hungry. Stephen says something along the lines of \"Well, my dear, you can\u0027t order off the children\u0027s menu,\" and that\u0027s our cue to \"laugh heartily.\" First course: caviar. Second course: the girls opt for lobster medallions instead of foie gras. Third course: duck. Siephen orders two bottles of wine from the sommelier, who seems impressed by the selections. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-108.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
