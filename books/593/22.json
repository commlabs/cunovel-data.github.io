He begged a letter should be written home making light of all exaggerated rumors, and that he should be moved to his own home; but heavy cold and wrenched nerves and bitter memories were poor aids to health in his big empty house, where Susan stood guard over him and Bill kept watch in the kitchen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The doctor went to see him and the professor. Two weeks went by, and the doctor was first surprised and then discouraged. Driving in from one of his visits he saw the professor on the sidewalk. He drew rein.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How is Edward?\" asked the professor quickly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The doctor shifted the reins he held carelessly. \"So, so,\" he said lightly, \"not so well as I thought he would be by this time; it\u0027s dull out there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 279]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The professor was listening, an anxious furrow down his forehead. \"I will take him out some magazines.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hm!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And—what do you think he needs?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Company, I guess. Helen\"—Mrs. Randall—\"wants to go out. Every time I go I have so many other visits to make I cannot manage it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll take her!\" eagerly interrupted the professor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Suppose you do. Beautiful weather,\" the doctor wandered on aimlessly; \"feels like spring.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The professor listened impatiently; he was hurried, and had no time for weather comments.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s a honeysuckle in bloom out there!\" he pulled a great sprig of it carelessly out of his button-hole, \"it\u0027s sweet, smell it!\" The professor sniffed at it disdainfully and handed it back. He felt it a travesty that two of the busiest men in the neighborhood should be standing on the busiest street of the town, its life surging[Pg 280] about them, talking of spring weather and honeysuckle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give it to Frances!\" and then, as if in afterthought, \"take her out too!\" He had made some curious prescriptions in his practice; \"It will cheer him up!\" And he was off at once, driving rapidly down the street, chuckling to himself as he looked back at the professor still standing there, honeysuckle in hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Take the doctor\u0027s wife out, and Frances? Why not? The doctor\u0027s wife was anxiously willing; the professor was half angered that Frances was not; only he gave scant heed to her indecision. \"We are going this afternoon,\" he said; \"if you have anything you think he would like to eat, fix it up for him,\" and Frances was forced to hide her reluctance in active preparation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The professor was worried, too, to notice, once they were there—and the joy of their host was pathetic to see in his white, worn face—how few words Frances had to say of their thankfulness at his recovery. He had been looking after the affairs of the farm on[Pg 281] each visit he made. When he got up to go out to a distant field Susan saw him. She had been talking to Mrs. Randall, who was busied in the storeroom putting away the custards and jellies she had brought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Marse Robert,\" Susan called, soon as she had nearly caught up with his rapid steps half way across the orchard. \"Marse Robert, Ise comin\u0027 back soon as Marse Edward is well. He is well \u0027nuff now!\" she sniffed, remembering some of his crossness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The professor stood looking down on the ground. \"Susan,\" he said, when she had finished, \"I\u0027ll come for you when you are ready. As long as I have a home, there\u0027s a place for you; but I tell you now, I will not have Bill hanging around!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bill!\" the old woman\u0027s big black eyes flashed. \"He\u0027s gwine git married.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In the name of sense who will have him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She!\" Susan pointed with dramatic forefinger to the narrow high window of the basement kitchen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She— Why—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 282]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s ten years older dan he is if she\u0027s a day, but Bill say she can cook to beat de ban\u0027!\" The slang slipped glibly from the old woman\u0027s tongue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s he going to do?\" asked the professor, after a moment\u0027s astonished silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"First, he \u0027lowed as how he wanted me to give him de cabin, but, Marse Robert, I suttenly didn\u0027t want to, an\u0027 while I was projictin\u0027 roun\u0027 in my min\u0027 \u0027bout it, Marse Edward he want to know if Bill won\u0027t come hyar to work.

The professor flushed, turned as if to go back, but turned fieldward again. Doubtless Mrs. Randall would be there even now. \"Go on, Susan, into the house,\" he commanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Susan went into the kitchen. If that young man up there wanted to say anything[Pg 283] and ease his mind, she swore she would give him a chance; maybe he would be more peaceable if she did. She sat down by the kitchen fire quite unmindful of the fact she was spoiling the love-making Bill was clumsily striving at, while he smelled the chicken steaming and the hot rolls baking for the early supper, which Montague had ordered soon as he had caught sight of his guests.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When she heard Mrs. Randall\u0027s slow footstep up the stair and hurried up the other way, she found her charm had worked; her patient was peaceable as a lamb.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On Frances\u0027 face was a look it warmed the heart of the old woman to see,—the flushed, faint flickerings of the beginnings of a great happiness.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2276/63872.html","bookId":593,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:18:39 AM"}
