They won\u0027t use the rock shore and they can\u0027t use the cliffs. I\u0027ll meet them there.” He glanced down at Vorbis. “Someone should.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can\u0027t mean you want to go by yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten thousand won\u0027t be sufficient.

It May Be That I Cannot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha was already halfway across the Place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, we\u0027re not deserting him,” said Simony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIV. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm watched them go, too. And then he was alone, except for the thousands watching him, crammed around the edges of the great square. He wished he knew what to say to them. That\u0027s why he needed people like Brutha.

You Stand Before Your God And Look For Business Opportunities?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We-ell,” said Dhblah, \"we could come to an arrangement. Strike while the iron is hot, as the inquisitors say. Haha. Twenty percent? How about it?

Just trying to make both ends hummus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eX. Tortoises Are To Be Left Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDhblah put his head on one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doesn\u0027t sing, does it?” he said. \"But . . . tortoise necklaces . . . hmm . . . brooches, of course.

Incidentally, you couldn\u0027t make a statue wobble every now and again, could you? Very good for business wobbling statues. The statue of Ossory wobbles eve; Fast of Ossory, reg\u0027lar. By means of a small piston device operated in the basement, it is said. But very good for the prophets, all the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXII. You Make me Laugh, Little Prophet.

There was a brief thunderclap. Dhblah looked reflectively at his sketches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . . but I suppose I\u0027ll have to take the little figure off them,” he said, more or less to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shade of Vorbis looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. The desert,” he said. The black sand was absolutely still under the starlit sky. It looked cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t planned on dying yet. In fact . . . he couldn\u0027t quite remember how he\u0027d died . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The desert,” he repeated, and this time there was a hint of uncertainty. He\u0027d never been uncertain about anything in his . . . life. The feeling was unfamiliar and terrifying. Did ordinary people feel like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got a grip on himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath was impressed. Very few people managed this, managed to hold on to the shape of their old thinking after death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath took no pleasure in his job. It was an emotion he found hard to grasp. But there was such a thing as satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So,” said Vorbis. “The desert. And at the end of the desert??”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJUDGEMENT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis tried to concentrate. He couldn\u0027t. He could feel certainty draining away. And he\u0027d always been certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, like a man opening a door to a familiar room and finding nothing there but a bottomless pit. The memories were still there. He could feel them. They had the right shape. It was just that he couldn\u0027t remember what they were. There had been a voice . . . . Surely, there had been a voice? But all he could remember was the sound of his own thoughts, bouncing off the inside of his own head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he had to cross the desert. What could there be to fear? The desert was what you believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis looked inside himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd went on looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sagged to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE BUSY, said Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t leave me! It\u0027s so empty!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath looked around at the endless desert. He snapped his fingers and a large white horse trotted up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI SEE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE, he said, swinging himself into the saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where? Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHERE. WITH YOU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can\u0027t see them!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath gathered up the reins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNEVERTHELESS, he said. His horse trotted forward a few steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t understand!” screamed Vorbis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath paused. YOU HAVE PERHAPS HEARD THE PHRASE, he said, THAT HELL IS OTHER PEOPLE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Yes, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath nodded. IN TIME, he said, YOU WILL LEARN THAT IT IS WRONG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first boats grounded in the shallows, and the troops leapt into shoulder-high surf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was quite sure who was leading the fleet. Most of the countries along the coast hated one another, not in any personal sense, but simply on a kind of historical basis. On the other hand, how much leadership was necessary? Everyone knew where Omnia was. None of the countries in the fleet hated the others worse than they did Omnia. Now it was necessary for it . . . not to exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Argavisti of Ephebe considered that he was in charge, because although he didn\u0027t have the most ships he was avenging the attack on Ephebe. But Imperiator Borvorius of Tsort knew that he was in charge, because there were more Tsortean ships than any others. And Admiral Rham-ap-Efan of Djelibeybi knew that he was in charge, because he was the kind of person who always thought he was in charge of anything. The only captain who did not, in fact, think that he was commanding the fleet was Fasta Benj, a fisherman from a very small nation of marsh-dwelling nomads of whose existence all the other countries were in complete ignorance, and whose small reed boat had been in the path of the fleet and had got swept along. Since his tribe believed that there were only fifty-one people in the world, worshiped a giant newt, spoke a very personal language which no one else understood, and had never seen metal or fire before, he was spending a lot of time wearing a puzzled grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly they had reached a shore, not of proper mud and reeds, but of very small gritty bits. He lugged his little reed boat up the sand, and sat down with interest to see what the men in the feathery hats and shiny fish-scale vests were going to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Argavisti scanned the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They must have seen us coming,” he said. “So why would they let us establish a beachhead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat haze wavered over the dunes. A dot appeared, growing and contracting in the shimmering air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore troops poured ashore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Argavisti shaded his eyes against the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fella\u0027s just standing there,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could be a spy,” said Borvorius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t see how he could be a spy in his own country,” said Argavisti. “Anyway, if he was a spy he\u0027d be creepin\u0027 around. That\u0027s how you can tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure had stopped at the foot of the dunes. There was something about it that drew the eye. Argavisti had faced many an opposing army, and this was normal. One patiently waiting figure was not. He found he kept turning to look at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“S\u0027carrying something,” he said eventually. “Sergeant? Go and bring that man here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later the sergeant returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Says he\u0027ll meet you in the middle of the beach, sir,” he reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn\u0027t I tell you to bring him here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn\u0027t want to come, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ve got a sword, haven\u0027t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yessir. Prodded him a bit, but he dint want to move, sir. And he\u0027s carrying a dead body, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On a battlefield? It\u0027s not bring-your-own, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And . . . sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Says he\u0027s probably the Cenobiarch, sir. Wants to talk about a peace treaty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, he does? Peace treaty? We know about peace treaties with Omnia. Go and tell . . . no. Take a couple of men and bring him here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha walked back between the soldiers, through the organized pandemonium of the camp. I ought to feel afraid, he thought. I was always afraid in the Citadel. But not now. This is through fear and out the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOccasionally one of the soldiers would give him a push. It\u0027s not allowed for an enemy to walk freely into a camp, even if he wants to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was brought before a trestle table, behind which sat half a dozen large men in various military styles,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand one small olive-skinned man who was gutting a fish and grinning hopefully at everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, now,” said Argavisti, “Cenobiarch of Omnia, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha dropped Vorbis\u0027s body on to the sand. Their gaze followed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know him- said Borvorius. ”Vorbis! Someone killed him at last, eh? And will you stop trying to sell me fish? Does anyone know who this man is?\" he added, indicating Fasta Benj.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a tortoise,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was it? Not surprised. Never did trust them, always creeping around. Look, I said no fish! He\u0027s not one of mine, I know that. Is he one of yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArgavisti waved a hand irritably. “Who sent you, boy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one. I came by myself. But you could say I come from the future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you a philosopher? Where\u0027s your sponge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ve come to wage war on Omnia. This would not be a good idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From Omnia\u0027s point of view, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From everyone\u0027s. You will probably defeat us. But not all of us. And then what will you do? Leave a garrison? For ever? And eventually a new generation will retaliate. Why you did this won\u0027t mean anything to them. You\u0027ll be the oppressors. They\u0027ll fight. They might even win. And there\u0027ll be another war. And one day people will say: why didn\u0027t they sort it all out, back then? On the beach. Before it all started. Before all those people died. Now we have that chance. Aren\u0027t we lucky?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-45.html","bookId":1629,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM"}
