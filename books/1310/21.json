We ain’t finding any fault with you for not doing it on your own hook, ’cause you’re a stickler for what you think’s your duty.

I’ve been in ships, man and boy, for thirty years, and this is the first time any one ever accused me of mutiny. We just think we know what ought to be done and are goin’ ahead and doin’ it. You’ll be able to tell the cap’n, when you next see him, that you couldn’t help yourself.

Oh, you’re a nice lot, you are! If you know when you’re well off, you’ll haul that don out of135 the conning tower and put him in double irons; then you’ll let Bob and me out of here and obey orders. It’s not too late yet to undo the trouble you’ve caused. Just let that bounce around in your head for a while and see what you make of it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We’re in this thing now, and we’re going to hang to it,” was the dogged response.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gaines turned away and the two chums could hear him moving off.

There were small ventilators for admitting fresh air, but these were no larger than loopholes.

And now to have the captain run the risk of losing a sale through the misguided and utterly unwarranted action of Speake, Clackett, and Gaines was a hard thing to bear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet Bob could see no way out of the difficulty.

The steady song of the cylinders had given way to an ineffectual popping, and he knew that something had137 gone wrong.
