It’s impossible not to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, because I know he fucks me in his head tons of times when he can’t do it physically. And I do the same, of course. I bet even a nun who saw him would do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling mischievous, I slide my fingers under his T-shirt and feel the bumps of his eight-pack, savoring the feel of his skin under my fingertips. I worship everything about the human body. Not only because I’m a sports rehab specialist, but because I used to be an athlete and I absolutely marvel what our bodies can do, how they endure when pushed, how they kick into gear with innate mechanisms for mating and survival. . . . But I can fiercely love the human body, and yet Remy’s body is my ultimate church. I can’t even explain in words what it does to my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All the girls undress you when you fight,” I tell him, and my smile fades as a little jealousy seeps in. “It makes me insecure you picked me out of the crowd.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I knew you were for me. Solely, exclusively, for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body instantly tightens at the words, so sexy when combined with that confident smile he wears. “I am,” I agree, looking into those dancing blue eyes. “And now I don’t know what I want to kiss most, you or your dimples?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dimples fade, and so do the lights in his eyes as he reaches out to rub my lower lip. “Me. Always me first. Then the rest of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lower lip feels warm and deliciously massaged by his thumb as the attendants finish loading the luggage and shut the plane door, and I’m vaguely aware that the team is talking in their seats, for I hear my own eager whisper, “Let me power down my phone for takeoff. . . . But you definitely owe me a morning kiss. Even if it’s noon.” I nod at him in warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chuckle is low, and I feel it roll all over my skin. “I owe you more than that, but I’ll start with your lips.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod. Remington? He kills me. He speaks casually, almost boredly saying—Yeah, I’m going to kiss you now. And my systems jack up. My blood bubbles as I start thinking about it, and I quickly pull my cell phone out of my bag to power it off when I spot a text from Melanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMELANIE: My best friend! It’s been ages and I really miss you. When are you coming home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMel! I straighten to use both hands to text back: I miss you too! So very much, Mel! But I’m so happy! I’m so fucking happy it’s not funny! Or maybe it is! See? I sound drunk! Hahaha\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMELANIE: I want a Remy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMELANIE: And a Brooke! Waaah!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBROOKE: Now that the season’s started I’ll plan a good place for you to come visit! It’s on me! Nora can come too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMELANIE: But will you still be keeping your place in Seattle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I frown at the question, because when I dropped my life and decided to follow my sex god to the ends of the earth while he kicked up his training regimen and got ready for this season, my rent hadn’t really crossed my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI text Melanie back: I’m really committed to him, Mel, so I will probably not renew my lease when it expires. My home is here now. I’m taking off, but I will text you later. I love you, Melly!!!!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMELANIE: DITTO!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn off my phone and tuck it into my bag. And when I lift my head, my sex clenches when I see Remy holding his sleek silver iPod. Thud. This man seriously knows how to seduce me with music. I watch as his thumb scrolls through the selections, and the slow, sensual manner in which it circles causes a flood of moisture between my thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at me with a devilish smile, then he reaches out and sets his headphones over my head, and I’m terribly excited when he clicks PLAY. The song starts, and penetrating, curious blue eyes stay on me, watching my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich is melting in my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd feeling my soul shudder inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the song he chose has completely made me stop breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe presses his forehead to mine as he watches me listen, and I’m so moved by this song, my hands tremble as I exchange his headphones for my earbuds and place one in my ear, and one in his, so that we both listen together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressing our foreheads back together, I watch his expression as intently as he watches mine . . . and we both listen to this amazing song. Not just any song. His song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the Goo Goo Dolls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze darkens with the same emotions burning inside me, and then he cups one side of my face in his hand. My body tightens in anticipation as he moves closer. I feel his breath bathe my face as he slowly eliminates the distance between our mouths. By the time he brushes my lips with his, I’ve already parted them and let my eyes drift shut. He brushes once, twice. Softly. Lazily. A sound escapes me, like a moan demanding he kiss me harder, but instead of hearing that, I hear this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen everything’s meant to be broken\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just want you to know who I am\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I can’t listen to this song without feeling eaten on the inside. I need to get as close as possible to him. As close as I can get. Head to toe, I crave him, every bit of me craves every bit of him. I tip my face up and press my lips lightly to his, eagerly sliding my fingers into his hair. Remy, oh god, kiss me harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes me wait a little more as he uses his hand to turn my head at an angle, and then, then, his lips finally lock over mine, his tongue tracing through the seam of my mouth until I open wider and gasp, electrified, when our tongues brush. I don’t hear his groan, but I feel it vibrate through his chest against my breasts, and I shudder as I touch my tongue to his and relax my mouth under the command of his. Because there’s no one I trust more, no one I drop all my walls with in the way they came tumbling down with this man. Stroking one hand up the side of my body, he sucks gently on my lower lip, and I feel the swelling heat between my legs. The hitching of my breath. The hardening of my nipples. The pulling sensation along my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t even know how much I needed this kiss until right now, when all my body buzzes under his mouth, and I move my lips and use my tongue to coax his tongue back in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t even know if Pete or Riley or anyone is watching; Iris is playing in our ears and our mouths are wet and hungry. He eases his fingers under my top as he sucks, suckles, probes, tastes. It seems impossible, but every quaking inch of my body feels pleasure merely from what his mouth does to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moan in need and bite him, and he loses a little control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe unsnaps my seat belt and leans me over until I’m spread all over the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music stops and another song starts, but he makes a frustrated noise when the cords get tangled between us, and he jerks our earbuds off and tosses them aside. Then he runs his eyes over my body. Suddenly, I’m no longer listening to anything except the pounding of my heart as he lowers his head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck, I want you,” he says, then I hear the slick sound of his mouth meeting mine once more. Heat blazes through my bloodstream as he takes over my mouth again. Tongues rubbing. Hands fondling. Breaths mixing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween my thighs, I’m getting so swollen, I squirm restlessly under his weight and move my mouth faster and more anxiously under his. I feel the bumps of his eight-pack under his T-shirt, and my nerves ignite as he slides the tips of his long, strong fingers under my top again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s killing me. I wanted this kiss—but now I want more. Every pore, atom, and cell heats up to supernova. Our mouths move so right together, I feel alive, expanded, loved. I love, I want, I need . . . him. So freaking much. I don’t think he will ever truly know . . . how ashamed I feel for leaving . . . how I ache for the way he hurt for me . . . how determined I am to stay with him . . . how much I really love him. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thumbs find my nipples through my bra and they feel so sensitive, the merest stroke arrows a bolt of pleasure to my toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remy, we have to stop,” I gasp, panting, while I still have a couple of neurons working in my brain. But even as I say one thing, I’m clutching his muscles and the crazy-as-hell aroused part of me doesn’t even care if we do it right here, right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m guessing he’ll go ballistic if anyone here listens to me come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe edges back a little and drags in a long, audible breath. Then, he looks at me, his eyes on fire, and kisses me again, a little rougher. He groans softly and stops, leaning his head on mine, his breath harsh in my ear. “Play me a song,” he says in a rough murmur, pulling me up to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery aware of my swollen mouth, I grab my iPod and start browsing my playlists while trying to ignore the throbbing between my thighs. “Just give me back my brain first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs and tweaks my nose. “Play me one of your sassy anti-love songs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’re so many, I don’t even know where to start.” I begin searching when he puts his thumb over mine and swiftly, he starts guiding me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got one for you. The kind you like.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice close to my ear causes pleasant little chills to rush through me. He clicks PLAY on a saucy song like the ones I like, but it’s not a girl power song at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s Kelly Clarkson’s “Dark Side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides melt when I hear the music. I love Kelly, but oh, this song. The words. Remy wants to know . . . that I will stay, that I will promise not to run away . . . ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me again, with that cocky little smile. But his eyes are not so cocky. His eyes are questioning. He wants to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when he takes my hand and laces his fingers between mine in a very boyfriend gesture that never fails to get me, I go to the ear without the earbud and tell him, “I promise. I promise, you have my heart, and you have me. You will always have me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s just no song on this earth, and no playlist big enough, to tell him that I truly love him. I love him when his eyes are black, and when his eyes are blue, and although I know—deep down—that he doesn’t believe I’m here to stay—one day, I swear one day I will make him believe me. We smile as we keep listening to this song, and when he squeezes my hand, I squeeze back, telling myself no matter what happens, I will never, ever, let go of this hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOUR PHOENIX HOTEL looks like something out of a drawing. The long, twenty-story adobe building spreads out prettily over a desert landscape, surrounded by blossoming cacti with flowers so ginormous and bright, I have the urge to go and touch—just to make sure they’re not plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the marble lobby, two teenage girls whisper and point at Remy as he passes—because of course they noticed him. You notice him like you’d notice a bull walking past you in a hotel lobby. Their gazes quickly seem to scan us—the group that came in with him—and they start checking me out next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift one of my eyebrows with an amused smile, and they seem to determine that I am probably his girlfriend, but I can’t help that my stomach does crazy twisting motions of proprietorship as they give him one last up-and-down with their starved little gazes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at those two infatuated girls! He’s always drawing eyes,” Diane tells me. “It doesn’t make you jealous?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Extremely,” I say, wrinkling my nose in disgust at my own jealousy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemy glances my way and winks as he and Pete wait for the keys, and Diane elbows me with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goodness, that man knows his own appeal!” she says. “But I wouldn’t be jealous, Brooke, the entire team feels the love between you two. We’ve never seen him like this over anyone. No matter how many women paraded through here, he still went back for you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-real-2/page-4.html","bookId":2737,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:36:31 PM"}
