Having skimmed the sugar till there remains only a small white scum, totally different from the other, which is foul and black, take it off, and strain it into the pan in which you intend to keep it for use.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n N.B. A particular attention to these rules, respecting the clarifying of sugar, will greatly conduce to the effect of the directions, which will be laid down hereafter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To boil Sugar to the Degree called Smooth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Having first clarified, put the quantity of sugar required into the preserving pan, and let it boil over the fire. You will ascertain its having boiled to the degree called smooth, by the following experiment: Dip your finger into the sugar; then put that finger and your thumb together. If in opening them you see a small thread drawn, which breaking immediately leaves a 15drop on the finger, you may conclude the sugar is boiled to the degree called smooth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To boil Sugar to the Degree called Pearled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This method of boiling sugar is thus ascertained: Take a little of the sugar when boiling, between your finger and thumb, and if on separation a string adheres to both, it is boiled to the degree called pearled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To boil Sugar to the Degree called Blown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let the sugar boil longer than on the former occasion, and make the following experiment: Dip the skimmer into the sugar; take it out immediately; and if on blowing strongly through the holes of the skimmer, little bladders appear, the sugar is boiled to the degree called blown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 16\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To boil Sugar to the Degree called Feathered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This is a higher degree of boiling sugar than either of the former. It is proved thus: Having dipped the skimmer into the sugar, and shaken it over the pan, give it a sudden flirt behind you, when, if it flies from the skimmer in particles resembling feathers, it is boiled to this degree.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To boil Sugar to the Degree called Crackled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This degree is ascertained in the following manner: The sugar having boiled somewhat longer than on the former process; dip a skewer into it, and immediately after into cold water; if on drawing the sugar from the skewer it snaps like glass, it is boiled to the degree called crackled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To boil Sugar to the Degree called Carmelled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This degree is thus ascertained: Having boiled the sugar longer still, 17dip a skewer into it, and immediately after into cold water. If the sugar be boiled to the degree called carmelled, it will snap the very instant it touches the cold water, and must be taken off directly, to prevent burning and discolouration.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2796/77364.html","bookId":1287,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:06:53 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:06:53 AM"}
