Look I\u0027ll tell you what. You just release me, and I\u0027ll be sure to pass the word around when I get back to -” Rincewind hesitated. Where the hell did demons live, anyway? “Demon City,” he said hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean Pandemonium?” said his captor suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, that\u0027s right. That\u0027s what I meant. I\u0027ll tell everyone, next time you\u0027re in the real world be sure and look up - what\u0027s your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thursley. Eric Thursley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demonologist. Midden Lane, Pseudopolis. Next door to the tannery,” said Thursley hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right you are. Don\u0027t you worry about it. Now, if you\u0027ll just let me out -”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursley\u0027s face fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re sure you really can\u0027t do it?” he said, and Rincewind couldn\u0027t help noticing the edge of pleading in his voice. “Even a small chest of gold would do. And, I mean, it needn\u0027t be the most beautiful woman in the whole of history. Second most beautiful would do. Or third. You pick any one out of, you know, the top one hundr - thousand. Whatever you\u0027ve got in stock, sort of thing.” By the end of the sentence his voice twanged with longing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind wanted to say: Look, what you should do is stop all this messing around with chemicals in dark rooms and have a shave, a haircut, a bath, make that two baths, buy yourself a new wardrobe and get out of an evening and then - but he\u0027d have to be honest, because even washed, shaved and soaked in body splash Thursley wasn\u0027t going to win any prizes - and then you could have your face slapped by any woman of your choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, it wouldn\u0027t be much, but it would be body contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursley sighed. “The kettle\u0027s on,” he said. “Would you like a cup of tea?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind stepped forward into a crackle of psychic energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” said Thursley uncertainly, as the wizard sucked his fingers, “I\u0027ll tell you what. I\u0027ll put you under a conjuration of duress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s no need, I assure you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it\u0027s best this way. It means you can move around. I had it all ready anyway, in case you could go and fetch, you know, her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” said Rincewind. As the demonologist mumbled words from the book he thought: Feet. Door. Stairs. What a great combination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to him that there was something about the demonologist that wasn\u0027t quite usual, but he couldn\u0027t put his finger on it. He looked pretty much like the demonologists Rincewind had known back in Ankh-Morpork, who were all bent and chemical-stained and had eyes with pupils like pinheads from all the chemical fumes. This one would have fitted in easily. It was just that there was something odd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To be honest,” said Thursley, industriously mopping away part of the circle, “you\u0027re my first demon. It\u0027s never worked before. What is your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rincewind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursley thought about this. “It doesn\u0027t ring a bell,” he said. “There\u0027s a Riinjswin in the Demonologie. And a Winswin. But they\u0027ve got more wings than you. You can step out now. I must say that\u0027s a first-class materialisation. No-one would think you were a fiend, to look at you. Most demons, when they want to look human, materialise in the shape of nobles, kings and princes. This moth-eaten-wizard look is very clever. You could\u0027ve almost fooled me. It\u0027s a shame you can\u0027t do any of those things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can\u0027t see why you\u0027d want to live for ever,” said Rincewind, privately determining that the words “moth-eaten” would be paid for, if ever he got the opportunity. “Being young again, I can understand that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh. Being young\u0027s not much fun,” said Thursley, and then clapped his hand over his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind leaned forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout fifty years. That was what was missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s a false beard!” he said. “How old are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eighty-seven!” squeaked Thursley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see the hooks over your ears!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seventy-eight, honest! Avaunt!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re a little boy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric pulled himself up haughtily. “I\u0027m not!” he snapped. “I\u0027m nearly fourteen!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah-ha!” The boy waved the sword at Rincewind. “It doesn\u0027t matter, anyway!” he shouted. “Demonologists can be any age, you\u0027re still my demon and you have to do as I say!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eric!” came a voice from somewhere below them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric\u0027s face went white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, mother?” he shouted, his eyes fixed on Rincewind. His mouth shaped the words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t say anything, please. “What\u0027s all that noise up there?” “Nothing, mother!” “Come down and wash your hands, dear, your breakfast\u0027s ready!” “Yes, mother.” He looked sheepishly at Rincewind. “That\u0027s my mother,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She\u0027s got a good pair of lungs, hasn\u0027t she,” said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027d, I\u0027d better go, then,” said Eric. “You\u0027ll have to stay up here, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt dawned on him that he was losing a certain amount of credibility at this point. He waved the sword again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Avaunt!” he said. “I command you not to leave this room!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. Sure,” said Rincewind, eyeing the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Promise? Otherwise you\u0027ll be sent back to the Pit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I don\u0027t want that,” said Rincewind. “Off you trot. Don\u0027t worry about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m going to leave the sword and stuff here,” said Eric, removing most of his accoutrements to reveal a slim, dark-haired young man whose face would be a lot better when his acne cleared up. “If you touch them, terrible things will befall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wouldn\u0027t dream of it,” said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was left alone he wandered he wandered over to the lectern and looked at the book. The title, in impressively flickering red letters, was Mallificarum Sumpta Diabolicite Occularis Singularum, the Book of Ultimate Control. He knew about it. There was a copy in the Library somewhere, although wizards never bothered with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might seem odd, because if there is one thing a wizard would trade his grandfather for, it is power. But it wasn\u0027t all that strange, because any wizard bright enough to survive for five minutes was also bright enough to realise that if there was any power in demonology, then it lay with the demons. Using it for your own purposes would be like trying to beat mice to death with a rattlesnake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven wizards thought demonologists were odd; they tended to be surreptitious, pale men who got up to complicated things in darkened rooms and had damp, weak handshakes. It wasn\u0027t like good clean magic. No self-respecting wizard would have any truck with the demonic regions, whose inhabitants were as big a collection of ding-dong as you\u0027d find outside a large belfry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inspected the skeleton closely, just in case. It didn\u0027t seem inclined to make a contribution to the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It belonged to his wossname, grandfather,” said a cracked voice behind him “Bit of an unusual bequest,” said Rincewind. \"Oh, not personally. He got it in a shop somewhere. It\u0027s one of them wossname,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earticulate wossnames.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s not saying much right now,” said Rincewind, and then went very quiet and thoughtful. “Er,” he said, without moving his head, “what, precisely, am I talking to?” “I\u0027m a wossname. Tip of my tongue. Begins with a P.” Rincewind turned around slowly. “You\u0027re a parrot?” he said. “That\u0027s it.” Rincewind stared at the thing on the perch. It had one eye that glittered like a ruby. Most\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the rest of it was pink and purple skin, studded with the fag-ends of feathers, so that the net effect was of an oven-ready hairbrush. It jiggled arthritically on its perch and then slowly lost its balance, until it was hanging upside down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you were stuffed,” said Rincewind. “Up yours, wizard.” Rincewind ignored it and crept over to the window. It was small, but gave out on to a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egently sloping roof. And out there was a real life, real sky, real buildings. He reached out to open the shutters A crackling current coursed up his arm and earthed itself in his cerebellum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the floor, sucking his fingers. “He tole you,” said the parrot, swinging backwards and forwards upside down. “But you wouldn\u0027t wossname. He\u0027s got you by the wossnames.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it should only work on demons!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” said the parrot, achieving enough momentum to swing upright again, whereupon it steadied itself with the stubby remains of what had once been wings. “It\u0027s all according, isn\u0027t it. If you come in the door marked `wossnames` that means you get treated as a wossname, right? Demon, I mean. Subject to all the rules and wossnames. Tough one for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you know I\u0027m a wizard, don\u0027t you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parrot gave a squawk. “I\u0027ve seen \u0027em, mate. The real McWossname. Some of the ones we\u0027ve had in here, they\u0027d make you choke on your millet. Great scaly fiery wossnames. Took weeks to get the soot off the walls,” it added, in an approving tone of voice. “That was in his granddad\u0027s day, of course. The kid hasn\u0027t been any good at it. Up to now. Bright lad. I blame the wossnames, parents. New money, you know. Wine business. Spoil him rotten, let him play with his wossname\u0027s old stuff, `Oh, he\u0027s such an intelligent lad, nose always in a book`,” the parrot mimicked. “They never give him any of the things a sensitive growing wossname really needs, if you was to ask me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What you mean love and guidance?” said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking of a bloody good wossname, thrashing,\" said the parrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind clutched at his aching head. If this was what demons usually had to go through, no wonder they were always so annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Polly want a biscuit,” said the parrot vaguely, in much the same way as a human would say “Er” or “As I was saying”, and went on, “His granddad was keen on it. That and his pigeons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pigeons,” said Rincewind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that he was particularly successful. It was all a bit trial and wossname.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you said great big scaly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yes. But that wasn\u0027t what he was after. He was trying to conjure up a succubus.” It should be impossible to leer when all you\u0027ve got is a beak, but the parrot managed it. “That\u0027s a female demon what comes in the night and makes mad passionate wossn -” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eric-discworld-9/page-3.html","bookId":1628,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM"}
