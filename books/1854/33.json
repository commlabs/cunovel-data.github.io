But Trent feels like something valuable misplaced and then found again and I’m overwhelmed with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent leans in and kisses my jaw line, near my earlobe. “Missed you too, babe,” he whispers into my ear, sending shivers through my core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, sir. Are you sure you don’t want to press charges?” A voice asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure. It’s just a bruise,” Trent answers, not releasing me from his grip, like he’s as in need of me as I am of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What bruise?” I pull away and look up to see Trent’s bottom lip swollen. My hand flies to it, but he grabs it and holds it away. “I’m fine. Really. It’s nothing. Completely worth it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll need to ask this young lady a few questions. Are you her guardian?” I hear the cop ask and I assume he’s talking to Storm so I continue staring up at Trent’s face, unable to peel away. He’s equally unwavering in his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, she is,” I hear Livie say and I snap out of it. He’s talking to me. “Yes, yes …” Turning, I find Officer Stares-A-Lot standing behind me. My frown tells him that I recognize him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs noncommittally. “You ladies sure are keeping us busy these days.” His gaze drifts over to Storm, ever so quickly taking in her body before averting his eyes to the ground as he pushes a hand through his short blonde hair. He’s a decent-looking guy in a Ken doll, mama’s boy sort of way. And he’s got the hots for Storm. That much is obvious. Then again, who doesn’t?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one can accuse us of being boring.” I smile to myself. “I’m Kacey. That’s Storm, but it looks like you remember her, Officer …?” I watch with morbid fascination as blood rushes right to his hair line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clears his throat. “Officer Ryder. Dan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStorm is oblivious, still holding her daughter tightly as she sways her hips, her eyes half-closed and dreamy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother throat clears. We turn to find a second officer poking his head into the doorway. “If there’s nothing else, we should get this guy to the station for booking.” His attention coasts to Storm and lingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then get him to the car. Now!” The officer catches Officer Dan’s lethal glare and growl and ducks out. To Storm, Officer Dan says in a soft voice, “I’d find another place to stay for the night until you can get this door fixed. My shift will be over in a few hours. I can come back and watch over the place until morning if you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStorm breaks free of her spell then and turns to look at Officer Dan like she’s seeing him for the first time, her irises twinkling. “Oh, thank you. I don’t have much, but I’d feel safer if someone were watching over it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Dan flushes for the third time and I have to say I’m impressed with him, his eyes locked on her face the entire time when even Gandhi would have a hard time not wandering over her barely clad frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll watch over the place until you get here,” Trent offers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Dan sizes Trent up, looks at me in his arms, and likely decides Trent isn’t competition. He nods. “I’d appreciate it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have somewhere to stay for the night, Angel?” Cain asks, stepping through the doorway. Nate looms behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She can stay with us,” I answer before Storm has a chance to say a word. She nods silently, her hand still cradling Mia’s head whose lids are drooping closed now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, then. I’ve got to get back to the club to close up. I’ll put your earnings from tonight in my safe. You can pick them up tomorrow.” Cain offers with a sincere smile, adding, “Take tomorrow night off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Cain,” I hear myself say. Storm’s right. They really are nice guys. “Thanks, Nate.” I get a grunt in return. But then Nate takes three mammoth steps to close the distance between himself and Storm. Like watching a bear paw at a newborn’s head, I cringe as Nate’s hand reaches out to cover Mia’s head. He’s gentle though, giving her a soft pat. “Sweet dreams, Mia,” he rumbles. Sleepy blue eyes look up at him. I’m sure she’s two seconds away from screaming. I know I would be. But I watch her little hand lift up to squeeze his one finger, the gesture yanking on my heart strings. With that, Cain and Nate leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, let’s get Mia to bed,” Livie puts her hand around Storm and gently ushers her toward the door, just as Tanner steps in. “Not now, Tanner,” Livie murmurs, leading them out and next door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scratches his head in that ‘Tanner way’ but nods, stepping aside. I bury my mouth in Trent’s chest again, this time to keep from laughing. I never noticed coming in, so zoned in to getting to Livie and Mia, but Tanner’s wearing Batman pajamas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner runs his hand up and down the doorway and I know what he’s thinking. “This wasn’t Storm’s fault, Tanner,” I start to say, afraid he’s going to throw down his one coveted rule. This would definitely be classified as disturbing thy peace. But he waves my words away, mumbling, “never seen people with such bad door luck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent peels himself away from me and steps forward, pulling out his wallet and another wad of cash. “This should cover it. Can you get your guy in first thing in the morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have to do that, Trent,” I say as Tanner’s meaty paw wraps around the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe comes back to grab hold of me again, shaking his head dismissively. “We’ll sort it out tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner lifts his hand to wave the money in thanks and moves for the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Dan stops him. “Sir, I suggest you speak to the building owner about replacing those entrance gates immediately and with a better system, given how easily these can be forced open, as demonstrated tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner appraises the cop with shrewd eyes. “I agree, Officer, but the owner of this building is a scrooge whose purse strings are tighter than a—” he glances at me and ducks his head. “He’s cheap, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it help if he received a formal order from the Miami Police Department and the City of Miami indicating he’s liable for a multi-million dollar lawsuit if he doesn’t provide adequate security for his residents?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner’s brow arches in surprise. “You can do that? I mean …” He clears his throat and that wry smile stretches over his face. “I do believe that would influence him, Officer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan nods curtly, a thinly concealed smile touching his lips. “Great. I’ll come up with something and have it to you first thing tomorrow.” Turning to Trent, he says, “I can cut out from my shift early. Can you make it until four?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, Dan exits, stooping slightly to pass through the doorway. Tanner and his Batman pajamas follow closely, leaving Trent and I alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peer up at Trent’s looming form to admire that gorgeous face. “I feel like I haven’t seen you in months,” I murmur, lifting to my tip toes to lay a gentle kiss on the uninjured side of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand lifts to brush my cheek as he smiles down at me. “You’ve got to be tired. Why don’t you get some sleep? I’ll stay and watch over things.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ten-tiny-breaths-ten-tiny-breaths-1/page-33.html","bookId":1854,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:39 PM"}
