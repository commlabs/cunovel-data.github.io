Why am I having them all now—in this lifetime?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFirst, let’s get one thing straight. You love them. Most of them, anyway. You’ve used them admirably to feel sorry for yourself and to get attention for yourself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOn the few occasions when you haven’t loved them, it’s only because they’ve gone too far. Farther than you thought they ever would when you created them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow let’s understand what you probably already know: all illness is self-created. Even conventional medical doctors are now seeing how people make themselves sick.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMost people do so quite unconsciously. (They don’t even know what they’re doing.) So when they get sick, they don’t know what hit them. It feels as though something has befallen them, rather than that they did something to themselves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis occurs because most people move through life—not simply health issues and consequences—un-consciously.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePeople smoke and wonder why they get cancer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePeople ingest animals and fat and wonder why they get blocked arteries.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePeople stay angry all their lives and wonder why they get heart attacks.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePeople compete with other people—mercilessly and under incredible stress—and wonder why they have strokes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe not-so-obvious truth is that most people worry themselves to death.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWorry is just about the worst form of mental activity there is—next to hate, which is deeply self destructive. Worry is pointless. It is wasted mental energy. It also creates bio-chemical reactions which harm the body, producing everything from indigestion to coronary ar-rest, and a multitude of things in between.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHealth will improve almost at once when worrying ends.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWorry is the activity of a mind which does not understand its connection with Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHatred is the most severely damaging mental con-dition. It poisons the body, and its effects are virtually irreversible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFear is the opposite of everything you are, and so has an effect of opposition to your mental and physical health. Fear is worry magnified.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWorry, hate, fear—together with their offshoots:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eanxiety, bitterness, impatience, avarice, unkindness, judgmentalness, and condemnation—all attack the body at the cellular level. It is impossible to have a healthy body under these conditions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly—although to a somewhat lesser de-gree—conceit, self-indulgence, and greed lead to physical illness, or lack of well-being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll illness is created first in the mind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow can that be? What of conditions contracted from another? Colds—or, for that matter, AIDS?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNothing occurs in your life—nothing—which is not first a thought. Thoughts are like magnets, drawing effects to you. The thought may not always be obvious, and thus clearly causative, as in, “I’m going to contract a terrible disease.” The thought may be (and usually is) far more subtle than that. (“I am not worthy to live.”) (“My life is always a mess.”) (“I am a loser.”) (“God is going to punish me.”) (“1 am sick and tired of my life! “)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThoughts are a very subtle, yet extremely powerful, form of energy. Words are less subtle, more dense. Actions are the most dense of all. Action is energy in heavy physical form, in heavy motion. When you think, say, and act out a negative concept such as “I am a loser,” you place tremendous creative energy into mo-tion. Small wonder you come down with a cold. That would be the least of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is very difficult to reverse the effects of negative thinking once they have taken physical form. Not im-possible—but very difficult. It takes an act of extreme faith. It requires an extraordinary belief in the positive force of the universe-whether you call that God, Goddess, the Unmoved Mover, Prime Force, First Cause, or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHealers have just such faith. It is a faith that crosses over into Absolute Knowing. They know that you are meant to be whole, complete, and perfect in this moment now. This knowingness is also a thought—and a very powerful one. It has the power to move mountains—to say nothing of molecules in your body. That is why healers can heal, often even at a distance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThought knows no distance. Thought travels around the world and traverses the universe faster than you can say the word.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Say but the word and my servant shall be healed.” And it was so, in that selfsame hour, even before his sentence was finished. Such was the faith of the centurion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet you are all mental lepers. Your mind is eaten away with negative thoughts. Some of these are thrust upon you. Many of these you actually make up—con-jure up—yourselves, and then harbor and entertain for hours, days, weeks, months—even years.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e.and you wonder why you are sick.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou can “solve some of the health problems,” as you put it, by solving the problems in your thinking. Yes, you can heal some of the conditions you have already acquired (given yourself), as well as prevent major new problems from developing. And you can do this all by changing your thinking.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlso—and I hate to suggest this because it sounds so mundane coming, as it were, from God, but—for God’s sake, take better care of yourself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou take rotten care of your body, paying it little attention at all until you suspect something’s going wrong with it. You do virtually nothing in the way of preventive maintenance. You take better care of your car than you do of your body—and that’s not saying much.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot only do you fail to prevent breakdowns with regular check-ups, once-a-year physicals, and use of the therapies and medicines you’ve been given (why do you go to the doctor, get her help, then not use the remedies she suggests? Can you answer Me that one?)—you also mistreat your body terribly between these visits about which you do nothing!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou do not exercise it, so it grows flabby and, worse yet, weak from non-use.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou do not nourish it properly, thereby weakening it further.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen you fill it with toxins and poisons and the most absurd substances posing as food. And still it runs for you, this marvelous engine; still it chugs along, bravely pushing on in the face of this on-slaught.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s horrible. The conditions under which you ask your body to survive are horrible. But you will do little or nothing about them. You will read this, nod your head in regretful agreement, and go right back to the mistreatment. And do you know why?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI’m afraid to ask.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause you have no will to live.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat seems a harsh indictment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not meant to be harsh, nor is it meant as an indictment. “Harsh” is a relative term; a judgment you have laid on the words. “Indictment” connotes guilt, and “guilt” connotes wrongdoing. There is no wrong-doing involved here, hence no guilt and no indictment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have made a simple statement of truth. Like all statements of truth, it has the quality of waking you up. Some people don’t like to be awakened. Most do not. Most would rather sleep.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe world is in the condition that it’s in because the world is full of sleepwalkers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith regard to my statement, what about it seems untrue? You have no will to live. At least you have had none until now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you tell me you’ve had an “instant conversion,” I will reassess my prediction of whatyou will now do. I acknow-ledge that my prediction is based on past experience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e.it was also meant to wake you up. Sometimes, when a person is really deeply asleep, you have to shake\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have seen in the past that you have had little will to live. Now you may deny that, but in this case your actions speak louder than your words.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you ever lit a cigarette in your life—much less smoked a pack a day for 20 years as you have—you have very little will to live. You don’t care what you do to your body.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut I stopped smoking over 10 years ago!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnly after 20 years of grueling physical punishment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd if you’ve ever taken alcohol into your body, you have very little will to live.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI drink very moderately.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe body was not meant to intake alcohol. It impairs the mind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Jesus took alcohol! He went to the wedding and turned water into wine!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo who said jesus was perfect?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOh, for God’s sake.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSay, are you becoming annoyed with Me?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, far be it from me to become annoyed with God. I mean, that would be a bit presumptuous, wouldn’t it? But I do think we can carry all this a bit too far. My father taught me, “all things in moderation.” I think I’ve stuck to that where alcohol is concerned.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe body can more easily recover from only mod-erate abuse. The saying is therefore useful. Neverthe-less, I’ll stick to my original statement: the body was not meant to intake alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut even some medicines contain alcohol!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have no control over what you call medicine. I’ll stay with my statement.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou really are rigid, aren’t You?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLook, truth is truth. Now if someone said “A little alcohol won’t hurt you,” and placed that statement in the context of life as you now live it, I would have to agree with them. Thatdoes not change the truth of what I’ve said. It simply allows you to ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet consider this. Currently, you humans wear your bodies out, typically, within 50 to 80 years. Some last longer, but not many. Some stop functioning sooner, but not the majority. Can we agree on that?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, okay.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAlright, so we have a good starting point for discus-sion. Now, when I said I could agree with the statement “A little alcohol won’t hurt you,” I qualified that by adding “in the context of life as you now live it.” You see, you people seem satisfied with life as you now live it. But life, it may surprise you to learn, was meant to be lived a whole different way. And your body was designed to last a great deal longer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow much longer?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eInfinitely longer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat does that mean?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt means, My son, your body was designed to last forever.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eForever?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. Read that: “for ever more.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou mean we were—are—never supposed to die?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou never do die. Life is eternal. You are immortal. You never do die. You simply change form. You didn’t even have to do that. You decided to do that, I didn’t. I made you bodies that would last forever. Do you really think the best God could do, the best I could come up with, was a body that could make it 60, 70, maybe 80 years before falling apart? Is that, do you imagine, the limit of My ability?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI never thought of putting it that way, exactly...\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI designed your magnificent body to last forever! And the earliest of you did live in the body virtually pain-free, and without fear of what you now call death.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn your religious mythology, you symbolize your cellular memory of these first-version humans by calling them Adam and Eve. Actually, of course, there were more than two.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the outset, the idea was for you wonderful souls to have a chance to know your Selves as Who You Really Are through experiences gained n the physical body, in the relative world—as I have explained repeatedly here.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis was done through the slowing down of the unfathomable speed of all vibration (thought form) to produce matter—including that matter you call the physical body.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLife evolved through a series of steps in the blink of an eye that you now call billions of years. And in this holy instant came you, out of the sea, the water of life, onto the land and into the form you now hold.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen the evolutionists are right!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI find it amusing—a source of continual amusement, actually—that you humans have such a need to break everything down into right and wrong. It never occurs to you that you’ve made those labels up to help you define the material—and your Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt never occurs to you (except to the finest minds among you) that a thing could be both right and wrong; that only in the relative world are things one or the other. In the world of the absolute, of time-no time, all things are everything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is no male and female, there is no before and after, there is no fast and slow, here and there, up and down, left and right—and no right and wrong.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour astronauts and cosmonauts have gained a sense of this. They imagined themselves to be rocketing upward to get to outer space, only to find when they got there that they were looking up at the Earth. Or were they? Maybe they were looking down at the Earth! But then, where was the sun? Up? Down? No! Over there, to the left. So now, suddenly, a thing was neither up nor down—it was sideways. . .and all definitions thus dis-appeared.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo it is in My world—our world—our real realm. All definitions disappear, rendering it difficult to even talk about this realm in definitive terms.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eReligion is your attempt to speak of the unspeakable. It does not do a very good job.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo, My son, the evolutionists are not right. I created all of this—all of this—in the blink of an eye; in one holy instant—just as the creationists have said. And. . .it came about through a process of evolution taking bil-lions and billions of what you call years, just as the evolutionists claim.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey are both “right.” As the cosmonauts discov-ered, it all depends on how you look at it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut the real question is: one holy instantlbillions of years-what’s the difference? Can you simply agree that on some of the questions of life the mystery is too great for even you to solve? Why not hold the mystery as sacred? And why not allow the sacred to be sacred, and leave it alone?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI suppose we all have an insatiable need to know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut you already know! I’ve just told you! Yet you don’t want to know the Truth, you want to know the truth as you understand it. This is the greatest barrier to your enlightenment. You think you already know the truth! You think you already understand how it is. So you agree with everything you see or hear or read that falls into the paradigm of your understanding, and reject everything which does not. And this you call learning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis you call being open to the teachings. Alas, you can never be open to the teachings so long as you are closed to everything save your own truth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus will this very book be called blasphemy—the work of the devil—by some.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet those who have ears to hear, let them listen. I tell you this: You were not meant to ever die. Your physical form was created as a magnificent conven-ience; a wonderful tool; a glorious vehicle allowing you to experience the reality you have created with your mind, that you may know the Self you have created in your soul.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe soul conceives, the mind creates, the body experiences. The circle is complete. The soul then knows itself in its own experience. If it does not like what it is experiencing (feeling), or wishes a different experience for any reason, it simply conceives of a new experience of Self, and, quite literally, changes its mind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSoon the body finds itself in a new experience. (“1 am the resurrection and the Life” was a magnificent example of this. How do you think Jesus did it anyway? Or do you not believe it ever happened? Believe it. It happened!)\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet this much is so: the soul will never override the body or the mind. I made you as a three-in-one being. You are three beings in one, made in the image and likeness of Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe three aspects of Self are in no wise unequal to each other. Each has a function, but no function is greater than another, nor does any function actually precede another.
