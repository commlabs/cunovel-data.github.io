She pulled out three different sundresses--one white eyelet, one Hawaiian print, and one black linen. \"Which one should I wear tonight?\" she asked me. She asked the question like it was a test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was tired of her tests and having to prove myself all the time. I said, \"We\u0027re just eating dinner, Taylor. We\u0027re not going anywhere special.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head at me, and the towel on her head bounced back and forth. \"We\u0027re going to the boardwalk tonight, though, remember? We have to look cute for that. There\u0027ll be boys there. Let me pick out your outfit, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt used to be that when Taylor picked out my clothes, I felt like the nerdy girl transformed at the prom, in a good way. Now it felt like I was her clueless mom who didn\u0027t know how to dress right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t brought any dresses with me. In fact, I never had. I never even thought to. I only had two dresses at home--one my grandmother bought me for Easter and one I had to buy for eighth-grade graduation. Nothing seemed to fit me right lately. Things were either too long in the crotch or too tight in the waist. I had never thought much about dresses, but looking at hers all laid out on the bed like that, I was jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not getting dressed up for the boardwalk,\" I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me just see what you have,\" she said, walking over to my closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taylor, I said no! This is what I\u0027m wearing.\" I gestured at my cutoff shorts and Cousins Beach T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor made a face, but she backed away from my closet and went back to her three sundresses. \"Fine. Have it your way, grumpy. Now, which one should I wear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"The black one,\" I said, closing my eyes. \"Now hurry up and put some clothes on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDinner that night was scallops and asparagus. When my mother cooked, it was always some sort of seafood with lemon and olive oil and a vegetable. Every time. Susannah only cooked every once in a while, so besides the first night, which was always bouillabaisse, you never knew what you were going to get. She might spend the whole afternoon puttering around the kitchen, making something I\u0027d never had before, like Moroccan chicken with figs. She\u0027d pull out her spiral bound Junior League cookbook that had buttery pages and notes in the margins, the one my mother made fun of. Or she might make American cheese omelets with ketchup and toast. Us kids were supposedly in charge of one night a week too, and that usually meant hamburgers or frozen pizza. But most nights, we ate whatever we wanted, whenever we felt like eating. I loved that about the summer house. At home, we had dinner every night at six thirty, like clockwork. Here, it was like everything just kind of relaxed, even my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor leaned forward and said, \"Laurel, what\u0027s the craziest thing you and Susannah did when you were our age?\" Taylor talked to people like she was at a slumber party, always. Adults, boys, the cafeteria lady, everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother and Susannah looked at each other and smiled. They knew, but they weren\u0027t telling. My mother wiped her mouth with her napkin and said, \"We snuck onto the golf course one night and planted daisies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that wasn\u0027t the truth, but Steven and Jeremiah laughed. Steven said in his annoying know-it-all kind of way, \"You guys were boring even when you were teenagers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s really sweet,\" Taylor said, squirting a glob of ketchup onto her plate. Taylor ate everything with ketchup--eggs, pizza, pasta, everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad, who I thought hadn\u0027t even been listening, said, \"You guys are lying. That wasn\u0027t the craziest thing you ever did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah put her hands up, like, I surrender. \"Mothers get to have secrets too,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t ask you boys about your secrets, now, do I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do,\" said Jeremiah. He pointed his fork at her. \"You ask all the time. If I had a journal, you would read it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I wouldn\u0027t,\" she protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother said, \"Yes, you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusannah glared at my mother. \"I would never.\" Then she looked at Conrad and Jeremiah sitting next to each other. \"Fine, I might, but only Conrad\u0027s. He\u0027s so good at keeping everything locked inside, I never know what he\u0027s thinking. But not you, Jeremiah. You, my baby boy, wear your heart right here.\" She reached over and touched his sweatshirt sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t,\" he protested, stabbing a scallop on his plate. \"I have secrets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when Taylor said, \"Sure you do, Jeremy,\" in this really sickeningly flirtatious way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at her, which made me want to choke on my asparagus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when I said, \"Taylor and I are going to go to the boardwalk tonight. Will one of you guys drop us off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore my mother or Susannah could answer, Jeremiah said, \"Ooh, the boardwalk. I think we should go to the boardwalk too.\" Turning to Conrad and Steven, he added, \"Right, guys?\" Normally I would have been thrilled that any of them wanted to go somewhere I was going, but not this time. I knew it wasn\u0027t for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Taylor, who was suddenly busy cutting up her scallops into tiny bite-size pieces. She knew it was for her too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The boardwalk sucks,\" said Steven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad said, \"Not interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who invited you guys anyway?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven rolled his eyes. \"No one invites anyone to the boardwalk. You just go. It\u0027s a free country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it a free country?\" my mother mused. \"I want you to really think about that statement, Steven. What about our civil liberties? Are we really free if--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laurel, please,\" Susannah said, shaking her head. \"Let\u0027s not talk politics at the dinner table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know of a better time for political discourse,\" my mother said calmly. Then she looked at me. I mouthed, Please stop, and she sighed. It was better to stop her right away before she really got going. \"Okay, fine. Fine. No more politics. I\u0027m going to the bookstore downtown. I\u0027ll drop you guys off on the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Mom,\" I said. \"It\u0027ll be just Taylor and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah ignored me and turned to Steven and Conrad. \"Come on, guys,\" he said. \"It\u0027ll be amazing.\" Taylor had been calling everything amazing all day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, but I\u0027m going to the arcade,\" said Steven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Con?\" Jeremiah looked at Conrad, who shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Con,\" Taylor said, poking at him with her fork. \"Come with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, and Taylor made a face. \"Fine. We\u0027ll be sure to have lots of fun without you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-15.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
