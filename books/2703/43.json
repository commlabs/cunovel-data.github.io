It felt as if someone was blowing up a balloon inside my ribcage. “Come on in. Cora’s in her room....” She paused and cocked her ear as if she wanted me to finish the sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grin broke across my lips. “Changing?” I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly.” Leaving the door open for me to make myself at home, Zoey turned away. As she did, her ponytail breezed past me, stirring up that mysterious smell. I started to step over the threshold when it hit me that the smell came from her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of shampoo do you use?” I blurted out the question before my brain could tell me not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoey stopped walking and turned back slowly. “I’m sorry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, crap. Her eyes narrowed suspiciously, letting me know good and well she realized I’d been smelling her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped, and motioned wildly with my hand to her ponytail. All the while, my face kept getting hotter and hotter. “I... you...when your hair whooshed past as you turned away...I didn’t mean to—sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must’ve realized I wasn’t trying to make a pass at her or anything because her shoulders relaxed and her lips loosened into a smile. “Oh, well, it’s, um...wild cherry and jewel orchid, or something like that. I can’t really remember. It’s supposed to be for curlier hair...” Plucking at her ponytail to show me just how curly her hair wasn’t, she shrugged with a rueful grin. “But it’s my favorite scent, so I use it anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t blame you. I love that smell.” I realized what I’d just said the moment the words left my lips. “I mean...” Mortified, I gaped at her with no idea how I was going to talk my way out of this faux pas, when a commotion on the television caught my attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you watching Pysch?” I shut the door behind me and wandered into the living room, remembering the episode she currently had on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. You have me officially addicted. I started watching it last night when Cora was out and almost finished the entire first season in one sitting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to smile until it struck me what else she’d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora had been out last night? She hadn’t told me she was going anywhere. I knew she probably didn’t sit at home alone on the nights I worked, but...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. My girlfriend certainly didn’t have to tell me every little move she made. Besides, I hadn’t had much of a chance to talk to her since then. She’d probably tell me all about what she’d done as I drove us to the frat party tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s helping me gag my way through my homework,” Zoey was saying as she settled onto a bare spot of couch that was covered in open textbooks. Sending me a brief accusing glance, she added, “You forgot to warn me how tough Gilcrest was. I mean...” She held up a stapled stack of papers and shook it at me. “This syllabus is insane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re studying biology?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man. Soaking in bio and watching Psych? I wondered if I could talk her into trading places with me for the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. So I’m really hoping you were serious about those notes you were offering to share.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a chuckle, I reached back and pulled out the sheets I’d rolled into a tube and shoved into my back pocket. Waving them at her, I stepped in to hand them over. “I was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, thank God. You’re amazing.” She snagged them from my outstretched hand. “Thank you, thank you, thank you.” She hugged the roll to her cheek and then kissed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy skin heated as I watched her press her lips to the paper I’d just had in my back pocket. She seemed to realize the intimacy of the moment a second later, because she froze, then glanced at me with a guilty cringe before she blushed and slowly moved my notes away from her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. That was...really weird, wasn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, it made me feel better for all the mortifying things I’d done and said since she’d opened the door. I sniffed and waved an unconcerned hand. “Not at all. I kiss my homework all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she laughed, I felt...I don’t know, but it was one of those really good feelings, like you’re floating off the ground because you’re so happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to stay back, I drifted closer. “What’s Gilcrest making you learn first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh! Here.” Zoey shoved aside some books on the couch to make room for me. “I’m not exactly sure. It says on his syllabus, but...” She shook her head and sighed. “It’s all Greek to me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-43.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
