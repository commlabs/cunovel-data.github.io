{"id":83751,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, you don\u0027t play fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas she ever under the impression that I did? \"I believe I recall telling you I always get my way, within reasonable means.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You put a ring on my finger—which is absolutely stunning, by the way—and teased me with the prospect of being your wife only moments before walking away. You skimmed the surface but you didn\u0027t really even ask me to marry you. And all of this you do while I\u0027m experiencing an emotional breakdown because you\u0027re leaving. You seriously think that\u0027s reasonable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I think it\u0027ll get me what I want, which is making you my wife.\" That\u0027s the end result I\u0027m shooting for here. I don\u0027t really care how I achieve it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t ask me to marry you yet, so I\u0027m not giving you an answer until you propose properly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounds agreeable, so I\u0027m going for it. \"Laurelyn, will you please marry me and be my wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\" That wasn\u0027t the answer I was expecting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asking over the phone isn\u0027t a proper proposal, and I won\u0027t answer you until you\u0027re on one knee in front of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. I should\u0027ve dropped down to my knee when I gave her that ring. \"It\u0027s sort of hard to do that when I\u0027m going to be nine thousand miles away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate it, pal, but a drunk proposal and a phone proposal are both null and void with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if she was ever going to bring up Vegas. \"This is the first mention of my drunk proposal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you do remember it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could I forget that epic fail? \"Hell yeah, I remember it. I could\u0027ve kicked my own arse for being so careless with those precious words. You deserve so much better than me getting wasted and telling you to marry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I damn sure do. Therefore, all proposals, drunk or sober, don\u0027t count. You\u0027ve not asked and I\u0027ve not answered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really don\u0027t want to go back to Australia like this. \"Should I get on a plane and come back now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Now isn\u0027t the best time to talk marriage with me, buster. I\u0027m still pretty pissed off at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just put a beautiful ring on her finger and told her how much I want her to be my wife, and she\u0027s mad at me. This can\u0027t be right. \"Don\u0027t be like that, baby. Think of the thought behind the gesture. I love you and want to be with you forever. Don\u0027t let formality or your anger cause you to forget that part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a dirty trick but I\u0027m gonna use it anyway to soften her anger with me. \"And think of those babies you long for. I\u0027ll give them to you—as many as you wish, whenever you\u0027re ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something tells me you want those babies as much as I do. Half of our conversations seem to revolve around them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right. Something has happened in me and I want them too. \"You think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you asking if I think you want them, or do I think we talk about them a lot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then yes to both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027ve talked about kids so this isn\u0027t news to her. \"I do want them, but only with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe makes a sound of frustration. \"This makes me so damn mad that we\u0027re having this conversation now when we should\u0027ve had it before you left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right. I feel like such a dumb-arse for holding out for the perfect time. \"I\u0027m sorry I waited. I should\u0027ve asked you the day I bought the ring. I was going to propose when I took you to Oscar\u0027s for dinner. I had the ring box in my hand, about to ask, when that reporter walked up to our table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went nuts right at the moment when you were going to ask. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s fate. That wasn\u0027t the way it was supposed to happen. \"It\u0027s not your fault,\" I reassure her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to be patient with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I\u0027ve waited thirty years for you. I can wait a little longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cannot believe Jack Henry did this to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and I aren\u0027t ordinary. We never have been—and we never will be—so I\u0027m not sure why I\u0027d expect a normal proposal from him. But he\u0027s right about one thing: it\u0027ll definitely be a story to tell our kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur kids. Wow. It\u0027s beyond the realms of reality to think we\u0027ve gone from agreeing to a three month sex-a-thon without true identities to contemplating marriage and kids, especially when he was so hell-bent on neither. Should it concern me that he made a complete one-eighty on issues he was so firm about only a few months ago?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he loves me, but I\u0027m concerned that he\u0027s changed his mind about marriage and kids for the wrong reason. I don\u0027t want him basing that on what I want instead of what he wants so he can keep me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need someone I can talk to about Jack Henry\u0027s proposal. There\u0027s only one person worthy of a brutally honest conversation about this, and she\u0027s gallivanting around Australia with the love of her life. I look at the clock—it\u0027s 10 p.m. her time. I\u0027m definitely calling that slut puppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe answers on the third ring with a greeting that isn\u0027t all that unfamiliar. \"Hello, twat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt stops becoming a surprise when she says it every time. \"Hello, crotch rot. How are things down under?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI anticipate her reply involving something about going down or getting under Zac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could do a lot with that and say that you walked right into it, but I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be a first. \"Thanks. I appreciate that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s going on with you since the good-looking suit left? Wasn\u0027t that going down today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still calls him that. \"Yeah. He left about five hours ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I\u0027m not. It\u0027s far shittier than I\u0027d imagined. \"I\u0027m not at all fine with being separated from him again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s the plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Addie, he asked me to marry him.\" I jerk the phone back in anticipation of the scream to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What!\" she yells, as expected. \"Tell me everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told me that he knew I wasn\u0027t ready to give up my career, but he\u0027d be waiting for me to come to him when I was prepared to be his wife. He put a ring on my finger. It\u0027s an engagement ring—the most beautiful one I\u0027ve ever seen—and told me it was a reminder of him waiting for me. That\u0027s how he left it, but then he called me from LA and asked me over the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what I want to do—drop everything and run to him. I want to beat him to Avalon and be waiting in his bed when he arrives home. \"I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s why I\u0027m calling you. I need your blunt advice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only met the guy a few times and it was under false pretenses. Thank you again for that, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe isn\u0027t going to let me forget that. \"I know. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s difficult to give you advice about a guy I don\u0027t know, but here\u0027s what I have to go on: he\u0027s rich and successful so you\u0027d never have to worry about how he\u0027d take care of you. He\u0027s fucking gorgeous, so that\u0027s a definite plus. According to what you\u0027ve told me, the two of you have crazy monkey sex. He gives your vajayjay a lot of special attention and makes you come a lot, so you\u0027re good there. We both know that one\u0027s a deal-breaker if the sex is terrible. He hired a private investigator to find you, so that proves he wants you bad. He must love you or he wouldn\u0027t have proposed. But do you love him enough to marry him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I do, but there are other issues at hand. \"I do, but I worry he\u0027s talking about marriage and babies because I told him it\u0027s what I wanted. What if he\u0027s going along with it but it\u0027s not what he wants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laurelyn, do you really think the guy would marry you if he didn\u0027t want to? For God\u0027s sake, he had meaningless sexual relationships with women to avoid the whole commitment thing. He wouldn\u0027t decide to give that life up unless he loved you and wanted to be married to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess that makes sense. \"But I\u0027m terrified of giving up my career only to have the whole thing backfire in my face. What if I move down there and it doesn\u0027t work out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if you don\u0027t and you never know what might have been? Can you live with that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I? I don\u0027t think so. \"You think I should give up my career?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I gave all of that up for Zac because I love him and wanted to be with him. Will I ever have a singing career for shit now? No. Do I care? No. We\u0027re together and I\u0027m happy. I was willing to walk away. The only question now is, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAddison is different. She isn\u0027t afraid to fly by the seat of her pants. \"You know me. I have trust issues that are damn near impossible to shake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You worry so much about protecting your toes that you miss out on the joy of the dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never thought of it that way. \"I may, but I\u0027ve never had anyone looking out for me. It\u0027s how I protect myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Answer this question for me: do you really feel like you need protection from Jack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one makes me feel safer than Jack Henry. No one. \"No. It\u0027s the complete opposite. He\u0027s always my protector.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you should marry him—if for no other reason than for me to have you back in Australia with me. I miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be nice to have him and my best friend. \"I know. I miss you too, and I do love Australia. I think I could be very happy living there. I can so easily see myself as part of Jack Henry\u0027s family. They\u0027re wonderful people and they took me in and treated me like one of their own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can take some time to think about it if you feel like it\u0027s necessary, but it\u0027s plain to see that your heart already knows what it wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s right. I can think about this day and night but I hear my heart\u0027s plea—and it\u0027s screaming for me to go to him, like, yesterday. On the other hand, I hear my head trying to overpower my heart. All I hear is my head saying no and my heart saying go. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-34.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
