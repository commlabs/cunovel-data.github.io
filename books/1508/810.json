It was like he was facing a mountain that couldn’t be scaled. That person was absolutely a top master!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It looks like the Destiny Decree is much more terrifying than I imagined it to be.” Lin Ming’s solemnly said. As he completely restrained his aura and energy, he quickly ran low to the ground and entered the vast forests of Jagged Slope Mountain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFlying was too dangerous right now. He prepared to conceal his energy and ran forwards into the forest. This way, he would be able to minimize the risk of being discovered.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithout knowing just how strong his opponent was, rashly rushing into their base wasn’t the wisest decision. In fact, as Lin Ming thought about it, he thought that maybe he had been a bit too crazy in his actions. Luckily for him, only the second, third, and fourth Demon Envoys had been guarding the Jagged Slope Mountain Branch Division.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf it had been the Great Demon Envoy, then Lin Ming suspected then that even the speed from the Gate of Wonder wouldn’t be enough to flee from him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I underestimated the power of the sixth stage Life Destruction masters. It’s impossible for me to reign over the other Life Destruction powerhouses with my speed, even with the Gate of Wonder. It’s a pity that my comprehension of the Concept of Wind is too shallow, since if my ‘Golden Roc Shattering the Void’ were to advance another level, then combined with the Gate of Wonder, it might be able to allow my speed to reach the peak of Life Destruction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming first discovered that the Heretical God Seed could absorb thunder and fire, he had experimented with the other elements to see if they would respond in the same way. However, there hadn’t been any response to those elements from the Heretical God Seed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming arrived at a deeply secluded mountain valley an hour later. He found a river several feet wide and plunged into it as he completely withheld his energy, allowing himself to drift down the water. This sort of escape method was very safe, as the river would wash away any and all traces of his energy. He wouldn’t even need to use true essence to travel, lowering the possibility of being discovered to the absolute minimum.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming floated down the icy river waters, he remembered all of the sixth stage Life Destruction masters he had encountered ever since coming to the four Divine Kingdoms. The first one was the ancient wood spirit jade carving appraisal grandmaster that Li Yifeng had introduced him to – Guru Blueway.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Guru Blueway had less than a hundred years of life remaining, and his current strength was less than half of what it used to be at its peak. Moreover, he had invested all the energy of his later years into appraising wood spirit jade carvings. He had cut off his heart of battle and started to cultivate a peaceful mind and soul, and was thus not too terrifying. Because of this, Lin Ming had never realized the horrifying strength of a sixth stage Life Destruction powerhouse at their peak.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs he thought about it, a sixth stage Life Destruction powerhouse had a slim hope of breaking into the Divine Sea realm. While they were young, they were undoubtedly Emperor level talents, and certainly outstanding ones amongst at that. Once these sorts of individuals reached the sixth stage of Life Destruction, it was hard to imagine just how powerful they would be!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I wonder what degree of strength a top 10 ranked Destiny Decree powerhouse would reach. What about a top 3 ranked master?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming thought this, he felt that his future road was still unbelievably long. Today, by massacring the Jagged Slope Mountain Branch Division, he had publicly slapped the Asura Divine Kingdom in front of all the major powers of the central Sky Spill Continent. The Asura Divine Kingdom would never let him go now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had also destroyed Situ Bonan’s battle spirit projection, completely enraging that 5000-6000 year old monster. If a top ranked Destiny Decree martial artist was already so terrifying, then Lin Ming couldn’t imagine just how strong Situ Bonan actually was in reality.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt could be imagined that after this fiasco, the Asura Divine Kingdom would not hesitate to put forth any price to search for him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Asura Divine Kingdom had a glorious and long inheritance. Not only were they powerful and influential, they had more masters than clouds in the skies. If they had over 10 Divine Sea Supreme Elders like Situ Bonan, then they were an existence nearing the level of a sixth grade sect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSuch a superpower was far from what Lin Ming could ever hope to contend with.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHis biggest priority right now was to increase his cultivation as soon as possible. Otherwise, he could only be at the mercy of others.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf he couldn’t increase his cultivation, then it didn’t matter how talented he was, or any other advantages he had to make up for the cultivation gap between him and the others. That wasn’t the orthodox method of doing things anyways.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDemonshine knew what Lin Ming was thinking. He thought for a moment and said, “Boy, you should make sure that you are mentally prepared. If you truly desire to breakthrough to Life Destruction, then I fear it won’t be so easy…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I said….if you want to break through into Life Destruction, then you will have to pay a price several times, or even ten times larger than other martial artists. The road ahead of you is filled with difficulties, but the corresponding rewards are also just as splendid. Of course, this all depends on if you can last until the very end….”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e………\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTime passed. In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed, and Lin Ming had finally slowly and safely made it out of the Jagged Slope Mountain range.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, news of Lin Ming’s massacre of the Asura Divine Kingdom’s Jagged Slope Mountain Branch Division and washing the entire grounds with blood had spread like wildfire over the four Divine Kingdoms.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePrior to that, the Asura Divine Kingdom had already released news that Lin Ming had stolen their Asura Divine Kingdom’s inheritance and had posted a sky high bounty to capture Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e300,000 spirit essence stones, a peak medium-grade heaven-step treasure, and a God Transforming Pill. This sky high bounty had made even the top 100 ranked Destiny Decree masters froth from the mouth in excitement. Many other martial artists had joined in groups just to search for Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Asura Divine Kingdom had used several large branch divisions as their bases of operations and gathered heroes from all around the world. They had planned to establish cooperative relations with the local fifth-grade sects and form a massive intelligence net with their help.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this sort of situation, with such a widespread and tight intelligence network searching for Lin Ming, everyone thought that Lin Ming would be like a meteor, experiencing a brief period of blazing glory before falling from the sky.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, seven days after that announcement, an explosive situation that made everyone’s eyes pop out had occurred.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith just himself and his spear, Lin Ming had killed his way into the Jagged Slope Mountain Branch Division. He had stolen away the bounty rewards that the Asura Divine Kingdom had prepared, played the three Demon Envoys like dogs, and then killed several hundred outstanding elite disciples of three great sects and the Asura Divine Kingdom. Even four Destiny Decree masters hadn’t been spared – all of them had been slaughtered!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhile the world hadn’t known of Lin Ming’s battle with Situ Bonan, just the killing of the four masters was enough to shock everyone. Of the four people, Hall Master Situ and Old Man Sun had been the weaker of the group, barely being able to rank on the Destiny Decree. However, the other two, Old Man Yan and Lian Shiyu, were true Destiny Decree masters. Their rankings were no worse than Corpsemancer’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven with the four of them joining forces, they had all been routed and slayed by Lin Ming without a single one escaping!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSuch a feat was bewildering! Lin Ming killing his way along into Jagged Slope Mountain and blatantly stealing the bounty reward…such brazen audacity had left everyone dumbfounded.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was especially true for the surviving minority of young disciples that had escaped from Jagged Slope Mountain. To them, the mere mention of Lin Lanjian’s name brought about bouts of nightmares. It could be said that the name of Lin Lanjian had already become a heart demon, infesting within their souls. If they couldn’t rid themselves of this, then when they tried to cross Life Destruction in the future, it was highly likely they would suffer a backlash from this heart demon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe infamous name of Lin Lanjian only took a few days to become well known amongst everyone. This was a hero that only came once every several thousand years! Even the Divine Emperors of the four Divine Kingdoms wouldn’t be able to stand side-by-side with Lin Lanjian when they were his age!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was because most of them only knew Lin Ming’s approximate age. None of them knew just how far into his twenties he was. If they were to discover that Lin Ming was actually less than 22 years old when he washed the Jagged Slope Mountains with blood, and had even destroyed Situ Bonan’s battle spirit will projection, then even the description of an eternally rare talent wouldn’t be enough to describe Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s talent would even cause the major powers of the Sky Spill Continent to feel unease. This was because according to this rate of growth, it was entirely possible that Lin Ming would become the number one master of the Sky Spill Continent in the future.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe would then be able to influence all matters within the entire Sky Spill Continent using just his strength!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo such a future unrivalled powerhouse with unknown intentions, it was truly difficult for the major powers to decide how to process this matter. \u0026nbsp;If Lin Ming grew, then it was possible that he would pose a threat to them. It was also possible that he could prove beneficial to them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWinning him over would be the best course of action to take. However, just because they wanted to, didn’t meant they would be successful.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf they couldn’t win him over and decided to kill him, then it wouldn’t be a matter if they did manage to kill him. If they failed to kill Lin Ming and made an enemy instead, however, then that would truly be a nightmare that would never end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey knew that for such a developing legend like Lin Ming, those sorts of characters often had an inestimably great destiny on their bodies. Wanting to kill someone like that would not be easy at all. Moreover, the other major forces weren’t like the Asura Divine Kingdom. There were no entangled interests and enmities between them. Unless the ruling decision makers had decided to go insane, no one would want to earn the hatred and become the enemy of a peerless talent with an infinite potential for growth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTen days later, a new Destiny Decree was freshly printed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was a revised Destiny Decree, undoubtedly published because of Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf Lin Ming had managed to kill four Destiny Decree masters at once, then that meant his strength had recently made enormous progress. What was strange, however, was that his cultivation hadn’t grown by much.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis caused Lin Ming to be shrouded in increasing layers of mystery.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe several great information organizations were unable to give a reasonable explanation for this. They could only ambiguously speculate that Lin Ming had encountered some massive lucky chance or cultivated an extremely mighty arcane ability. That extreme, unparalleled speed that Lin Ming had shown when he set off a bloodbath in Jagged Slope Mountain was good proof of this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe new Destiny Decree was sold out at nearly the same moment it was released. Of those that opened the Destiny Decree, they had no interest at all in those masters whose positions hadn’t moved for dozens of years. They turned the pages to search for Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the 280\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eth\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e page, in scarlet letters written with great flourish was a name – Lin Lanjian. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis red ink was meant for the hottest rising star of the moment.
