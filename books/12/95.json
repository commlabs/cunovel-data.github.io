She looked at Seldons hair as though she was of a mind to feel it herself.\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon moved away slightly. \"Please dont. The woman made it seem like a perversion.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose it was--from her standpoint. Did you derive no pleasure from it yourself?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pleasure? It gave me gooseflesh. When she finally stopped, I was able to breathe again. I kept thinking: What other conditions will she make?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors laughed. \"Were you afraid that she would force sex upon you? Or hopeful?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I assure you I didnt dare think. I just wanted the Book.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e They were in their room now and Dors turned on her field distorter to make sure they would not be overheard.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Mycogenian night was about to begin. Seldon had removed his skincap and kirtle and had bathed, paying particular attention to his hair, which he had foamed and rinsed twice. He was now sitting on his cot, wearing a light nightgown that had been hanging in the closet.\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors said, eyes dancing, \"Did she know you have hair on your chest?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was hoping earnestly she wouldnt think of that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Poor Hari. It was all perfectly natural, you know. I would probably have had similar trouble if I was alone with a Brother. Worse, Im sure, since he would believe--Mycogenian society being what it is--that as a woman I would be bound to obey his orders without delay or demur.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, Dors. You may think it was perfectly natural, but you didnt experience it. The poor woman was in a high state of sexual excitement. She engaged all her senses ... smelled her fingers, licked them. If she could have heard hair grow, she would have listened avidly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"But thats what I mean by natural. Anything you make forbidden gains sexual attractiveness. Would you be particularly interested in womens breasts if you lived in a society in which they were displayed at all times?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I might.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wouldnt you be more interested if they were always hidden, as in most societies they are?-- Listen, let me tell you something that happened to me. I was at a lake resort back home on Cinna ... I presume you have resorts on Helicon, beaches, that sort of thing?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course,\" said Seldon, slightly annoyed. \"What do you think Helicon is, a world of rocks and mountains, with only well water to drink?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"No offense, Hari. I just want to make sure youll get the point of the story. On our beaches at Cinna, were pretty lighthearted about what we wear ... or dont wear.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nude beaches?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not actually, though I suppose if someone removed all of his or her clothing it wouldnt be much remarked on. The custom is to wear a decent minimum, but I must admit that what we consider decent leaves very little to the imagination.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon said, \"We have somewhat higher standards of decency on Helicon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I could tell that by your careful treatment of me, but to each its own. In any case, I was sitting at the small beach by the lake and a young man approached to whom I had spoken earlier in the day. He was a decent fellow I found nothing particularly wrong with. He sat on the arm of my chair and placed his right hand on my left thigh, which was bare, of course, in order to steady himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"After we had spoken for a minute and a half or so, he said, impishly. Here I am. You know me hardly at all and yet it seems perfectly natural to me that I place my hand on your thigh. Whats more, it seems perfectly natural to you, since you dont seem to mind that it remains there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was only then that I actually noticed that his hand was on my thigh. Bare skin in public somehow loses some of its sexual quality. As I said, its the hiding from view that is crucial.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"And the young man felt this too, for he went on to say, Yet if I were to meet you under more formal conditions and you were wearing a gown, you wouldnt dream of letting me lift your gown and place my hand on your thigh on the precise spot it now occupies.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I laughed and we continued to talk of this and that. Of course, the young man, now that my attention had been called to the position of his hand, felt it no longer appropriate to keep it there and removed it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That night I dressed for dinner with more than usual care and appeared in clothing that was considerably more formal than was required or than other women in the dining room were wearing. I found the young man in question. He was sitting at one of the tables. I approached, greeted him, and said, Here I am in a gown, but under it my left thigh is bare. I give you permission. Just lift the gown and place your hand on my left thigh where you had it earlier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"He tried. Ill give him credit for that, but everyone was staring. I wouldnt have stopped him and Im sure no one else would have stopped him either, but he couldnt bring himself to do it. It was no more public then than it had been earlier and the same people were present in both cases. It was clear that I had taken the initiative and that I had no objections, but he could not bring himself to violate the proprieties. The conditions, which had been hand-on-thigh in the afternoon, were not hand-on-thigh in the evening and that meant more than anything logic could say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon said, \"I would have put my hand on your thigh.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you sure?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Positive.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Even though your standards of decency on the beach are higher than ours are?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors sat down on her own cot, then lay down with her hands behind her head. \"So that youre not particularly disturbed that Im wearing a nightgown with very little underneath it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Im not particularly shocked. As for being disturbed, that depends on the definition of the word. Im certainly aware of how youre dressed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, if were going to be cooped up here for a period of time, well have to learn to ignore such things.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Or take advantage of them,\" said Seldon, grinning. \"And I like your hair. After seeing you bald all day, I like your hair.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, dont touch it. I havent washed it yet.\" She half-closed her eyes. \"Its interesting. Youve detached the informal and formal level of respectability. What youre saying is that Helicon is more respectable at the informal level than Cinna is and less respectable at the formal level. Is that right?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Actually, Im just talking about the young man who placed his hand on your thigh and myself. How representative we are as Cinnians and Heliconians, respectively, I cant say. I can easily imagine some perfectly proper individuals on both worlds--and some madcaps too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Were talking about social pressures. Im not exactly a Galactic traveler, but Ive had to involve myself in a great deal of social history. On the planet of Derowd, there was a time when premarital sex was absolutely free. Multiple sex was allowed for the unmarried and public sex was frowned upon only when traffic was blocked: And yet, after marriage, monogamy was absolute and unbroken. The theory was that by working off all ones fantasies first, one could settle down to the serious business of life.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did it work?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"About three hundred years ago that stopped, but some of my colleagues say it stopped through external pressure from other worlds who were losing too much tourist business to Derowd. There is such a thing as overall Galactic social pressure too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Or perhaps economic pressure, in this case.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps. And being at the University, by the way, I get a chance to study social pressures, even without being a Galactic traveler. I meet people from scores of places inside and outside of Trantor and one of the pet amusements in the social science departments is the comparison of social pressures.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here in Mycogen, for instance, I have the impression that sex is strictly controlled and is permitted under only the most stringent rules, all the more tightly enforced because it is never discussed. In the Streeling Sector, sex is never discussed either, but it isnt condemned. In the Jennat Sector, where I spent a week once doing research, sex is discussed endlessly, but only for the purpose of condemning it. I dont suppose there are any two sectors in Trantor--or any two worlds outside Trantor--in which attitudes toward sex are completely duplicated.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon said, \"You know what you make it sound like? It would appear--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors said, \"Ill tell you how it appears. All this talk of sex makes one thing clear to me. Im simply not going to let you out of my sight anymore.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"What?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Twice I let you go, the first time through my own misjudgment and the second because you bullied me into it. Both times it was clearly a mistake. You know what happened to you the first time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon said indignantly, \"Yes, but nothing happened to me the second time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You nearly got into a lot of trouble. Suppose you had been caught indulging in sexual escapades with a Sister?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It wasnt a sexual--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You yourself said she was in a high state of sexual excitement.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"But--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was wrong. Please get it through your head, Hari. From now on, you go nowhere without me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look,\" said Seldon freezingly, \"my object was to find out about Mycogenian history and as a result of the so-called sexual escapade with a Sister, I have a book--the Book.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"The Book! True, theres the Book. Lets see it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon produced it and Dors thoughtfully hefted it.\n\u003cbr\u003e She said, \"It might not do us any good, Hari. This doesnt look as though it will fit any projector Ive ever encountered. That means youll have to get a Mycogenian projector and theyll want to know why you want it. Theyll then find out you have this Book and theyll take it away from you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon smiled. \"If your assumptions were correct, Dors, your conclusions would be inescapable, but it happens that this is not the kind of book you think it is. Its not meant to be projected. The material is printed on various pages and the pages are turned. Raindrop Forty-Three explained that much to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"A print-book!\" It was hard to tell whether Dors was shocked or amused. \"Thats from the Stone Age.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Its certainly pre-Empire,\" said Seldon, \"but not entirely so. Have you ever seen a print-book?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Considering that Im a historian? Of course, Hari.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, but like this one?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e He handed over the Book and Dors, smiling, opened it--then turned to another page--then flipped the pages. \"Its blank,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It appears to be blank. The Mycogenians are stubbornly primitivistic, but not entirely so. They will keep to the essence of the primitive, but have no objection to using modern technology to modify it for conveniences sake. Who knows?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe so, Hari, but I dont understand what youre saying.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"The pages arent blank, theyre covered with microprint. Here, give it back. If I press this little nubbin on the inner edge of the cover-- Look!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e The page to which the book lay open was suddenly covered with lines of print that rolled slowly upward.\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon said, \"You can adjust the rate of upward movement to match your reading speed by slightly twisting the nubbin one way or the other. When the lines of print reach their upward limit when you reach the bottom line, that is--they snap downward and turn off. You turn to the next page and continue.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where does the energy come from that does all this?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"It has an enclosed microfusion battery that lasts the life of the book.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then when it runs down--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You discard the book, which you may be required to do even before it runs down, given wear and tear, and get another copy. You never replace the battery.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors took the Book a second time and looked at it from all sides. She said, \"I must admit I never heard of a book like this.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nor I. The Galaxy, generally, has moved into visual technology so rapidly, it skipped over this possibility.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is visual.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, but not with the orthodox effects. This type of book has its advantages. It holds far more than an ordinary visual book does.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors said, \"Wheres the turn-on?--Ah, let me see if I can work it.\" She had opened to a page at random and set the lines of print marching upward. Then she said, \"Im afraid this wont do you any good, Hari. Its pre-Galactic. I dont mean the book. I mean the print ... the language.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can you read it, Dors? As a historian--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"As a historian, Im used to dealing with archaic language--but within limits. This is far too ancient for me. I can make out a few words here and there, but not enough to be useful.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good,\" said Seldon. \"If its really ancient, it will be useful.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not if you cant read it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can read it,\" said Seldon. \"Its bilingual. You dont suppose that Raindrop Forty-Three can read the ancient script, do you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"If shes educated properly, why not?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because I suspect that women in Mycogen are not educated past household duties. Some of the more learned men can read this, but everyone else would need a translation to Galactic.\" He pushed another nubbin. \"And this supplies it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e The lines of print changed to Galactic Standard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Delightful,\" said Dors in admiration.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"We could learn from these Mycogenians, but we dont.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"We havent known about it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I cant believe that. I know about it now. And you know about it. There must be outsiders coming into Mycogen now and then, for commercial or political reasons, or there wouldnt be skincaps so ready for use. So every once in a while someone must have caught a glimpse of this sort of print-book and seen how it works, but its probably dismissed as something curious but not worth further study, simply because its Mycogenian.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"But is it worth study?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course. Everything is. Or should be. Hummin would probably point to this lack of concern about these books as a sign of degeneration in the Empire.\" He lifted the Book and said with a gush of excitement, \"But I am curious and I will read this and it may push me in the direction of psychohistory.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope so,\" said Dors, \"but if you take my advice, youll sleep first and approach it fresh in the morning. You wont learn much if you nod over it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon hesitated, then said, \"How maternal you are!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Im watching over you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I have a mother alive on Helicon. I would rather you were my friend.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"As for that, I have been your friend since first I met you.\" She smiled at him and Seldon hesitated as though he were not certain as to the appropriate rejoinder.\n\u003cbr\u003e Finally he said, \"Then Ill take your advice--as a friend--and sleep before reading.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e He made as though to put the Book on a small table between the two cots, hesitated, turned, and put it under his pillow.\n\u003cbr\u003e Dors Venabili laughed softly. \"I think youre afraid I will wake during the night and read parts of the Book before you have a chance to. Is that it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well,\" said Seldon, trying not to look ashamed, \"that may be it. Even friendship only goes so far and this is my book and its my psychohistory.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I agree,\" said Dors, \"and I promise you that we wont quarrel over that. By the way, you were about to say something earlier when I interrupted you. Remember?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Seldon thought briefly. \"No.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e In the dark, he thought only of the Book. He gave no thought to the hand-on-thigh story. In fact, he had already quite forgotten it, consciously at least.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1560/46328.html","bookId":12,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:17:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:17:13 AM"}
