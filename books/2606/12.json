But I didn\u0027t even get a chance to touch them. The moment I took a couple of steps towards the jeep, its window began slowly winding down. Some kind of mechanism must have switched on. I really wanted to find out what was behind the glass, but the light began to fade, and a few seconds later it was dark. Exactly the same thing as happened to you, in fact. I climbed up on the platform and touched the wall where the window of the jeep had been. There was a gap there now. I ran my hand round its edge. It really felt like a car window. But the window hadn\u0027t opened all the way and the gap wasn\u0027t big enough to climb through the wall. There was a slight draught from the window, as if there was an air-conditioner working inside. And I thought I caught a faint glimpse of light. I leaned down to look inside, but as soon as my face was level with the opening something bumped against my cheek and I heard a terrible howl. I leapt back, lost my balance and fell off the platform on to the floor. The light came on\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dim at first, then brighter and brighter, like in the cinema after a film. By the time it got really light, the jeep\u0027s window was already closed again. I went back out through the corridor into the open air and came back here. I was shaking all over at first, but I started feeling better on the way. It\u0027s funny to think about it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomeo-y-Cohiba\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I\u0027ve learned one lesson.

I want to tell you something. It will probably sound stupid, but I want you to hear it anyway. Whatever I\u0027m thinking about, I always come back to you. As if all the thoughts that aren\u0027t connected with you are heavy weights and as soon as my mind tries to deal with them, the effort becomes too much. But everything to do with you is light and happy, like the bubbles in champagne. I just want to go on and on thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsoldA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Romeo, that really did sound stupid.

The twilight of Ancient Greek thought in a nutshell. Zeno\u0027s paradoxes. Achilles can\u0027t go riding in his big beautiful car. Because when he\u0027s riding in it, he can\u0027t see it. The passers-by can see it, so they\u0027re the ones riding in it. And Achilles only imagines he\u0027s driving it, but in actual fact it\u0027s driving him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a bit jealous.

And anyway an RR SUV is a bit OTT. Cohiba ought to have an Alfa Romeo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t mean the car. Alfa Romeo, Beta Romeo\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;all that sounds like the stud ranking in a herd of chimpanzees to me. I mean the feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you have them too. They have love, you have envy. As comrade Ariadne teaches us, these are merely different states assumed by past within the helmet of horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on that optimistic note ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes indeed.

If you ever leaf through those fashionable journals with all the chic interiors, you might have seen something of the kind. It\u0027s a large room, and the bed takes up at least half of it. The mattress is so wonderful I don\u0027t even know how to describe it. I should write more poems. When you lie down on it, it feels like you\u0027re parachuting through the air, soaring along the pillows, the blankets and the sheets\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;everything is absolutely the very best. And there\u0027s an air conditioner with heaps of different operating modes. You can set it so that a fresh breeze blows through the room as though it\u0027s coming straight off the sea.

There are lots and lots of them, all beautiful kinds of colours, and inside each one there are instructions on how many pills you can take at once, which ones you can take with others, which ones you can\u0027t, and so on. Only I don\u0027t need any sleeping pills. I only have to lie down on the bed, and I\u0027m gone.
