I\u0027ll hope always for the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrancis Belanger burst into Jesse Weill\u0027s office in his usual steaming tizzy, his reddish hair disordered and his face aglow with worry and a mild perspiration. He was brought up sharply by the sight of Weill\u0027s head cradled in the crook of his elbow and bent on the desk until only the glimmer of white hair was visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelanger swallowed. \"Boss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill\u0027s head lifted. \"It\u0027s you, Frank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, boss? Are you sick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m old enough to be sick, but I\u0027m on my feet. Staggering, but on my feet. A government man was here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He threatens censorship. He brought a sample of what\u0027s going round. Cheap dreamies for bottle parties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God damn!\" said Belanger feelingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only trouble is that morality makes for good campaign fodder. They\u0027ll be hitting out everywhere. And, to tell the truth, we\u0027re vulnerable, Frank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are? Our stuff is clean. We play up straight adventure and romance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill thrust out his lower lip and wrinkled his forehead. \"Between us, Frank, we don\u0027t have to make believe. Clean? It depends on how you look at it. It\u0027s not for publication, maybe, but you know and I know that every dreamie has its Freudian connotations. You can\u0027t deny it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, if you look for it. If you\u0027re a psychiatrist-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re an ordinary person, too. The ordinary observer doesn\u0027t know it\u0027s there and maybe he couldn\u0027t tell a phallic symbol from a mother image even if you pointed it out. Still, his subconscious knows. And it\u0027s the connotations that make many a dreamie click.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, what\u0027s the government going to do? Clean up the subconscious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a problem. I don\u0027t know what they\u0027re going to do. What we have on our side, and what I\u0027m mainly depending on, is the fact that the public loves its dreamies and won\u0027t give them up... Meanwhile, what did you come in for? You want to see me about something, I suppose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelanger tossed an object onto Weill\u0027s desk and shoved his shirttail deeper into his trousers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill broke open the glistening plastic cover and took out the enclosed cylinder. At one end was engraved in a too fancy script in pastel blue \"Along the Himalayan Trail.\" It bore the mark of Luster-Think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Competitor\u0027s Product.\" Weill said it with capitals, and his lips twitched. \"It hasn\u0027t been published yet. Where did you get it, Frank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind. I just want you to absorb it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill sighed. \"Today, everyone wants me to absorb dreams. Frank, it\u0027s not dirty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelanger said testily, \"It has your Freudian symbols. Narrow crevasses between the mountain peaks. I hope that won\u0027t bother you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m an old man. It stopped bothering me years ago, but that other thing was so poorly done, it hurt... All right, let\u0027s see what you\u0027ve got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the recorder. Again the unfreezer over his skull and at the temples. This time, Weill rested back in his chair for fifteen minutes or more, while Francis Belanger went hurriedly through two cigarettes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Weill removed the headpiece and blinked dream out of his eyes, Belanger said, \"Well, what\u0027s your reaction, boss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill corrugated his forehead. \"It\u0027s not for me. It was repetitious. With competition like this, Dreams, Inc., doesn\u0027t have to worry for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your mistake, boss. Luster-Think\u0027s going to win with stuff like this. We\u0027ve got to do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Frank-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you listen. This is the coming thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This!\" Weill stared with a half-humorous dubiety at the cylinder. \"It\u0027s amateurish, it\u0027s repetitious. Its overtones are very unsubtle. The snow had a distinct lemon sherbet taste. Who tastes lemon sherbet in snow these days, Frank? In the old days, yes. Twenty years ago, maybe. When Lyman Harrison first made his Snow Symphonies for sale down south, it was a big thing. Sherbet and candy-striped mountaintops and sliding down chocolate-covered cliffs. It\u0027s slapstick, Frank. These days it doesn\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because,\" said Belanger, \"you\u0027re not up with the times, boss. I\u0027ve got to talk to you straight. When you started the dreamie business, when you bought up the basic patents and began putting them out, dreamies were luxury stuff. The market was small and individual. You could afford to turn out specialized dreamies and sell them to people at high prices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" said Weill, \"and we\u0027ve kept that up. But also we\u0027ve opened a rental business for the masses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we have and it\u0027s not enough. Our dreamies have subtlety, yes. They can be used over and over again. The tenth time you\u0027re still finding new things, still getting new enjoyment. But how many people are connoisseurs? And another thing. Our stuff is strongly individualized. They\u0027re First Person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Luster-Think is opening dream palaces. They\u0027ve opened one with three hundred booths in Nashville. You walk in, take your seat, put on your unfreezer and get your dream. Everyone in the audience gets the same one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard of it, Frank, and it\u0027s been done before. It didn\u0027t work the first time and it won\u0027t work now. You want to know why it won\u0027t work? Because, in the first place, dreaming is a private thing. Do you like your neighbor to know what you\u0027re dreaming? In the second place, in a dream palace, the dreams have to start on schedule, don\u0027t they? So the dreamer has to dream not when he wants to but when some palace manager says he should. Finally, a dream one person likes another person doesn\u0027t like. In those three hundred booths, I guarantee you, a hundred fifty people are dissatisfied. And if they\u0027re dissatisfied, they won\u0027t come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Belanger rolled up his sleeves and opened his collar. \"Boss,\" he said, \"you\u0027re talking through your hat. What\u0027s the use of proving they won\u0027t work? They are working. The word came through today that Luster-Think is breaking ground for a thousand-booth palace in St. Louis. People can get used to public dreaming, if everyone else in the same room is having the same dream. And they can adjust themselves to having it at a given time, as long as it\u0027s cheap and convenient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, boss, it\u0027s a social affair. A boy and a girl go to a dream palace and absorb some cheap romantic thing with stereotyped overtones and commonplace situations, but still they come out with stars sprinkling their hair. They\u0027ve had the same dream together. They\u0027ve gone through identical sloppy emotions. They\u0027re in tune, boss. You bet they go back to the dream palace, and all their friends go, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if they don\u0027t like the dream?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the point. That\u0027s the nub of the whole thing. They\u0027re bound to like it. If you prepare Hillary specials with wheels within wheels within wheels, with surprise twists on the third-level undertones, with clever shifts of significance and all the other things we\u0027re so proud of, why, naturally, it won\u0027t appeal to everyone. Specialized dreamies are for specialized tastes. But Luster-Think is turning out simple jobs in Third Person so both sexes can be hit at once. Like what you\u0027ve just absorbed. Simple, repetitious, commonplace. They\u0027re aiming at the lowest common denominator. No one will love it, maybe, but no one will hate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill sat silent for a long time and Belanger watched him. Then Weill said, \"Frank, I started on quality and I\u0027m staying there. Maybe you\u0027re right. Maybe dream palaces are the coming thing. If so we\u0027ll open them, but we\u0027ll use good stuff. Maybe Luster-Think underestimates ordinary people. Let\u0027s go slowly and not panic. I have based all my policies on the theory that there\u0027s always a market for quality. Sometimes, my boy, it would surprise you how big a market.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boss-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounding of the intercom interrupted Belanger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Ruth?\" said Weill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice of his secretary said, \"It\u0027s Mr. Hillary, sir. He wants to see you right away. He says it\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hillary?\" Weill\u0027s voice registered shock. Then, \"Wait five minutes, Ruth, then send him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill turned to Belanger. \"Today, Frank, is definitely not one of my good days. A dreamer\u0027s place is in his home with his thinker. And Hillary\u0027s our best dreamer so he especially should be at home. What do you suppose is wrong with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelanger, still brooding over Luster-Think and dream palaces, said shortly, \"Call him in and find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In one minute. Tell me, how was his last dream? I haven\u0027t tried the one that came in last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelanger came down to earth. He wrinkled his nose. \"Not so good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was ragged. Too jumpy. I don\u0027t mind sharp transitions for the liveliness, you know, but there\u0027s got to be some connection, even if only on a deep level.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it a total loss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No Hillary dream is a total loss. It took a lot of editing, though. We cut it down quite a bit and spliced in some odd pieces he\u0027d sent us now and then. You know, detached scenes. It\u0027s still not Grade A, but it will pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told him about this, Frank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think I\u0027m crazy, boss? Think I\u0027m going to say a harsh word to a dreamer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at that point the door opened and Weill\u0027s comely young secretary smiled Sherman Hillary into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherman Hillary, at the age of thirty-one, could have been recognized as a dreamer by anyone. His eyes, unspectacled, had nevertheless the misty look of one who either needs glasses or who rarely focuses on anything mundane. He was of average height but underweight, with black hair that needed cutting, a narrow chin, a pale skin and a troubled look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe muttered, \"Hello, Mr. Weill,\" and half-nodded in hangdog fashion in the direction of Belanger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill said heartily, \"Sherman, my boy, you look fine. What\u0027s the matter? A dream is cooking only so-so at home? You\u0027re worried about it?... Sit down, sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dreamer did, sitting at the edge of the chair and holding his thighs stiffly together as though to be ready for instant obedience to a possible order to stand up once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I\u0027ve come to tell you, Mr. Weill, I\u0027m quitting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quitting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to dream any more, Mr. Weill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill\u0027s old face looked older now than at any time in the day. \"Why, Sherman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dreamer\u0027s lips twisted. He blurted out, \"Because I\u0027m not living, Mr. Weill. Everything passes me by. It wasn\u0027t so bad at first. It was even relaxing. I\u0027d dream evenings, weekends when I felt like, or any other time. And when I felt like I wouldn\u0027t. But now, Mr. Weill, I\u0027m an old pro. You tell me I\u0027m one of the best in the business and the industry looks to me to think up new subtleties and new changes on the old reliables like the flying reveries, and the worm-turning skits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill said, \"And is anyone better than you, Sherman? Your little sequence on leading an orchestra is selling steadily after ten years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Mr. Weill. I\u0027ve done my part. It\u0027s gotten so I don\u0027t go out any more. I neglect my wife. My little girl doesn\u0027t know me. Last week, we went to a dinner party-Sarah made me-and I don\u0027t remember a bit of it. Sarah says I was sitting on the couch all evening just staring at nothing and humming. She said everyone kept looking at me. She cried all night. I\u0027m tired of things like that, Mr. Weill. I want to be a normal person and live in this world. I promised her I\u0027d quit and I will, so it\u0027s good-by, Mr. Weill.\" Hillary stood up and held out his hand awkwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill waved it gently away. \"If you want to quit, Sherman, it\u0027s all right. But do an old man a favor and let me explain something to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to change my mind,\" said Hillary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to try to make you. I just want to explain something. I\u0027m an old man and even before you were born I was in this business so I like to talk about it. Humor me, Sherman? Please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHillary sat down. His teeth clamped down on his lower lip and he stared sullenly at his fingernails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill said, \"Do you know what a dreamer is, Sherman? Do you know what he means to ordinary people? Do you know what it is to be like me, like Frank Belanger, like your wife, Sarah? To have crippled minds that can\u0027t imagine, that can\u0027t build up thoughts? People like myself, ordinary people, would like to escape just once in a while this life of ours. We can\u0027t. We need help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In olden times it was books, plays, radio, movies, television. They gave us make-believe, but that wasn\u0027t important. What was important was that for a little while our own imaginations were stimulated. We could think of handsome lovers and beautiful princesses. We could be beautiful, witty, strong, capable, everything we weren\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, always, the passing of the dream from dreamer to absorber was not perfect. It had to be translated into words in one way or another. The best dreamer in the world might not be able to get any of it into words. And the best writer in the world could put only the smallest part of his dreams into words. You understand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now, with dream recording, any man can dream. You, Sherman, and a handful of men like you, supply those dreams directly and exactly. It\u0027s straight from your head into ours, full strength. You dream for a hundred million people every time you dream. You dream a hundred million dreams at once. This is a great thing, my boy. You give all those people a glimpse of something they could not have by themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHillary mumbled, \"I\u0027ve done my share.\" He rose desperately to his feet. \"I\u0027m through. I don\u0027t care what you say. And if you want to sue me for breaking our contract, go ahead and sue. I don\u0027t care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill stood up, too. \"Would I sue you?... Ruth,\" he spoke into the intercom, \"bring in our copy of Mr. Hillary\u0027s contract.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited. So did Hillary and so did Belanger. Weill smiled faintly and his yellowed fingers drummed softly on his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis secretary brought in the contract. Weill took it, showed its face to Hillary and said, \"Sherman, my boy, unless you want to be with me, it\u0027s not right you should stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, before Belanger could make more than the beginning of a horrified gesture to stop him, he tore the contract into four pieces and tossed them down the waste chute. \"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHillary\u0027s hand shot out to seize Weill\u0027s. \"Thanks, Mr. Weill,\" he said earnestly, his voice husky. \"You\u0027ve always treated me very well, and I\u0027m grateful. I\u0027m sorry it had to be like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right, my boy. It\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf in tears, still muttering thanks, Sherman Hillary left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the love of Pete, boss, why did you let him go?\" demanded Belanger distractedly. \"Don\u0027t you see the game? He\u0027ll be going straight to Luster-Think. They\u0027ve bought him off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill raised his hand. \"You\u0027re wrong. You\u0027re quite wrong. I know the boy and this would not be his style. Besides,\" he added dryly, \"Ruth is a good secretary and she knows what to bring me when I ask for a dreamer\u0027s contract. What I had was a fake. The real contract is still in the safe, believe me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meanwhile, a fine day I\u0027ve had. I had to argue with a father to give me a chance at new talent, with a government man to avoid censorship, with you to keep from adopting fatal policies and now with my best dreamer to keep him from leaving. The father I probably won out over. The government man and you, I don\u0027t know. Maybe yes, maybe no. But about Sherman Hillary, at least, there is no question. The dreamer will be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill smiled at Belanger and crinkled his cheeks into a network of fine lines. \"Frank, my boy, you know how to edit dreamies so you think you know all the tools and machines of the trade. But let me tell you something. The most important tool in the dreamie business is the dreamer himself. He is the one you have to understand most of all, and I understand them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen. When I was a youngster-there were no dreamies then-I knew a fellow who wrote television scripts. He would complain to me bitterly that when someone met him for the first time and found out who he was, they would say: Where do you get those crazy ideas?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They honestly didn\u0027t know. To them it was an impossibility to even think of one of them. So what could my friend say? He used to talk to me about it and tell me: Could I say, I don\u0027t know? When I go to bed, I can\u0027t sleep for ideas dancing in my head. When I shave, I cut myself; when I talk, I lose track of what I\u0027m saying; when I drive, I take my life in my hands. And always because ideas, situations, dialogues are spinning and twisting in my mind. I can\u0027t tell you where I get my ideas. Can you tell me, maybe, your trick of not getting ideas, so I, too, can have a little peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, Frank, how it is. You can stop work here anytime. So can I. This is our job, not our life. But not Sherman Hillary. Wherever he goes, whatever he does, he\u0027ll dream. While he lives, he must think; while he thinks, he must dream. We don\u0027t hold him prisoner, our contract isn\u0027t an iron wall for him. His own skull is his prisoner, Frank. So he\u0027ll be back. What can he do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelanger shrugged. \"If what you say is right, I\u0027m sort of sorry for the guy-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeill nodded sadly. \"I\u0027m sorry for all of them. Through the years, I\u0027ve found out one thing. It\u0027s their business; making people happy. Other people.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-24.html","bookId":1749,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:19:09 AM"}
