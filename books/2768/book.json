Carlos likes living his life on the edge and wants to carve his own path—just like Alex did. Then he meets Kiara Westford. She doesn’t talk much and is completely intimidated by Carlos’ wild ways. As they get to know one another, Carlos assumes Kiara thinks she’s too good for him, and refuses to admit that she might be getting to him. But he soon realizes that being himself is exactly what Kiara needs right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/rules-of-attraction-perfect-chemistry-2.jpg","author":"Simone Elkeles","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/rules-of-attraction-perfect-chemistry-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:27 PM"}
