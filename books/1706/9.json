You can go right in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerb Lowenstein stood and shook Evans\u0027s hand perfunctorily. He was a pleasant-faced balding man, mild-mannered and slightly nerdy. His office was decorated with dozens of pictures of his family, stacked three and four deep on his desk. He got on well with Evans, if only because these days, whenever Morton\u0027s thirty-year-old daughter got arrested for cocaine possession, it was Evans who went downtown at midnight to post her bail. Lowenstein had done it for many years, and now was glad to sleep through the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he said, \"how was Iceland?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.

Tell me: Is there a problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There might be.\" Evans was thinking that George rarely held up charitable donations. And there had been a certain tension in the brief talk he had with him the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this meeting about tomorrow morning?\" Lowenstein said. \"The big conference room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beats me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George didn\u0027t tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick is very upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s not unusual for Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick has heard of this Kenner guy.

Got deposited in the wrong account.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard about that. It was an error by a volunteer. You can\u0027t blame Nick for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t build confidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was deposited to the International Wilderness Preservation Society.

I\u0027m aware of a delay. That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Lowenstein said, reaching for the phone. \"I\u0027ll calm Nick down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans went back to his office. His phone was ringing. He answered it. \"What are you doing today?\" Morton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much. Paperwork.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That can wait. I want you to go over and see how that Vanutu lawsuit is coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, George, it\u0027s still pretty preliminary. I think the filing is several months away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pay them a visit,\" Morton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, they\u0027re in Culver City, I\u0027ll call over there and\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Don\u0027t call. Just go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if they\u0027re not expecting\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. That\u0027s what I want. Let me know what you find out, Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCULVER CITY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTUESDAY, AUGUST 24\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:30 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vanutu litigation team had taken over an old warehouse south of Culver City. It was an industrial area, with potholes in the streets. There was nothing to see from the curb: just a plain brick wall, and a door with the street number in battered metal numerals. Evans pushed the buzzer and was admitted to a small walled-off reception area. He could hear the low murmur of voices from the other side of the wall, but he could see nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo armed guards stood on either side of the far door, leading into the warehouse itself. A receptionist sat at a small desk. She gave him an unfriendly look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter Evans, Hassle and Black.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Balder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have an appointment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe receptionist looked disbelieving. \"I will buzz his assistant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe receptionist talked on the phone in a low voice. He heard her mention the name of the law firm. Evans looked at the two guards. They were from a private security firm. They stared back at him, their faces blank, unsmiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe receptionist hung up and said, \"Ms. Haynes will be out in a moment.\" She nodded to the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them came over and said to Evans, \"Just a formality, sir. May I see some identification?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans gave him his driver\u0027s license.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any cameras or recording equipment on your person?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any disks, drives, flash cards, or other computer equipment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you armed, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you mind raising your arms for a moment?\" When Evans gave him a strange look, the guard said, \"Just think of it like airport security,\" and he patted him down. But he was also clearly feeling for wires. He ran his fingers over the collar of Evans\u0027s shirt, felt the stitching in his jacket, ran his finger around his waistband, and then asked him to take off his shoes. Finally he passed an electronic wand over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys are serious,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes we are. Thank you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard stepped away, resuming his place at the wall. There was no place to sit, so Evans just stood there and waited. It was probably two minutes before the door opened. An attractive but tough-looking woman in her late twenties, with short dark hair and blue eyes, wearing jeans and a white shirt, said, \"Mr. Evans? I\u0027m Jennifer Haynes.\" Her handshake was firm. \"I work with John Balder. Come this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in a narrow corridor, with a locked door at the far end. Evans realized it was a security locktwo doors to get inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that all about?\" he said, indicating the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve had a little trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People want to know what\u0027s going on here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve learned to be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her card against the door, and it buzzed open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey entered an old warehousea vast, high-ceilinged space, separated into large rooms by glass partitions. Immediately to his left, behind glass, Evans saw a room filled with computer terminals, each manned by a young person with a stack of documents beside their keyboard. In big lettering on the glass it said, \"data-raw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his right, there was a matching conference room labeled \"satellites/radiosonde.\" Evans saw four people inside that room, busily discussing huge blowups of a graph on the wall, jagged lines on a grid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarther along there was another room marked \"general circulation models (gcms).\" Here the walls were plastered with large maps of the world, graphical representations in many colors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" Evans said. \"Big operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big lawsuit,\" Jennifer Haynes replied. \"These are all our issue teams. They\u0027re mostly graduate students in climate science, not attorneys. Each team is researching a different issue for us.\" She pointed around the warehouse. \"The first group does raw data, meaning processed data from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University, in New York, from the USHCN at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and from Hadley Center in East Anglia, England. Those are the major sources of temperature data from around the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" Evans said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the group over there works on satellite data. Orbiting satellites have recorded temperatures of the upper atmosphere since 1979, so there is more than a twenty-year record. We\u0027re trying to figure out what to do about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What to do about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The satellite data\u0027s a problem,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though she hadn\u0027t heard him, she pointed to the next room. \"The team there is doing comparative analyses of GCMsmeaning the computer-generated climate modelsfrom the 1970s to the present. As you know, these models are immensely complex, manipulating a million variables or more at once. They are by far the most complex computer models ever created by man. We\u0027re dealing with American, British, and German models, primarily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see amp;\" Evans was starting to feel overwhelmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the team down there is doing sea-level issues. Around the corner is paleoclimate. Those\u0027re proxy studies, of course. And the final team is dealing with solar irradiance and aerosols. Then we have an off-site team at UCLA that is doing atmospheric feedback mechanisms, primarily focusing on cloud cover as it varies with temperature change. And that\u0027s about all of it.\" She paused, seeing the confusion on Evans\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m sorry. Since you work with George Morton, I assumed you were familiar with all this stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who said I work with George Morton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"We know our job, Mr. Evans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed a final glass-walled room that had no label. It was filled with charts and huge photographs, and three-dimensional models of the earth set inside plastic cubes. \"What\u0027s this?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our AV team. They prepare visuals for the jury. Some of the data is extremely complex, and we\u0027re trying to find the simplest and most forceful way to present it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked on. Evans said, \"Is it really that complicated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct,\" she said. \"The island nation of Vanutu is actually four coral atolls in the southern Pacific, which have a maximum elevation of twenty feet above sea level. The eight thousand inhabitants of those islands are at risk of being flooded out by rising sea levels caused by global warming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Evans said. \"I understand that. But why do you have so many people working on the science?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him oddly. \"Because we\u0027re trying to win the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes amp;\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s not an easy case to win.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Evans said. \"This is global warming. Everybody knows that global warming is\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice boomed from the other end of the warehouse. \"Is what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bald, bespectacled man came toward them. He had an ungainly gait, and looked like his nickname: the Bald Eagle. As always, John Balder was dressed all in blue: a blue suit, a blue shirt, and a blue tie. His manner was intense, his eyes narrowed as he looked at Evans. In spite of himself, Evans was intimidated to meet the famous litigator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans extended his hand. \"Peter Evans, Hassle and Black.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you work with George Morton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are indebted to Mr. Morton\u0027s generosity. We strive to be worthy of his support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell him that, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you will. You were speaking of global warming, Mr. Evans. Is it a subject that interests you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir, it does. And every concerned citizen of the planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly agree. But tell me. What is global warming, as you understand it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans tried to conceal his surprise. He hadn\u0027t expected to be quizzed. \"Why do you ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We ask everybody who comes here. We\u0027re trying to get a feel for the general state of knowledge. What\u0027s global warming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Global warming is the heating up of the earth from burning fossil fuels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, that is not correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even close. Perhaps you\u0027d try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans paused. It was obvious he was being interrogated by a fussy and precise legal mind. He knew the type only too well, from law school. He thought for a moment, choosing his words carefully. \"Global warming is, uh, the heating up of the surface of the earth from the excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that is produced by burning fossil fuels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again, not correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Several reasons. At a minimum, I count four errors in the statement you just made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" Evans said. \"My statementthat\u0027s what global warming is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact, it is not.\" Balder\u0027s tone was crisp, authoritative. \"Global warming is the theory\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"hardly a theory, anymore\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it is a theory,\" Balder said. \"Believe me, I wish it were otherwise.
