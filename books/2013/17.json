You tread now on the thinnest skin of ground, with naught but mud beneath.’ He sat forward, folding his hands on the desk. ‘But I shall look into it nonetheless. Perhaps the recent spate of arrests has succeeded in quelling the disenchantment among the learned, or at least culled the most egregious of their lot.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Thank you, Invigilator… Now, who will conduct you investigation?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why, I will attend to this personally.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Venitt Sathad, my assistant who awaits in the courtyarc below, can serve as liaison between your organization and myself for this week; thereafter, I will assign someone else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very good. Weekly reports should suffice, at least to start.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Agreed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRautos Hivanar rose, and after a moment Karos Invictad followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office was suddenly very cramped, and Tanal edged back, angry at the intimidation he felt instinctively rising within him. I have nothing to fear from Rautos Hivanar. Nor Karos. I am their confidant, the both of them. They trust me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad was a step behind Rautos, one hand on the man’s back as the Master opened the door. As soon as Rautos stepped into the hallway, Karos smiled and said a few last words to the man, who grunted in reply, and then the Invigilator closed the door and turned to face Tanal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘One of those well-respected academics is now staining your sheets, Yathvanar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanal blinked. ‘Sir, she was sentenced to the Drowning-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Revoke the punishment. Get her cleaned up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir, it may well be that she will recall-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A certain measure of restraint,’ Karos Invictad said in a Cold tone, ‘is required from you, Tanal Yathvanar. Arrest some daughters of-those already in chains, damn you, and have your fun with them. Am I understood?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Y-yes sir. If she remembers-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then restitution will be necessary, won’t it? I trust you keep your own finances in order, Yathvanar. Now, begone horn my sight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Tanal closed the door behind him, he struggled to draw breath. The bastard. There was no warning off her, was there! Whose mistake was all this? Yet, you think to make me pay /or it. All of it. Blade and Axe take you, Invictad, I won’t suffer alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I depravity holds a certain fascination, don’t you think?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘After all, the sicker the soul, the sweeter its comeuppance.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Assuming there is one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There’s a centre point, I’m sure of it. And it should b dead centre, by my calculations. Perhaps the fulcrum itself is flawed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What calculations?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, the ones I asked you to do for me, of course. Where are they?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They’re on my list.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And how do you calculate the order of your list?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s not the calculation you asked for.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good point. Anyway, if he’d just hold all his legs still, we could properly test my hypothesis.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He doesn’t want to, and I can see why. You’re trying to balance him at the mid-point of his body, but he’s designed to hold that part up, with all those legs.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are those formal observations? If so, make a note.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘On what? We had the wax slab for lunch.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No wonder I feel I could swallow a cow with nary hiccough. Look! Hah! He’s perched! Perfectly perched!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men leaned in to examine Ezgara, the insect with a head at each end. Not unique, of course, there were plenty around these days, filling some arcane niche in the compli-cated miasma of nature, a niche that had been vacant for countless millennia. The creature’s broken-twig legs kicked out helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re torturing him,’ said Bugg, ‘with clear depravity Tehol.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It only seems that way’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, it is that way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘All right, then.’ Tehol reached down and plucked the hapless insect from the fulcrum. Its heads swivelled about, Anyway,’ he said as he peered closely at the creature, ‘that wasn’t the depravity I was talking about. How goes the construction business, by the way?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-17.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
