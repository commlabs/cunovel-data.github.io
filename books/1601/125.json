But I knew, as I did it, that they would eventually fail. Everything eventually fails when he touches it . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene hefted another of the seals, holding it gingerly. It would not do to break the thing by accident. She kept them wrapped and the pouch stuffed with cloth; she worried about breaking them while carrying them, but Moiraine had indicated that Egwene would break them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt that was foolish, but the words she had read, the things Moiraine had said . . . Well, if the moment did come to break them, Egwene would need to have them at hand. And so she carried them—carried with her the potential death of the world itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand suddenly went as white as a sheet. \"Egwene\", he said. \"This does not fool me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What doesn’t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her. \"This is a fake. Please, it is all right. Tell me the truth. You made a copy and gave it to me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did nothing of the sort\", she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh . . . Oh, Light\" Rand raised the seal again. \"Its a fake\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What!\" Egwene snatched it from his hand, feeling it. She sensed nothing wrong. \"How can you be sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made them\", Rand said. \"I know my handiwork. That is not one of the seals. It is . . . Light, someone took them\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ve had these with me each moment since you gave them to me!\" Egwene said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it happened before\", Rand whispered. \"I didn’t look them over carefully after I fetched them. He knew, somehow, where I’d put them\". Taking the other one from her, he shook his head. \"It’s not real either\". He took the third. \"Nor this one\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her. \"He has them, Egwene. He’s stolen them back, somehow. The Dark One holds the keys to his own prison\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor much of Mat’s life, he had wished that people would not look at him so much. They gave him frowns at the trouble he had ostensibly caused—trouble that really was not his fault—and glances of disapproval when he walked about completely innocent, trying his best to be pleasant. Every boy filched a pie now and then. No harm in it. It was practically expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormal life had been harder for Mat than for other boys. For no good reason, everyone watched him extra carefully. Perrin could have stolen pies all day, and people would have just smiled at him and maybe mussed his hair. Mat they came at with the broom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he entered a place to dice, he drew looks. People watched him as they would watch a cheater—though he never was—or with envy in their eyes. Yes, he had always figured that not being watched would be a grand situation. A cause for real celebration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he had it, and it made him sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can look at me\", Mat protested. \"Really. Burn you, it’s all right!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My eyes would be lowered\", the serving woman said as she piled fabric on the low table against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your eyes are already lowered! They’re staring at the bloody floor, aren’t they? I want you to raise them\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seanchan continued her work. She was of fair skin with freckles under her eyes, not too bad to look at, though he was more in favor of darker shades these days. He still would not have minded if this girl showed him a smile. How could he talk to a woman if he could not try to make her smile?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few other servants entered, eyes downcast, carrying other folds of fabric. Mat stood in what were apparently \"his\" chambers in the palace. They were more numerous than he would ever need. Perhaps Talmanes and some of the Band could move in with him and keep the place from feeling so empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat sauntered over to the window. Below, in the Mol Hara, an army organized. It was going to take longer than he wanted. Galgan—Mat had only met the man briefly, and he did not trust the fellow, no matter what Tuon said about his assassins not being intended to succeed—was gathering the Seanchan forces from the borders, but too slowly. He worried about losing Almoth Plain with the withdrawal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he had better listen to reason. Mat had little reason to like the man already, but if he delayed in this . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honored One?\" the serving girl asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat turned, raising an eyebrow. Several da’covale had entered with the last of the fabric, and Mat found himself blushing. They hardly wore any clothing at all, and what they did wear was transparent. He could look, though, could he not? They would not wear clothing like that if a man was not supposed to look. What would Tuon think?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t own me, Mat thought, determined. I will not be husbandly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe freckled servant—she was so’jhin, half of her head shaved—gestured toward a person who had entered behind the da’covale, a middle-aged woman with her dark hair in a bun, none of her head shaved. She was squat, shaped kind of like a bell, with a grandmotherly air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newcomer inspected him. Finally someone who would look at him! If only her face did not have the expression of one studying horses at the market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Black for his new station\", the woman said, clapping her hands once. \"Green for his heritage. A deep forest, in moderation. Someone bring me a variety of eyepatches, and someone else burn that hat\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Mat exclaimed. Servants swarmed around him, picking at his clothing. \"Wait, now. What is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your new regalia, Honored One\", the woman said. \"I am Nata, and I will be your personal tailor\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren’t burning my hat\", Mat said. \"Try, and we’ll bloody well see if you can fly from four stories up. Do you understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman hesitated. \"Yes, Honored One. Do not burn his clothing. Keep it safe, should it be needed\". She seemed doubtful it ever would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat opened his mouth to complain further, and then one of the da’covale opened a box. Jewelry shone inside it. Rubies, emeralds, firedrops. Mat’s breath caught in his throat. There was a fortune in there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so stunned that he almost did not notice that the servants were undressing him. They pulled at his shirt, and Mat let them. Although he held on to his scarf, he was not bashful. That blush on his cheeks had nothing to do with his trousers being taken off. He was just surprised at the jewelry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen one of the young da’covale reached for Mat’s smallclothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You’d be real funny without any fi \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-125.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
