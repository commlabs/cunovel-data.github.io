He quickly jumped to his feet, now watching me warily. His cheek was split, but because he was in spirit form, the wound wasn’t bleeding. His body would be, though. Back at the barn, I bet crimson streaked his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on with you?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeed from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words whispered through my mind, and I didn’t care who had spoken them. Hunger gnawed at me, relentless. Yes, I would feed from him, would feast on his spirit. Scowling, I stalked forward. The red flames moved to my shoulders. I swung out my arm, but Cole ducked. He could have launched a counterattack, could have kicked my feet out from under me. Instead, he straightened, his hands fisting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t do this,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot my will. Do it, I would. I circled him, our gazes locked together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFEED!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead, finish your story,” I commanded, doing what he hadn’t done and kicking out my leg. His ankles knocked together, and he tumbled to the ground a second time. The bottom of his pants burned away, revealing another gash in his skin. A gash I had caused. My feet were also covered in red flames. “Help me be sure I hate you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that what it will take?” He stood, saying, “She went down on me. And you know what? I liked it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a screech, I lashed out at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dodged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have done it again, but my gaze caught on the fireworks exploding in the sky. One after the other, the other slayers were shooting off their flares. Everyone, it seemed, had spotted a zombie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA twig snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze whizzed to the left, and I saw red eyes peeking from the brittle wall of foliage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill don’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole moved closer to me, perhaps to protect me from the coming battle. When I scented him, my hunger spun out of control. I growled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped forward... When I’m done, there’ll be nothing left of him... The world around me began to darken, until a black sheet enveloped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think...Z.A. was trying to take over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI—she—continued forward in spite of the blindness, tripped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali,” Cole said, concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime seemed to slow down as I fell, landed. Sound faded from my ears. Except for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTick. Tock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Slaughter of the White Queen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked open my eyes and realized I couldn’t catch my breath. Why couldn’t I catch my breath?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took stock. I was standing. My clothes were torn, and I was splattered in black goo from the top of my head to the soles of my feet. I had cuts on my arms and stomach. My entire body was shaking, as if I’d run the treadmill for hours, all uphill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe forest around me had been torched. The trees were now naked, their leaves burned away, their branches covered with ash. Zombie ash? Or...slayer? The ground was just as bad, black and charred, no grass remaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole was on the ground, alive. Thank God! There were patches of black all over his skin. He’d been bitten multiple times, and his features were contorted with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali-gator,” he gasped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rushed to his side, and he flinched, as if he thought I meant to hurt him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. I remembered...throwing a punch at him. Yes, I’d thrown a punch, and he’d ducked. He’d told me about kissing Veronica, about the other stuff they’d done—even now I choked on a well of pain. A need to feed from him had consumed me, and I’d attacked him in earnest. Then...nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so, so sorry,” I said, sliding my hands under the hem of his pant leg. The antidote was strapped to his ankle. I freed the syringe, and though I was trembling uncontrollably, managed to shove the needle into his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d done this to me countless times, but I’d never had to do it to him. I remained by his side, watching, waiting. At last, the black began to fade from his skin, and he sagged into the decimated ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the cuts and gashes remained. At the barn, his body had to be covered in blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you not remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chewed on my bottom lip, shook my head. Z.A. had spoken to me—yes, that was right. Oh, good glory. She’d taken over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWincing, he sat up. He didn’t meet my gaze as he said, “Your eyes went red, Ali, just like the zombies. The creatures arrived and ignored you, treating you as if you were one of their own. You burned the trees and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped. “I burned the trees?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You touched them with the red flames, and the leaves instantly withered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears welled in my eyes, and they stung, as if they had been fermenting, ready to spring for weeks, but I hadn’t let them. “Did I do anything to you?” Was I responsible for any of the damage?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fingered the gash in his cheek. “Something’s going on with you, Ali,” he said, ignoring my question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had. I’d hurt him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I whispered. I couldn’t keep quiet anymore, whatever the consequences were for speaking out. I’d known I was a danger but hadn’t taken enough precautions to protect my friends. “Mr. Ankh told me my blood work was fine, but, Cole, that can’t be true. I’m filled with zombie toxin. It’s there, inside me, and it’s alive. A part of me. A new part. I’ve seen her—heard her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for hatred to gleam in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for a savage rage to be unleashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to kill me now. I was the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, confused. “Urges come, dark urges, and I find myself giving in. I never would have believed it unless—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell happened?” Gavin demanded, cutting me off with his arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over in time to see him and Veronica stalk past the trees I’d burned. Z.A. might have done it, but she’d used my hands. The realization still flayed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pair was as battle-wounded and dirty as Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole reached out, squeezed my wrist. “I don’t want you to say another word about this,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t plan to tell the others? Why? To protect me? Maybe. What would happen if the slayers learned what I’d done to him? I’d be thrown out, no question. And they’d be smart to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lumbered to his feet, dragging me with him. “Let’s get back to the barn,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cole!” Veronica rushed to his side and cradled his battered face, tilting his head from one side to the other to study his injuries. “Sugar, you look like you’ve been mauled by a bear. Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSugar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine.” Clearly uncomfortable, he set Veronica away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too wrung out to feel jealousy just then. Or anguish. Or longing. Yeah. Way too wrung out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swiped at the sting in my eyes with the back of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tossed me a glare meant to slay me on the spot. “I thought you had special powers or something like that. You should have protected him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I said sadly, “I should have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin wrapped his arms around my shoulders in a surprising show of support, and I leaned against him. I was getting more and more comfortable with contact with him—and I wouldn’t let myself think about what that meant. It wasn’t romantic, I told myself, and that was all that mattered. “Catfight round two can wait. Cole’s right. We need to get back to the barn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole stepped toward us, the menace I’d expected earlier now radiating from him. His gaze moved from Gavin to me, then to Gavin again. He looked 100 percent capable of murder. Then he stopped himself and spun away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo badly I wanted to follow him, to catch up to him. It was utter anguish denying myself—fine, I was feeling it—but I couldn’t risk another fight with him. Besides, I had a spy to catch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led the way through the forest, Veronica staying close to his heels. Along the way, we met up with Frosty and Justin, and I did some mental measuring. They were both about the size of the spy I’d seen. But then, so was Lucas. And Gavin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin also wore a bandanna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spy had to be someone close to our circle. I mean, the guy had known the location of Cole’s barn and that we would be on patrol tonight. But...I didn’t want to accuse any of the slayers. I might not be able to trust myself right now, but I did trust my friends. Even, surprisingly enough, Gavin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a lot of ways, he was like Cole. He got in your face with his with beliefs and opinions. He was fearless, cared nothing about consequences. But he was fierce when it came to the safety of his friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a lot to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I’m about to say is true, so I’m not simply making it true in your life by speaking it, if you know what I mean, but she’s a terrible enemy to have,” Gavin said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who? Veronica?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. I’d had enemies before, and I would make many more, I was sure. “What do guys see in her anyway? I mean, she’s beautiful, but that’s all she’s got going for her.” I think what I was really asking was—what did Cole see in her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGavin looked straight ahead. “She’s actually a very nice person, but envy has turned you both into raving— Well. Never mind. I want to keep my balls. As I was saying, she’s smart, and she’s funny, and the best part is, she puts out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas sex always on his mind? “Your words are like poetry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, saying, “I admit I’d like to take her to bed, have since the day I met her, and she’d let me, I think, if she weren’t so determined to win back Cole, but unlike your Mr. Holland, I’ve never hooked up with another slayer. I like to keep business separate from pleasure. A cliché, I know, but there are far less complications that way. As I’m sure Cole is learning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a slayer,” I pointed out, “and yet you keep asking me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re also not my type. Or you weren’t. I’m not sure what my type is anymore. You resist, and it drives me wild.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-zombie-glass-white-rabbit-chronicles-2/page-31.html","bookId":2521,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:05 PM"}
