The combination of searing light and dark shadows stops me from seeing anything. He doesn\u0027t look at me, must be focused on whatever it is he\u0027s going to do to me. He turns his back and puts something down on the chair; then he puts the lamp on the floor in the corner of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s that smell? Christ, it\u0027s beautiful. Smells like hot food... some kind of soup, I think. But it can\u0027t be, can it? Can you imagine a smell? Is this another trick my tired mind\u0027s playing on me? Mallon turns around and moves closer. He\u0027s left a tray on the chair. There\u0027s a bowl on it with steam snaking up, and next to it is a plastic bottle full of water. My stomach starts to growl and churn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be damn hungry,\" he says, his deep voice filling the room. I stop myself answering with the words on the very tip of my tongue, remembering at the last second what he is and what his kind have done to people like me. \"You look hungry. You must be starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans over me, and I instinctively strain against my chains to get to him. Maybe this time I\u0027ll reach him...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy arms and legs hurt too much, and I quickly drop back down. Bastard doesn\u0027t even flinch. He knows I\u0027m not going anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You smell of piss,\" he says, laughing at me and shaking his head. \"You\u0027re in a bad way, big man! Lost, all alone, chained up, and soaked with piss!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help trying to lunge forward again, but the pain\u0027s intense, and this time I hardly move. He looks me in the eye and raises his hand. I screw my eyes shut and tense up, ready for him to hit me-but the pain doesn\u0027t come. I feel him tugging on the wide strap across my forehead. He loosens it slightly, then steps back. I still can\u0027t lift my head up, but at least I\u0027ve got some side-to-side movement now. The freedom is bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallon picks up the tray and sits down on the chair opposite. He sniffs the soup or stew or whatever it is, then takes a spoonful and holds it up to his lips. He stops just before he eats it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want some of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFucker knows how much I want it. He\u0027s playing games with me again, and I have to resist. I won\u0027t give him the satisfaction of a response. Won\u0027t lower myself to speak to him. I watch his every move as he blows steam away, then takes a mouthful. He closes his eyes and shakes his head with pleasure, deliberately overdoing it for effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s good... You know, Danny, it\u0027s getting harder and harder to find food like this these days. I\u0027m betting it\u0027s been a long time since you\u0027ve tasted anything as good as this soup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eats more. I want him to stop. Please don\u0027t eat it all...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s chicken, you know. It\u0027s out of a can, of course, but man, you can still taste the meat. I don\u0027t even know if it really is meat, but oh, this is damn fine soup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe puts down the spoon and opens the bottle of water. My mouth and throat are dry. My tongue feels ten times its normal size, like it\u0027s too big for my mouth. He takes a huge swig of water, then gasps with overstated pleasure when he\u0027s done. My eyes are fixed on him, and he knows it. My stomach churns again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gets up and carries the tray over. I stare at the steam coming from the soup and watch it disappear into the air, trying to imagine what it tastes like. Can\u0027t remember the last time I ate hot food...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can have this,\" he tells me, putting the tray down on my chest. I watch it going up and down with my fast, nervous breathing. I feel the heat from the soup on my body. \"You can have all this and more; you just have to do one thing. You know what that is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t react. Don\u0027t know and I don\u0027t want to know. I don\u0027t have anything this sick fucker could want. But if there is something, something I haven\u0027t thought about that matters, then I know he\u0027ll keep pushing. And the longer I act dumb, the harder he\u0027ll have to push. If I stay silent long enough, he\u0027ll have to tell me something to keep this bullshit interrogation moving along. He clears his throat to speak again. Predictable bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All you have to do, Danny,\" he says, leaning closer, \"is talk to me. We don\u0027t even have to have a proper conversation. You can just tell me to fuck off if you like. All I want is to hear your voice. I just want you to respond to me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t do it. I\u0027d rather starve. He waits, looking at me hopefully. Keep waiting, fucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems strange to me,\" he eventually whispers after he\u0027s been watching for a couple of minutes, \"that someone like you who\u0027s obviously so hungry and thirsty can\u0027t bring themselves to just do one small thing to get what they need so badly. No one else is going to know about it, Danny. No one\u0027s watching...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay focused. I look up at the ceiling and count the cracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really are strange, strange people. If I had the time and inclination to wait and watch, I think you really would rather lie there until you die than drop your guard. Crazy behavior...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans over me until his face is all I can see. I start to tense my body again, but he gently pushes me back down with one hand, and I know there\u0027s nothing I can do. I make eye contact and refuse to break it. I\u0027ll kill him when I get out of here. I\u0027ll rip his damn body apart, smash his face into the wall...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallon sighs. He shakes his head with feigned disappointment, then picks up the tray and puts it back on the chair. I stare at the bottle of water, still three-quarters full, and watch the few last wisps of steam rising up from the soup. He stands in the open doorway with the lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All you have to do is talk to me. Just say something... anything...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause; then he shakes his head again and leaves. He slams and locks the door, and the room is plunged back into total darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eiv\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE Hate were vast and incalculable. While the impact was predominantly felt by the surviving population-those remaining on both sides of the Change-its effects reached much, much further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very nature of the division that had unequally split the human race in two had caused irreparable damage to every area of life where two people or more were expected to work together. Basic services had faltered and collapsed within a matter of days. There then followed a frantic, barely coordinated period of reprioritization as the remaining Unchanged resources were diverted to the maintenance of vital services and defense. Within weeks, however, even the most basic of public services had either fallen apart or been brought to its knees. A government of sorts (with a civilian mouthpiece but under military control) continued to try to coordinate what remained of the country\u0027s infrastructure. City and district councils either were dissolved or collapsed. All schools were closed. The hospitals and the health service couldn\u0027t cope. What was left of the police force and fire brigade were absorbed into the military.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concentration of huge masses of refugees in hopelessly unprepared locations also presented a constant string of enormous, virtually insurmountable, logistical and practical problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lack of food, shelter, and adequate medical care aside, water, gas, and electricity supplies failed with astonishing speed as power stations, pumps, and pipelines were abandoned, destroyed, or disabled. With every single person without exception being dragged into the war, those installations and facilities that remained operational longest were frequently those that could function unmanned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evacuation of the Unchanged masses to city center camps simply concentrated and exacerbated the problems faced by the authorities. Extremely limited utility supplies were maintained, with all available water, gas, and power being diverted to the military as priority. Fuck the civilians, there\u0027s a war to be won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout adequate supplies of clean water and basic medical care, the refugee camps quickly became breeding grounds for disease. Previously easily curable ailments rapidly became killers, and small outbreaks and infestations quickly became epidemics. Most bodies were collected and burned, but scores of others inevitably remained undetected. The almost total lack of sanitation compounded the problem dramatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the cities, the closely confined masses of refugees continued to produce vast amounts of garbage, none of which was collected or treated. As well as quickly becoming a physical hazard, the huge quantities of waste that quickly gathered also contributed to the acceleration of disease. Rats and other vermin benefited from suddenly plentiful supplies of food, and those drains and sewers that had not been damaged by the fighting instead became blocked with debris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom late May onward, an increase in temperature combined with frequent heavy downpours of rain to further accelerate the decline in conditions in the refugee camps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery available scrap of indoor space had been utilized to house the displaced, but inevitably the demand far outweighed what was available. As a result, huge numbers of people were left outside. Some were housed in tents, RVs, and trailers, but most made do with temporary shelters constructed from whatever materials they could find. More than 30 percent of the total population of the refugee camp was forced to live outdoors-hundreds of thousands of exhausted, vulnerable, malnourished people left to the mercy of the elements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Block it up!\" Mark yelled as rainwater poured in through the broken top-floor hotel window. The room was dark, almost pitch black despite it normally being bright at this time in the morning. The stormy dawn sky over the city was swollen with rain. It had been falling with the force of bullets for more than fifteen minutes already and showed no signs of abating. The guttering and drainpipes serving the dilapidated old building couldn\u0027t cope with the sheer amount of water flushing through them. A blocked section of gutter had overflowed, and the water had seeped behind a rotting fascia board, then flooded through the window frame. More water seeped through a broken pane of glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Block it with what?\" Kate shouted, using a bucket, a wastebasket, cups, and whatever else she could find to catch the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Stay there. I\u0027ll go and find something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go outside,\" she pleaded, struggling with her heavily pregnant bulk to turn around and stop him. \"Please, Mark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just to the end of the hall, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t give her time to answer. He weaved around the bottom of the double bed, where Katie\u0027s traumatized elderly parents lay terrified, cold, and wet, then ran past the permanently locked bathroom door. He unlocked the main door, took off the security chain, and put his head outside. Just a handful of people out on the landing-a rain-soaked woman from the room next door (who obviously had problems similar to his) and the Chinese guy with his three kids who slept in the broken elevator. Mark looked up and down, then spied a wooden hatch on the wall between two of the opposite rooms. The fire hose that used to be hidden behind the small square door was missing. He pulled at the hatch, then pushed down on it from above, feeling the hinges begin to weaken. A few seconds of violent shaking and pulling and he yanked it free with an almighty splintering crack. He ran back to room 33 with it, stopping only to pull the one remaining curtain down from the side of a large gallery window overlooking the street below. Jesus Christ, things looked bad down there. Crowds of people were pressed up against the sides of buildings, desperate for whatever shelter they could find, woken without warning by an early morning deluge of ice-cold rain. The main street itself, Arley Road, a wide, relatively straight, and gently sloping strip of pavement, looked more like a river. A fast-moving, debris-carrying torrent of rainwater surged down it toward the center of town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the hotel room, Mark threw the curtain to Kate, who started mopping up the water that was still cascading down the glass, then spilling down the windowsill and soaking the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s that?!\" Kate\u0027s elderly, confused father yelled in panic, lifting his head off the pillow for the first time in hours. \"Is it one of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to him, her mother lay on her side, sobbing, the dirty bedclothes pulled up tight under her chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just Mark, Dad,\" Kate shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s me, Joe,\" Mark said, leaning closer to the old man so he could see his face. He\u0027d lost his glasses weeks ago. Mark didn\u0027t know whether he recognized him or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark leaned the hatch door against the window over the broken glass and used a phone directory to wedge and hold it in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save the water,\" he said to Kate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rainwater... save it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the bathtub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flow of water into the room temporarily plugged, Kate carried the half-full bucket across the room, her bare feet squelching on the damp carpet. She knocked on the bathroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief pause; then the latch clicked and the door opened. Another adult refugee appeared, her face drawn and haggard-looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything okay?\" she asked. Kate nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark said we should try to save the water in the tub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman nodded and took the bucket from her. Mark passed her several water-filled cups that he\u0027d collected from by the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes sense to try to hoard as much as we can,\" he said, taking back the empty bucket. She nodded but didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flood stemmed temporarily, Kate walked away and sat down exhausted on a rain-splashed chair next to her parents. Her mother continued to sob, but Kate couldn\u0027t face trying to comfort her. Instead she closed her eyes and ran her hands over her swollen stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark picked up the last pot of water and carried it to the bathroom. The rain seemed to finally be easing. The woman in the shadows took it from him and emptied it into the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Lizzie,\" he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-21.html","bookId":2556,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM"}
