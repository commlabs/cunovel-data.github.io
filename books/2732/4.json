My lie detecting skills told me she was one hundred percent genuine. “What can I get for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to match her, teeth for teeth. “A medium soy latte, please. And a job application.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl’s smile faltered slightly as she punched in the code on the register. “I’m sorry, Ma’am. We aren’t hiring at the moment. But the Christmas season will be here soon and we’ll be taking on more people then. Would you like to fill out an application?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow desperate did I want to look? Was I even going to be in Palm Valley next month? Was I even going to be in Palm Valley by the end of the week?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I found myself nodding, with the smile frozen on my face. She passed me the paper and I gave her money, making sure to tip her extra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your name?” she asked, her pen poised and ready on the cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellie,” I answered. To my own ears it sounded fake, but she just nodded and scribbled it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked down the bar and loitered inconspicuously near the counter while I waited, looking over the form. I could easily forge my past references if I needed to. I had some friends spread out all over the country for just that kind of thing, and then when they called me in for an interview, I could show them how skilled I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that it was a crazy complicated skill, but operating an espresso machine during high traffic could be added to my repertoire along with card tricks and how to fire a Colt .45. But what was the point in getting a job here when I might as well get a job anywhere else in the country? Seattle was the birthplace of coffee in North America and I’d never lived there yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI folded the application haphazardly and tried to stick it in the back pocket of my jeans but I felt it fall out and flutter to the floor behind me. I turned around to see a man bent over, picking it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw the top of his head first, saw shaggy dark brown hair that curled down the nape of his neck. Then, as he rose, application in hand, I saw dark, arched brows over crystal clear blue eyes. A septum ring that acted like an exclamation point at the end of his slim nose. A striking pair of lips: thin and curved on top, full and wide on the bottom. A few day’s worth of stubble all over his chin and jaw. He looked like a male model and I found my breath hitching as I took him in, from his nice height and all-too-firm build, to the way he wore his cargo shorts and his aged Iggy Pop tee like a second skin. His arms were covered in tattoos, an intensely colorful mixture of skulls, animals, and campiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally breathed out when he tucked a strand of hair behind his ears. His ears kind of stuck out like Dumbo. This was good. This stranger had flaws. I couldn’t stand perfect people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was handing me the application and smiling at me. And in that smile, the way it took a few seconds to reach his eyes, an expression that darkened momentarily before brightening, I felt a rush of déjà vu that nearly knocked me over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew him. How did I know him? And how long had I been standing there staring at him like an idiot? I was usually a lot smoother than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You dropped this,” he said. He had an interesting voice, low but precise, like he could narrate Rosetta Stone DVDs. It pushed pleasure buttons along my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the application from him, our fingers brushing against each other. I felt a spark, electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, literally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ow,” I said, as I snatched my hand and the application away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned sheepishly and shoved his hands in his pockets. “Sorry. I’m a good conductor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him while blindly refolding the application. He continued, “Of electricity. You know, the sparks. I just shocked you. I’m not a train conductor or anything. Or like a music conductor. Although I do play guitar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was babbling, and if I didn’t know any better, I’d say he was nervous. But that would beget the question of why the hell this hunk of man was nervous around me. I wasn’t ugly by any means. I had my mother’s Estonian features, which meant high cheekbones, heart-shaped lips, and dark, hooded eyes. But my beauty was always more of a “hey, I never actually realized how pretty you were.” If I was just standing in the corner of a room, your eyes would pass over me. I’d go unnoticed. And I liked that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I was walking, well that was another story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellie!” the barista announced in a surprisingly strong voice. Must have been all the coffee she drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot the man a quick smile, painfully aware that in the last minute, all I’d said to him was “ow,” and plucked the steaming drink off the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew it,” he said with a snap of his fingers, and I slowly turned around, bringing the cup to my lips and gauging how scalding it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Knew what?” I asked. Hot. Coffee was way too hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned at me as if he’d just solved a Rubik’s cube, and I felt myself get a weird flutter in my stomach. I knew I should have eaten more than beef jerky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re Ellie Watt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh fudgeknuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned back around and slapped a lid on my cup with shaking hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew me. Hot tattoo dude knew me and I didn’t know him. This wasn’t good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned back to face him and shot him my biggest smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go,” I said. When in doubt, just go. My parents had taught me that, along with “never underestimate your mark” and “emotions don’t win the game.” It’s too bad they were as hypocritical as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a step to leave, my eyes newly focused on the door, but he reached out, grabbing my free arm. I flinched, expecting another spark to flow through me, but it was just his warm, strong hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” he said, lowering his voice and coming a step closer. He smelled peculiar. It wasn’t bad—actually it was quite a sensual smell, but it was something I couldn’t put my finger on. Earthy and industrial. Cinnamon and…ink?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dared to meet his eyes. He was so close I could see the contact ring around his baby blues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you remember me?” he asked. His eyes flashed between expectation and edginess. Like if I didn’t remember who he was, he wouldn’t be smiling for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I had no idea who this guy was. And I felt like kicking myself for it. My luck usually had me running into assholes, not hot guys I wanted to lick from head to toe (though they often were one and the same).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his hand off of me and I relaxed. I tried to look as apologetic as possible. “I’m sorry, you’d think I’d remember someone like you but I don’t. I have a bad memory, don’t take it personally.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Somehow I doubt that,” he said under his breath. I eyed him quizzically. Was that to the bad memory remark (which wasn’t true) or to the—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Camden McQueen,” he said quickly. The name ran along the length of my brain like rain on hardened soil before really sinking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt guilt before anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze narrowed on my face, still beautiful but dark. “Oh, so you do remember me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Camden McQueen I pulled up from my memory banks did not look like the tattooed and pierced sex on a stick I had standing before me. The Camden McQueen I remembered was tall, yes, but gawky. Awkward. Back when he was a teenager, his broad-shouldered build had gone to waste. That Camden had gross, long black hair down to his mid-back. He was a fan of dog collars and black lipstick and lace gloves with the fingers cut out. He wore black all the time. He always had mysterious bandages on his arms, something you’d see if he wasn’t wearing his trademark long black trench coat. He wore that thing in the middle of the summer when seniors were dying from the heat. He loved music and art and spent long hours in the darkroom. Everyone called him The Dark Queen, and there were a few vicious rumors running around that he was gay, or into bestiality, and that he carried a gun to class. He was the most bullied, most tortured kid in the whole of Palm Valley High School.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” I said softly, trying to match up the Camden I had known to the Camden I saw now. “You look different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face relaxed and went back to looking all model-like. “So do you. Your hair…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached forward and brushed a piece of hair away from my face. My body froze at his touch and my eyes widened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s nice,” he said, taking his hand away. “I always thought the long blonde hair was a bit too Barbie on someone as…tough…as you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is tough supposed to be a synonym for bitch?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and that hadn’t changed at all. It was one of those laughs that made you believe the joke was always on him. “Well, I was going to say angry but I suppose that’s kind of redundant, isn’t it? So what are you doing here? I haven’t seen you since high school.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, just paying a visit to my uncle. Just passing through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his brow. “Just passing through and you’re applying for jobs at a coffee shop?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. That whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged and looked around the store with a stupid smile stretched on my lips. “It’s nice here. I was surprised how much it’s changed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe you’re the one who’s changed?” he questioned. His eyes were still clear and bright, jovial enough, but I detected something off-putting in his tone. He was testing me. And he was right to do it. We hadn’t exactly ended on good terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI punched his arm lightly with my free hand. So, so awkward. “You’re the one who’s changed, Camden. Wow.” I almost said “What happened to you?” but thought that was a bit patronizing. “What, uh, what’s new?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked behind him at an empty table near the giggling tube-top girls who were now tight-lipped tube-top girls. They had been watching him with googly eyes and quickly averted them as soon as he looked their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, with his face coming back to mine, he looked hopeful. That was the look I recognized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have to be somewhere? Do you want to catch up over some coffee?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost said no. I almost told him I actually did have somewhere to be, even though I had nowhere to go and would just end up driving aimlessly for hours. But he smiled and the combination of those white teeth, the septum ring, and that messy hair made my heart beat against my chest, shrugging off the pills like a heavy coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I said yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl had somehow survived her first week of high school, though as she walked down the dust-heavy road that led to her uncle’s house, she felt that was as triumphant as surviving military boot camp. Already she’d earned the nicknames “Sir-Limps-A-Lot” (which didn’t make much sense considering her gender), “The Gimp,” and “Crippled Cow.” The cow part, of course, was for the fact that she’d gained a bit of weight since the accident. Something that was somewhat inevitable when you combined the burgeoning hormones of a thirteen-year-old and her limited ability. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sins-needles-the-artists-trilogy-1/page-4.html","bookId":2732,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:30:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:30:20 PM"}
