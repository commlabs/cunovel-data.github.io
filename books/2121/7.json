She was in the cab and she\u0027d seen it all: Schuyler\u0027s jump, Dylan coming after, the chase, the reversal. She\u0027d witnessed Dylan\u0027s anguish and Schuyler\u0027s mastery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God, don\u0027t let her have killed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dylan!\" Bliss kneeled by his side. He lay facedown on the sidewalk, so she turned him over gently and took him in her arms. He was so thin...just skin and bones underneath a T-shirt. She held him tenderly like a baby bird. He was damaged and pathetic, but he was hers. Tears streamed down her cheeks. \"Dylan!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she\u0027d arrived home after her go-see appointment and he wasn\u0027t there to meet her as they\u0027d planned, she\u0027d known immediately that something was wrong. She called Oliver and told him to meet her at the Perry Street apartment building as soon as he could. Dylan had been saying all along he was going to do something, and now he had. Luckily, Bliss knew where to find him because she knew Schuyler\u0027s secret and where she was going to be that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan opened his eyes. He recoiled when he saw Bliss, and then turned to Schuyler and snarled in a deep, booming rumble, \"Argento Croatus!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you insane?\" Schuyler asked, Oliver standing by protectively. She couldn\u0027t believe her ears. Dylan had just called her a Silver Blood. What was going on? What had happened to him? Why did his voice sound like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dylan, stop it. Sky - he doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s talking about,\" Bliss said nervously. \"Dylan, please, you\u0027re not making sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan spaced out, his pupils dilating rapidly as if a flashlight were shining in his eyes. Then he started laughing in a high-pitched squeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve known he was back and you didn\u0027t tell me,\" Schuyler said, and the accusation hung in the air between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Bliss took a sharp breath. \"I didn\u0027t want to tell you because...\" Because you would tell the Conclave. You would have them take him away. And yes, he\u0027s changed. He\u0027s different. He\u0027s not the same. Something awful and unspeakable has happened to him. But I still love him. You understand, don\u0027t you? You, who wait in an apartment for a boy who does not arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler nodded. The two of them understood each other without speaking. It was the vampire way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still, he can\u0027t be like this; we\u0027ve got to get him help.\" Schuyler moved closer to the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t touch me,\" Dylan snarled. Suddenly, he leaped to his feet and grabbed Bliss by the throat, his bony fingers pressing violently on her pale neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re not going to help me, then you\u0027re one of them,\" he said menacingly, tightening his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBliss began to cry. \"Dylan...don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler lunged toward Dylan, but Oliver restrained her. \"Wait,\" he said. \"Wait - I can\u0027t let you get hurt again...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Dylan pushed Bliss further and further with his mind, his fury relentless, his power only more frightening in its recklessness. Bliss dropped to her knees. There would be no telepathic gymnastics on her part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Schuyler\u0027s turn to scream. Schuyler\u0027s turn to beg him to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan took no notice of them, and stroked Bliss\u0027s cheek with his other hand. He leaned in, his mouth on her neck. Schuyler could see his fangs appear. They were about to draw blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...Dylan...please,\" Bliss whispered. \"No...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go.\" Schuyler shook Oliver off her. Bliss watched as her friend frantically prepared an incantation that would break Dylan\u0027s hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut just before Schuyler could send the coercion, Dylan\u0027s shoulders shook and he sank to the ground of his own volition, abruptly releasing his victim. Bliss crumpled to the floor, violet imprints from his fingers blooming on her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDylan put his head between his knees and sobbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell just happened?\" he cried, and finally his was a voice Bliss recognized. For the first time that evening, Dylan sounded like himself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/revelations-blue-bloods-3/page-7.html","bookId":2121,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:06 PM"}
