Next minute they reappearedcarrying a full-length portrait. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It represented a woman of forty or thereabouts, with a yellowface, very long and disproportionately large for the frail, sicklybody it surmounted, and dressed in an unpretending black gown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She wore a sad, submissive look. Her grey eyes bespoke a contriteand fearful heart, the cheeks were pendulous and the loose chinalmost touched the bosom. Jean scrutinized the poor, pitifulface, but could recall no memory in connection with it.
