{"id":88811,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll change your mind,\" Thierry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn instant later everything was chaos. Thierry had one hand in her hair, twisting her head to the side,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexposing her neck. His other arm was keeping both her arms trapped against her body. Hannah was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etwisting, struggling-and it wasn\u0027t doing any good. He was unbelievably strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the warmth of breath on her neck . .. and then the sharpness of teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t fight.\" Thierry\u0027s muffled voice came to her. \"You\u0027ll only make it hurt worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah fought. And it did hurt. The pain of having blood drawn out against her will was like nothing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe\u0027d ever felt. It was as if her soul was being pulled out of her body, a pain that radiated down her neck\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand through her left shoulder and arm. It turned her vision gray and made her feel lightheaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-hate-you,\" she got out. She tried to reach for him with her mind, to see if she could hurt him that way .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . but it was like running up against an obsidian wall. She could feel nothing of Thierry in the contact, just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmooth black hardness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForget about that, the cool wind voice said. And don\u0027t faint; you\u0027ve got to stay conscious. Think about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour room. You need wood; you need a weapon. Where...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she thought it, Thierry\u0027s grip on her was shifting. He was forcing her to turn so she faced away\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom him, still holding her in an iron grip with one arm. She had no idea what he was doing with the other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earm until he spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to give you back something for what I took.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the other arm was in front of Hannah, wrist pressing to her mouth. She still didn\u0027t really\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstand-she was dazed with pain and loss of blood-until she felt warm liquid trickling into her mouth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand tasted a strange exotic taste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God-no. It\u0027s his blood. You\u0027re drinking vampire blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried not to swallow, but the liquid kept flowing in, choking her. It didn\u0027t taste at all like blood. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas rich and wild and burned slightly-and she could almost feel it changing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve got to stop this, the cool wind voice told her. New.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a violent wrench that almost dislocated her shoulder, Hannah got one arm free. Then she started to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efight hard, not because she wanted to get away, but because she wanted to keep Thierry occupied in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eholding her. While they were struggling, she surreptitiously reached out with her free hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t feel it. She threw her body back and forth, trying to get Thierry to move closer to the desk. Just a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle farther... there. There!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers were on her desk. She stomped on Thierry\u0027s foot to keep him distracted. She heard a snarl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof pain and Thierry shook her, but her fingers kept groping across the desk until they found something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmooth and long, with a pointed graphite end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pencil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah curled her fingers, gathering the pencil into her fist. She was gasping with effort, which meant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore of the strange blood was flowing into her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow think. Visualize his hand. Picture the pencil going right in, all the way through. And now strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah brought the pencil up with all her strength, driving it into the back of Thierry\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard a yelp of pain and outrage-and at the same instant she felt a stab of pain herself. She\u0027d driven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe pencil all the way through his hand and jabbed her own cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t spend time worrying about it. The iron grip on her had loosened. She slammed a foot into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry\u0027s shin and spun away as he jerked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desk! You need another weapon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as the voice was telling her, Hannah was teaching for her desk, gathering a random handful of pens\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand pencils. Thank God for her habit of losing pencils, which was the reason she had to keep so many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she had them, she twisted to dart across the room, getting her back to a wall. She faced\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry, panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This next one goes right into your heart,\" she told him, pulling one pencil out of the handful and holding it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein her fist. Her voice was soft and ragged, but absolutely deadly in its conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hurt me!\" Thierry had pulled the pencil out and was staring at the wound. His face was contorted,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis eyes blazing with animal pain and fury. He looked like a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Hannah said, panting. \"And if you come close to me again, I\u0027ll kill you. That\u0027s a promise. Now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eget the hell out of my house and out of my life!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry stared back and forth from her to his hand. Then he snarled-really snarled, his upper lip lifting,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis teeth bared. Hannah had never seen a human face look so bestial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be sorry,\" he said, like a child in a temper tantrum. \"And if you tell anybody about this, I\u0027ll kill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem. I will. It\u0027s Night World law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he did the fade-out thing. Hannah blinked and he wasn\u0027t there. He must have backed up down the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehall, but she didn\u0027t hear a door open or close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was several minutes before she could loosen her grip on her pencil or step away from the wall. When\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe could, it was to stumble toward the phone. She pressed the speed dial for Chess\u0027s number. Busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah dropped the phone. She was swaying on her feet, feeling sick and giddy, but she headed for the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edining room. There, keeping one of the windows shut, was a wooden dowel, the remnant of some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elong-past safety craze of her mother\u0027s. Hannah broke it over her knee and carried one splinter-ended\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epiece with her to the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dusty old Ford was parked there, the one her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efather had driven before he died. Hannah found the keys and started for Chess\u0027s house. She could think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof only one thing: she didn\u0027t want to be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray spots danced in front of her eyes as she drove. She kept imagining things rushing at her from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprairie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay awake. Just stay awake, she told herself, biting her lip hard enough to draw blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere! There\u0027s the house up ahead. You can see the light. All you have to do is get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped on the accelerator. And then everything went gray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry looked around the resort lobby, then glanced at his watch. He\u0027d been doing that every five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eminutes for about the last twelve hours, and his nerves were starting to fray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t like leaving Hannah alone. Of course, the ring would protect her when she was away from the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehouse, and the amulet he\u0027d buried in her backyard would protect the house itself. It was a strong amulet,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade for him by Grandma Harman, the oldest and most powerful witch in the world, the Crone of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInner Circle. It set wards around the house, so that no Night Person could enter without a direct\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einvitation from somebody who lived inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still didn\u0027t like leaving Hannah alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a little while longer, he told himself. It had \u0027taken him most of last night and all of today to call in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenough of his own people to set up a plan for watching over Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d told him to go away, and he had. Her word was law to him. But that didn\u0027t mean he couldn\u0027t have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher guarded. She need never realize that there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere Night People around her, watching and waiting in the shadows-and ready to fight to the death if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eany danger appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe had been right. He couldn\u0027t deal with this alone. And now he was going to have to rely on other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epeople to keep Hannah safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry looked at his watch again. It was nine o\u0027clock at night, and he was almost tempted to give up on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCirce. But only a witch of her power could set up the kind of heavy-duty wards that would protect\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah wherever she went in Amador County.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept waiting. As he did, he stared at a gun rack on the wall and tried to keep his brain turned off. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since he\u0027d awoken Hannah from her hypnotic trance, he\u0027d been trying very hard not to think about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe old days. But now, he found himself being irresistibly drawn back-not only thinking about them, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereliving them. Traveling back in his mind to the stupid young man he had been....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t been the first vampire. He didn\u0027t have that distinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had only been the second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d grown up in the tribe of Maya and Hellewise. The Maya and Hellewise, the twin daughters of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHecate Witch Queen. The Maya and Hellewise who would go down as the two greatest figures in Night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorld history; Hellewise Hearth-Woman as the ancestress of the Harman family, the most famous of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eliving witches, and Maya as the ancestress of both the lamia and the made vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut of course he knew nothing about that at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he knew was that they were both pretty girls. Beautiful. Hellewise had long yellow hair and deep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrown eyes. Maya had long black hair and eyes that glittered in different colors like the changing lights in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea glacier. He liked both sisters very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was his downfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been a very ordinary fellow, with a good throwing arm, a delicate touch in carving ivory, and a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evague longing to see the world. He\u0027d taken it for granted that his tribe was special, that they could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einfluence the weather and summon animals from the forest. They were the witch people, they\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egranted special powers, and that was all. It wasn\u0027t anything to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, like everyone else, he knew that Maya was doing experiments in the forest, using her powers to try\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand become immortal. But that didn\u0027t worry him particularly either....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was very young and very, very stupid, Thierry thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been the real downfall of the tribe. Maya\u0027s desire to become immortal. Because she\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewilling to pay any price for it, even to the point of becoming a monster and leaving a curse on all her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edescendants. Maybe if Thierry and the other witch people had realized that, they could have stopped her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Maya had finally found the right spell to achieve immortality. The problem was that to do it, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad to steal the babies of the tribe. All four of them. She took them out to the forest, did the spell, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edrank their blood. Thierry and the rest of the tribe found the four little bled-out bodies later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHellewise had cried all night. Thierry, who couldn\u0027t understand how the pretty girl he liked could have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edone something so awful, cried, too. Maya herself had disappeared completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a few nights later she came to Thierry. He was keeping watch outside the cave when she appeared\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esilently beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t the pretty girl he knew anymore. She was stunningly, dazzlingly beautiful. But she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edifferent. She moved with the grace of a nighttime predator, and her eyes reflected the firelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was very pale, but that only made her more lovely. Her mouth, which had always been soft and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einviting, seemed red as blood. And when she smiled at him, he saw her long pointed teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Theory,\" she said-that was his name back then. \"I want to make you immortal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry was scared out of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea what she\u0027d become-some weird creature with unnatural teeth. But he knew he had no\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edesire at all to be like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really think it\u0027s unfair, the way you go back and forth between me and Hellewise,\" she said casually,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esitting down on the bare earth. \"So I\u0027ve decided to resolve the question. You\u0027re going to be mine, now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out and took his hand. Her fingers were very slender and very cold-and unbelievably\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrong. Thierry couldn\u0027t pull away. He stared at his hand with his mouth open like the idiot he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the time he should have started yelling, thrashing, doing anything to attract attention and get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway. But Maya seemed to hold him with her eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike a snake holding a bird. She was unnatural and evil... but she was so beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first and the last time that Thierry would be fascinated by the beauty of pure evil-but it was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenough. He was doomed from that moment. He\u0027d doomed himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn instant of hesitation. He would pay for it for unimaginable years in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not so bad,\" Maya was saying, still fixing him with her terrible and lovely eyes. \"There are a few\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethings I had to figure out-a few things I didn\u0027t expect. I thought drinking the blood of the babies would be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe end of it, but no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry felt sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got these teeth for a reason, apparently. It seems I have to drink the blood of a mortal creature\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eevery day, or I die. It\u0027s inconvenient, but I can live with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry whispered something beginning with, \"Oh, Hecate, Dark Mother-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, stop that!\" Maya made a sharp gesture. \"No praying, please, and especially not to that old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eharridan. I\u0027m not a witch anymore. I\u0027m something completely new-I suppose I should think of a name for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emyself. Night-hunter... blood-drinker ... I don\u0027t know, the possibilities are endless. I\u0027m going to start a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enew race, Theorn. We\u0027ll be better than the witches, stronger, faster-and we\u0027ll live forever. We\u0027ll never\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edie, so we\u0027ll rule everyone. And you\u0027re going to be my first convert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Thierry said. He still thought he had a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m going to have a baby-not with you, I\u0027m afraid; I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll be able to-and the baby will\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave my blood. And I\u0027m going to give my blood to other people the way I\u0027ll give it to you now. Someday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere won\u0027t be anyone in the world who won\u0027t have my blood. It\u0027s a nice thought, isn\u0027t it?\" She rested her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echin on a fist and her eyes glittered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hellewise will stop you,\" Thierry said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sister? No, I don\u0027t think so. Especially not since I\u0027ll have you to help me. She likes you, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be hard for her to kill somebody she likes so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She won\u0027t have to. I\u0027ll kill you,\" Thierry snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya laughed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You? You? Don\u0027t you know yourself yet? You\u0027re not a killer-you don\u0027t have the guts for it. That will\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echange, of course, after I give you my blood. But you won\u0027t want to kill me then. You\u0027ll join me-and be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappy. You\u0027ll see.\" She dusted off her hands as if a difficult negotiation had been accomplished and terms\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad been reached. \"Now. Let\u0027s do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was strong. He had that good throwing arm-he was dead accurate with a spear or a killing stick. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was so much stronger that she could handle him like a baby. The first thing she did was clamp a hand\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eacross his mouth-because by this time it had occurred even to stupid Thierry that he was in very bad\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrouble, and that he needed help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sound of a struggle as she dragged him off into the bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid this is going to hurt,\" she said. She was lying on top of him, her eyes glittering into his. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas excited. \"At least, all the animals I\u0027ve caught seem to have found it very unpleasant. But it\u0027s for your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eown good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she ripped his throat out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what it felt like. And that was when he realized what those long canine teeth were for. Like any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elynx or cave lion or wolf, she needed teeth to tear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the black waves of shock and pain, he heard her drinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt lasted a long time. But finally, mercifully, he realized that he was dying. He took comfort in the thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat the horror would soon be over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t have been more wrong. The horror was just beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Maya lifted her head, her mouth was scarlet with his blood. Dripping. She wasn\u0027t beautiful any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elonger, she was simply fiendish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" she said. \"I\u0027m going to give you something that will make it all better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled back and placed a fire-hardened splinter of wood at her own throat. She smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya had always been physically brave. And then, with a gesture almost of ecstasy, she plunged the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esplinter in, sending blood spurting and spilling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she fell on top of him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t mean to swallow the blood that filled his mouth. But everything was so gray and unreal-and he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estill had enough survival reflex left to not want to drown in it. The warm, strange-tasting liquid went down\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis throat. It burned like fermented-berry wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she made him drink, he realized to his relief that he was still dying. He didn\u0027t know that he wasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing to stay dead. He felt her carrying him farther into the forest-he was completely limp now and didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eput up any resistance-and then everything went black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he woke up, he\u0027d been buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clawed himself up out of the shallow grave and found himself looking into the astonished face of his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrother Conlan. The tribe had buried him in the traditional way-in the soft dirt at the back of the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the minute before his brother could yell in surprise, Thierry was at his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was animal instinct. A thirst inside of him like nothing he had ever known. A pain that was like being\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderwater-being strangled-gasping for air. It made him desperate, made him insane. He didn\u0027t think at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe simply tried, mindlessly, to tear at his brother\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat stopped him was someone calling his name. Calling it over and over, in great pain. When he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked around, he saw Hellewise, her brown eyes huge and spilling with tears, her mouth trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression on her face would haunt him forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran out of the cave and kept running. Behind him, just faintly, he could hear Hellewise\u0027s voice,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Theorn, I\u0027ll stop her. I swear to you, I\u0027ll stop her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized later that it was all Hellewise could offer him. She knew that his curse was permanent. What\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe was now, he would be forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn\u0027t a name for it then, but he was the first made vampire. Maya, who would have a son just as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe promised, was the first of the lamia, the family vampires who could grow up and have children. And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher son, Red Fern, would be the ancestor of the Redfern family, the most powerful lamia family in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry didn\u0027t know any of that as he ran. He only knew he had to get away from people, or he would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehurt them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya caught up with him while he was frantically trying to quench his thirst by drinking from a stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to make yourself sick,\" she said, inspecting him critically. \"You can\u0027t drink that. It\u0027s blood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry jumped up, shaking with fury and hatred and weakness all mixed together. \"What about yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya laughed. \"How sweet. But it won\u0027t do. You need the blood of living creatures.\" She wasn\u0027t at all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eafraid of him, and he remembered how strong she had been. He was no match for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and began to stumble off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya called after him, \"You can\u0027t do it, you know. You can\u0027t get away from me. I\u0027ve chosen you,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheorn. You\u0027re mine, now and forever. And in the end you\u0027ll realize that and join me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry kept going. He could hear her laughing as he went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lived on the steppes for several weeks, wandering across the high windswept grasslands. He was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore an animal than anything resembling a person. The thirst inside him made him desperate-until he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estumbled over a rabbit. The next instant he found that he was holding it, biting into its throat. His teeth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere like Maya\u0027s now-long, sensitive, and perfect for tearing or puncturing. And she was right, only the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblood of a living creature could help the burning, suffocating feeling inside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t catch food very often. Every time he drank it reminded him of what he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was starving when he finally came to the Three Rivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t see the little girl out picking spring greens until he was on top of her. He burst out of a pile of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrush, panting with thirst like a wounded deer-and there she was, looking up at him. And then everything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewent dark for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he came to himself, he stopped drinking. He needed the food, he would die in terrible agony\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewithout it-but he dropped the girl and ran. Hana\u0027s people found him a little while later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they did exactly what he\u0027d expected any tribe to do-they saw that he was an abomination and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrandished spears at him. He expected them to kill him at any minute. He didn\u0027t realize yet-and neither\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edid they-that a creature like him took some killing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he saw Hana. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-9.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:26 PM"}
