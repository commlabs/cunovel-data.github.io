It was a quest that had appeared after chewing up the Slaughterer\u0027s token quest. He couldn\u0027t help but be curious. He wouldn\u0027t have to gather 10 Trickster\u0027s tokens, but including this one, he\u0027d have to gather a total of 10 different karma tokens...\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0027Ugh... it\u0027s not like anything will happen right away by exerting myself, so let\u0027s think about it carefreely.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ultimately, Lee Shin Woo decided to positively put this off. Rather than rot his brain from thinking too deeply about this, he decided to instead do his best when it comes to a situation where it seems like he\u0027ll be able to progress the quest. After he decided to do so, he felt a bit more relieved.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0027Anyway, the quest reward changed, so it\u0027s become kind of awkward to use the permit to God\u0027s secret shop right away.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had pushed through the dungeon and the Treasure Eaters all at once, so he had come to possess a fortune of 25,000 Perium in no time. Whether he buys a bone or a magic book; he had enough of a fortune to reinforce himself! ...Is what he believed.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n However, since he didn\u0027t have a promise for when he got his next permit right now, he refused to use his remaining permit without careful consideration. In the end, Lee Shin Woo sighed and changed his mind. He would continue to do what he had been doing first... in other words, cleanly mop up the level 1 dungeons in the nearby vicinity, and then go to the secret shop.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0027I\u0027ve decided, so shall we hurry?\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lee Shin Woo gently closed his (nonexistent) eyes and after checking where each dungeon was, he gripped his Bone of Thunder Lasting and hurried his steps. He had grown rapidly after the intense battle, and his steps definitely contained more strength than before.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was currently level 2, and his stat total was 323.
