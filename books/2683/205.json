I\u0027d just gotten back from Canyon Ranch. I met you at Jerry\u0027s? Remember? In SoHo? We sat in a booth in the back? You talked about going to NYU?\" She pauses, staring at me wide-eyed. \"Then we went back to my place...\" She looks away. She softly says, \"We had sex, then you left, whatever.\" She pauses again. \"You were having dinner that night with Viggo Mortensen and Jude Law and one of the producers of Flatliners II and Sean MacPherson was in town with Gina and I didn\u0027t really want to go and you didn\u0027t invite me-and then you never called... That week I read that you had dinner at Diablo\u0027s-maybe it was a Buddy Seagull column-and you and Damien had patched things up and then I ran into Edgar Cameron who said he had had dinner with you at Balthazar and you guys had all gone to Cheetah afterwards and... you just never called me again and... oh forget it, Victor-it\u0027s all in the past, right? I mean, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour weeks ago I was on a ship in the middle of an ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour weeks ago on that ship there was blood pooled behind a toilet in the cabin of a doomed girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour weeks ago I was in London at a party in Notting Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour weeks ago I was meeting Bobby Hughes. Jamie Fields hugged me while I stood screaming in a basement corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour weeks ago I was not in New York City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour weeks ago an impostor arrived in Chloe\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour weeks ago on that Sunday he undressed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m saying nothing. Reams of acid start unspooling in my stomach and I\u0027m vibrating with panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby,\" I\u0027m saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start getting dressed. \"I\u0027ve gotta go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asks, sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve gotta get my stuff,\" I say in a controlled voice. \"I\u0027m moving out of the house.

I\u0027m totally, totally sure of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" She\u0027s nodding. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fall on the bed, wrapping my arms around her. I kiss her on the lips, stroking the side of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back in an hour,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she says. \"Do you want me to come with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" I\u0027m saying. \"Just wait here.

Probably less. Maybe forty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" she says, \"I think I\u0027m supposed to stay here.\" \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m supposed to shoot a scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I supposed to do?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think\"-Chloe squints at the script and then, looking up-you\u0027re supposed to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\" Chloe says, smiling. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re supposed to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no need to punch in the code to deactivate the alarm system in the house in the 8th or the 16th. The door leading into the courtyard just swings open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking quickly through the courtyard, I grab my keys out of the Prada jacket I\u0027m wearing but I don\u0027t need them because that door\u0027s open too. Outside, it\u0027s late afternoon but not dark yet and the wind\u0027s screaming is occasionally broken up by distant thunderclaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, things feel wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the entranceway I lift a phone receiver, placing it next to my ear. The line is dead. I move toward the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" I\u0027m calling out. \"Hello?... It\u0027s me... It\u0027s Victor...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m overly aware of how silent and dark it is in the house. I reach for a light switch. Nothing happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house smells like shit, reeks of it-damp and wet and fetid-and I have to start breathing through my mouth. I pause in a doorway, bracing myself for a surprise, but the living room is totally empty. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-205.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
