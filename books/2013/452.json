And from this was born a sense of a self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich he did not possess and perhaps had never possessed. And in the grip of such ignorance, he was as malleable as a child. To be used; to be, indeed, abused. And many had done so, for there was power in Icarium, far too much power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch exploitation was now at an end. All of Taralack Veed’s exhortations were as wind in the distance, and he was not swayed. The Gral would be Icarium’s last companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in the street, all of his senses awakened to the realization that he knew this place, this modest patch of the mosaic grey with promise. And true illumination was finally at hand. The measuring of time, from this moment and for ever onward. A life begun again, with no risk of losing his sense of self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands have worked here. In this city, beneath this city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now awaits me, to be awakened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when I have done that, I will begin anew. A life, a host of tesserae to lay down one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set out, then, for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door into his machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked, unmindful of those scurrying in his wake, of the figures and soldiers moving out of his path. He heard but held no curiosity for the sounds of fighting, the violence erupting in the streets to either side, the detonations as of lightning although this dawn was breaking clear and still. He passed beneath diffused shadows cast down by billowing smoke from burning buildings, wagons and barricades. He heard screams and shouts but did not seek out where they came from, even to lend succour as he would normally have done. He stepped over bodies in the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked alongside an ash-laden greasy canal for a time, then reached a bridge and crossed over into what was clearly an older part of the city. Down another street to an intersection, whereupon he swung left and continued on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were more people here in this quarter-with the day growing bolder and all sounds of fighting a distant roar to the west-yet even here the people seemed dazed. None of the usual conversations, the hawkers crying their wares, beasts pulling loaded carts. The drifting smoke wafted down like an omen, and the citizens wandered through it as if lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew nearer the door. Of course, it was nothing like a door in truth. More like a wound, a breach. He could feel its power stir to life, for as he sensed it so too did it sense him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium then slowed. A wound, yes. His machine was wounded. Its pieces had been twisted, shifted out of position. Ages had passed since he had built it, so he should not be surprised. Would it still work? He was no longer so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is mine. I must make it right, no matter the cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1 will have this gift. 1 will have it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started forward once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house that had once disguised this nexus of the machine had collapsed into ruin and no efforts had been made to clear the wreckage. There was a man standing before it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment, Icarium realized that he recognized this man. He had been aboard the ships, and the name by which he had been known was Taxilian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Icarium walked up to him, Taxilian, his eyes strangely bright, bowed and stepped back. ‘This, Icarium,’ he said, ‘is your day.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy day? Yes, my first day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifestealer faced the ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glow was now rising from somewhere inside, shafts slanting up between snapped timbers and beams, lancing out in spears from beneath stone and brick. The glow burgeoned, and the world beneath him seemed to tremble. But no, that was no illusion-buildings groaned, shuddered. Splintering sounds, shutters rattling as from a gust of wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium drew a step closer, drawing a dagger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder sounded beneath him, making the cobbles bounce in puffs of dust. Somewhere, in the city, structures began to break apart, as sections and components within them stirred into life, into inexorable motion. Seeking to return to a most ancient pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore thunder, as buildings burst apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColumns of dust corkscrewed skyward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still the white glow lifted, spread out in a fashion somewhere between liquid and fire, pouring, leaping, the shafts and spears twisting in the air. Engulfing the ruin, spilling out onto the street, lapping around Icarium, who drew the sharp-edged blade diagonally, deep, up one forearm; then did the same with the other-holding the weapon tight in a blood-soaked hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho then raised his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo measure time, one must begin. To grow futureward, one must root. Deep into the ground with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI built this machine. This place that will forge my beginning. No longer outside the world. No longer outside time itself. Give me this, wounded or not, give me this. If K’rul can, why not me? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-452.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
