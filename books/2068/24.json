{"id":111271,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\u003cp\u003eSeptember 25, 1864\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey say love can conquer all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut can it conquer Father\u0027s belief that Katherine and those like her are demons--devils?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not exaggerate when I say Katherine is an angel. She saved my life--and Anna\u0027s. Father must know the truth. Once he does, he will be unable to deny Katherine\u0027s goodness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is my duty as a Salvatore to stay true to my convictions and to the ones I love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow is the time for action, not doubt. Confidence courses through my veins. I will make Father understand the truth--that we are all the same. And with that truth will come love. Father will call off the siege.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis I swear on my name and my life. For the rest of the day, I sat at my desk in my bedroom, glancing at an empty notebook as I contemplated what to do. If Father knew Katherine was a vampire, he\u0027d call off the hunt. He had to. I\u0027d seen him laugh with Katherine, attempt to impress her with stories of his boyish antics back in Italy, and treat her as he\u0027d have treated a daughter. Katherine gave my father a vigor I\u0027d never seen in him. She gave my father life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how could I persuade him of this, when he so deeply despised demons? Then again, Father was rational. Logical. Maybe he could learn what Katherine had already taught me: that vampires weren\u0027t all evil. They walked among us, they cried human tears; all they wanted was a true home --and to be loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I steeled my courage and stood up, closing the notebook with an abrupt clap. This wasn\u0027t a schoolboy\u0027s assignment, and I didn\u0027t need notes to speak from my heart. I was ready to speak to Father man to man. After all, I was nearly eighteen, and he was planning to leave me Veritas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and walked down the winding staircase, through the quiet living room, and knocked sharply on the door to Father\u0027s study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in!\" Father\u0027s muffled voice called. Before I had even put my hand on the knob, Father swung the door open himself. He wore a tailored jacket, with a sprig of vervain in the lapel, but I noticed that instead of being clean shaven, he sported salt-and-pepper stubble and his eyes were bloodshot and hooded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see you last night at the ball,\" Father said as he ushered me into his study. \"I hope you weren\u0027t part of that noisy, careless mob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I shook my head vigorously, feeling a flicker of hope. Did this mean Father was no longer planning an attack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Father sat at his oak desk and slammed his leather-bound book shut. Beneath it, I could see complicated drawings and diagrams of the town, with X\u0027s over certain buildings, including the apothecary. And just like that, the flicker of hope was extinguished, and cold, hard fear took up residence in its place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather followed my gaze. \"As you can see, our plans are much more thought-out than that foolish brigade of drunks and boys. Luckily Sheriff Forbes and his team put a stop to them, and none of them will be welcome at our own siege.\" Father sighed and steepled his fingers together. \"We\u0027re living in dangerous and uncertain times, and your actions need to reflect that.\" His dark eyes softened for a second. \"I just want to make sure your decisions, at least, are prudent.\" He didn\u0027t add \"unlike Damon\u0027s,\" but he didn\u0027t have to. I knew that was what he was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the siege ...\" \"Will happen next week as planned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the compass?\" I asked, remembering the conversation with Katherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather smiled. \"It works. Jonathan\u0027s been tinkering with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" A wave of horror rushed through me. If it worked, then that meant there was no doubt Father would find Katherine. \"How do you know that it works?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather smiled and rolled up his papers. \"Because it does,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I talk to you about something?\" I asked, hoping my voice betrayed none of my nerves. An image of Katherine\u0027s face flashed in my head, giving me the strength to lock eyes with Father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Sit down, Stefan,\" Father commanded. I perched in the leather wingback chair near the bookshelves. He stood up and walked over to the decanter of brandy on the corner table. He poured a glass for himself, then one for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the tumbler and held it to my lips, taking a tiny, almost imperceptible sip of the liquid. Then I steeled my courage and stared straight at him. \"I have concerns about your plan for the vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? And why is that?\" Father leaned back against his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nervously took a large gulp of brandy. \"We\u0027re making the assumption that they\u0027re as evil as they\u0027ve been characterized. But what if that\u0027s not true?\" I asked, willing myself to meet Father\u0027s gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather snorted. \"Have you any evidence to the contrary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Of course not. But why take what people say at face value? Y taught us\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eou differently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather sighed and walked to his decanter, pouring more brandy. \"Why? Because these creatures are from the darkest parts of hell. They know how to control your mind, seduce your spirit. They are deadly, and they need to be destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down at the amber liquid in my glass. It was as dark and murky as my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather tipped his glass to me. \"I shouldn\u0027t have to tell you, son, that those who stand with them, those who bring shame to their families, will be destroyed as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill went up my spine, but I held his gaze. \"Anyone who stands with evil should be destroyed. But I hardly think it\u0027s prudent to assume that all vampires are evil just because they happen to be vampires. Y always taught us to see the good in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eou people, to think for ourselves. The last thing this town needs, when there have already been so many deaths from the war, is more senseless killing,\" I said, remembering Pearl and Anna\u0027s terrified expressions in the woods. \"The Founders need to rethink the plan. I\u0027ll come to the next meeting with you. I know I haven\u0027t been as involved as I could have been, but I\u0027m ready to take on my responsibilities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather sank back into his chair, leaning his head against the wooden back. He closed his eyes and massaged his temples. For several long moments he remained in that posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited, every muscle in my body coiled to receive the angry flurry of words that was sure to fly from his mouth. I stared dejectedly into my glass. I had failed. I had failed Katherine, Pearl, and Anna. I had failed at securing my own happy future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Father\u0027s eyes snapped open. To my surprise, he nodded. \"I suppose I could give the matter some thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCool relief flooded my body, as if I\u0027d just jumped into the pond on a scorching summer day. He would give the matter some thought! To some, that might not seem to be much, but from my stubborn father, it meant everything. It meant there was a chance. A chance to stop sneaking around in the dark. A chance for Katherine to remain safe. For us to be together, forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather lifted his glass to me. \"To family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To family,\" I echoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Father drained the rest of his glass, which compelled me to do the same. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-origins-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-24.html","bookId":2068,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:20:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:20:40 AM"}
