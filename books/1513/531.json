He charged into the spell formation and began to rummage through as he wished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Arcane Art left the base in a mess, looking like ruins after the end of the world. Yet, there were still some intact objects lying in the dust and emanating light that attracted hi’s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a Thousand-Eyed Worm Egg. It’s so big, and can practically be exchanged for an astral stone of a similar quality…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And very concentrated refined gold. There’s so much…” Siebel’s eyes lit up, cheeks turning a rosy red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarious famous and also unknown precious materials were lying on the ground like trash. Though many had been destroyed, they were still of high value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch enormous wealth was placed before him to be chosen from. Even in his life, this experience was very rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha… If I’d known, I would have done this long ago. Though it might affect some treasures, I can save time and attack a few other areas…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiebel’s eyes turned slightly red, as he scanned the ground and kept anything of value. He then left, reaching another area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surroundings of the large laboratory were flickering with crystal luster, obstructing Siebel like a city wall. At the door, there was a wooden sign that was a warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grandmaster Nuuk’s Alchemy Laboratory! Do not disturb if you are not supposed to be here! You will bear the consequences!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s already been dead for over tens of thousands of years. Who are you kidding?” Siebel had originally been surprised by the crimson words on the sign, feeling a chill down his spine, but the harvests he had reaped caused him to get greedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once I attack this place, I can move on to the core area. The treasures there must be even more amazing…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiebel’s expression changed several times, but he gradually made his decision. Rays from innate spells of various ranks lit up from his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he had also set up several layers of defence, with magic equipment that looked like shells covering his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be ruined! Morning Star Arcane Art— Ocean Crash!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe azure ocean that stretched as far as the eye could see, as well as the vicious ocean animals, immediately submerged the laboratory in front of him. All sorts of lights exploded, before dying down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Siebel was done, the laboratory had turned into a large ruins. All the spell runes had either been destroyed, smashed, or had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha… As expected! My guess was right!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe counterattack he had expected did not arrive, and Siebel’s face showed his elation. He first sent a few puppets forth cautiously, and after determining there was no danger ahead, pounced towards the ruins hastily and began to look through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Morning Star Magi did not get such chances often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, spilledvarious violent and dangerous reactions were rapidly happening out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Determined to be point mass reaction! Judged Morning Star-ranked enemy at area DK-34, activating counterattack spell formation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp in the air in the secret space, large amounts of vacant spaces fused together and formed the strange shape of a crystal ball. At the heart of it was an unusual human in black robes, eyes giving off crimson rays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraces of a mysterious aura were emitted along with the control room’s command. In the area above what had been the laboratory, a concealed spell formation began to operate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Extrapolating force of point mass. Attribute determined to be: Water. Activating counterattack spell formation. Begin!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hm? What’s going on?” Siebel raised his head, and in that moment, his intuition as a Magus made him feel immensely threatened, some existence was giving him the chills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not good! I need to leave immediately!” He turned into a blue silhouette as he darted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was too late. With a terrifying, high-pitched sound, a large, crimson spell formation appeared in the air. Large numbers of runic chains formed a cage, trapping him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Target confirmed. Beginning annihilation.” The icy, robotic voice immediately gave Siebel the feeling that he was in immense danger. However, as a Morning Star Magus, he would naturally not sit and wait to be killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah! You want to kill me, just with this spell formation?” Siebel snarled, body exploding and revealing his true marine form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the enormous undulations from the Morning Star final technique appeared once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning Star Arcane Art— Ocean Crash!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremendous ocean descended, and many ancient creatures thundered as they charged straight for the runic chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Weng!* The attacks fell on the thin runic chains, but were not able to cause any damage at all. Large amounts of blue light were absorbed by the chains, causing Siebel’s face to immediately turn pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ho-How?” Seeing a spell formation like this that could absorb a whole Morning Star Arcane Art, Siebel seemed to have been dealt a massive blow. Were Morning Star not able to do as they wished in the continent? Their Arcane Arts were even more horrifying, so how could this have happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly now did he understand how terrifying ancient Magi were, but it was far too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Xiu!* A giant blue bow appeared, still having some of the power Siebel’s own point mass as it shot out blue flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the heart of the blue flames, there was a unique long arrow, the arrowhead having alarming black threads that distorted time and space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Pu!* Like paper being ripped through, his defensive layers were pierced through by the blue arrow, and even the Morning Star Magus’ famed soul force was rendered useless under the black threads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant blue arrow pierced through Siebel’s chest, pinning him to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I… will actually here… in the hands of a trap…” Siebel’s expression cycled, and he was unsure if he should laugh or cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough these injuries would cause regular people or even Magi to die straightaway, Morning Star Magi had a vigorous life force and powerful vitality that still allowed them to struggle for their lives for a period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never thought I’d die here. Thankfully, I still have the marine tribe’s deity egg and can be reborn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiebel had a wry smile on his face, unwilling to part with the precious items and magic equipment he had found. However, there was no way around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marine tribe’s deity egg was a secret method of the marine tribe Magi to save one’s life, for Morning Stars and above. It was able to separate one’s blood, flesh and soul in the form of a marine egg, and after the fall of the main body, they would then be reborn in the egg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it was part of the Magus, after a period of training, it was possible to even return to the Morning Star realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince it was so valuable, it was obviously extensively sought out. However, due to the limitations of the race, only the marine tribe were able to use it, causing many human Morning Stars to wring their hands in defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough there were some Magi who had one or even a few clones, if the main body fell, it was extremely difficult for the clone to reach Morning Star and was even considered impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Collection of soul aura complete. Beginning obliteration of soul brand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, the icy robotic voice sounded once more, giving Siebel the impression that he was really in trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately after, he felt a strange force being transmitted to his body through the bow and arrow, and with the sensing abilities of his soul aura, felt it trace the source and reach a part of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scene suddenly appeared in his mind. It was that of when he had carefully placed the deity egg in his Magus Tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, multiple black threads were sent out, puncturing the deity egg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh! Noooo…” Siebel yelled while struggling. He could tell that with the changes in the scene, his original connection with the deity egg had been completely broken, and he would no longer have any chances at rebirth. In that case, if he were to die, it would truly be the end...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How– How did it become like this?” Large amounts of blood spilt from the corner of Siebel’s mouth, which then turned into blue bubbles that exploded. His eyes closed for eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn ancient times, there were many Magi with clones or those who entrusted their lives elsewhere. The methods were strange and hard to be determined, but many Magi who had participated in the great ancient Magus war had still fallen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the original was completely wiped out, even a Morning Star would be helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Poof!* A spot of light that was like a morning star emerged from his body and, with the guidance of a stream of astral light, broke through the space and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a Morning Star Magus’ point mass, holding his soul within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on legends of the ancient Byron Empire, when Morning Star Magi completely died, their soul would return to the astral plane for eternity, floating in the deepest part of the astral plane and waiting for their next chance at reincarnation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Point mass discovered! Beginning seizure!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few large hands full of black runes emerged from the air and grabbed at the point mass. The formless force immediately spread throughout the area, causing the starlight to turn unsteady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Sou!* Taking this opportunity, the large black hands grabbed hold of the point mass, disappearing into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-530\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-532\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-531","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
