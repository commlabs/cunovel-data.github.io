It was a beam of holy light that connected heaven and earth, seemingly reaching endlessly above and below. Even though it was comparatively further away, one could see see that it was at least a hundred times thicker than the light illuminating Pandora’s body. Meanwhile, below Pandora’s feet appeared a shining path that led straight to the enormous pillar of light towering at the end of this world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOn the shining path, a single one of Pandora’s steps took her a great distance, and in the blink of an eye, she was already in front of that pillar of light. The sacred pillar that looked horrifyingly wide even from the distance at this moment completely became a sea of brilliance, vast and limitless. This entire world was brimming with holy radiance that stretched as far as the eye could see!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePandora knelt down on one knee, and then with a distinctive mechanical voice, she said, “Great Apostle, I have already brought that sheep back.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe apostle’s imposing voice sounded from the sea of brilliance. “Why were you gone for so long?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFaced with this sea of pressure from the apostle, Pandora didn’t feel the slightest bit of fear. She was just like a machine, not revealing the slightest emotion humans should have. Her erotic lips opened, and then a few drops of blood slowly drifted out from her lips, floating towards the sea of light. One could see that a brilliantly red drop of blood was currently frantically squirming about, continuously changing its shape as it attacked at every direction. However, there seemed to be some type of incorporeal restriction in the air that firmly bound this drop of blood, forcing it to fly towards the sea of light.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Great apostle, I need time to understand and suppress its power, and only then can I bring your distinguished self a living sheep.

Just as Pandora was quietly waiting for the sea of light to disappear, the apostle’s voice unexpectedly sounded again, “Pandora, you need to be careful when you head north. I can sense a boundless darkness in an extremely distant place that is blocking off my perception. It is not a naturally formed darkness. Even though the existence hidden in the darkness has not exposed any hostility yet, to the extent where it didn’t even display any clues of being aware of my existence, anyone that can release such a great amount of darkness is not a person you can currently face.

The black haired young lady’s figure appeared again. She was kneeling at the center of a circular room, and in front of her floated a small and exquisite altar. There were now two crystal bottles in her hands, precisely the reward and drug the apostle bestowed upon her.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe circular room was extremely large, over 50 meters in diameter. It could simply be considered a main hall. The curved walls had enormous slabs of glass embedded within, and behind the glass was green culture fluid. All types of bizarre creatures floated within.

As a result, the two meter thick door slowly slid to the side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-4-chapter-1-4\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-4-chapter-2-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-4-chapter-2-1","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:17 AM"}
