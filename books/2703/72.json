Then she chased me until she caught me in my bedroom. She hit me until I passed out, and...I don’t remember anything else after that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoey shuddered and hugged herself. “I kind of prefer passing out during a beating. I don’t like remembering...or feeling it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached over slowly and unpeeled her fingers off her forearm from where she was hugging herself, then I squeezed her hand gently. “Will you please tell me why you’re so upset? I know what it feels like to think something’s important, only to find out someone else thinks it’s stupid. I promise I won’t think any less of you. I just want to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her face and sniffed. “We had open critique in my writing class today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled her hand against my chest and squeezed it a little bit harder. She didn’t have to tell me she’d gotten some bad comments about her story. She wouldn’t be sitting here, sobbing, if it’d gone okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t say anything, just stroked the knuckles on her hand and waited for her to talk. A minute later, she sniffed again, blew out a shuddery breath, and wiped at her cheek with the back of her free hand. “Not one person liked it. It was stupid, silly, immature. The teacher went into a big long tirade about the differences between true literature and...and...whatever drivel I’d written. Talking animals are bad. Stories with no connection to the human condition are worthless—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now wait a second,” I butted in, frowning. “The Silver Belt had all kinds of connections to deeper things. And the frog in that was the funniest character in the entire story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoey jerked her face up, her eyes wide as she blinked them. “Y-you actually read The Silver Belt already? All of it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well...yeah. And it connected with me, like, really well. I kept thinking about it long after I finished. How Truman always felt like he was on the outside of everything, left out as if he was missing the biggest step of how to be a true fisherman. I feel that way practically every day. Not about fishing, but other things. And I’m serious about that frog. You’re not allowed to take him out of that story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a watery laugh, and I swear, watching her smile made my entire day. “You really liked him?” she asked, her voice uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve read it three times,” I said. “So I don’t think the problem is your writing. It was just...your audience. I don’t think they wanted to teach you to be a better writer, they wanted to teach you to write a certain way. I just hope you know not everyone wants to read their kind of stories. Some of us prefer the talking animals. And there’s nothing wrong with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and brushed the last of her tears off her face. “Okay. Thank you.” Her eyes lifted to mine. The trust and gratitude I saw made my chest fill with this awesome pressure. “I just wish I would’ve known that before I turned in my first story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled her closer and gave her a one-armed hug. “So do I.” Because I seriously hated to see her cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you again, Quinn. I don’t know what I would’ve done if you hadn’t come along and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, no problem.” I bumped my shoulder into her to get her to look at me. Then I grinned, flashing my dimple in pleading. “Just promise you’ll let me read more of your talking animals, and we’ll call it even.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled hers eyes but grinned back. “You don’t seriously want to read more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heck, yes, I do.” I stood up, dusted off my pants and then held down a hand to her. “Until then, what do you say? Want to work on some biology?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroaning as she stood, she gifted me with a dry glance. “No. But...I probably should. You’re a better teacher than the professor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned. “Thank you. Now let’s find a table around here and get our geek on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I tightened my grip on her hand, she tightened hers right back. I felt good that hour, helping her with her homework and making silly jokes about people against talking animals. She finally loosened up enough to joke back with me. I was never so happy that I’d been able to get past my physical reaction to her so we could finally be friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I really liked being Zoey’s friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first trip to the Forbidden Nightclub to watch the band Non-Castrato play their first gig started with me full of nerves.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-72.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
