And there the three famous jumpers were met together in the room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I\u0027ll give my daughter to him who jumps highest, said the King,“for it would be mean to let these people jump for nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Flea stepped out first. He had very pretty manners, and bowed in all directions, for he had young ladies blood in his veins, and was accustomed to consort only with human beings; and that is of great consequence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen came the Grasshopper: he was certainly much heavier, but he had a good figure, and wore the green uniform that was born with him. This person, moreover, maintained that he belonged to a very old family in the land of Egypt, and that he was highly esteemed there. He had just come from the field, he said, and had been put into a card-house three stories high, and all made of picture cards with the figures turned inwards. There were doors and windows in the house, cut in the body of the Queen of Hearts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I sing so,”he said,“that sixteen native crickets who have chirped from their youth up, and have never yet had a card-house of their own, have become even thinner than they were with envy at hearing me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them, the Flea and the Grasshopper, took care to announce who they were, and that they considered themselves entitled to marry a Princess.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Frog said nothing, but it was said of him that he thought all the more; and directly the Yard Dog had smelt at him he was ready to assert that the Frog was of good family.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe old councillor, who had received three medals for holding his tongue, declared that he knew that the Frog possessed the gift of prophecy: one could tell by his backbone whether there would be a severe winter or a mild one; and that\u0027s more than one can always tell from the backbone of the man who writes the almanac.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I shall not say anything more,”said the old King. “I only go on quietly, and think my own thoughts.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow they were to take their jump. The Flea sprang so high that no one could see him; and then they asserted that he had not jumped at all. That was very mean. The grasshopper only sprang half as high, but he sprang straight into the King\u0027s face, and the King declared that was horribly rude. The Frog stood a long time considering; at last peple thought that he could not jump at all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I only hope he\u0027s not become unwell, ”said the Yard Dog, and then he smelt at him again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Tap! He sprang with a little crooked jump just into the lap of the Princess, who sat on a low golden stool.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen the King said,“The highest leap was taken by him who jumped up to my daughter; for therein lies the point; but it requires head to achieve that, and the Frog has shown that he has a head.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he had the Princess.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“I jumped highest, after all,”said the Flea.“But it\u0027s all the same. Let her have the goose-bone with its lump of wax and bit of stick. I jumped the highest; but in this world a body is required if one wishes to be seen.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Flea went into foreign military service, where it is said he was killed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and thought and considered how things happened in the world. And he too said,“Body is required! body is required! And then he sang his own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story, which they say is not true, though it\u0027s in print.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/881/1023.html","bookId":674,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 7:46:09 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 7:46:09 AM"}
