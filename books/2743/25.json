Like Erin said, he was not unaffected—a knowledge that made me feel both better and worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chokeholds were easier, and I did them without his verbal cues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the class was over, with Ralph encouraging us to practice—carefully—over the coming week. “Next week the guys will be in full body gear, and you’ll be able to clobber the daylights out of ’em, no holds barred.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin and Vickie high-fived, and Ralph beamed at them both, rubbing his palms together. “Bloodthirsty and ruthless. Exactly what I wanna see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t attended any Greek events since the Halloween party, and had only seen Buck in passing since the stairwell incident—always within a group, and always in public. When he moved closer, I moved away, as though his very being repelled me, which was true. The mere thought of him still made my mouth go dry and my stomach knot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our room, Erin turned after her final mirror check. “He’d better stay the hell away from you or I will whip out the lawnmower on his ass,” she declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That move’s not for ass use,” I joked, hating the tremor that lanced through me at the thought of Buck with his arms banded around me. I hoped Erin was ready to have a shadow, because I didn’t intend to leave her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer arm encircling my shoulders, she turned us both to face the full-length mirror. “We look hot, girlfriend.” Her eyes met mine in the reflection. “Thanks for doing this. The girls have been real supportive, but they’re not you. I feel stronger knowing you’ll be with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and hugged her to my side. We did look hot. In the shimmery silver dress, with her silver-strappy heels, Erin was her own disco ball. My blue sheath—simply cut in front and the exact shade of my eyes—looked basic if not dull next to Erin, until I turned around. The combination of bass playing and yoga had given me a toned back, and the dress showed it off with a “V” cut almost to the waist. The nosebleed-level black patent slingbacks on my feet negated dull quite a bit all on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErin did a couple of dance moves. “Let’s go make Chaz wish he was never born.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and laughed. “Oh, Erin. I’m so glad you’re on my side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn right, bitch.” She slapped my butt and we grabbed our coats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn unspoken agreement, we passed the stairwell door and walked down the wide, open front staircase to meet our ride. Everyone we passed gawked—one scrawny freshman tripping on a step, his eyes moving between Erin and me. Luckily, he was going up, so he landed on both hands, practically at Erin’s feet. “Whoa,” he breathed taking her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe patted his head as she passed him, crooning, “Aww, how sweet,” like he was a puppy. His adoring expression at her touch indicated that here was a guy willing to put her on a pedestal and treat her like a goddess. I suspected that Erin didn’t want that from a guy nearly as much as she insisted she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men of Chaz’s fraternity had gone all out, hanging an actual disco ball and hiring a band. Outfitted in suits, ties, and a hazardous level of confidence, they all looked hotter than hell and every one of them knew it. Two guys from the pledge class were at the door, one hanging coats, the other taking the plus-one invitation Erin handed over and giving us each a strip of tickets for the ‘bar’ set up in the kitchen and a raffle ticket for the table of prizes another pledge watched over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prizes were mostly electronic provisions—from iPods to game systems to a 42” flatscreen. “Boys,” Erin scoffed. “Where’s a spa day? Or a Victoria’s Secret shopping spree?” The table guard’s eyes widened in obvious approval of the latter idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Erin,” a deep voice said. We turned, and there was Chaz, looking amazing in a perfectly-cut charcoal gray suit and red tie that somehow blended perfectly with Erin’s hair. He glanced at me, his eyes warm and friendly. “Hi, Jacqueline.” I sensed no reproach over the fact that their relationship had detonated over Erin standing up for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Chaz. The place looks awesome.” I answered for both of us while Erin swayed to the music and waved at friends, as though her ex didn’t exist. The theme of the Bash this year was Saturday Night Fever. The band shifted from playing a Keith Urban cover to a Bee Gees song—something popular when my parents were in grade school, maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChaz glanced around perfunctorily, his eyes returning to me. “Thanks,” he said, and then he only had eyes for Erin. Watching the people already dancing, she snagged a full red cup from a passing guy with a handful of them. He started to protest, but Chaz glared, daring him to say a word to her. He buttoned his lip and kept moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she sipped and pretended to be oblivious to his presence, he stared at her. It was obvious where he wanted this to go, and the fact that Erin was conspicuously gazing anywhere but at him told me she was anything but immune. They didn’t move from each other’s orbits the rest of the night, but he didn’t attempt to speak to her again, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Chaz was a good guy, if misguided and gullible. He’d swallowed Buck’s side of what happened between us, had argued with Erin that maybe I was drunk that night, and I didn’t remember everything clearly. He was probably one of those boys to whom rapists were ugly men who jumped out of bushes, assaulting random girls. Rapists weren’t your nice-guy coworker, or your frat brother, or your best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it never occurred to him that his best friend was capable of ripping a girl’s self-confidence away in the span of five minutes. That he could hurt someone innocent to wound a rival. That he could violate her in a twisted attempt to obliterate his own powerlessness. That he could make her feel constantly threatened, and not give a shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only time I felt completely safe was when I was with Lucas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, I was watching Buck dance with a senior from Erin’s sorority. He smiled and laughed, and so did she. He looked so… normal. For the first time, I wondered if I was the only girl he’d ever terrorized, and if so, why. I jumped when I heard Kennedy’s voice in my ear. “You look stunning, Jacqueline.” My drink sloshed over the cup’s rim onto my hand, luckily missing my dress. He took the cup from my hand. “Ah, I’m sorry—didn’t mean to startle you. C’mon, let me get you a towel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was disconcerted enough from his arm steering me through the crowd, his hand on my bare back, that I wasn’t aware of the separation from Erin until we were in the kitchen with my arm over the sink as though I had a mortal injury rather than a beer-soaked hand. He rinsed and patted my hand dry, and I withdrew it from his grasp when he didn’t let go right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored my withdrawal, smiling down at me. “As I was trying to say before—you look beautiful tonight. I’m glad you came.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music was loud, and conversation required us to stand closer than I wanted to be. “I came for Erin, Kennedy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. But that doesn’t diminish my satisfaction that you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wearing his usual Lacoste cologne, but it no longer made me want to lean against him and inhale. Once again, he stood in direct contrast to Lucas, whose scent wasn’t any one thing—it was his leather jacket and his barely-there aftershave, the meal he’d cooked for me and the subtle yet sharp smell of graphite on his fingers after he’d been drawing, the exhaust of his Harley and the minty shampoo smell of his pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne brow cocked, Kennedy looked at me closely, and I realized he’d probably said or asked something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, what?” I leaned my ear toward him so I could take a second to push Lucas from my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said, ‘Let’s dance.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to shake my errant thoughts, I agreed and let my ex lead me to the designated dance floor, right in front of the band. An area had been cleared of furniture just under the motorized disco ball, which hung dangerously low for some of the taller guys. Rotating slowly, its mirrored surface threw flashes of light in waves around the room, illuminating faces and gyrating bodies, and glinting off any reflective surface from doorknobs to jewelry to Erin’s silver dress. Her hands were locked behind the neck of a Pi Kappa Alpha senior, an empty cup hanging from her fingertips. Her dance partner was unknowingly at the receiving end of a death glare from Chaz. Erin had noticed, though, and she pressed closer to him, staring up into his eyes with rapt attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Chaz. I should be angry with him, too, but he was clearly miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard about Chaz and Erin. What happened?” Kennedy had followed my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should ask him.” I wondered what Kennedy would make of Buck’s behavior. They were civil with each other, but that competitive fixation had been between them from day one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did, sort of. He didn’t seem to want to talk about it. Said they’d had a big fight, she was being unreasonable, blah blah—you know, the stupid stuff guys say when we fuck up something good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, the music changed to something fast, allowing me to reinstate my bubble of personal space and fortunately axing the conversation about breakups and fuckups. I was so relieved to end that exchange that I failed to pay attention to where Erin was. I failed to pay attention to where Buck was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a lull between songs, he walked up behind me. “Hey, Jacqueline” he said, and I jumped for the second time that night. “Are you done dancing with this loser? Come dance with me.” The hair on my arms stood on end, every nerve in my body on full alert, and I moved closer to Kennedy, who put his arm around my shoulders. I didn’t want his arm on me, but given the choice between them, there was no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, Buck held out a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at it, incredulous and cringing closer to Kennedy, whose body became rigid, aligned with mine. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his usual indolent smirk, Buck gazed down at me as though my ex wasn’t there. Like we were alone. “All right then, maybe later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and focused on the word I’d said over and over that morning. The word that preceded every kick. “I said no. Don’t you understand no?” From the corner of my eye, I saw Kennedy’s gaze snap to my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuck’s eyes narrowed and his mask of indifference slipped for a split second. And then he recovered and the guise was back in place. I knew in that moment that he wasn’t giving up. He was merely biding his time. “Sure. I hear you. Jacqueline.” His eyes shifted to Kennedy, whose guarded expression was at odds with the piqued rigidity of his body. “Kennedy.” He nodded and Kennedy responded in kind, and then he walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slumped against my ex, and then moved out of his grasp, my eyes searching for Erin’s silver dress amongst the crush of people in the little house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jacqueline, what’s going on between you and Buck?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/easy-contours-of-the-heart-1/page-25.html","bookId":2743,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM"}
