At first the ever-practical Joy is ready to dismiss her vision as a product of too much gin and too many vampire romances, but while traveling through the Czech Republic with Roxy, Joy begins to have some second thoughts about her mystery lover because she is suddenly plagued by visions of a lethally handsome stranger. Then, when she and Roxy attend a local GothFaire, Joy meets Raphael Griffin St. John, head of security, and she becomes even more bewildered because the dark and dangerous Raphael seems too close to her dreams for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-girl-s-guide-to-vampires-dark-ones-1.jpg","author":"Katie MacAlister","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-girl-s-guide-to-vampires-dark-ones-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:15 PM"}
