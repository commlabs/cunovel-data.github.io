I normally liked having the company, but after being with Seth, Dante\u0027s presence now made me feel uncomfortable and confused. He didn\u0027t seem to notice right away, though, and instead was immediately caught up by Maddie\u0027s condo packet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this?\" he asked, leafing through some pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maddie\u0027s been playing real estate agent for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. I didn\u0027t think you were serious about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned back on the couch, weary from dancing, sex, and the emotional miasma I seemed to be swimming through lately. Bringing up Maddie didn\u0027t make me feel so great. \"I didn\u0027t think I was either. I mentioned it offhand, and she kind of went crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alki Beach, huh? Some of these are pretty nice.\" He held up one print-out. \"Brand-new condo, still being built. You can weigh in on the colors and trim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t have time to go shopping right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the power spots on your list is near Alki. You could swing by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a puzzled look. \"Since when are you interested in me moving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down opposite me, still looking through the listings. \"Well, if you buy locally, I can rest easy that you\u0027re sticking around. Besides, get a bigger place, and we could try some cohabitation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat caught me off-guard. \"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave me a key. I might as well live here anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to freeload off me for some more space, huh?\" I teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, looking pained. \"Man, you really do think the worst. I\u0027d pay you rent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With what?\" I asked incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Business has been good. I think things are on the upswing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No offense, baby, but your business doesn\u0027t seem like the type that can maintain that kind of momentum. I think this has been a fluke.\" I spoke too soon and felt bad when I realized I\u0027d hurt him. \"But we can play it by ear if you want to move in. Maybe your reputation\u0027s spreading, and business will keep booming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed a little mollified after that, yet as I spoke the words, I found I wasn\u0027t overly thrilled at the prospect of us living together. I still had Seth on the brain. Obsessing on him was foolish, I knew. This fling of ours could only last a few more days at most. I shouldn\u0027t be mooning over him when I\u0027d just be going back to Dante anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante wanted to know how my beach investigation had gone, and I welcomed the change in subject. I gave him a brief rundown of my non-progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to look with you?\" he asked. \"I\u0027ve finally got some time tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. The truth was, just before we\u0027d parted, Seth had said he\u0027d look with me and that he\u0027d bring Kayla. The afterglow could be very persuasive. Still, I\u0027d had to do a lot of convincing that she\u0027d be safe, and honestly, I hoped I was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I roped some other people into it,\" I said. \"We should be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feared he\u0027d question me further, particularly about whether I had a psychic to go with me or not. Mercifully, he let it go. I honestly didn\u0027t think he wanted to wander beaches and was grateful for the reprieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we went to bed later, there was no way I could put his arduous advances off any longer, not without raising suspicion. I\u0027d made a good recovery and no longer had my back excuse. Yet...something was nagging at me. Dante himself had been the one to first joke about whether I could get pregnant in my pseudo-human state. I still didn\u0027t know if that was possible, and even if it was, would it matter if I returned to my immortal state in a few days? I had no clue how any of this would work, but Seth and I hadn\u0027t used protection. And suddenly, I realized that if there were any chance in the world that I could get pregnant-if Nyx\u0027s vision might really come true-I didn\u0027t want to chance a paternity dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I turned on the charm for Dante and went down on him again, something he didn\u0027t really seem to mind. He tried to get me off in return, but it was to no avail. After being with Seth, I had zero desire of my own and found I couldn\u0027t come. And so, for the first time with Dante, I faked it. I was a pretty good faker. He never suspected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slept late the next morning, so I slipped out early without waking him. Seth and I were meeting over at a restaurant in Bellevue, hopefully far enough away from anyone we knew to see us. While walking to my car, I felt someone fall into step beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, I hear you\u0027re spreading stories about me,\" Cedric said amiably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, I glanced over at him, unease spreading through me. Cedric was my suspect du jour, and I\u0027d already seen one demon\u0027s reaction to my theories. Of course, he didn\u0027t look particularly destructive at the moment, and there was also the fact that I had yet to tell anyone my latest theories about him implicating Nanette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kristin said you said that I told Nanette how you thought she might have summoned Jerome.\" He paused as though trying to make sense of that. \"For the record, I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly stopped walking. \"Then who did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell if I know. Just figured you should know I wasn\u0027t responsible for what happened to you.\" He offered no more, no condolences or queries to my health. I honestly couldn\u0027t expect that from a demon. The fact that he\u0027d bothered to come talk to me was a rarity enough-and naturally, he could be lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know who else could have told her, then. Or why. I only told a handful of people.\" The more I thought about it, the more I realized he had to be lying. I\u0027d only told my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe maintained his perfectly bland face. \"Like I said, I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reached my car, and I paused, leaning against it. \"You came all the way here to tell me this?\" Not that it would have been an arduous journey for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t flatter yourself,\" he said with a smile. \"I\u0027m here to chat with your demonesses. Hell\u0027s pretty much ruled out Jerome coming back. There\u0027ll be someone official here in days to settle the matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to ignore the chill that sent down my spine and parse the rest of his words. Cedric was cozying up to Grace and Mei. Not a surprise. Whoever came here to assign a new archdemon would question those two the most. \"Well, thank you,\" I said. I didn\u0027t really know what else to say in that matter, so I switched to something else that had been on my mind. \"Hey, I haven\u0027t heard much about your cult lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, they\u0027ve been pretty quiet. Maybe you helped after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t think I did much.\" I was also starting to suspect the cult had nothing left to do. Now that their \"Angel\" had used them as an effective distraction during Jerome\u0027s summoning, they were no longer needed. I clicked my door open, and another curious thought struck me. \"How\u0027s it going with Tawny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCedric grimaced. \"Well...we went out a couple of times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My private life is no concern of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough.\" I started to get in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you must know...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused and arched an eyebrow. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her conversation is...lacking a little,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help it. I laughed. \"Are you seriously surprised by that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beauty\u0027s skin deep, I know...I guess I\u0027d just hoped for a little more depth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chose not to comment on what he considered beautiful. \"Don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but I figured you wouldn\u0027t really want more than cheap sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut me a look. \"Because I\u0027m a demon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look at me like that. Being romantic isn\u0027t really in your job description.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, true. But at the very least, I\u0027d like to have a little understanding with my cheap sex. Someone who had some vague inkling of what I endure on a daily basis.\" He was still being gruff and demonlike, but there was a faint whisper of something surprisingly human under there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to tell him that I didn\u0027t think that was very likely. Then, I thought of Kristin, Kristin who watched him with doe eyes and fretted over his well-being. \"Someone who sort of gets your job and has an appreciation for its absurdity? Someone who\u0027s interested in helping you when you\u0027re stressed, in connecting with you and understanding things to an extent where you don\u0027t even have to say them anymore? Is that what you\u0027re looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"Yeah, like that\u0027ll happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Maybe there\u0027s someone out there like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may not have been human for a long time, but you still cling to their delusions. That\u0027s fairy-tale stuff. You can\u0027t have that. I can\u0027t have that. See you later.\" He vanished, uncaring of any mortals who might see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared vacantly at where he\u0027d been, wondering if what he said was true. Was he missing a good match right in front of him? Or was Kristin deluding herself with her crush on him? And was I deluding myself with my feelings for Seth? Was I really feeling connected to him or was it all just lust?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no use fretting about any of it now. Cedric didn\u0027t seem to want to kill me at the moment, so that was the best I could get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove over to Bellevue, just in time for the morning commute out of the city to be winding down. Bellevue was a suburb, a city in its own right, and the restaurant we\u0027d chosen was in Bellevue\u0027s old downtown, one that had eventually been supplanted when a mall rearranged the city\u0027s trendy areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was a quiet little bistro, tucked between a jewelry store and a bakery. Seth and Kayla were already there. She sat in a booster seat beside him, examining a stuffed unicorn while he leafed through a menu. Seeing both of them sent ripples of warmth and happiness through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey guys,\" I said, sliding in across from them. Kayla gave me a shy smile, and Seth positively lit up. His hair was as messy as usual, and his T-shirt today advertised Trix, a cereal I\u0027d forgotten even existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for doing this,\" I said. \"I really appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth\u0027s smile grew, though I saw the tiniest bit of apprehension in his eyes. \"Just so long as you\u0027re sure it\u0027s...you know...\" He glanced over at Kayla, who was groping for her glass. Seth hastily intervened to help her before she could knock it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be easy,\" I said. \"Maybe even boring. We\u0027ll just walk around and look for something resembling white stone or rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Kayla can help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned toward the little girl. She glanced between both of us, her blue eyes wide and eerily knowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so. Again, at this point, she just senses stuff without really understanding why. If we get anywhere near Jerome, I think she\u0027ll show some sort of reaction, even if she doesn\u0027t know what it is.\" At least I hoped so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, we didn\u0027t mention our mission for the rest of the meal. We made small talk instead and fawned over Kayla, but it was almost something we did on autopilot, something we weren\u0027t even paying attention to. Really, Seth and I were consumed by each other. It was more than just lust too, though I certainly hoped he\u0027d noticed my low-cut top today. I found myself just aglow from his presence. I loved being close to him, feeling the joy that spread within me. It was like falling in love again. It was that connection and understanding that Cedric had said was a fairy tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even when we finished up and went and scoped out our first beach, that electricity and warmth continued flowing between us. Kayla walked between us for a while, with each of us holding one of her hands. She struggled a little with the sand but seemed infinitely fascinated by the sights around her: the waves, the seagulls, other children. The rain had faded away today, and we had sunshine taunting us with the hope that spring had truly arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe found no white rocks, however, and Kayla had no out-of-the-ordinary reactions like she\u0027d had with me in the past, or even with Dante. When we got to our second beach, she began slowing down, and I realized this wasn\u0027t going to be the aggressive day of hunting I\u0027d hoped for. After a while, Seth picked her up and carried her. She managed to stay awake until we finished our search but promptly fell asleep in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew we\u0027d have to call it a day, but we stopped off at a little caf¨¦ on the way home that served great desserts. We settled into a corner booth, Seth and me sitting side by side while I held Kayla on my lap. We decided to simply split a piece of cheesecake, and naturally, I required coffee. Kayla still leaned drowsily against me, but she\u0027d valiantly woken up as though sensing the approach of sugar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brushed her hair back from her face. \"Hey,\" I said gently. \"Did you see anything magic today?\" That was how she\u0027d referred to me in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head and reached up to touch my cheek in a mirror of my own gesture. \"When will you be magic again?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I told her. \"Soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth\u0027s leg against mine was starting to stir up some illicit feelings, something I felt a little ashamed of with Kayla there. I was further startled when I glanced up at him and saw not lust in his eyes, but rather, something soft and tender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of you,\" he said. \"Just the way you interact with her...it\u0027s remarkable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I can get her to talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Nah. More than that. I\u0027ve seen it with the other girls. You have a knack with kids. You\u0027d make a great mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie had made the same offhand comment. I don\u0027t think Seth had ever really and truly grasped how much I\u0027d pined for children. His words filled me with both elation and sorrow. For an instant, I considered telling him about Nyx\u0027s dream and the bizarre pregnancy theory. Those things were too fragile and too precious to me, however, and the cheesecake\u0027s serendipitous arrival saved me from further deliberation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cheesecake was lemon raspberry, a bit adventurous for Kayla, perhaps, but she ate it without hesitation. Seth gave up on his share before us, and she and I finished it down to the last bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" he mused. \"I\u0027ll return her to Terry and Andrea, just in time for her the sugar rush to kick in. They\u0027ll never let her go out again.\" He frowned. \"Will you need her again? I think she has some kind of play-date thing tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, and reality dimmed my golden moment. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m running out of close places. I\u0027ll have to head up north next, up around Edmonds, though Dante pointed out that Jerome could be farther out-out on the Olympic Peninsula or something. The summoners would want to keep him close, but \u0027close\u0027 could mean ten miles or a hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to be able to go out to the coast in an easy day trip,\" observed Seth. Under the table, his hand rested on mine out of sympathy. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed his hand in return. \"It\u0027ll be as it\u0027ll be, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still want to help if I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offered him a rueful smile. \"You want to help me get back to being a succubus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis return smile was equally bittersweet. \"There\u0027s no way any of this can end well, Georgina. Sometimes...sometimes we have to choose the lesser of evils and simply enjoy our sweet moments while we can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike this one. And through some shared instinct, we both fell silent, savoring this brief interlude, this dream we\u0027d gotten ourselves ensnared in. For now, it was enough to just sit together like this. His hand moved idly on my leg, offering comfort and love...at least for a little while. Before long, the sweet affection turned into something with a bit more desire. I met his eyes, and while it wasn\u0027t the same animal intensity that had thrown me against the wall last night, there was still a longing in his eyes that told me how much he wanted me, to be closer to me. My body responded to it, and then we both glanced over at Kayla, who had fallen asleep again. We laughed, realizing the absurdity of our current situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should get her back,\" said Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said, sad at the thought of parting but certainly not aroused enough to make out while his niece was around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove me back to my car in Bellevue. Our parting kiss was gentle and light, almost hesitant. It seemed typical of this entire affair, like it was hardly real and would blow away at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you need, Thetis,\" he breathed into my ear. \"Anything you need, I\u0027ll do it. You know I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flower of agony and euphoria burst open in my chest. He hadn\u0027t called me Thetis, his old pet name for me, since the day we broke up. \"I know,\" I murmured into his shirt. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned to Queen Anne not long after that, getting a nice spot right in front of my building. My head was swimming with Seth and Kayla and Jerome and a hundred other things. I was so distracted that when I stepped into my apartment, I nearly walked right past Grace sitting on my couch. Of course, considering she was the first demon all week who hadn\u0027t attacked me the instant I cleared the door, my reaction to her subtlety was understandable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grace?\" I asked curiously, as though maybe it wasn\u0027t her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was leafing through a copy of Seattle Metropolitan magazine, their issue on Seattle\u0027s best brunches. When she glanced up at me, there was a tiredness in her eyes that even demonic perfection couldn\u0027t hide. Seeing her alone was almost as strange as her being here at all. I\u0027d grown so used to her and Mei being a unit that their forced separation lately seemed almost as tragic as Jerome\u0027s summoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are,\" she said. \"I almost left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I said. I meant it. I seemed to be on her and Mei\u0027s good side lately and wanted to keep it that way. Demons didn\u0027t like waiting, and without that innate connection of an archdemon, she couldn\u0027t instantly find me across time and space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace gave a half-hearted shrug. \"I don\u0027t mind. It\u0027s rather pleasant having a few moments\u0027 respite from all the politics and bickering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can imagine.\" I frowned. \"No, wait. I don\u0027t think I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear, I thought for a second she might laugh, but she kept that same stone face she excelled at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll all be over soon, which is why I came to see you. Mei and I have been talking to all of the other lesser immortals today. The day after tomorrow, a corporate demon named Ephraim will be making his final decision on who will replace Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold lump settled into my stomach. \"So soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell doesn\u0027t like to waste time and resources.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ephraim\u0027s already in the area and may come speak to you as he attempts to assess the situation. He\u0027ll want to know about your job, how things ran under Jerome, etc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith each word, my spirits sank further and further. My window to find Jerome was shriveling up. We were going to get a new archdemon anytime now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be afraid to speak the truth,\" she advised. \"I know that\u0027s often a concern among lesser immortals, for fear of causing offense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that,\" I muttered, thinking of Nanette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clearly, you don\u0027t want to actively anger Ephraim, but he has no affiliations with anyone currently involved in the dispute here. He won\u0027t punish you for stating your opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m guessing he might not listen to it either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was. A tiny quirky of her lips, gone so quickly that I wasn\u0027t even sure I saw it. She rose from the sofa and absentmindedly tugged on her blazer. It was deep, deep red, paired with sleek black trousers and patent leather heels. Underneath the collar of her coat, I caught a glimpse of that same chunky necklace she\u0027d worn at the meeting. I recalled Mei\u0027s sleeker one and couldn\u0027t resist my next words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This may sound weird...but I can\u0027t help but notice you and Mei are dressing differently lately.\" As soon as I said that, I hoped she wouldn\u0027t get mad at me essentially calling her and Mei copycats. Fortunately, she remained as blas¨¦ as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In these times, it\u0027s wise to distinguish yourself. None of our jobs are secure right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did a double-take. In all of this madness, it had never occurred to me that Grace and Mei might have something to fear. But of course they did. When Hell did re-orgs, they tended to tweak the larger structure. They could very well decide to transfer Grace and Mei and institute a whole new set of demonic leaders here. I didn\u0027t like that idea any better than losing Jerome. I wanted things to stay the same. And studying that fatigue I\u0027d seen on Grace\u0027s face, I realized I wasn\u0027t the only one with a lot to worry about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...for what it\u0027s worth, I think you\u0027re doing a great job. You\u0027ve had to do so much clean-up and damage control, and then with all these demons...\" I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t know. They\u0027d be stupid not to recognize that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strangest look came over Grace\u0027s face. I would have almost called it surprise, but her careful, icy composure made it hard to say for sure. \"Thank you, Georgina.\" Her voice was stiff, like dealing with compliments made her uncomfortable. \"I hope you\u0027ll share your feelings with Ephraim, should he speak with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I said. \"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a quick glance at my kitchen clock, she turned back to me and gave a smart nod. \"I have to meet with the others. I\u0027ll speak with you again soon.\" She vanished, but I could offer no farewell in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had just seen something. Something that changed everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood frozen. This whole time, for the last week, something had been percolating in my head. I\u0027d noted Grace and Mei\u0027s dedication to their job, how they were always there to help when chaos broke out. I\u0027d noted also how they\u0027d been forced to split up a lot lately with the new workload, and as Grace had said, they would now probably be scrutinized individually. And why wouldn\u0027t they be? If someone was going to scout for a new demon to run Seattle, why not look at the ones who were already running it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God,\" I breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was more to it than that. It wasn\u0027t just that Grace or Mei had the perfect motive to get Jerome summoned. I had more than motive before me. I had proof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSprinting to my bedroom, I searched frantically for the photo of Mary\u0027s medallion, certain it would be gone. Nope. It was still there, knocked off my nightstand to the floor. I picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was. When Grace had turned her head, I\u0027d caught a fuller glimpse of the chunky necklace and its network of brown and black stones. The answer had been right in front of me. At the Cellar meeting, I\u0027d noticed a piece of the necklace\u0027s stonework shaped like a crescent moon. I hadn\u0027t recognized it as anything more than ornamentation, but now, comparing the photo to what I\u0027d just seen on Grace, the truth was obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace had part of the seal. It was the left side of the medallion, separated in an irregular way to give it that fanciful crescent shape. But I\u0027d seen the fine etchings of the symbols when she tilted her head. They were the same. It was the seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture fell from my hands, and I ran back to the living room, grappling for my cell phone. My hands shook, and I could barely dial. Of course, for a second, I wasn\u0027t sure who I was dialing. Hugh, I decided. I had to tell him and the rest of my friends that-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strong hand covered my mouth and jerked me backward. My back hit somebody, a tall man with a rock-solid chest. His other hand reached out and wrapped around my wrist, making the links of my watch dig in painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drop it,\" he said. \"I know what you saw. I saw it too. But you can\u0027t tell anyone. Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could barely hear through the pounding of my heart in my ears, but it didn\u0027t matter. I knew this voice, knew it intimately. It had haunted my dreams-or rather, my nightmares-for the last six months. It was a sign of how truly out of it I\u0027d been after Nanette attacked me that I hadn\u0027t recognized his voice that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released his grip on my wrist, and a moment later, the hand on my mouth moved away as well. Miraculously, I didn\u0027t start screaming. Slowly, slowly, I turned around, knowing exactly what I\u0027d find. Blue-green eyes, just like the sea I\u0027d grown up around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roman.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-20.html","bookId":2057,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM"}
