Things were looking up. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eAnd then he opened his mouth. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eDaemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something...unexpected happens. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe hot alien living next door marks me. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eYou heard me.
