And as sound can often do, even the most precious fragments, it took me back to childhood, to some night in winter when all my family had gone down to the church in our village and stood for hours among the blazing candles, breathing the heavy, sensual smell of the incense as the priest walked in procession with the monstrance lifted high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered the sight of the round white Host behind the thick glass, the starburst of gold and jewels surrounding it, and overhead the embroidered canopy, swaying dangerously as the altar boys in their lace surplices tried to steady it as they moved on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thousand Benedictions after that one had engraved into my mind the words of the old hymn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO Salutaris Hostia\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuae caeli pandis ostium\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella premunt hostilia,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDa robur, fer auxilium . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as I lay in the remains of this broken coffin under the white marble slab at the side altar in this large country church, Gabrielle clinging to me still in the paralysis of sleep, I realized very slowly that above me were hundreds upon hundreds of humans who were singing this very hymn right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe church was full of people! And we could not get out of this damned nest of bones until all of them went away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround me in the dark, I could feel creatures moving. I could smell the shattered, crumbling skeleton on which I lay. I could smell the earth, too, and feel dampness and the harshness of the cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle\u0027s hands were dead hands holding to me. Her face was as inflexible as bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to brood on this, but to lie perfectly still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds of humans breathed and sighed above. Perhaps a thousand of them. And now they moved on into the second hymn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat comes now, I thought dismally. The litany, the blessings? On this of all nights, I had no time to lie here musing. I must get out. The image of that red velvet coat came to me again with an irrational sense of urgency, and a flash of equally inexplicable pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd quite suddenly, it seemed, Gabrielle opened her eyes. Of course I didn\u0027t see it. It was utterly black here. I felt it. I felt her limbs come to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no sooner had she moved than she grew positively rigid with alarm. I slipped my hand over her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be still,\" I whispered, but I could feel her panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the horrors of the preceding night must be coming back to her, that she was now in a sepulcher with a broken skeleton, that she lay beneath a stone she could hardly lift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in the church!\" I whispered. \"And we\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe singing surged on. \"Tantum ergo Sacramentum, Veneremur cernui.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s a Benediction,\" Gabrielle gasped. She was trying to lie still, but abruptly she lost the struggle, and I had to grip her firmly in both arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must get out,\" she whispered. \"Lestat, the Blessed Sacrament is on the altar, for the love of God!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remains of the wooden coffin clattered and creaked against the stone beneath it, causing me to roll over on top of her and force her flat with my weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now lie still, do you hear me!\" I said. \"We have no choice but to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her panic was infecting me. I felt the fragments of bone crunching beneath my knees and smelled the rotting cloth. It seemed the death stench was penetrating the walls of the sepulcher, and I knew I could not bear to be shut up with that stench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t,\" she gasped. \"We can\u0027t remain here. I have to get out!\" She was almost whimpering. \"Lestat, I can\u0027t.\" She was feeling the walls with both hands, and then the stone above us. I heard a pure toneless sound of terror issue from her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove the hymn had stopped. The priest would go up the altar steps, lift the monstrance in both hands. He would turn to the congregation and raise the Sacred Host in blessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle knew that of course, and Gabrielle suddenly went mad, writhing under me, almost heaving me to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, listen to me!\" I hissed. I could control this no longer. \"We are going out. But we shall do it like proper vampires, do you hear! There are one thousand people in the church and we are going to scare them to death. I will lift the stone and we will rise up together, and when we do, raise your arms and make the most horrible face you can muster and cry out if you can. That will make them fall back, instead of pouncing upon us and dragging us off to prison, and then we\u0027ll rush to the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t even stop to answer, she was already struggling, slamming the rotted boards with her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose up, giving the marble slab a great shove with both hands, and leapt out of the vault just as I had said I would do, pulling my cloak up in a giant arc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI landed upon the floor of the choir in a blaze of candlelight, letting out the most powerful cry I could make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHundreds rose to their feet before me, hundreds of mouths opening to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving another shout, I grabbed Gabrielle\u0027s hand and lunged towards them, leaping over the Communion rail. She gave a lovely high-pitched wail, her left hand raised as a claw as I pulled her down the aisle. Everywhere there was panic, men and women clutching for children, shrieking and falling backwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy doors gave at once on the black sky and the gusting breeze. I threw Gabrielle ahead of me and, turning back, made the loudest shriek that I could. I bared my fangs at the writhing, screaming congregation, and unable to tell whether some pursued or merely fell towards me in panic, I reached into my pockets and showered the marble floor with gold coins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The devil throws money!\" someone screeched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tore through the cemetery and across the fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds, we had gained the woods and I could smell the stables of a large house that lay ahead of us beyond the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood still, bent almost double in concentration, and summoned the horses. And we ran towards them, hearing the dull thunder of their hooves against the stalls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolting over the low hedge with Gabrielle beside me, I pulled the door off its hinges just as a fine gelding raced out of his broken stall, and we sprang onto his back, Gabrielle scrambling into place before me as I threw my arm around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug my heels into the animal and rode south into the woods and towards Paris. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-lestat-the-vampire-chronicles-2/page-27.html","bookId":2210,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:58 PM"}
