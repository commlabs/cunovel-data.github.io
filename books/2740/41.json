But that awareness wouldn’t keep me from taking her if she showed up at my door. I’m not as noble as she thinks I am. “Goodbye, Emma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goodbye, Reid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So?” John answers when I ring his cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not happening. And I don’t want to talk about it.” It’s not even 5:00 p.m. and I’ve just downed a Jack and Coke. Maybe there’s a luxury rehab place with a mother-son option. But rehab would never work; I’d have to actually quit drinking while I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s cool, man. No problemo. What about the Porsche? You still trading up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely. Soon as possible.” Dad already cashed out one of my investments; the money is sitting in my account. All I have to do is choose a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rest up, bro. We’re going out tonight. Time to get you back to your pointless, pleasure-driven life.” That sums it up. Back to the clubs, the parties, the hookups. New car. New project to train for this summer and film next fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that all it is—a pointless, pleasure-driven life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs. “Shit, Reid. I don’t know. If you’re lucky. It’s either that or aspire to be some Dark Lord asshole like my father, with a boring-as-shit trophy wife like Elise, who has nothing to do but work out, get plastic surgery and have sex with my dad. I’d fucking kill myself if I was her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents: Dad works, Mom drinks. Besides that, what? I think I’m nothing like them—as though my career and celebrity will make my existence more significant, but that’s bullshit and I know it. “Guess I’m feeling introspective.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn makes a sound of dismissal. “Dude, forget that shit. Talk about pointless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure what it will take to forget Emma Pierce’s belief that there’s more to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I don’t want to forget. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-you-are-between-the-lines-2/page-41.html","bookId":2740,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:41 PM"}
