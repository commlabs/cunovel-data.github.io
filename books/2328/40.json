How much have you got here, Yuri?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hundred fifty thousand in the schlock. And Dani\u0027s got sixty thousand, a little over. From four different people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did the arithmetic. \"That should put us right around eight hundred thousand. That\u0027s close enough. I think we\u0027re in business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God,\" Yuri said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter eased the wrapper off a bundle of counterfeit bills, fanned them, stood looking at them and shaking his head. Kenan pulled up a chair and began removing six bills from each packet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is tiresome,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For me too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s more trouble than it\u0027s worth. You know, there are plenty of dope dealers around, and most of them have wives or daughters. Maybe we should just cut and run, maybe our next client will prove more cooperative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was our third conversation since Yuri had come back with the two flight bags full of counterfeit money. He had called at half-hour intervals, first to suggest his own agenda for making the transfer, then to find something wrong with every suggestion I made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially if he hears how we cut before we run,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll carve young Lucia into bite-size pieces, my friend. And go looking for other game tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to cooperate,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your actions don\u0027t show it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to meet face-to-face,\" I said. \"You have to have an opportunity to inspect the money and we have to be able to assure ourselves that the girl is all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then you people come down on us. You can have the whole area staked out, God knows how many armed men you can put together. Our resources are limited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can still create a standoff,\" I said. \"You\u0027ll have the girl covered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A knife at her throat,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The edge of the blade right up against her skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we give you the money,\" I went on. \"One of you holds on to the girl while the other makes sure the money\u0027s all there. Then one of you takes the money to your vehicle while the other still holds the girl. Meanwhile your third man is posted where we can\u0027t see him, covering us with a rifle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone could get behind him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" I demanded. \"You\u0027ll be in place first. You\u0027ll see us arrive, all of us at the same time. You\u0027ll have the drop on us, that\u0027s to offset the numerical edge we\u0027ve got. Your man with the rifle will be able to cover your withdrawal, and you\u0027d be safe anyway because we\u0027d have the girl back by this point and the money would be in the car with your partner, and out of our reach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the face-to-face business,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor, I thought, could he rely too strongly on the third man, the one covering his retreat with the rifle. Because I was virtually certain there were only two of them, so there wouldn\u0027t be any third man. But if I let him think we figured their strength at three, maybe it would make him feel a little more secure. The value of the third man lay not in the covering fire he could lay down but in our belief that he was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say we set up fifty yards apart. You bring the money halfway and then return to your lines. Then we bring the girl halfway and one of us stays there, knife at her throat, as you said-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you said, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"- while the other withdraws with the money. Then I release the girl and she runs to you while I back off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No good. You have the money and the girl at the same time and we\u0027re on the other side of the field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAround and around and around. The operator\u0027s recorded voice cut in, asking for more money, and he dropped a quarter in without missing a beat. He wasn\u0027t worried about having calls traced, not at this stage. His calls were lasting longer and longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0027d been able to reach the Kongs early on, we could pick him up while he was still on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"All right, try it like this. We set up fifty yards apart, just as you said. You\u0027ll be in place first, you\u0027ll see us arrive. You\u0027ll show the girl so we can see you\u0027ve brought her. Then I\u0027ll approach your position carrying the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Unarmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have a gun concealed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have a suitcase full of dough in each hand. A hidden gun\u0027s not going to do me much good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You check the money. When you\u0027re satisfied, you let the girl go. She joins her father and the rest of our people. Your man takes off with the money. You and I wait. Then you take off and I go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could grab me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m unarmed and you\u0027ve got a knife, a gun, too, if you want. And your sharpshooter is behind a tree covering everybody with the rifle. It\u0027s all going your way. I don\u0027t see how you can have a problem with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll see my face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wear a mask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cuts the visibility. And you\u0027d still be able to describe me even if you didn\u0027t get that good a look at my face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought, fuck it, let\u0027s throw the dice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I already know what you look like, Ray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard his intake of breath, then a stretch of silence, and for a minute there I was afraid I\u0027d lost him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said, \"What do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know your name. I know what you look like. I know about some of the women you killed. And one you almost killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The little whore,\" he said. \"She heard my first name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know your last name, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should I? Look it up for yourself, it\u0027s right there on the calendar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you figure that out for yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like a cop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m a cop, why isn\u0027t there a pack of blue-and-whites lined up in front of your house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you don\u0027t know where it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try Middle Village. Penelope Avenue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could almost feel him relax. \"I\u0027m impressed,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of cop plays it this way, Ray?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in Landau\u0027s pocket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close. We\u0027re in bed together, we\u0027re partners. I\u0027m married to his cousin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No wonder we couldn\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. I should bail out now, cut the bitch\u0027s throat and get the hell out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027re dead,\" I said. \"An all-points goes out nationwide in a matter of hours, with you on the hook for Gotteskind and Alvarez, too. Do the deal and I guarantee I\u0027ll sit on it for a week, longer if I can. Maybe forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I won\u0027t want it to come out, will I? You can go set up shop on the other side of the country. Plenty of dope dealers in L.A. Plenty of fine-looking women out there, too. They love to go for a ride in a pretty new truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for a long moment. Then he said, \"Go over it again. The whole scenario, from the time we arrive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went through it. He interrupted with a question from time to time and I answered them all. Finally he said, \"I wish I could trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ,\" I said. \"I\u0027m the one who has to do the trusting. I\u0027ll be walking up to you unarmed with a bag of money in each hand. If you decide you don\u0027t trust me you can always kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I could,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s better for you if you don\u0027t. It\u0027s better for both of us if the whole transaction goes off just the way it\u0027s scheduled to. We both come out winners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re out a million dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that fits in with my plans, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You figure it out,\" I said, leaving him to puzzle out my own interfamilial secret agenda, some strategy I must have for getting the upper hand on my partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting,\" he said. \"Where do you want to do the switch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was ready for the question. I had proposed enough other sites in earlier phone calls, and I\u0027d been saving this one. \"Green-Wood Cemetery,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I know where that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ought to. That\u0027s where you dumped Leila Alvarez. It\u0027s a distance from Middle Village, but you found your way there once before. It\u0027s nine-twenty. There are two entrances on the Fifth Avenue side, one around Twenty-fifth Street, the other ten blocks south of there. Take the Twenty-fifth Street entrance and head south about twenty yards inside the fence. We\u0027ll enter at Thirty-fifth and approach you from the south.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laid it all out for him, like a war-games tactician re-creating the Battle of Gettysburg. \"Ten-thirty,\" I said. \"That gives you over an hour to get there. No traffic at this hour, so that shouldn\u0027t be a problem. Or do you need more time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t need anything like an hour. He was in Sunset Park, a five-minute drive from the cemetery. But he didn\u0027t need to know that I knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That should be time enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll have plenty of time to set up. We\u0027ll enter ten blocks south of you at ten-forty. That gives you ten minutes lead time, plus the ten minutes it\u0027ll take us to walk up to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027ll stay fifty yards back,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ll come the rest of the way alone. With the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I liked it better with Khoury,\" he said. \"Where I said \u0027Frog\u0027 and he jumped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see where you would. Twice as much money this time, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s true,\" he said. \"Leila Alvarez. Haven\u0027t thought of her in a while.\" His voice took on an almost dreamy quality. \"She was really nice. Choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord, she was frightened,\" he said. \"Poor little bitch. She was really terrified.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN I finally got off the phone I had to sit down. Kenan asked me if I was all right. I said I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t look so hot,\" he said. \"You look like you need a drink, but I guess that\u0027s the one thing you don\u0027t need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yuri just made some coffee. I\u0027ll get you a cup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he brought it I said, \"I\u0027m okay. It takes it out of you, talking to that son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tipped my hand some, let him know some of what I know. It started to look as though that was the only way to get him off the dime. He wasn\u0027t going to move unless he could control the situation completely. I decided to show him he was in a little weaker position than he realized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYuri said. \"You know who he is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know his name. I know what he looks like and the license number of the car he\u0027s driving.\" I closed my eyes for a moment, feeling his presence on the other end of the telephone line, sensing the workings of his mind. \"I know who he is,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explained what I\u0027d worked out with Callander, started to sketch out a diagram of the terrain, then realized that what we needed was a map. Yuri said there was a street map of Brooklyn somewhere in the apartment but didn\u0027t know where. Kenan said Francine had kept one in the glove box of the Toyota, and Peter went downstairs for it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-40.html","bookId":2328,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM"}
