It had a skylight, so the lighting in the room was good, and the young orang in the cage appeared healthy enough, bright-eyed and alert. He seemed to have recovered completely from the darts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Gorevitch paced back and forth, intensely frustrated, glancing at his watch. On the table nearby, his video camera lay on its side, the case cracked, muddy water draining out of it. Gorevitch would have taken it apart to dry it, but he lacked the tools. He lacked...he lacked...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOff to one side, Zanger, the network representative, said, \"What are you going to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re waiting for another bloody camera,\" Gorevitch said. He turned to the DHL rep, a young Malay man in a bright yellow uniform. \"How much longer now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They said within the hour, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGorevitch snorted. \"They said that two hours ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. But the plane has left Bekasi and is on its way to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBekasi was on the north coast of Java. Eight hundred miles away. \"And the camera is on the plane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe so, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGorevitch paced, avoiding Zanger\u0027s accusatory stare. It was all a comedy of errors. In the jungle, Gorevitch had worked to resuscitate the ape for almost an hour before the animal showed signs of life. Then he had struggled to bind the animal and tranquilize it again - not too much this time - and then monitor the animal with care, to prevent the creature from going into adrenaline shock while Gorevitch brought him north to Medan, the nearest big town with an airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orang survived the journey without incident, ending up in the warehouse, where he cursed like a Dutch sailor. Gorevitch notified Zanger, who immediately flew in from New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut by the time Zanger arrived, the ape had developed laryngitis, and no longer spoke, except for a raspy whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell good is that?\" Zanger said. \"You can\u0027t hear him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t matter,\" Gorevitch said. \"We\u0027ll tape him and then dub in his voice later. You know, lip-synch him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll dub in his voice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody will know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you out of your mind?Everybody will know. Every lab in the world will go over this video with sophisticated equipment. They\u0027ll spot a dub in five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Gorevitch said, \"then we\u0027ll wait until he gets better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZanger didn\u0027t like that, either. \"He sounds quite ill. Did he catch a cold somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possible,\" Gorevitch said. In fact, he was almost certain the ape had caught his own cold, during the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. It was a mild cold for Gorevitch, but appeared to be serious for the orang, who was now bent over in spasms of coughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He needs a vet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t,\" Gorevitch said. \"He\u0027s a protected animal, and we stole him, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Youstole him,\" Zanger said. \"And if you\u0027re not careful, you\u0027ll kill him as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s young. He\u0027ll recover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, indeed, the following day, the ape was talking again, but coughing spasmodically and spitting up ugly, yellow-green gobs. Gorevitch decided he\u0027d better film the animal now, so he went to get his equipment from the car, stumbled, and dropped the camera in a muddy ditch. Cracked the case open. All this not ten feet from the warehouse door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course in the entire city of Medan, they did not seem to be able to lay their hands on a decent video camera. So they had had to fly one in from Java. They were waiting for the camera now, while the ape swore and hacked and coughed and spat at them from inside his cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZanger stood just out of range, shaking his head. \"Christ, what a cock-up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd once again Gorevitch turned to the Malay kid and said, \"How much longer?\" The kid just shook his head and shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd inside the cage, the orang coughed and swore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 060\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia Bellarminoopened the door to her daughter\u0027s bedroom and began a swift examination. The room was a mess, of course. Crumbs in the creases of the rumpled bedcovers, scratched CDs on the floor, knocked-over Coke cans beneath the bed, along with a dirty hairbrush, a curling iron, and an empty tube of self-tanner. Georgia pulled open the drawers of the bedside table, revealing a clutter of chewing-gum wrappers, balled-up underwear, breath mints, mascara, photos from last year\u0027s prom, matches, a calculator, dirty socks, old issues ofTeen Vogue andPeople. And a pack of cigarettes, which didn\u0027t make her happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen to the dresser drawers, riffling through them quickly, feeling all the way to the back; then the closet, which took her quite a while. A jumble of shoes and sneakers at the bottom. The cabinet under the bathroom sink, and even the dirty clothes hamper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found nothing to explain the bruises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, she thought, there was hardly any purpose to putting a hamper in the room, since Jennifer just dropped her clothes all over the bathroom floor. Georgia Bellarmino bent over and picked them up, not really thinking about it. That was when she noticed the streaks on the tile floor of the bathroom. Rubber streaks. Faint. In parallel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what had caused those streaks: a stepladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up at the ceiling she saw a panel that provided an entrance to the attic. There were smudged fingerprints on that panel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia went to get a stepladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the panel aside, and needles and syringes tumbled out, clattering onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God,she thought. She reached up into the attic space, feeling around. Her hand touched a stack of cardboard tubes, like toothpaste. She brought them out; they all bore medical labels:LUPRON, GONAL-F, FOLLESTIM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFertility drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was her daughter doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided not to call her husband; he would get too upset. Instead, she took out her cell phone and dialed the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 061\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn theChicago offices of Dr. Martin Bennett, the intercom was buzzing, but Dr. Bennett paid no attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biopsy report was worse than he had expected, much worse. He ran his fingers along the edge of the paper, wondering how he would tell his patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartin Bennett was fifty-five; he had been a practicing internist for nearly a third of a century, and had delivered bad news to many patients in his day. But it never got easier. Especially if they were young, with young children. He glanced at the pictures of his sons on his desk. They were both in college now. Tad was a senior at Stanford; Bill was at Columbia. And Bill was premed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock on the door and his nurse, Beverly, stuck her head in. \"I\u0027m sorry, Dr. Bennett, but you weren\u0027t answering the intercom. And I thought it was important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I was just...trying to think how to put it.\" He stood up behind the desk. \"I\u0027ll see Andrea now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeverly shook her head. \"Andrea hasn\u0027t arrived,\" she said. \"I\u0027m talking about the other woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What other woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeverly slipped into the office and closed the door behind her. She lowered her voice. \"Your daughter,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about? I don\u0027t have a daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s a young woman in the waiting room who says she\u0027s your daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible,\" Bennett said. \"Who is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeverly glanced at a note card. \"Her name is Murphy. She lives in Seattle. Her mother works at the university. She\u0027s about twenty-eight and she has a toddler with her, maybe a year and a half. Little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murphy? Seattle?\" Bennett was thinking back. \"Twenty-eight, you say? No, no. Impossible.\" He had had his share of affairs in college, and even in medical school. But he\u0027d married Emily almost thirty years ago, and since then the only times he had been unfaithful had been at medical conferences. True, that was at least twice a year, in Canc��n, in Switzerland, somewhere exotic. But he\u0027d only started that about ten, fifteen years ago. He just didn\u0027t think it was possible he\u0027d have a child that old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeverly said, \"I guess you never know for sure...Will you see her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell her,\" Beverly said. She dropped her voice to a whisper. \"But we don\u0027t want her making a scene in front of the patients. She seems like she might be a little, uh, unstable. And if she\u0027s not your daughter, maybe you should set her straight in private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBennett nodded slowly. He dropped back into his chair. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Show her in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big surprise, huh?\"The woman standing in the doorway, bouncing a child in her arms, was an unattractive blonde of medium height, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, grunge clothes. Her baby\u0027s face was dirty, dripping snot. \"Sorry I didn\u0027t dress for the occasion, but you know how it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBennett stood behind his desk. \"Please come in, Miss, uh...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murphy. Elizabeth Murphy.\" She nodded to the baby. \"This is Bess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Dr. Bennett.\" He waved her to the seat on the other side of the desk. He looked at her closely as she sat down. He saw no resemblance at all, not the slightest. He, himself, was dark-haired, fair-skinned, slightly overweight. She was olive-complexioned, rail-thin, brittle, tense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know,\" she said. \"You\u0027re thinking I don\u0027t look anything like you. But with my natural hair color, and more weight, you can see the family thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Bennett said, sitting down, \"but to be frank, I don\u0027t see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay,\" she said, shrugging. \"I figure it must be a shock to you. My showing up at your office like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s certainly a surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to call ahead and warn you, but then I decided I should just come. In case you refused to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Miss Murphy, what makes you believe you are my daughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m yours, all right. There\u0027s no question about it.\" She was speaking with an uncanny confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBennett said, \"Your mother says she knows me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever met me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a sigh of relief. \"Then I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t understand - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come right to the point. You did your residency in Dallas. At Southern Memorial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"Yes...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the residents had their blood typed, in case they were needed as emergency blood donors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a long time ago.\" He was thinking back. About thirty years, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well. They kept the blood, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, he heard that conviction in her voice. \"Meaning what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shifted in her seat. \"You want to hold your granddaughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at the moment, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave a crooked smile. \"You\u0027re not what I expected. I thought a doctor would be more...sympathetic. They\u0027ve got more sympathetic people at the methadone clinic in Bellevue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Murphy,\" he said, \"let me - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But when I got off the drugs, and I had this beautiful daughter, I wanted to make sense of my life. I wanted my baby to know her grandparents. And I wanted to finally meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time, Bennett decided, to cut this short. He stood up. \"Miss Murphy, you realize that I can have genetic testing done, and it will show - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"I realize that.\" She tossed a folded sheet of paper onto his desk. He opened it slowly. It was a report from a genetic laboratory in Dallas. He scanned the paragraphs. He felt dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It says you are definitely my father,\" she said. \"One chance in four billion that you are not. They tested my genetic material against your stored blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is crazy,\" he said, dropping back in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you would congratulate me,\" she said. \"It wasn\u0027t easy to figure it out. My mom was living in St. Louis twenty-eight years ago; she was married at the time...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBennett had gone to medical school in St. Louis. \"But she doesn\u0027t know me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had artificial insemination from an anonymous donor. Which was you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBennett felt dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured the donor must have been a medical student,\" she continued, \"because she went to the clinic at the medical school. And they had their own sperm bank. Medical students donated sperm for money back then, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Twenty-five dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go. Good pocket money in those days. And you could do it, what, once a week? Go in there and pop off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The clinic burned down fifteen years ago, and all the records were lost. But I got the student yearbooks and searched them. Each year the class was a hundred and twenty students, half female. That means sixty males. Eliminate Asians and other minorities, you have about thirty-five a year. Back then sperm didn\u0027t keep for more than a year or so. I ended up with about a hundred and forty names to check. It went faster than I thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBennett slumped down in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you want to know the truth? When I saw your picture in the medical yearbook, I knew immediately. Something about your hair, your eyebrows...\" She shrugged. \"Anyway, here I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But this was never supposed to happen,\" Bennett said. \"We were all anonymous donors. Untraceable. No one would ever know whether we had children or not. And back then, our anonymity was a given.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well. Those days are over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I never agreed to be your parent. That\u0027s my point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"What can I say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t having a child. I was helping infertile couples so they could have a child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m your child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have parents...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m your child, Dr. Bennett. And I can prove it in court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. They stared at each other. The baby drooled and squirmed. Finally, he said, \"Why did you come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to meet my biological father...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027ve met him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I wanted him to fulfill his duties and obligations. Because of what he did to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there it was. Finally out on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Murphy,\" he said slowly, \"you\u0027ll get nothing from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood. She stood, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reason I\u0027m an addict,\" she said, \"is because of your genes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be absurd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father was an alcoholic and you had drug troubles of your own. You carry the genes for addiction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What genes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"AGS3. Heroin dependence.DAT 1. Cocaine addiction. You have those genes, and so do I. You gave me those genes. You never should have donated defective sperm in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" he said, suddenly agitated. This woman was clearly following a memorized script. He felt danger. \"I donated sperm thirty years ago. There were no tests back then...and there is no responsibility now...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew,\" she snapped. \"You knew you had a problem with cocaine. You knew it ran in your family. But you sold your sperm anyway. You put your damaged, dangerous sperm on the market. Not caring who you infected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Infected?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had no business doing what you did. You\u0027re a disgrace to the medical profession. Burdening other people with your genetic diseases. And not giving a damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough his agitation, he somehow found self-control. He reached for the door. \"Miss Murphy,\" he said, \"I have nothing more to say to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re throwing me out? You\u0027ll regret this,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll regret this very, very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she stormed out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling suddenly drained,Bennett collapsed into the chair behind his desk. He was in a state of shock. He stared at his desk, at the files for his waiting patients. None of it seemed to matter, now. He dialed his attorney, and explained the situation quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she want money?\" the attorney said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assume so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she tell you how much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeff,\" Bennett said, \"you\u0027re not taking this seriously?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, we have to,\" the attorney said. \"This happened in Missouri, and Missouri had no clear laws regarding paternity from artificial insemination back then. Cases like yours were never a problem until quite recently. But as a rule in paternity disputes, the court orders child support.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s twenty-eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, and she has parents. Still, she can make an argument in court. Based on this gene thing, she can claim reckless endangerment, she can claim child abuse, and whatever else she can pull out of a hat. Maybe she\u0027ll get something from a judge, maybe she won\u0027t. Remember, paternity rulings are stacked against males. Say you get a woman pregnant and she decides to have an abortion. She can do that without consulting you. But if she decides to give birth, you\u0027ll pay support, even though you never agreed to have a child with her. The court will say it\u0027s your responsibility not to have gotten her pregnant in the first place. Or suppose you do genetic testing on your kids, and discover they\u0027re not yours - your wife cheated on you. The court will still require you to pay support for kids that aren\u0027t yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s twenty-eight years old. She\u0027s not a child - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The question is, does a prominent physician want to go to court on a case that involves not supporting his own daughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Bennett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, you don\u0027t. She knows that. And I assume she knows Missouri law, too. So wait until she calls back, arrange a meeting, and call me. If she has an attorney, all the better. Make sure he comes. Meanwhile, fax me that genetic report she gave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to have to pay her off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Count on it,\" the attorney said, and hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 062\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe deskofficer at the Rockville Police Station was an attractive, smooth-skinned black woman of twenty-five. The desk plate readOFFICER J. LOWRY . Her uniform was crisp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia Bellarmino pushed her daughter close to the other side of the desk. She set the paper bag of syringes in front of the policewoman and said, \"Officer Lowry, I want to know why my daughter has these things, but she refuses to tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer daughter glared at her. \"I hate you, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Lowry showed no surprise. She glanced at the syringes. She turned to Georgia\u0027s daughter. \"Were these prescribed to you by a physician?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they involve matters of reproduction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sixteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I see some ID?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s sixteen, all right,\" Georgia Bellarmino said, leaning forward. \"And I want to know - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, ma\u0027am,\" the policewoman said. \"If she is sixteen, and these drugs involve reproductive issues, you have no right to be informed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean I have no right to be informed? She\u0027s mydaughter. She\u0027ssixteen. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the law, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that law is for abortions. She isn\u0027t having an abortion. I don\u0027t know what the hell she is doing. These are fertility drugs. She\u0027sshooting up fertility drugs. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I can\u0027t help you on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean my daughter is allowed to inject drugs into her body, and I am not allowed to know what is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if she won\u0027t tell you, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about her doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Lowry shook her head. \"He can\u0027t tell you, either. Doctor-patient privilege.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia Bellarmino collected the syringes and threw them back in the bag. \"This is ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t make the laws,\" the policewoman said. \"I just enforce them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were drivinghome. \"Honey,\" Georgia said. \"Are you trying to get pregnant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Sitting there with her arms folded.

You\u0027re a nosy, evil bitch. I hate you, and I hate this car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt went on like this for a while, until finally Georgia drove her daughter back to school. Jennifer got out of the car, slamming the door. \"Andyou made me late for French!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was anexhausting morning, and she had canceled two appointments. Now she had to try and reschedule the clients. Georgia went into the office, set the bag of needles on the floor, and started dialing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe office manager, Florence, walked by and saw the bag. \"Wow,\" she said. \"Aren\u0027t you a little old for this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not me,\" Georgia said irritably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then...not your daughter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia nodded. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s that Dr. Vandickien,\" Florence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down in Miami. These teenage girls take hormones, pump up their ovaries, sell their eggs to him, and pocket the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And do what?\" Georgia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buy breast implants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorgia sighed. \"Great,\" she said. \"Just great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted her husband to talk to Jennifer, but unfortunately, Rob was on a flight to Ohio, where they were making a TV segment about him. That discussion - which was sure to be fiery - would have to wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHapter 063\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiding theunderground tram from the Senate Office Building to the Senate Dining Room, Senator Robert Wilson (D-Vermont) turned to Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) and said, \"I think we ought to be more proactive on this genetic thing. For example, we should consider a law that would prevent young women from selling their eggs for profit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young girls already doing that, Bob,\" Feinstein said. \"They sell their eggs now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, to pay for college?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe a few.

I think medically the procedure has dangers. I think these girls may be risking their reproductive futures. But what would be the basis for banning it? Their bodies, their eggs.\" Feinstein shrugged. \"Anyway, the boat\u0027s sailed, Bob.
