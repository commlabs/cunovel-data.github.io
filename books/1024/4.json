{"id":12461,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV SCHUMER\u0027S STORY","content":"They rowed back across the lagoon to the camp, and there Schumer set to on the construction of his dredge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Floyd had suddenly found an object of interest on the island almost as absorbing as the oyster bed, and that object was Schumer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Schumer had seemed to him at first a simple trader bound up in trade, one of a class that swarms in the Pacific. Bound up in trade he undoubtedly was, but there was all the difference in the world between him and the others of his class that Floyd had come across in his wanderings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps the hardest thing in the world to put one\u0027s finger on is personality, or the power that tells in a man\u0027s appearance, actions, and speech. Its essence lies in complexity, and is born of all the multitudinous attributes that form spirit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Floyd watched Schumer working on the dredge, and wondered at his ingenuity and power over metal and wood. He had but little material to his hand—cask hoops and old ironwork from the wreck, and so on—yet he made the most of it, and did not grumble. He explained the mechanism of the thing when he had[Pg 38] finished. He had set Isbel to work stitching the canvas bag which was part of the dredge, and she sat mysterious as a sphinx, working and listening to him as he talked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then, later on, as they smoked after supper and watched the stars break out over the lagoon, Schumer went on talking, now of trade and the wild work he had seen here and there in the Pacific.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was vague, rarely giving the names of islands or places, contenting himself with such wide terms as \"It was an island south of the Marshalls,\" or \"It was down in the Solomons.\" It was down in the Solomons that he had got the scar on his arm which he showed to Floyd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s fifteen years old,\" said he; \"it missed the artery or I wouldn\u0027t be here now. I was only twenty then and new to the islands, new to the sea also. I\u0027d taken passage in a big schooner; two hundred and fifty tons she was, captained by a Yankee skipper, and manned by the biggest crowd of rascals that ever sailed out of Frisco to meet perdition.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We put in at a big island southeast of Manahiki. I went ashore with the old man, the first mate, and two of the hands that could be trusted. We were all well armed, and lucky for us we were.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was the bos\u0027n who started the trouble—a big, black-bearded chap, half Irish, quarter Scotch, with a tar brush somewhere in his family. Not a good mixture by any means.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We hadn\u0027t been ashore ten minutes when this chap took the schooner. There were no preliminaries. She had a big brass swivel gun, and he turned it on the beach and let fly. He\u0027d loaded her with a bag of bullets, and[Pg 39] the first shot smashed the boat we\u0027d landed in, smashed the only canoes in the place, and tore up the sand as if it had been plowed. Fortunately we had seen his game and scattered, but two natives were killed, and the rest took to the bush.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So did we, and under cover of the leaves we watched what was going on in the schooner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They seemed pretty satisfied with themselves. They were sure against attack; they had smashed our boat and the canoes, and they were pretty certain we wouldn\u0027t try to board them by swimming, for the lagoon was full of sharks. They brought up grog and took to dancing on deck. Their object, of course, was to get away with the schooner and all the trade on board, change her name, and make for some port on the South American coast, and sell schooner and cargo and all. There was money aboard, too—the ship\u0027s money and some coin of the old man\u0027s, and fifty British sovereigns of my own hid in my bunk, though the beggars did not guess that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, they should have knocked the shackle off the anchor chain and got to sea at once; they chose instead to drink and dance, celebrating their victory. You see they did not know whom they were dealing with.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"From where we lay we could have picked them off like crows with our rifles. Of course, that would have meant they would have gone below and hid, and then at dark they\u0027d have gone away. It would have sobered them, too, and I did not want that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So we let them be, putting our trust in the bottle, and we set to and made a raft with the help of some of the natives who were hiding in the bush with us.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 40]\"There was a little creek hidden from the schooner by a cape of coconut and pandanus trees, and we made the raft there, and a rotten raft it was; but it served our purpose, and when dark came down we shoved off, us four and two natives.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The tide was with us; it was running out of the lagoon. The natives had canoe paddles, but they scarcely used them. Not a soul was on deck; they were all in the saloon drinking, and the noise was worse than a tavern on the Barbary Coast of a Saturday night. They wouldn\u0027t have heard us coming alongside if we had come blowing trumpets—which we didn\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Schumer paused to refill and light his pipe. The lagoon was now a sheet of stars, and not a sound came but the murmur of the reef and the splash of a fish jumping in the lagoon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We came alongside, and in a minute we were over the rail—she had a low freeboard—every man of us. We didn\u0027t trouble about the raft, and she went out to sea on the tide.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The saloon hatch was off, and there they were all crowded like bees in a bottle fighting and playing cards and drinking and smoking, and there as they sat we began to plug them with our Winchesters. We got six before the smoke of the firing hid them, and then we fired into the smoke and stood by to down them as they came up the companionway. They were plucky, but mad with drink, and they had no arms to speak of. One of them had a bottle in his hand, the only thing he could find to fight with; when he tumbled over into the lee scuppers he still held it unbroken, and I guess he went before his Maker with it like that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We settled them all with the exception of the bos\u0027n.[Pg 41] He skulked below, and I went down to find him. The saloon was clear of smoke and the swinging lamp was burning; dead men were lying everywhere, but no bos\u0027n. He\u0027d taken refuge in the old man\u0027s cabin and had barricaded the door, so that I couldn\u0027t kick it in—only managed to crack the paneling; so I began firing through it with my revolver, and then out he came with two bullets in him and a sheath knife in his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He gave me this cut before we had done with one another.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The upshot was that every man of them was given his dose, and we took the schooner out of the lagoon, us four, with four Kanakas who joined the ship, and we had good luck all the rest of the voyage, though my arm inflamed so that I nearly lost it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So you see a trader\u0027s life out here is not all trading; one has to fight sometimes for what one gets, and to keep what one gets.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Floyd could not help thinking that Schumer\u0027s part in the recapture of the schooner had been more than he had stated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s made you take to trading out here?\" he asked. \"You\u0027re a sailor, aren\u0027t you? At least I made the guess yesterday that you were a sailor first and a trader after.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I began as a sailor. I served my two years before these new topsail yards made reefing child\u0027s work. I served in a Hamburg ship. What made me a trader? Well, I suppose it was the common sense that made me give up sailoring. I do not like hard manual labor. As I told you before, it was on the cards that I might have cast my lines in the newspaper world. Books interest me, written books; the world interested[Pg 42] me, and I might have been the correspondent of newspapers. I am a fair linguist, and I can write simple English and picture fairly well what I see in words; yet I am a trader. I do not know why I am a trader in the least. It is the way of life that has come to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He ceased, and they sat in silence for a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Floyd, looking round, saw that Isbel had vanished; she had slipped off to bed somewhere in the bush—slipped off like an animal. It was her characteristic that she was one of the shipwrecked party, yet remained apart. She helped in cooking and boat sailing and in other ways; but she lived her own life as an animal lives it, thinking her own thoughts, keeping her own counsel, speaking little. There was nothing about her of the childish and the light-hearted that stamps so many Polynesians, which is not to say that she was gloomy or too old for her years. She was just a creature apart, and had always the air of a looker-on at a game in which she helped, but which did not particularly interest her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The girl\u0027s gone,\" said Floyd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Schumer looked round.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Crept off to sleep; she\u0027ll sleep anywhere—in a tree or in the bush. I can\u0027t make out Kanakas. I\u0027ve read a lot of stuff written about them, but there\u0027s always something behind that no one can get at. They are right down good in a lot of ways, and right down bad in others. Missionaries civilize them and varnish them over, but there\u0027s always the Kanaka underneath; they make Christians of them, but it\u0027s only on the outside. Look at that girl—she\u0027s only a child, of course, but a missionary has had the handling of her, and in the time we\u0027ve been here she has turned right in on herself and[Pg 43] gone back to her people, so to speak. She\u0027s not bad, but she\u0027s a savage, and nothing will make a savage anything else than a savage, except, maybe, on the outside.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She seems pretty faithful and helps us all she can,\" said Floyd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, she\u0027s not bad,\" yawned Schumer; \"and she\u0027s a good deal of use in her way, and she\u0027s company of a sort, same as a dog or a cat. Well, I\u0027m going to turn in.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He rose up and stretched himself, and looked at the starlit lagoon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s funny to think there\u0027s maybe a fortune in pearls under all that,\" said he, \"no knowing—but it will take some getting.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll get it if it\u0027s there,\" said Floyd.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823/52906.html","bookId":1024,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:43:14 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:43:14 AM"}
