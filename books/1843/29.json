He glanced at Gillian and then turned to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winslow needed to know so that he could prepare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith wouldn\u0027t let it go. \"Prepare what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our troops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian stiffened. \"For battle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going into England?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\" Gillian demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you give us the names of the Englishmen,\" Brodick answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a step toward him. \"Us? Then Dylan is also going to prepare your soldiers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"My soldiers are always prepared.

You will risk war with England, whether you intend to or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, lass, you don\u0027t understand,\" Brodick told her. \"Your king won\u0027t even know we\u0027re there.

When exactly are you planning this invasion no one\u0027s going to know about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iain already answered that question,\" he replied. \"We\u0027ll leave as soon as you give us the names of the English pigs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" she said. \"Now that I thoroughly understand your plans, I\u0027m never going to give you their names. I\u0027ll find a way to deal with them. One way or another, justice will prevail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain scowled. \"Gillian, what do you think you could do? You\u0027re a woman—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick defended her. \"She\u0027s strong, and she\u0027s determined, and very clever. I honestly think she would find a way to defeat the bastards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t praise,\" he countered. \"I\u0027m simply stating what I know to be true. However, I cannot let you rob us of our rights, Gillian. We have just as much at stake in this as you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Revenge isn\u0027t my primary motive,\" she argued. \"But it\u0027s yours, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. She turned to Ramsey in hopes of ending the discussion. \"I could be ready to leave in just a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey nodded. \"Are you coming with us, Brodick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time for that direct question, lass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brodick, I seem to remember that when Annie Drummond was about to pour that godawful mother\u0027s fire on my arm, you told her I wouldn\u0027t make a sound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t,\" she answered. \"But you didn\u0027t ask me. You told me. I\u0027m just following your lead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the love of God,\" he muttered, his patience at an end. \"If you want me to come with you, then ask. Do it now, Gillian, or I\u0027m leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would leave me?\" she whispered, appalled he would threaten such a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he wanted to throttle her. \"Ask me,\" he demanded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to think that I need you…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a step back. He followed. With a sigh, she tried again. \"It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve gotten to know you quite well and I trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already knew you trusted me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you making this so difficult?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a difficult man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, he is,\" Ramsey agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others had obviously heard every word she\u0027d said. Feeling like a fool, she asked, \"Will you come with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick tilted her chin up with his thumb. \"I\u0027ll stay with you until you get back home. I give you my word,\" he promised. \"Now you can stop worrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOblivious to their audience, he leaned down and kissed her. It was a gentle touch of his mouth against hers, and it was finished before she even had time to blink, yet it still made her heart race.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA burst of laughter startled her, and she turned to the sound. Her eyes widened then, for now there were at least twelve women waiting by the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laird Maitland, there are quite a few young ladies waiting to speak to you,\" Gillian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith laughed. \"They aren\u0027t waiting to speak to my husband. He\u0027s already taken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taken?\" Gillian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Married,\" Judith explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For as long as Gillian is in the Highlands, she\u0027s my responsibility,\" Iain began. \"She is the reason my son is alive,\" he added. \"I will therefore act as her guardian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also feel a tremendous responsibility for Gillian,\" Ramsey said. \"Because of her, my brother will remain safe, and I now know I have an insurrection on my hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain stared at Brodick now and said, \"I won\u0027t have her reputation blackened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning?\" Brodick demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People are going to talk,\" Judith said. \"I don\u0027t want Gillian\u0027s feelings injured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what will they say?\" Gillian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith deliberately avoided giving a direct answer so that she wouldn\u0027t embarrass her new friend. \"Some will be cruel. Not the Maitlands, of course, but others will say terrible things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s trying to tell you that there will be speculation you\u0027re Brodick\u0027s mistress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Iain, must you be so blunt?\" Judith cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She needs to understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there talk now?\" Gillian asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIain shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That isn\u0027t a satisfactory answer,\" Brodick said. \"Is her reputation being blackened now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded outraged by the possibility. Gillian straightened her shoulders. \"I don\u0027t care what the talk is,\" she said. \"I will admit I hadn\u0027t thought about… that is to say, with everything else on my mind, I didn\u0027t stop to consider…\" She suddenly stopped trembling, and though she could feel her face burning with mortification, her voice was firm when she said, \"People who spend their time gossiping are petty and foolish. They may call me harlot for all I care. I know what\u0027s in my heart, and I only have to answer to God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I damn well do care,\" Brodick said angrily. \"And I\u0027m not going to let anyone slander you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you plan to stop them, Brodick?\" Ramsey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Iain said, \"tell us what you plan to do about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Brodick\u0027s mind there was really only one possible solution. With a long drawn out sigh he said, \"Marry her, I suppose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian\u0027s gasp nearly knocked her over. \"You suppose wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone, including Judith, ignored her protest. \"It makes sense to me,\" Iain said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it does,\" Ramsey agreed. \"Brodick\u0027s been acting very possessive of her. Last night he wouldn\u0027t let me near her except when he was by her side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s well aware of how women tend to forget themselves when they\u0027re around you,\" Iain remarked. \"And there was that unfortunate incident in England when you and Brodick went to find brides. He\u0027s probably still chafed about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not chafed,\" Brodick snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friends ignored his protest. Ramsey shrugged. \"It happened over eight years ago,\" he reminded Iain. \"Besides, Brodick wouldn\u0027t have been happy with a woman who could so easily turn her attentions to other men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is why neither one of you brought her home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither one of us wanted her. She lacked morals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an understatement,\" Iain said with a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick looked as if he wanted to kill Iain and Ramsey, but his friends remained unconcerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more to this story than you\u0027re telling, isn\u0027t there?\" Judith asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one answered the question. Iain winked at her, and she decided she would find a way to get the details later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was wearing your plaid last night, Brodick,\" Ramsey said then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He insisted she wear his colors,\" Iain said. \"It\u0027s little wonder people are speculating about her position.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard that during the celebration you kissed her in front of the entire Maitland clan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick shrugged. \"Not the entire clan, just some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted everyone to know—\" Iain began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick cut him off. \"Damned right I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted everyone to know what?\" Judith asked after giving Gillian a worried look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That Gillian belongs to him,\" Iain explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why he kissed her in front of witnesses all right,\" Ramsey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor Gillian looked as though she\u0027d just been struck hard on her head. Judith took mercy on her, for she knew she didn\u0027t understand the blunt ways of the Highlanders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it was just a friendly little kiss, the kind one cousin would give another in greeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian was frantically nodding when Brodick muttered, \"The hell it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a little sigh, Judith gave up. If she\u0027d learned anything in her years living with Iain, it was that none of the Highlanders knew how to be subtle. If they wanted something done, they did it themselves, and if one of them wanted a woman, he took her. It was that simple. The men respected women, of course, and for that reason they usually married them before they took them to their bed, but once they made the commitment, they kept it until the day they died. In this instance, Brodick obviously wanted Gillian, and no amount of arguing would change his determination. He would take her, and his two loyal friends with their outrageous banter were simply letting him know they approved the match and would do anything they could to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them, however, were considering Gillian\u0027s feelings in the matter. Judith patted her friend\u0027s hand to let her know she sympathized. Gillian looked positively dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brodick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Judith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love Gillian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead silence followed the question. If looks could kill, Iain would be without a wife by now, Judith thought. It was very apparent that Brodick didn\u0027t like being pinned down with such a personal question. Judith didn\u0027t back away, though; she had Gillian\u0027s best interests at heart after all. \"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart, that isn\u0027t a question you should be asking,\" Iain said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it is,\" she argued. \"Someone has to look out for Gillian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re looking out for her,\" Ramsey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Brodick obviously wants her,\" Iain interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanting isn\u0027t enough,\" Judith said. \"Have you all forgotten she\u0027s English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She used to be English,\" both Ramsey and Iain said at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudith let them see how exasperated she was. \"Didn\u0027t you and Brodick vow to marry Highlanders or not marry at all?\" she asked Ramsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they did,\" Iain answered. \"After that unfortunate incident in England—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you quit calling it an \u0027unfortunate incident?\u0027\" Brodick demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did make that promise,\" Ramsey admitted. \"But Brodick has obviously changed his mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking of her reputation,\" Brodick muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then simply stay away from her,\" Judith suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not an acceptable solution,\" Brodick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why isn\u0027t it?\" Judith prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he doesn\u0027t want to stay away from her,\" Ramsey said. \"That much should be obvious to you, Judith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to try another direction. \"Brodick, have you told her what her life will be like living with the Buchanans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I only just decided to marry her,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told me I\u0027d be miserable.\" Gillian\u0027s voice was but a hoarse whisper. She was still reeling from Brodick\u0027s outrageous impudence in dictating her future, but anger was quickly replacing disbelief, and within seconds she was trembling. She kept telling herself that any minute now they would have their laugh and tell her it was all just a game. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-29.html","bookId":1843,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM"}
