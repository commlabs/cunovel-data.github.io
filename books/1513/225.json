With his strength as a’ peak rank 1 Magus, he could increase the gravitational force up to 20 times the normal amount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long distance away from the battlefield, inside a secret cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spell formation emitting light constantly drew in and expelled air, as if trying to suck something in. On top of the spell formation, there was a constantly flashing reversed “L” shaped rune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside the spell formation, two knights in black heavy armour nervously stood guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Boom!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light from the suction spell formation suddenly became brighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, a black figure charged inside with a speed that one could not see with the naked eye, and smashed into the centre of the spell formation, producing a loud sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDust flew everywhere, and the spell formation was completely destroyed, leaving a large pit on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pu!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin mustered up strength and sat up, spitting out another mouthful of blood. At the same time, intense pain flared up from all parts of his body, as if he had been ripped apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strong suction power of this spell had allowed Leylin to escape, but it had also caused his injuries to worsen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s still not possible for me to battle with a peak rank 1 Magus. Everyone has their own trump cards…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin smiled wryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master!” Number 2 and 3 immediately knelt and greeted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hn! We need to leave here as soon as possible!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked left and right before commanding his subordinates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was currently seriously injured, and had no battle power to speak of whatsoever. No matter if he met enemies or people from his faction, it would still be very dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good thing was that in this period of time, he had already set up a few hideouts in the region that were only known to his two spirit bound slaves. They were the safest places that he could be in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin wasn’t planning on appearing in front of anyone before recovering from his injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the support of Number 2 and Number 3, Leylin quickly left the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Although I suffered massive injuries, I still garnered some profits! At the very least, Marb’s two trump cards, his metal body and gravitational spell, have been revealed to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis kind of knowledge regarding a peak rank 1 Magus was very difficult to obtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin had gathered some information through the Thousand Meddling Hands and the Four Seasons Garden, but things like trump cards were not mentioned in the reports from these two organisations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps, this might have been due to his status being too low and him lacking in power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A.I. Chip! Have you recorded all the previous data?” Leylin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Marb’s general data has been recorded. Beginning generation of stats!] The A.I. Chip’s robotic voice resounded in Leylin’s ear, and immediately after, a blue light flashed in front of him, producing a virtual screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Marb Lilytell. Peak Rank 1 Magus. Estimated Strength: 10.7. Agility: 9.5. Vitality: 23. Spiritual Force: 79. Magic Power: 79 (Magic Power is in synchronisation with Spiritual Force). Elemental essence conversion type: Metal. Progress: 78% - 85%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Special techniques: 1. Metallic Life: After fusing with a lifeform that is purely metallic, all fatal attacks are ineffective. Vitality increases, and damage increased when using metal magic. As a side effect, loss of sense of touch. 2. Gravitational Spell Formation: Discovered gravitational runes related to gravity spell formation. Estimated completion of spell: 56%. Information recorded! Able to achieve between 2 and 25 times normal gravity over an area of 100 metres when used as an attack. Estimated strongest might: 29 times normal gravity!]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter this battle, Marb’s basic stats had been calculated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis meant that the next time they fought, if Leylin took countermeasures towards his attacks, the chances of Marb dying by Leylin’s hand would be more than 50%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an advantage based on the information the data had given him. Leylin’s eyes flashed. “A.I. Chip! Construct human model and simulate the best ways to kill him. Factor in Number 2 and Number 3 as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, scenes of battles appeared in Leylin’s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout ten minutes later, the A.I. Chip’s reply sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Based on the newest data recorded, result: Death of target! Death of Number 2, massive injuries inflicted on Number 3, host body with light injuries.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing what the A.I. Chip had planned, a thin smile appeared on his face. “Marb! The next time we meet will be the day you die…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the Eternal River Plains’ secret plane, inside the inverted castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin a room that was as cold as an ice storehouse, with several large chunks of ice strewn about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyder was wearing a pair of thick, heavy spectacles as he stared fixedly at a beaker with liquid boiling inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hair of a female goblin, the toenail of a subterranean lizard, and also… the silk sac of a Dulok spider…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis incantation was unclear, yet both his hands were as precise as a machine as he continuously tossed the items into the beaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Woman of the Deep Red, grace us with your presence!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the ingredients had completely fused within the beaker, Hyder raised up and opened his hands towards the sky, and chanted in a very bizarre incantation as if conducting a sacrificial rite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Weng…*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground began to tremble, and the stench of blood began to permeate the tiny room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, Hyder seemed to have seen a deep, crimson sea surging towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, the blood coloured sea converged into the figure of a gorgeous woman that strangely had no face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer ethereal body floated ever so beautifully in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“....!” Hyder chanted the final stream of the incantation, which was extremely tongue twisting. The accent was extremely difficult to understand as well; it was filled with a primordial and barbaric aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chikchik…” After listening to Hyder, the woman finally spoke. Her voice sounded like the chirps of a little bird, yet, at the same time, it strangely sounded like the flapping of insect wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hurry! Bring it forward!” Hyder said to the old lady behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old lady clapped her hands, and two black robed servants entered with a dozen feeble, trembling humans who had their heads covered by a black sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chikchik!” The woman in midair chirped in excitement as she immediately began to stretch her body forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Pu!* *Pu!**Pu!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless large wounds split open on the bodies of these captives, from which blood gushed out like a fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if seeing the plague, the two servants quickly retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Gloook!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood formed a tiny tendril of steam as it floated through the air towards the woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, there were no longer any traces of blood on the ground. As for the woman, the colour red was even more vibrant on her body now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter accepting the sacrifices, the woman nodded her faceless head and transformed into the shape of a flask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Drip-Drop!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tiny droplet of crimson liquid dripped from the flask directly into the beaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Ka-Cha!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the liquid entered the beaker, a flame emerged from within the beaker and engulfed it. As the flames blazed, the sound of wailing spirits occasionally sounded from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the flames continued to burn, the woman disappeared without a trace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether it was Hyder or the old lady, no one knew how she had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is it?” The old lady’s gaze was fixed on the flame, which was spreading, and she put on an expression that could make one feel anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the gleam of the flames, which reflected off of the old lady’s face, there was an intimidating look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the most feasible method that I could come up with after many experiments. Moreover through a sacrificial rite, I borrowed the power of a trace of blood from an evil spirit… Towards this curse, it should be the best remedy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyder looked at the subsiding flames, and his expression was extremely calm, his eyes showing signs of wisdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope that is so! Jenna’s curse is nearing complete activation, so time is pressing…” The old lady muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing this, a peculiar expression could be seen in Hyder’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Jenna was the one who had inherited the innate talent of prophecy, Manla was also a relative of theirs. From the perspective of a light Magus, this was somewhat going overboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Hyder concealed his opinion well, not letting the old lady discover it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral minutes later, the red flames completely died out, revealing a strange, congealed item in the beaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an amorphous item, like a large lump of jelly, and was even squirming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a success!” A smile surfaced on Hyder’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing which, his expression turned solemn as he said the old lady, “Madame, although this method of removal has a very high success rate, the curse is an extremely troublesome thing. Some dark Magi also like to add various disgusting and poisonous elements inside, and if they are not treated properly, things could very well become disastrous. Hence, if… what I’m saying is that if there is a possibility, it would still be better to have a chat with the Magus who laid this curse…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No need for that! My family will never be threatened by someone else! Fate is watching over us!” The old lady vehemently rejected the notion, and Hyder could only smile wryly in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the possibility of a chain reaction from the activation of the curse, during treatment, Jenna and Manla were held very far apart in their locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyder wore white robes with many runes occasionally blinking on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, he held onto a container with one hand, which contained the soft body within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyder looked at Manla, who was lying unconscious on the experiment table,and finally gave one last glance at the old lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded expressionlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing this, Hyder sighed on the inside, and his face turned serious, “Then, I will begin…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-224\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-226\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-225","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
