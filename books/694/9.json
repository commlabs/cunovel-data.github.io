At breakfast that morning (a simple meal of marmalade spread lightly over a honeycomb or two) he had suddenly thought of a new song. It began like this:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sing Ho! For the life of a Bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had got as far as this, he scratched his head, and thought to himself \"That\u0027s a very good start for a song, but what about the second line?\" He tried singing \"Ho,\" two or three times, but it didn\u0027t seem to help. \"Perhaps it would be better,\" he thought, \"if I sang Hi for the life of a Bear.\" So he sang it . . . but it wasn\u0027t. \"Very well, then,\" he said, \"I shall sing that first line twice, and perhaps if I sing it very quickly, I shall find myself singing the third and fourth lines before I have time to think of them, and that will be a Good Song. Now then:\"\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThen they all went home again. And I think, but I am not quite sure, that Roo had a hot bath and went straight to bed. But Pooh went back to his own house, and feeling very proud of what he had done, had a little something to revive himself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/364/347.html","bookId":694,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:22:31 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:22:31 PM"}
