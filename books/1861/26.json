I signed up for some summer art classes and my internship at the museum is great, even though I spend most of my day cleaning up after people and running errands. I also started counseling. As much as I\u0027d like to believe I was getting better, when I\u0027m alone and lost in my own thoughts, the darkness sometimes gets to me. But my therapist is nice and the visits seem to be helping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila is letting me borrow her car for the weekend, so I can drive back home and meet up with Dean and my dad. I\u0027m glad to be making the drive alone, that way I\u0027ll have twelve hours to mentally prepare myself. Although, deep down, I wish Micha was going with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you don\u0027t want me to go with you,\" Lila asks as I snatch the handle of my suitcase and scan the room for forgotten items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"I\u0027ll be fine and you have classes and your math tutor thing.\" I stop at the doorway, needing to get something off my chest. \"Lila, thank you for letting me borrow your car and for just being there for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile is bright. \"Don\u0027t get all weepy on me. You\u0027re only going to be gone for a couple of days, silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe laugh, exiting the building and head down the stairs. Our apartment is right by the campus and we keep Lila\u0027s car in the parking lot most of the time. When we reach the grass that reaches across the campus, my phone starts to sing inside my pocket, a sad turned happy song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, again?\" Lila throws her head back dramatically. \"Can\u0027t you two go five minutes without talking to each other?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I smile and answer the phone as Lila scoots away, giving us some privacy. \"So how\u0027s the weather in Seattle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty sunny, actually,\" Micha says and I can hear the smile in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerk on my roll away bag as it gets caught in a hole in the lawn. \"That\u0027s funny, because I thought it was supposed to be rainy there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope, I got a blue sky and a hell of a lot of sunshine over my head,\" he says. \"And I\u0027m really enjoying the view.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, I\u0027m glad,\" I tell him, missing him like crazy. \"Are you still driving out here next weekend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually there\u0027s been a slight change of plans,\" he answers. \"And I can\u0027t come out next weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop in the middle of the grass, pouting. \"Oh. Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs softly into the phone. \"You know, you\u0027re beautiful when you pout like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know I\u0027m pouting?\" I wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same way that I know you have a sexy pair of shorts on and your hair is done up,\" he says and I start to glance around the campus at the people walking around in the quad and on the sidewalks. \"Your ass looks really good, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let my suitcase go and spin in a circle with the cell phone still to my ear. Then I spot him in the parking lot, standing next to a SUV in black jeans, a tight-fitted grey tee, and eyes as blue as the sky. I drop my phone and run to him, not caring that people are staring at me like I\u0027m insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t slow down when I reach him and he catches me as I run into his arms. He picks me up and I secure my legs around him, kissing him with so much passion his lip ring cuts into my lip. Finally we pull back, panting with raw wildness in our eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tucks a strand of my hair behind my ear. \"You didn\u0027t think I was going to let you go back home on your own, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said you had to play this weekend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can do one performance without me. This is more important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost start to cry and he begins to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ella May, what\u0027s wrong?\" he asks. \"This is a good thing, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is\" I say, staring into his eyes. \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles and whispers, \"I love you, too,\" before reconnecting his lips with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kiss each other deeply, not caring that people are watching and whispering about us. To them we\u0027re just two people making out in the parking lot, creating a scene. They\u0027ll never really know what it took to get here. How many years were invested, but that\u0027s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a secret between us. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1/page-26.html","bookId":1861,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:09 PM"}
