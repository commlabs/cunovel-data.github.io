And you\u0027ve been along with me,Kitty--all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (Alice had once made theremark) that, whatever you say to them, they ALWAYS purr. `If themwould only purr for \"yes\" and mew for \"no,\" or any rule of that sort,\u0027 shehad said, `so that one could keep up a conversation! But how CAN youtalk with a person if they always say the same thing?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　On this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible toguess whether it meant `yes\u0027 or `no.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　So Alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had foundthe Red Queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, andput the kitten and the Queen to look at each other. `Now, Kitty!\u0027 shecried, clapping her hands triumphantly. `Confess that was what you turnedinto!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　(`But it wouldn\u0027t look at it,\u0027 she said, when she was explaining thething afterwards to her sister: `it turned away its head, and pretended notto see it: but it looked a LITTLE ashamed of itself, so I think it MUSThave been the Red Queen.\u0027)`Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!\u0027 Alice cried with a merry laugh.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　`And curtsey while you\u0027re thinking what to--what to purr. It saves time,remember!\u0027 And she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, `just inhonour of having been a Red Queen.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　`Snowdrop, my pet!\u0027 she went on, looking over her shoulder at theWhite Kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, `when WILLDinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder? That must bethe reason you were so untidy in my dream-- Dinah! do you know thatyou\u0027re scrubbing a White Queen? Really, it\u0027s most disrespectful of you!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　`And what did DINAH turn to, I wonder?\u0027 she prattled on, as shesettled comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand, to watch the kittens. `Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to HumptyDumpty? I THINK you did--however, you\u0027d better not mention it to yourfriends just yet, for I\u0027m not sure.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　`By the way, Kitty, if only you\u0027d been really with me in my dream,there was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed--I had such a quantity ofpoetry said to me, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have areal treat. All the time you\u0027re eating your breakfast, I\u0027ll repeat \"TheWalrus and the Carpenter\" to you; and then you can make believe it\u0027soysters, dear!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　`Now, Kitty, let\u0027s consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is aserious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your pawlike that--as if Dinah hadn\u0027t washed you this morning! You see, Kitty, itMUST have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream,of course--but then I was part of his dream, too! WAS it the Red King,Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know--Oh, Kitty, DOhelp to settle it! I\u0027m sure your paw can wait!\u0027 But the provoking kittenonly began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn\u0027t heard the question.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Which do YOU think it was?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　A boat beneath a sunny sky,Lingering onward dreamilyIn an eveningof July-Children three that nestle near,Eager eye and willing ear,Pleased asimple tale to hear-Long has paled that sunny sky:Echoes fade and memories die.Autumnfrosts have slain July.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Still she haunts me, phantomwise,Alice moving under skiesNever seenby waking eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Children yet, the tale to hear,Eager eye and willing ear,Lovingly shallnestle near.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　In a Wonderland they lie,Dreaming as the days go by,Dreaming as thesummers die:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Ever drifting down the stream--Lingering in the golden gleam--Life,what is it but a dream?\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/272/316.html","bookId":695,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:51:08 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:51:08 AM"}
