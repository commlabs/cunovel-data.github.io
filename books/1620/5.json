My job was to get the box. Simon didn’t tell me what was inside. I asked. He said the client either didn’t know himself, or just wouldn’t tell him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So why didn’t you bring the box?” Phaelan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I dropped it, all right?” Quentin’s voice went up about two octaves. “Seeing goblins appear out of nowhere can make you drop things. I had the amulet in my hand, and I figured that’s what they wanted anyway. If I’m dead, the client doesn’t get his goods, and I don’t get the rest of my money, so I jumped out the window. Seeing goblins can make you do that, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t doubt that, but I did doubt the part about goblins appearing out of nowhere. They had to have come from somewhere, and since they were Khrynsani, they didn’t need a door to make an entrance. I knew that. Quentin didn’t need to. No use scaring him any more than he already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did the goblins see that you had the amulet?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” He looked a little embarrassed. “It got kind of chaotic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuentin screaming and running and jumping out of windows certainly qualified as chaotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, if neither Stocken nor the client is expecting an amulet,” I said, carefully assuming my best rational tone, “then they won’t be disappointed when they don’t get one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you saying?” Quentin knew very well, and from the way his eyes narrowed, he didn’t like it one bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nigel Nicabar had it,” I told him. “The Khrynsani want it. I don’t know what this amulet is or what it does, but if the Khrynsani want it, it would probably be bad if they got it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuentin started to speak, and I held up a hand. “Hear me out. Just tell Stocken about the goblins. Tell him you dropped the box, and you don’t know what happened to it after that. That’s not a lie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about my money?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuentin and Phaelan looked at me like I’d just uttered the most condemnable blasphemy imaginable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got twenty gold tenari,” Quentin informed me. “Up front.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhaelan whistled. “I’d stroll around Nigel’s house at night for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to get five more when I deliver the goods, and another five if I deliver it before dawn.” Quentin took two steps in the direction of Stocken’s warehouse. “So I’m in a bit of a hurry. If we can move along, I can get my money, and we can all go home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t move. “Don’t you mean when you deliver the box?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRealization began to dawn on Quentin, and the thought that he might not get paid for delivering an amulet rather than a box was the final blow to an already bad night. I felt equally bad about breaking the news to him, but I would have felt even worse if the amulet was sold out from underneath us before I knew what the Khrynsani wanted with it—or more to the point, what Sarad Nukpana wanted with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarad Nukpana was the Khrynsani grand shaman. He was also a sadistic psychopath. I’d done work for Duke Markus Sevelien long enough to have that confirmed on numerous occasions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkus was the head of elven intelligence in Mermeia. I’d like to think he’d retained me as a consultant because of my superior seeking skills, but I know differently. Markus thought my being related to criminals helped me know the criminal mind. This wasn’t always true, but I wasn’t one to turn down a regular, well-paying client just because he wounded my delicate sensibilities. Truth be told, if it can be picked up, pried off, or in any way pilfered, my family’s made off with it at one time or another. Unfortunately those pilfered goods have occasionally included people. It’s not something I’m proud of, but it’s not something I can deny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of my work for Markus involved finding pilfered elves—diplomats, intelligence agents, assorted nobles. The kind of people the less savory members of my family would love to get their ransom-grubbing hands on. Though most of the missing elves Markus wanted me to find had been taken by the kind of people who had no interest in ransom. I guess the more money you had, the cheaper life was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I had it on the best authority that no one held life in lower regard than Sarad Nukpana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d heard stories from some of Markus’s agents who had seen the rotten fruits of Nukpana’s labors up close and personal. A few of Markus’s agents were goblins. They knew the Khrynsani grand shaman as soft voiced, cultured and courteous with a formidable intellect. Elven agents told a different story. One of them had been held across from another cell where Nukpana was interrogating a human prisoner. Nukpana chatted as if hosting a cocktail party—while he did a little exploratory surgery. His prisoner/patient was awake. The elven agent said the screams went on longer than he thought possible. The pleasant conversation continued, even after the screams had stopped. That story alone kept me waking up in a cold sweat for weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it was the amulet they really wanted.” Quentin was looking in growing desperation from one of us to the other. “Right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably.” I answered. “But Stocken might take some convincing. Then he’d have to get back to the client for confirmation. All of which is going to delay your payment. In the meantime, you can’t turn over the amulet without proper payment. As a businessman, Stocken would understand that. It’s just not good business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Makes sense to me,” Phaelan added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuentin shot a betrayed look at my cousin. “You didn’t have to break into that crypt Nigel Nicabar calls home.” His fear from earlier in the evening had been soundly replaced by moral outrage and greed. “You didn’t have goblins jump on you out of thin air. You didn’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fight Khrynsani guards to keep you from being sliced apart one piece at a time?” Phaelan’s voice was soft and low. It was the voice his enemies never wanted to hear. He stepped toe to toe with Quentin. “Something I’m beginning to regret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuentin raised both hands and stepped back. “It’s not that I’m ungrateful, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It sounds that way.” Phaelan didn’t back down. Retreating isn’t a concept my family’s too familiar with. If we’ve gone to the trouble to stake out ground, or water, we’re keeping it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blew out an exasperated sigh and stepped in. “Just tell Stocken what happened. But don’t show him the amulet. Don’t tell him what was in the box at all at this point. On second thought, just so you won’t be tempted, why don’t you give me the amulet? I’ll keep it until you finish talking to Stocken.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure that’s a good idea?” Phaelan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what he was thinking, because I had already thought it. The last thing I wanted was a repeat performance of my reaction in the alley when Quentin had opened the box. But when he had dangled the amulet itself in front of my face, nothing had happened. Maybe it had been the box, or a spell guarding the box. Either way, I wanted to make sure Quentin didn’t give the amulet to Simon Stocken. If Stocken dangled a pouch of gold in front of Quentin’s face, the amulet was as good as gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuentin looked doubtful. “You’ll give it back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’ll give it back.” Eventually. Once I found out what it was. And if I found I needed to hold onto it to keep it out of Sarad Nukpana’s hands, I’d pay Quentin the rest of his fee. Or Markus Sevelien would. For the elven duke, thirty gold tenari was pocket change. I couldn’t say the same for myself. Information was a professional courtesy Markus and I had extended to each other over the years. If I happened across something that Markus might be interested in, I let him know, and the elven duke did the same for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew Markus would be interested in anything that interested Sarad Nukpana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuentin pulled the chain over his head and handed it and the amulet to me. I hesitated before actually touching it. Caution had never been a bad thing for me. I took it from Quentin by the chain, and the silver disk spun slowly at the end. There were carvings on the front and back, but I couldn’t make out any details. The amulet gleamed when I touched the chain. Just a reflection of the streetlamps—and the hum that I heard was just a figment of my imagination. Metal didn’t make noise unless you struck it. And even if it could hum, that hum wouldn’t sound smug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you hear anything?” I asked Phaelan, never taking my eyes off the amulet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me an odd look, then glanced behind us for signs of pursuit. There were none, but he knew that. “No, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind. Just my imagination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped the chain over my head, and when the amulet didn’t try to burn a hole through my jerkin, I slipped it and the chain inside my shirt. The metal was warm against my skin. I told myself the heat was left over from Quentin’s body. Perhaps if I kept telling myself that, I’d begin to believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front entrance to Simon Stocken’s warehouse was usually guarded by at least two men. Things usually went better if they knew you. I recognized the first guard, but not the other on duty with him. Both acknowledged Quentin, and the one I didn’t know opened the door for him. Stocken’s guards were reliable men as long as he kept their purses full; and with business as good as it was, there was ample coin to pay for good help. Quentin went inside. We stayed outside and out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute or so passed. Quentin must have been halfway through the warehouse by now. Simon Stocken’s office was in the far corner. I shifted my weight from one leg to the other, and adjusted my baldric on my shoulder. Then I shifted my weight back. I was suddenly uncomfortable in my own skin. I looked down at my hands. One of them actually twitched. I looked back to the warehouse. The guards were no longer by the door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/magic-lost-trouble-found-raine-benares-1/page-5.html","bookId":1620,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:17 PM"}
