He knew Hali had been hurt by his rejection and he wondered why he did not feel guilty. He sighed. There was no sense in running away; this was the way he had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHali spoke first, her voice low, tentative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing\u0027s changed, is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talking about it doesn\u0027t change it,\" he said. \"Why did you ask me out here - to revive our sexual debate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t I just want to be with you for a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was close to tears. He spoke softly to avoid hurting her even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m always with you, Hali.\" With his left hand he lifted her right hand, pressed the tips of his fingers against the tips of her fingers. \"Here. We touch, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded like a child being coaxed from a tantrum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is we and which the material of our flesh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held their fingertips a few centimeters apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the atoms between us oscillate at incredible speeds. They bump into each other and shove each other around.\" He tapped the air with a fingertip, careful to keep from touching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I touch an atom; it bumps into the next one; that one nudges another, and so on unti....\" He closed the gap and brushed her fingertips. \"...we touch and we were never separate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are just words!\" She pulled her hand away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much more than words, you know it, Med-tech Hali Ekel. We constantly exchange atoms with the universe, with the atmosphere, with food, with each other. There\u0027s no way we can be separated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t want just any atoms!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have more choice than you think, lovely Hali.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied him out of the corners of her eyes. \"Are you just making these things up to entertain me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious. Don\u0027t I always tell you when I make up something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always, Hali. I will make up a poem to prove it.\" He tapped her wire ring lightly. \"A poem about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027re you telling me your poems? You usually just lock them up on tapes or store them away in those old-fashioned glyph books of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to please you in the only way I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then tell me your poem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed her cheek beside the ring, then:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With delicate rings of the gods\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein our noses\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewe do not root in their garden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him, puzzled. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An ancient Earthside practice. Farmers put rings in the noses of their pigs to keep the pigs from digging out of their pens. Pigs dig with their noses as well as their feet. People called that kind of digging \u0027rooting.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re comparing me to a pig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all you see in my poem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, then smiled as much at herself as at Kerro. \"We\u0027re a fine pair to be selected for breeding - the poet and the pig!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, met her gaze and, without knowing why, they were suddenly giggling, then laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, he lay back on the duff. \"Ahhh, Hali, you are good for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you might need some distraction. What\u0027ve you been studying that keeps you so shut away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scratched his head, recovered a brown twig of dead cedar. \"I\u0027ve been rooting into the \u0027lectrokelp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That seaweed the Colony\u0027s been having all the trouble with? Why would that interest you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m always amazed at what interests me, but this may be right down my hatchway. The kelp, or some phase of it, appears to be sentient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean it thinks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than tha.... probably much more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why hasn\u0027t this been announced?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know for sure. I came across part of the information by accident and pieced together the rest. There\u0027s a record of other teams sent out to study the kelp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find this report?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wel.... I think it may be restricted for most people, but Ship seldom holds anything back from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Ship!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hal....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, all right. What\u0027s in this report?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The kelp appears to have a language transmitted by light but we can\u0027t understand it yet. And there\u0027s something even more interesting. I can\u0027t find out if there\u0027s a current project to contact and study this kelp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t Shi....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ship refers me to Colony HQ or to the Ceepee, but they don\u0027t acknowledge my inquiries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nothing new. They don\u0027t acknowledge most inquiries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You been having trouble with them, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just that Medical can\u0027t get an explanation for all the gene sampling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gene sampling? How very curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oakes is a very curious and very private person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about someone on the staff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lewis?\" Her tone was derisive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKerro scratched his cheek reflectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The \u0027lectrokelp and gene sampling. Hali, I don\u0027t know about the gene samplin.... that has a peculiar stink to it. But the kel....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe interrupted, excited: \"This creature could have a sou.... and it could WorShip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A soul? Perhaps. But I thought when I saw that record: \u0027Yes! This is why Ship brought us to Pandora.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if Oakes knows that the \u0027lectrokelp is the reason we\u0027re here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gripped his arm. \"Think of all the times Oakes has called us prisoners of Ship. He tells us often enough that Ship won\u0027t let us leave. Why won\u0027t he tell us why Ship brought us here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he doesn\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ohhh, he knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what can we do about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke without thinking: \"We can\u0027t do anything without going groundside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled his arm away from her and dug his fingers into the humus. \"What do we know about living groundside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we know about living here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you go down to the Colony with me, Hali?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I would bu....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s apply fo....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t let me go. The groundside food shortage is critical; there are health problems.

She pressed the response key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hal....\" There was a clatter, a buzz. Presently, the voice returned. \"Sorry I dropped you. This is Winslow Ferry. Is that Kerro Panille with you, Hali?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHali stifled a laugh. The bumbling old fool could not even put in a call without stumbling over something. Kerro was caught by the direct reference to someone being with Hali. Had Ferry been listening? Many shipside suspected that sensors and portable communications equipment had been adapted for eavesdropping but this was his first direct clue. He took the pribox from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Kerro Panille.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhh, Kerro. Please report to my office within the hour. We have an assignment for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An assignment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no response. The connection had been broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you suppose that\u0027s all about?\" Hali asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor answer, Kerro drew a blank page from his notebook, scribbled on it with a fade-stylus, then pointed to the pribox. \"He was listening to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at the note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKerro said: \"Isn\u0027t that strange? I\u0027ve never had an assignment befor.... except study assignments from Ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHali took the stylus from him, wrote: \"Look out. If they do not want it known that the kelp thinks, you could be in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKerro stood, blanked the page and restored it to his case. \"Guess I\u0027d better wander down to Ferry\u0027s office and find out what\u0027s happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked most of the way back in silence, intensely aware of every sensor they passed, of the pribox at Hali\u0027s hip. As they approached Medical, she stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kerro, teach me how to speak to Ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bu....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like your genotype or your color.

Do you respond to everyone who wants to talk to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I know Ship must be very busy wit....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that has anything to do with it. Ship either speaks to you or doesn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe digested this for a moment, nodded, then: \"Kerro, do you really talk to Ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no mistaking the resentment in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I wouldn\u0027t lie to you, Hali. Why\u0027re you so interested in talking to Ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the idea of Ship answering you.
