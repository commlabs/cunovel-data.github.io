Cloth rustled. I blinked the blood out of my eyes and squinted up at him. He stood over me, whole and unhurt. “I wanted to see what you’re made of,” he said, “and I must say your performance was disappointing. It worries me. Prophecies, after all, are tricky things. So I’m glad for the tests.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTests. The word drifted on a dark sea of pain. I couldn’t grab hold of it. What was he talking about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice changed, becoming loud and echo-y, like he was shouting across a canyon. “There will be three tests. If you survive them, I’ll know you are fated to bear my sons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight flashed; tremors shook the earth. When the quaking stopped, I was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEVERYTHING HURT. I TRIED TO TAKE AN INVENTORY OF MY injuries, but the individual pains blended into one big ball of agony. I knew several ribs had cracked, my nose was broken, and probably my right arm, too. My liver and kidneys throbbed with pain. One eye swelled shut; the other was a mere slit. I coughed, and pain wracked my chest. Bloody mucus spewed onto the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I tried to sit up, pain stabbed me in so many places I gave up and fell back to the ground. I had two choices. I coughed up more blood, then groaned. Make that three choices: I could just die right now. But I wouldn’t let Pryce win so easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, two choices: I could lie here and wait for Mab to send a search party. But that would take hours, especially because she didn’t know which way I’d set out walking. Cold seeped from the ground into my fractured bones. I didn’t know if I’d make it that long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr I could shift. Shifting would fix my broken bones. Soft tissue was trickier. My internal injuries might heal imperfectly, or not at all. And the effort of making the shift might require more energy than I could summon. If I tried to shift and failed, I’d be left in this battered form, too weak to heal. I’d die before Mab could find me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA freezing raindrop hit my face. More followed, a few random splatters that soon became a steady downpour. Each drop felt like a needle of ice piercing my flesh. I couldn’t lie here helpless until someone happened to find me, wounded and half-frozen. What if no one did? And what if Pryce came back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was really only one choice. I’d have to try shifting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gentle bleat wafted across the field, and I remembered the flock of sheep we’d seen. Pryce had nothing but contempt for the creatures, but right now they sounded like safety to me. I could hide among them. If Pryce returned, he’d never know I was here. He’d find nothing but bloodstains on the ground and a flock of stupid sheep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed the eye that still worked—even that small movement hurt—and concentrated. I pulled the sheep’s bleating into me, filling my mind with it. I thought of fleece, thick and soft and warm, protecting me from the rain. I sniffed the air, searching for a hint of grass. I focused on these sensations, letting them fill me, folding them into the core of my being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I began to change. An energy field glowed around me as my arms and legs thinned, as my nails hardened and thickened into hooves. Woolly fleece sprouted, diminishing the cold as it grew along my belly and back, my neck and head. My nose lengthened and broadened. Sounds sharpened as my ears grew. The shift hurt—God, it hurt—as my body reshaped itself. But the pain was different. This was the pain of creation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy field flared … then flickered. Panic sped my heartbeats. It wasn’t working. I’d fall back to my usual form or, worse, end up half-shifted and dead from the effort. I couldn’t let that happen. Pushing aside the fear, I poured every ounce of concentration into changing. The energy glowed brighter, then a little brighter. With a flash, it exploded outward in sparks and stars and fiery spirals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I lie here alone? Bleating over there. My kind, calling me. Flock meant safe. I bleated back. Other voices answered. I stood up, trotted to the flock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto the midst of them I went. Smell of sheep all around me, warm and safe. I bleated, happy. Grass smell. Old grass, winter grass, not new. Hungry. I lowered my head to graze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ate and ate. Warm, fleecy bodies on all sides. Safe. Ate more. Light dimmed. Then sudden movement on this side and that, all around. The flock bleated a warning. I ran, bleating too, keeping with the flock. Must stay together. Others slowed. I slowed with them, stopped. Looked back. What made us run? A two-legs walked through our field. Just walked. No danger. I bent to graze. The two-legs bleated in a high, strong voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vicky!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp jerked my head. I looked at the two-legs. Why did her bleat call to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vicky!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething good about this one. Carrots? Apple? I stepped toward her. She kept walking, toward the stone barrier. I bleated, went faster. Had to catch up. Something good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two-legs stopped. Looked at me. I trotted to her. Nudged at pockets. No apple smell. No carrot smell. But the two-legs’ smell was good. Safe. Like home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Vicky.” She scratched behind my ears. It felt good. I leaned into her. Warm. Happy. She stepped away. I stepped with her. She walked on the path, away from the trees. A bleat behind. I stopped, turned. There was the flock. But here was the two-legs who felt like home. I stood, not sure where to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vicky, come.” Two-legs clicked her tongue and patted her pocket. Apples, maybe. Or carrots. I followed her across the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN I OPENED MY EYES, I KNEW EXACTLY WHERE I WAS—home at Maenllyd, in the shift room. What I didn’t know was how I’d arrived here. I had only dim, fuzzy memories of following Mab away from the flock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shift room is a special room in Maenllyd’s cellar. Ten by twelve, its cement floor has a drain in the center. Small, barred, horizontal windows near the ceiling let in light. A cot is pushed against one wall. There’s only one door, with an automatic lock. Beside the door is a numbered keypad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it sounds like a prison cell, the shift room is really a recovery room. It’s a place where Mab or a visiting relative or I can go in animal form, a place where we’ll be safe until we shift back to our human forms. The locked door keeps any animal contained, but once someone shifts back to human form, they just tap a four-digit code, written on the wall, into the keypad to open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay under a blanket on the cot, feeling like an elephant had been flamenco dancing on my skull. Experimentally, I stretched to see what else hurt. Pretty much everything. But it was an achy soreness, not the battered agony that made me believe I was dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was in my mouth. I spit it into my hand: a disgusting mess of semi-digested grass and bits of other stuff. Gross. Brilliant idea, shifting into a cud-chewing animal. At least there was no blood in it. I sat up and threw the mess on the floor. I’d come back and clean it up later. The room needed to be hosed down, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here, child, use this handkerchief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bunched up the blanket in front of me. Mab sat in a wooden chair a few feet from the cot’s head. Her face looked grim, even fierce. To me, that look was beautiful. My aunt—strong, formidable, watching over me, never letting the bad guys win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the handkerchief and wiped my mouth and hands. “What time is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just past seven in the morning. You shifted back eight hours after I found you.” The corners of her mouth quirked. “We must have made quite a sight, me lifting you over the stile. I was quite terrified Farmer Davies would shoot me for stealing one of his sheep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my temples and tried to remember. In human form, it’s hard to make sense of animal memories, all flashes and sensations and nudges of instinct. I remembered following Mab across the field, squirming and kicking as she lifted me in her preternaturally strong arms. Being on the other side of the stone wall. Trotting behind her. Balking at the kitchen door, then tempted inside as someone—Rose?—gave me a whiff of chopped-up apples in a bowl. My hooves clicking strangely on the flagstone floor. Eating. Feeling sleepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You put sleeping herbs into the apples?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “And the herbs to prevent dreams. Also some for healing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat explained my headache. I’d probably ingested enough magical herbs to knock a human into next month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were weak,” Mab went on. “It was clear you needed rest. When you shifted back to human form, you had bruises all over. You must have been very badly hurt, especially considering the moon phase.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShifts are strongest around the time of a full moon. The animal brain takes over more strongly—and healing happens faster. Tonight would be the first night of the full moon. Mab was telling me that, without shifting, I would have died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set her mouth in a grim line. “What happened, child?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood and wrapped the blanket around me, then sat on the cot. Every muscle screamed; I felt like I’d sprinted a marathon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it bad now?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab reached into her pocket and produced a hand mirror. “I thought you’d ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied my reflection. Two black eyes, faded so that they looked like they’d happened a week ago. My nose was straight and unbroken. No cuts, although a new scar, thin and white, marked a corner of my mouth. I peeked under the blanket. Faint, yellow-green bruises mottled my torso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI returned the mirror. “You were right about Pryce. He definitely means harm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMab drew in a sharp breath. “He attacked you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right after he shared his evil plan for world domination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows slanted downward, like she thought I was making an unfunny joke. I sat on the cot and told her about my conversation with Pryce, how he was using the Morfran to strengthen Uffern’s demons and expand the demon plane into the human world. I left out one thing: Pryce’s desire to make little demon babies with me. I knew I should tell Mab, but I decided not to. Yet. From a goddess two lines diverged, but they shall be reunited in Victory. It was too crazy. I needed time to think about it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hellforged-deadtown-2/page-30.html","bookId":2610,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:26 PM"}
