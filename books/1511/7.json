He had accepted that he was an undead now, but he needed more time before he accepted his impotence!\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even so, the woman, the storekeeper, giggled.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah yes, you\u0027re right.

Her red, bobbed hair trailed down to bottom of her neck, and slowly shimmered and swayed as if it were actually fire.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yes, Lee Shin Woo had seen that almost living red hair before; he had seen it just recently.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you God?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There\u0027s no way God would be that free.

By Earth standards, God looked both eastern and western, had truly strange physical features (ears, eyes, mouth, and nose), and looked like a 10 year old girl, and a 60 year old lady at the same time, such that it was difficult to tell.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the other hand, the woman in front of him was different. She looked energetic and in her early 20s, and had western physical features as well.

Levels were a number that represented one\u0027s league and was also this world\u0027s standard of absolute strength. Lee Shin Woo mentioned it so casually, so she pitied him.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know what levels you\u0027re talking about, but levels in this world aren\u0027t something that can be raised that easily.

You see, what you did to get to that level is just as important as the level up itself. Whether it\u0027s by a special feat or a skill, other types of karma are important as well. Well, you\u0027ll see once you\u0027ve experienced it yourself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It seems like level ups aren\u0027t simply a change in number in this world.

In any case, it would happen soon, so just like the merchant said, he\u0027d find out for sure once he experienced it himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was briefly lost in thought, and the merchant tapped the counter to snap him out of it.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think I\u0027ve explained enough, back to the point that I should receive karma in exchange for goods.

They sold bones? What if he was right, and they were the bones he was thinking about? He wondered why they sold such a thing and he tilted his head, while the merchant\u0027s expression remained calm.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There are bones scattered around the Empire, so there\u0027s no way our shop wouldn\u0027t sell them.

The reason he, who hadn\u0027t learnt any martial arts on Earth, could get this far and put up a decent fight against the Treasure Eater, was because he had indirectly gained the combat experience from absorbing the Skeleton Soldiers\u0027 bones.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The true ability of Bone Reinforcement wasn\u0027t just the increase in stats or the acquisition of skills.
