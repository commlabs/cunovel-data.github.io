Nothing could ever be the way it had been before Elena died. Nothing. And Bonnie had serious misgivings about this party Caroline was trying to set up. A vague nagging in the pit of her stomach told her that for some reason it was a very, very bad idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meredith\u0027s birthday is already over,\" she pointed out. \"It was last Saturday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she didn\u0027t have a party, not a real party like this one. We\u0027ve got all night; my parents won\u0027t be back until Sunday morning. Come on, Bonnie-just think how surprised she\u0027ll be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, she\u0027ll be surprised, all right, thought Bonnie. So surprised she just might kill me afterward. \"Look, Caroline, the reason Meredith didn\u0027t have a big party is that she still doesn\u0027t feel much like celebrating. It seems-disrespectful, somehow-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s wrong. Elena would want us to have a good time, you know she would. She loved parties. And she\u0027d hate to see us sitting around and crying over her six months after she\u0027s gone.\" Caroline leaned forward, her normally feline green eyes earnest and compelling. There was no artifice in them now, none of Caroline\u0027s usual nasty manipulation. Bonnie could tell she really meant it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want us to be friends again the way we used to be,\" Caroline said. \"We always used to celebrate our birthdays together, just the four of us, remember? And remember how the guys would always try to crash our parties? I wonder if they\u0027ll try this year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie felt control of the situation slipping away from her. This is a bad idea, this is a very bad idea, she thought. But Caroline was going on, looking dreamy and almost romantic as she talked about the good old days. Bonnie didn\u0027t have the heart to tell her that the good old days were as dead as disco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there aren\u0027t even four of us anymore. Three doesn\u0027t make much of a party,\" she protested feebly when she could get a word in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to invite Sue Carson, too. Meredith gets along with her, doesn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie had to admit Meredith did; everyone got along with Sue. But even so, Caroline had to understand that things couldn\u0027t be the way they had been before. You couldn\u0027t just substitute Sue Carson for Elena and say, There, everything is fixed now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how do I explain that to Caroline? Bonnie thought. Suddenly she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s invite Vickie Bennett,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline stared. \"Vickie Bennett? You must be joking. Invite that bizarre little drip who undressed in front of half the school? After everything that happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaroline stared. \"Vickie Bennett? You must be joking. Invite that bizarre little drip who undressed in front of half the school? After everything that happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment Caroline looked helplessly frustrated. Bonnie thrust her chin out, put her hands on her hips, and waited. Finally Caroline sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right; you win. I\u0027ll invite her. But you have to take care of getting Meredith to my house Saturday night. And Bonnie-make sure she doesn\u0027t have any idea what\u0027s going on. I really want this to be a surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it will be,\" Bonnie said grimly. She was unprepared for the sudden light in Caroline\u0027s face or the impulsive warmth of Caroline\u0027s hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re seeing things my way,\" Caroline said. \"And it\u0027ll be so good for us all to be together again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t understand a thing, Bonnie realized, dazed, as Caroline walked off. What do I have to do to explain to her? Sock her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then: Oh, God, now I have to tell Meredith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut by the end of the day she decided that maybe Meredith didn\u0027t need to be told. Caroline wanted Meredith surprised; well, maybe Bonnie should deliver Meredith surprised. That way at least Meredith wouldn\u0027t have to worry about it beforehand. Yes, Bonnie concluded, it was probably kindest to not tell Meredith anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd who knows, she wrote in her journal Friday night. Maybe I\u0027m being too hard on Caroline. Maybe she\u0027s really sorry about all the things she did to us, like trying to humiliate Elena in front of the whole town and trying to get Stefan put away for murder. Maybe Caroline\u0027s matured since then and learned to think about somebody besides herself. Maybe we\u0027ll actually have a good time at her party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe aliens will kidnap me before tomorrow afternoon, she thought as she closed the diary. She could only hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe diary was an inexpensive drugstore blank book, with a pattern of tiny flowers on the cover. She\u0027d only started keeping it since Elena had died, but she\u0027d already become slightly addicted to it. It was the one place she could say anything she wanted without people looking shocked and saying, \"Bonnie McCullough!\" or \"Oh, Bonnie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still thinking about Elena as she turned off the light and crawled under the covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sitting on lush, manicured grass that spread as far as she could see in all directions. The sky was a flawless blue, the air was warm and scented. Birds were singing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad you could come,\" Elena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-yes,\" said Bonnie. \"Well, naturally, so am I. Of course.\" She looked around again, then hastily back at Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a teacup in Bonnie\u0027s hand, thin and fragile as eggshell. \"Oh-sure. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena was wearing an eighteenth-century dress of gauzy white muslin, which clung to her, showing how slender she was. She poured the tea precisely, without spilling a drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like a mouse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said, would you like a sandwich with your tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. A sandwich. Yeah. Great.\" It was thinly sliced cucumber with mayonnaise on a dainty square of white bread. Without the crust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole scene was as sparkly and beautiful as a picture by Seurat. Warm Springs, that\u0027s where we are. The old picnic place, Bonnie thought. But surely we\u0027ve got more important things to discuss than tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who does your hair these days?\" she asked. Elena never had been able to do it herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like it?\" Elena put a hand up to the silky, pale gold mass piled at the back of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s perfect,\" said Bonnie, sounding for all the world like her mother at a Daughters of the American Revolution dinner party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hair is important, you know,\" Elena said. Her eyes glowed a deeper blue than the sky, lapis lazuli blue. Bonnie touched her own springy red curls self-consciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, blood is important too,\" Elena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood? Oh-yes, of course,\" said Bonnie, flustered. She had no idea what Elena was talking about, and she felt as if she were walking on a tightrope over alligators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, blood\u0027s important, all right,\" she agreed weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another sandwich?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" It was cheese and tomato. Elena selected one for herself and bit into it delicately. Bonnie watched her, feeling uneasiness grow by the minute inside her, and then- And then she saw the mud oozing out of the edges of the sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What-what\u0027s that?\" Terror made her voice shrill. For the first time, the dream seemed like a dream, and she found that she couldn\u0027t move, could only gasp and stare. A thick glob of the brown stuff fell off Elena\u0027s sandwich onto the checkered tablecloth. It was mud, all right. \"Elena... Elena, what-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was no longer warm and scented; it was hot and sickly sweet with the odor of rotting garbage. There were black pits in the green grass, which wasn\u0027t manicured after all but wild and overgrown. This wasn\u0027t Warm Springs. She was in the old graveyard; how could she not have realized that? Only these graves were fresh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another mouse?\" Elena said, and giggled obscenely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie looked down at the half-eaten sandwich she was holding and screamed. Dangling from one end was a ropy brown tail. She threw it as hard as she could against a headstone, where it hit with a wet slap. Then she stood, stomach heaving, scrubbing her fingers frantically against her jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t leave yet. The company is just arriving.\" Elena\u0027s face was changing; she had already lost her hair, and her skin was turning gray and leathery. Things were moving in the plate of sandwiches and the freshly dug pits. Bonnie didn\u0027t want to see any of them; she thought she would go mad if she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not Elena!\" she screamed, and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind blew her hair into her eyes and she couldn\u0027t see. Her pursuer was behind her; she could feel it right behind her. Get to the bridge, she thought, and then she ran into something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been waiting for you,\" said the thing in Elena\u0027s dress, the gray skeletal thing with long, twisted teeth. \"Listen to me, Bonnie.\" It held her with terrible strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not Elena! You\u0027re not Elena!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me, Bonnie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Elena\u0027s voice, Elena\u0027s real voice, not obscenely amused nor thick and ugly, but urgent. It came from somewhere behind Bonnie and it swept through the dream like a fresh, cold wind. \"Bonnie, listen quickly-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were melting. The bony hands on Bonnie\u0027s arms, the crawling graveyard, the rancid hot air. For a moment Elena\u0027s voice was clear, but it was broken up like a bad long-dis-tance connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... He\u0027s twisting things, changing them. I\u0027m not as strong as he is...\" Bonnie missed some words. \"... but this is important. You have to find... right now.\" Her voice was fading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena, I can\u0027t hear you! Elena!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... an easy spell, only two ingredients, the ones I told you already...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie was still shouting as she sat bolt upright in bed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-dark-reunion-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-1.html","bookId":2034,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:26:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:26:20 PM"}
