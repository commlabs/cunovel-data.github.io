Aviation fuel starts burning the trees in the forest, the word CANCELED appears on a big black arrival board at JFK airport in New York, and the next morning, as the sun rises gently over cleanup crews, church bells start ringing and psychics start calling in with tips and then the gossip begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m walking through Washington Square Park, carrying a Kenneth Cole leather portfolio that holds my lawbooks and a bottle of Evian water. I\u0027m dressed casually, in Tommy Hilfiger jeans, a camel-hair sweater, a wool overcoat from Burberrys. I\u0027m stepping out of the way of Rollerbladers and avoiding clusters of Japanese NYU film students shooting movies. From a nearby boom box Jamaican trip-hop plays, from another boom box the Eagles\u0027 \"New Kid in Town,\" and I\u0027m smiling to myself. My beeper keeps going off. Chris Cuomo keeps calling, as does Alison Poole, whom I rather like and plan to see later this evening. On University, I run into my newly appointed guru and spiritual adviser, Deepak. Deepak is wearing a Donna Karan suit and Diesel sunglasses, smoking a cigar. \"Partagas Perfecto,\" he purrs in a distinct Indian accent. I purr back \"Hoo-ha\" admiringly. We exchange opinions about a trendy new restaurant (oh, there are so many) and the upcoming photo shoot I\u0027m doing for George magazine, how someone\u0027s AIDS has gone into remission, how someone\u0027s liver disease has been cured, the exorcism of a haunted town house in Gramercy Park, the evil spirits that were flushed out by the goodwill of angels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s so brill, man,\" I\u0027m saying. \"That\u0027s so genius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see that bench?\" Deepak says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it\u0027s a bench,\" Deepak says. \"But it isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s also you,\" Deepak says. \"You, Victor, are also that bench.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeepak bows slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I\u0027ve changed,\" I tell Deepak. \"I\u0027m a different person now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeepak bows slightly again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am that bench,\" I hear myself say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see that pigeon?\" Deepak asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I\u0027ve gotta run,\" I interrupt. \"I\u0027ll catch you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t fear the reaper, Victor,\" Deepak says, walking away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m nodding mindlessly, a vacant grin pasted on my face, until I turn around and mutter to myself, \"I am the f**king reaper, Deepak,\" and a pretty girl smiles at me from underneath an awning and it\u0027s Wednesday and late afternoon and getting dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a private workout with Reed, my personal trainer, I take a shower in the Philippe Starck locker room and as I\u0027m standing in front of a mirror, a white Ralph Lauren towel wrapped around my waist, I notice Reed standing behind me, wearing a black Helmut Lang leather jacket. I\u0027m swigging from an Evian bottle. I\u0027m rubbing Clinique turnaround lotion into my face. I just brushed past a model named Mark Vanderloo, who recited a mininarrative about his life that was of no interest to me. A lounge version of \"Wichita Lineman\" is piped through the gym\u0027s sound system and I\u0027m grooving out on it in my own way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up?\" I ask Reed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buddy?\" Reed says, his voice thick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" I turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give Reed a hug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause in which to consider things.
