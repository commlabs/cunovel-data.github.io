There were miles of downhill ski runs, hiking trails, bobsled and sleigh rides, polo tournaments, and a dozen other activities. Curled around a sparkling lake in the Engadine Valley six thousand feet high on the southern slope of the Alps, between Celerina and Piz Nair, the little village made Catherine gasp with delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine and Kirk Reynolds checked into the fabled Palace Hotel. The lobby was filled with tourists from a dozen countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk Reynolds said to the reception clerk, \"A reservation for Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds,\" and Catherine looked away. I should have put on a wedding ring. She was sure everyone in the lobby was staring at her, knowing what she was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mr. Reynolds. Suite two-fifteen.\" The clerk handed a bellboy the key, and the bellboy said, \"Right this way, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were escorted to a lovely suite, simply furnished, with a spectacular view of the mountains from each window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the bellboy left, Kirk Reynolds took Catherine in his arms. \"I can\u0027t tell you how happy you\u0027ve made me, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I will,\" Catherine replied. \"I...It\u0027s been a long time, Kirk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry. I won\u0027t rush you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s so dear, Catherine thought, but how would he feel about me if I told him about my past? She had never mentioned Larry to him, or the murder trial, or any of the terrible things that had happened to her. She wanted to feel close to him, to confide in him, but something held her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better unpack,\" Catherine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe unpacked slowly - too slowly - and suddenly realized that she was stalling, afraid to finish what she was doing because she was afraid of what was going to happen next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the other room she heard Kirk calling, \"Catherine...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my God, he\u0027s going to say let\u0027s get undressed and go to bed. Catherine swallowed and said in a small voice, \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we go outside and look around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine went limp with relief. \"That\u0027s a wonderful idea,\" she said enthusiastically. What\u0027s the matter with me? I\u0027m in one of the most romantic places on earth, with an attractive man who loves me, and I\u0027m panicky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReynolds was looking at her strangely. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Catherine said brightly. \"Just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I...I was thinking about - about skiing. It\u0027s supposed to be dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReynolds smiled. \"Don\u0027t worry. We\u0027ll start you on a gentle slope, tomorrow. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey put on sweaters and lined jackets and walked outside into the crisp, clear air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine breathed deeply. \"Oh, it\u0027s wonderful, Kirk. I love it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ain\u0027t seen nothin\u0027 yet,\" he grinned. \"It\u0027s twice as beautiful in the summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill he still want to see me in the summer? Catherine wondered. Or am I going to be a big disappointment to him? Why don\u0027t I stop worrying so much?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe village of St. Moritz was charming, a medieval marvel, filled with quaint shops and restaurants and chalets set among the majestic Alps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wandered around the shops, and Catherine bought presents for Evelyn and Wim. They stopped at a little cafe and had a fondue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the afternoon, Kirk Reynolds hired a sleigh driven by a bay, and they rode along the snow-covered path up into the hills, the snow crunching beneath the metal runners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enjoying?\" Reynolds asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes.\" Catherine looked at him and thought, I\u0027m going to make you so happy. Tonight. Yes, tonight. I\u0027m going to make you happy tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat evening, they dined in the hotel at the Stubli, a restaurant with the atmosphere of an old country inn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This room dates back to 1480,\" Kirk said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027d better not order the bread.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Small joke. Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarry used to understand my jokes; why am I thinking about him? Because I don\u0027t want to think about tonight. I feel like Marie Antoinette going to her execution. I won\u0027t have cake for dessert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meal was superb, but Catherine was too nervous to enjoy it. When they had finished, Reynolds said, \"Shall we go upstairs? I\u0027ve arranged an early ski lesson for you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Fine. Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey started upstairs, and Catherine found that her heart was pounding. He\u0027s going to say, \"Let\u0027s go right to bed.\" And why shouldn\u0027t he? That\u0027s what I came here for, isn\u0027t it? I can\u0027t pretend I came for the skiing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached their suite, and Reynolds opened the door and turned on the lights. They walked into the bedroom and Catherine stared at the large bed. It seemed to take up the whole room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk was watching her. \"Catherine...are you worried about anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" A hollow little laugh. \"Of course not. I...I just...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a bright smile. \"Nothing. I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Let\u0027s get undressed and go to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExactly what I knew he was going to say. But did he have to say it? We could have just gone ahead and done it. Putting it in words is so...so...crass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine had not realized that she had spoken aloud. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine had reached the bed. It was the largest she had ever seen. It was a bed that had been built for lovers, and lovers only. It was not a bed to sleep in. It was a bed to...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to get undressed, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I? How long has it been since I slept with a man? More than a year. And he was my husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cathy...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I\u0027m going to get undressed, and I\u0027m going to get into bed, and I\u0027m going to disappoint you. I\u0027m not in love with you, Kirk. I can\u0027t sleep with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kirk...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to her, half undressed. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kirk, I...Forgive me. You\u0027re going to hate me, but I...I can\u0027t. I\u0027m terribly sorry. You must think I\u0027m...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the look of disappointment on his face. He forced a smile. \"Cathy, I told you I\u0027d be patient. If you\u0027re not ready yet, I...I understand. We can still have a wonderful time here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed his cheek gratefully. \"Oh, Kirk. Thank you. I feel so ridiculous. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the matter with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing the matter with you,\" he assured her. \"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hugged him. \"Thank you. You\u0027re an angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meanwhile,\" he sighed, \"I\u0027ll sleep on the couch in the living room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you won\u0027t,\" Catherine declared. \"Since I\u0027m the one responsible for this dumb problem, the least I can do is see that you\u0027re comfortable. I\u0027ll sleep on the couch. You take the bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine lay on the bed, wide awake, thinking about Kirk Reynolds. Will I ever be able to make love with another man? Or has Larry burned that out of me? Maybe, in a way, Larry did manage to kill me, after all. Finally, Catherine slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk Reynolds was awakened in the middle of the night by the screams. He sat straight up on the couch, and as the screams continued, he hurried into the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine was flailing about on the bed, her eyes tightly closed. \"No,\" she was yelling. \"Don\u0027t! Don\u0027t! Leave me alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReynolds knelt down and put his arms around her and held her close. \"Shhh,\" he said. \"It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine\u0027s body was wracked with sobs, and he held her close until they subsided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They - tried to drown me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was only a dream,\" he said soothingly. \"You had a bad dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine opened her eyes and sat up. Her body was trembling. \"No, it wasn\u0027t a dream. It was real. They tried to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk was looking at her, puzzled. \"Who tried to kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My...my husband and his mistress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Catherine, you had a nightmare, and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you the truth. They tried to murder me, and they were executed for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk\u0027s face was filled with disbelief. \"Catherine...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t tell you before, because it\u0027s...it\u0027s painful for me to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly realized that she was serious. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t give Larry a divorce, and he...he was in love with another woman, and they decided to murder me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk was listening intently now. \"When was this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A year ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were - they were executed by the state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised a hand. \"Wait a minute. They were executed for attempting to kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReynolds said, \"I\u0027m not an expert on Greek law, but I\u0027m willing to bet that there\u0027s no death sentence for attempted murder. There has to be some mistake. I know a lawyer in Athens. Actually, he works for the state. I\u0027ll give him a call in the morning, and clear this up. His name is Peter Demonides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine was still asleep when Kirk Reynolds awakened. He dressed quietly and went into the bedroom. He stood there a moment, looking down at Catherine. I love her so much. I have to find out what really happened, and clear the shadows away for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirk Reynolds went down to the hotel lobby and placed a phone call to Athens. \"I\u0027d like to make it person-to-person, operator. I want to speak with Peter Demonides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe call came through half an hour later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Demonides? This is Kirk Reynolds. I don\u0027t know whether you remember me, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do. You work for Constantin Demiris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you, Mr. Reynolds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me for bothering you. I\u0027m a bit puzzled about some information I just came across. It involves a point of Greek law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know a little bit about Greek law,\" Demonides said jovially. \"I\u0027ll be happy to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there anything in your law that allows someone to be executed for attempted murder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence on the other end of the line. \"May I ask why you are inquiring?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with a woman named Catherine Alexander. She seems to think that her husband and his mistress were executed by the state for trying to kill her. It doesn\u0027t sound logical. Do you see what I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Demonides\u0027s voice was thoughtful. \"I see what you mean. Where are you, Mr. Reynolds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m staying at the Palace Hotel in St. Moritz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me check this out, and I\u0027ll get back to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would appreciate it. The truth is, I think Miss Alexander may be imagining things, and I\u0027d like to straighten this out and relieve her mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand. You will hear from me. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air was bright and crisp, and the beauty of Catherine\u0027s surroundings dispelled her terrors of the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them breakfasted in the village, and when they had finished, Reynolds said, \"Let\u0027s go over to the ski slope and turn you into a snow bunny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took Catherine over to the beginners\u0027 slope and hired an instructor for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine got into her skis, and stood up. She looked down at her feet. \"This is ridiculous. If God had meant us to look like this, our fathers would have been trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, Kirk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instructor smiled. \"Don\u0027t worry. In no time at all you\u0027ll be skiing like a pro, Miss Alexander. We\u0027ll start out at Corviglia Sass Ronsol. That\u0027s the beginner\u0027s slope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be surprised at how quickly you\u0027ll get the hang of it,\" Reynolds assured Catherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at a ski run in the distance, and turned to the instructor. \"I think I\u0027ll try Fuorcla Grischa today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sounds delicious. I\u0027ll have mine grilled,\" Catherine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a smile. \"It\u0027s a ski run, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Catherine felt embarrassed to tell him it was a joke. I mustn\u0027t do that around him, Catherine thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instructor said, \"The Grischa\u0027s a pretty steep run. You might start out on the Corviglia Standard Marguns to warm up, Mr. Reynolds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea. I\u0027ll do that. Catherine, I\u0027ll meet you at the hotel for lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReynolds waved and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a nice time,\" Catherine called. \"Don\u0027t forget to write.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" the instructor said. \"Let\u0027s go to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Catherine\u0027s surprise, the lessons turned out to be fun. She was nervous in the beginning. She felt awkward and moved up the small slope clumsily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lean forward a little. Keep your skis pointed forward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them. They have a mind of their own,\" Catherine declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re doing fine. Now we\u0027re going down the slope. Bend your knees. Get your balance. There you go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once more. You\u0027re doing fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fell again. And again. And suddenly, she found her sense of balance. And it was as though she had wings. She sailed down the slope, and it was exhilarating. It was almost like flying. She loved the crunch of the snow beneath her skis and the feel of the wind batting at her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love it!\" Catherine said. \"No wonder people get hooked on this. How soon can we do the big slope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instructor laughed. \"Let\u0027s stay with this for today. Tomorrow, the Olympics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, it was a glorious morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was waiting for Kirk Reynolds in the Grill Room when he returned from skiing. His cheeks were ruddy and he looked animated. He walked up to Catherine\u0027s table and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he asked, \"how did it go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. I didn\u0027t break anything important. I only fell down six times. And you know something?\" she said proudly. \"Toward the end I got pretty good. I think he\u0027s going to enter me in the Olympics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReynolds smiled. \"Good.\" He started to mention the phone call he had made to Peter Demonides, and then decided against it. He did not want to have Catherine upset again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter lunch they went for a long walk in the snow, stopping in at some of the shops to browse. Catherine was beginning to feel tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027d like to go back to the room,\" she said. \"I might take a little nap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good idea. The air\u0027s pretty thin here, and if you\u0027re not used to it you can get tired easily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do, Kirk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at a distant slope. \"I think I might ski down the Grischa. I\u0027ve never done it before. It\u0027s a challenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean - \u0027because it\u0027s there.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. It looks so dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReynolds nodded. \"That\u0027s why it\u0027s a challenge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine took his hand. \"Kirk, about last night. I\u0027m sorry. I...I\u0027ll try to do better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it. Go back to the hotel and get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine watched him walk away and thought, He\u0027s a wonderful man. I wonder what he sees in an idiot like me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine slept during the afternoon, and this time there were no dreams. When she awakened it was almost six o\u0027clock. Kirk would be returning soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine bathed and dressed, thinking about the evening ahead of her. No, not the evening, she admitted to herself, the night. I\u0027ll make it up to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the window and looked out. It was beginning to get dark. Kirk must really be enjoying himself, Catherine thought. She looked up at the huge slope in the distance. Is that the Grischa? I wonder if I\u0027ll ever be able to ski down that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt seven o\u0027clock Kirk Reynolds still had not returned. The twilight had turned to a deep blackness. He can\u0027t be skiing in the dark, Catherine thought. I\u0027ll bet he\u0027s in the bar downstairs having a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started for the door just as the phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine smiled. I was right. He\u0027s calling me to ask me to join him downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted the receiver and said brightly, \"Well, did you come across any Sherpas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange voice said, \"Mrs. Reynolds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to say no, then remembered how Kirk had registered them. \"Yes. This is Mrs. Reynolds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I have some bad news for you. Your husband has been in a skiing accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no! Is it...is it serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll come right away. Where...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to tell you he\u0027s...he\u0027s dead, Mrs. Reynolds. He was skiing the Lagalp and broke his neck.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-16.html","bookId":2362,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM"}
