But if I hadn\u0027t come for the cat, what was I there for? I gave her an abbreviated explanation of my role. While she was digesting that I asked her how she\u0027d gained access to Kim\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I had a key. I\u0027d given her a key to my apartment some months ago. I was going out of town and wanted her to water my plants, and shortly after I came back she gave me her key. I can\u0027t remember why. Did she want me to feed Panther? I really can\u0027t remember. Do you suppose I can change his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just that I don\u0027t much care for the cat\u0027s name, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s proper to change it. I don\u0027t believe he recognizes it. What he recognizes is the whirr of the electric can opener, announcing that dinner is served.\" She smiled. \"T. S. Eliot wrote that every cat has a secret name, known only to the cat himself. So I don\u0027t suppose it really matters what name I call him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned the conversation to Kim, asked how close a friend she\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if we were friends,\" she said. \"We were neighbors. We were good neighbors, I kept a key to her apartment, but I\u0027m not sure we were friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew she was a prostitute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I knew. At first I thought she was a model. She had the looks for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But somewhere in the course of things I gathered what her actual profession was. She never mentioned it. I think it may have been her failure to discuss her work that made me guess what it was. And then there was that black man who visited her frequently. Somehow I found myself assuming he was her pimp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she have a boyfriend, Mrs. Simkins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides the black man?\" She thought about it, and while she did so a black streak darted across the rug, leaped onto a couch, leaped again and was gone. \"You see?\" the woman said. \"He\u0027s not at all like a panther. I don\u0027t know what he is like, but he\u0027s nothing like a panther. You asked if she had a boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wonder. She must have had some sort of secret plan because she hinted at it the last time we talked- that she\u0027d be moving away, that her life was going to take a turn for the better. I\u0027m afraid I wrote it off as a pipe dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I assumed she meant she and her pimp were going to run off into the sunset and live happily ever after, only she wouldn\u0027t say as much to me because she\u0027d never come out and told me that she had a pimp, that she was a prostitute. I understand pimps will assure a girl that their other girls are unimportant, that as soon as enough money\u0027s saved they\u0027ll go off and buy a sheep station in Australia or something equally realistic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Fran Schecter on Morton Street, convinced she and Chance were bound by karmic ties, with innumerable lifetimes ahead of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was planning on leaving her pimp,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For another man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never seen Kim with anyone in particular, never paid much attention to the men who visited Kim\u0027s apartment. Such visitors were few at night, anyway, she explained, and she herself was at work during the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought she\u0027d bought the fur herself,\" she said. \"She was so proud of it, as if someone had bought it for her, but I thought she wanted to conceal her shame at having had to buy it for herself. I\u0027ll bet she did have a boyfriend. She showed it off with that air, as if it had been a gift from a man, but she didn\u0027t come out and say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the relationship was a secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. She was proud of the fur, proud of the jewelry. You said she was leaving her pimp. Is that why she was killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I try not to think about her having been killed, or how or why it happened. Did you ever read a book called Watership Down?\" I hadn\u0027t. \"There\u0027s one colony of rabbits in the book, a sort of semidomesticated colony. The food\u0027s in good supply there because human beings leave food for the rabbits. It\u0027s sort of rabbit heaven, except that the men who do this do so in order to set snares and provide themselves with a rabbit dinner from time to time. And the surviving rabbits, they never refer to the snare, they never mention any of their fellows who\u0027ve been killed that way. They have an unspoken agreement to pretend that the snare does not exist, and that their dead companions never existed.\" She\u0027d been looking to one side as she spoke. Now her eyes found mine. \"Do you know, I think New Yorkers are like those rabbits. We live here for whatever it is that the city provides- the culture, the job opportunities, whatever it is. And we look the other way when the city kills off our friends and neighbors. Oh, we read about it and we talk about it for a day or two days but then we blink it all away. Because otherwise we\u0027d have to do something about it, and we can\u0027t. Or we\u0027d have to move, and we don\u0027t want to move. We\u0027re like those rabbits, aren\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left my number, told her to call if she thought of anything. She said she would. I took the elevator to the lobby, but when it got there I stayed in the car and rode it back to twelve again. Just because I\u0027d located the black kitten didn\u0027t mean I\u0027d be wasting my time knocking on a few more doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept that\u0027s what I did. I talked to half a dozen people and didn\u0027t learn a thing, other than that they and Kim did a good job of keeping to themselves. One man had even managed to miss out on the knowledge that a neighbor of his had been murdered. The others knew that much, but not a great deal more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027d run out of doors to knock on I found myself approaching Kim\u0027s door, key in hand. Why? Because of the fifth of Wild Turkey in the front closet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put her key in my pocket and got out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting book led me to a noon meeting just a few blocks from Kim\u0027s. The speaker was just finishing her qualification when I walked in. At first glance I thought she was Jan, but when I took another look I saw there was no real resemblance. I got a cup of coffee and took a seat at the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was crowded, thick with smoke. The discussion seemed to center itself on the spiritual side of the program, and I wasn\u0027t too clear on what that was, nor did anything I hear clarify it for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne guy said something good, though, a big fellow with a voice like a load of gravel. \"I came in here to save my ass,\" he said, \"and then I found out it was attached to my soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Saturday was a good day for knocking on doors, it was equally good for visiting hookers. While a Saturday-afternoon trick may not be unheard of, it\u0027s the exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ate some lunch, then rode uptown on the Lexington IRT. The car was uncrowded, and directly opposite me a black kid in a pea jacket and heavy-soled boots was smoking a cigarette. I remembered my conversation with Durkin and wanted to tell the kid to put out the cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, I thought, mind your own business. Leave it alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got off at Sixty-eighth Street and walked a block north and two blocks east. Ruby Lee and Mary Lou Barcker lived in apartment buildings diagonally opposite one another. Ruby\u0027s was on the southwest corner and I went there first because I came to it first. The doorman announced me over the intercom and I shared the elevator with a florist\u0027s delivery boy. He had his arms full of roses and the car was heavy with their scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby opened the door to my knock, smiled coolly, led me inside. The apartment was sparsely if tastefully furnished. The furniture was contemporary and neutral, but there were other items to give the place an oriental cast- a Chinese rug, a group of Japanese prints in black lacquered frames, a bamboo screen. They weren\u0027t enough to render the apartment exotic, but Ruby managed that all by herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was tall, though not so tall as Kim, and her figure was lithe and willowy. She showed it off in a black sheath dress with a skirt slit to show a flash of thigh when she walked. She put me in a chair and offered me a drink, and I heard myself ask for tea. She smiled and came back with tea for both of us. It was Lipton\u0027s, I noted. God knows what I expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father was half French and half Senegalese, her mother Chinese. She\u0027d been born in Hong Kong, lived for a time in Macao, then came to America via Paris and London. She didn\u0027t tell me her age and I didn\u0027t ask, nor could I have possibly guessed it. She might have been twenty or forty-five or almost anything in between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had met Kim once. She didn\u0027t really know anything about her, didn\u0027t know much about any of the girls. She herself had been with Chance for a time and found their arrangement comfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know if Kim had had a boyfriend. Why, she wondered, would a woman want two men in her life? Then she would have to give money to both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suggested that Kim might have had a different sort of relationship with her boyfriend, that he might have given her gifts. She seemed to find the idea baffling. Did I mean a customer? I said that was possible. But a customer was not a boyfriend, she said. A customer was just another man in a long line of men. How could one feel anything for a customer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the street, Mary Lou Barcker poured me a Coke and set out a plate of cheese and crackers. \"So you met the Dragon Lady,\" she said. \"Striking, isn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s putting it mildly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three races blended into one absolutely stunning woman. Then the shock comes. You open the door and nobody\u0027s home. Come here a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined her at the window, looked where she was pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s her window,\" she said. \"You can see her apartment from mine. You\u0027d think we\u0027d be great friends, wouldn\u0027t you? Dropping in at odd hours to borrow a cup of sugar or complain about premenstrual tension. Figures, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it hasn\u0027t worked out that way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s always polite. But she\u0027s just not there. The woman doesn\u0027t relate. I\u0027ve known a lot of johns who\u0027ve gone over there. I\u0027ve steered some business her way, as far as that goes. A guy\u0027ll say he\u0027s had fantasies about oriental girls, for example. Or I might just tell a guy that I know a girl he might like. You know something? It\u0027s the safest thing in the world. They\u0027re grateful because she is beautiful, she is exotic, and I gather she knows her way around a mattress, but they almost never go back. They go once and they\u0027re glad they went, but they don\u0027t go back. They\u0027ll pass her number on to their buddies instead of ringing it again themselves. I\u0027m sure she keeps busy but I\u0027ll bet she doesn\u0027t know what a steady trick is, I\u0027ll bet she\u0027s never had one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a slender woman, dark haired, a little taller than average, with precise features and small even teeth. She had her hair pulled back and done in a chignon, I think they call it, and she was wearing aviator glasses, the lenses tinted a pale amber. The hair and the glasses combined to give her a rather severe look, an effect of which she was by no means unaware. \"When I take off the glasses and let my hair down,\" she said at one point, \"I look a whole lot softer, a good deal less threatening. Of course some johns want a woman to look threatening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf Kim she said, \"I didn\u0027t know her well. I don\u0027t know any of them really well. What a crew they are! Sunny\u0027s the good-time party girl, she thinks she\u0027s made a huge leap in status by becoming a prostitute. Ruby\u0027s a sort of autistic adult, untouched by human minds. I\u0027m sure she\u0027s socking away the dollars, and one of these days she\u0027ll go back to Macao or Port Said and open up an opium den. Chance probably knows she\u0027s holding out and has the good sense to let her.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eight-million-ways-to-die-matthew-scudder-5/page-25.html","bookId":2323,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:25 AM"}
