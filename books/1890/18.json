He lifted me up again and carried me to the door and then the elevator. When the doors opened, France was standing inside of it, taking up a lot of the room. He looked pissed when he held his arms out for Will to hand me over. The minute I was in his arms, I closed my eyes, letting the room spinning take me. The safety of his chest and the smell of him, told it me it was time to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anytime. You get some rest, J.D.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved weakly, more like flopping my arm about. The elevator moved but we didn’t talk. He held me to him and I let the comfort of him make me feel better. When we got to his floor, he carried me inside. He was being gentle as he laid me down on his sofa. He forced my eyes open. I winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck, Jack. You\u0027re stoned. What did you take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I don’t know. A white pill and my blue pills and drinks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved me back onto the couch, \"Did you eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I had some olives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed and walked away. The dimly-lit room burned my eyes. I closed them but tried to stand. I barely managed to get to my feet and stumble into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned against the metal countertop I always hated. It felt too industrial. He was making eggs or something. He looked different. \"You shaved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, not meeting my gaze. His handsome face was back. The beard might have hidden the clench in his jaw. Clean-shaven, I could see just how angry he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at me, \"Bachelorette party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and slumped onto a barstool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Why didn’t you just come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, \"I did. You didn’t come. I was there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked lost, \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed and tried not to throw up anymore. \"The second day you were meeting me. I couldn’t get there the first day. I had something to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed his fist on the counter, \"More important than meeting me? Really? You\u0027re such a bitch sometimes, Jack. Sometimes you are one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t get the words to explain. I stepped off of the stool and slumped onto the floor. The room spins were out of control. The last thing I saw was his moving mouth, still shouting at me for not meeting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunday\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed was the worst I\u0027d slept on in a while. My back was aching. I opened one eye to see bright light and a lady moving in white. She smiled, \"You\u0027re awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced, lifting a hand to my face, \"Where am I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Presbyterian Hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"What happened?\" Was I hit by a cab? I was dying for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, \"Partied a bit hard, I\u0027m afraid. Your friend there brought you in last night. You were dehydrated beyond what I have seen in a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over at Mike, passed out on a chair. He looked small there on the chair, curled into himself. I smiled, \"He brought me in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the fuck had happened? I had nothing. He had a banner or sash in his hands. It was bright pink. Was I in Ms. New York contest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that he\u0027s holding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse smiled harder, \"Your bachelorette party sash. Guess you had fun.\" She left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t feel like I had fun. It felt like I was dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"France.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stirred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank the water in the paper cup she had set next to me and then tossed it at him, \"France!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes slowly, \"Piss off, Jack. I\u0027m sleeping. Damn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"What happened, France? Why am I here? Where\u0027s my sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"She came by earlier and went home to sleep. People need sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacqueline, oh you\u0027re alright!\" I looked over as my mother came rushing into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, who had called her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed my hand, \"Honey, are you feeling better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snatched my hand from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, \"Your sister called and said you had not been feeling well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched her face turn cold as her eyes landed on Mike. Her jaw became set and her eyes narrowed, \"What are you doing here? You don’t think you\u0027ve done enough? Did you do this to her? They said you brought her in. You and your trailer-trash, drug-addict ways. You get out of here. You\u0027ve done enough.\" Mike sat up, rubbing his eyes. I could see the fury starting on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swatted her arm, \"Don’t talk to him like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snapped her head back around at me and I saw a look I had never seen on my mother’s face. She pointed, \"Your father has worked very hard to get you into the engagement you are in. You spoiled little bitch. You will not ruin that for him. Your father and Phil will be here in a few minutes. I expect that gone when they get here.\" She turned on her heel and stormed from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike laughed, \"Good to see the Prozac is working on her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t laugh. I reached for him, \"You don’t have to leave. I made sure he can\u0027t touch you. None of them can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up, taking my hand, \"What are you talking about? What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"There isn’t any time. You shouldn’t have called my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over to see two guards come in, \"Hey man, we gotta ask you to leave. Her family is making a stink.\" They looked somber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike nodded, \"Yeah, I probably shouldn’t cause another scene. Bad for press.\" He bent and kissed my cheek, \"Call me tomorrow.\" I pressed my face into his. He stood up, taking my sash with him and walked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get an autograph though, when we get downstairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike laughed, \"Yeah, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt trapped. The IV in my arm was cold like a handcuff, pinning me to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked out the window; the light was filtering in softly. It looked like a beautiful day to run away from home. Even at twenty-eight, I had no power over how things were going to play out. I hated that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice interrupted my pity party for one. \"Jacqueline, I am so disappointed in you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, not meeting my father\u0027s eyes, \"Fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, \"You always were the difficult one. This little stunt of yours has actually proved to be fruitful though. I have to thank you for that one. I never imagined you would make it easier for me to force your hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him; the hateful look on his face was a sinister smirk. Dr. Michaels walked in after my father, holding a folder. His look matched my father\u0027s. \"We take suicide attempts very seriously now, Jacqueline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowled, \"What? I went partying. I never tried to kill myself. You two are really reaching for that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father folded his arms smugly, \"Your blood work has a deadly cocktail of narcotics in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Whatever. That is terrible. You would actually lie for him, Dr. Michaels? I\u0027m an adult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, \"I am worried for your mental health. Worst comes to worst, you could require a 28-day dry out at rehab. This is serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed hard, \"You gave me the drugs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"The only prescription you have from me is a one-time prescription for Xanax. The other bottle wasn’t prescribed by me.\" He nodded once, \"I\u0027ll leave you two to discuss the therapy I am recommending, and possible two-week stay for observation in the mental ward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room spun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father walked close, grabbing my hand like a viper. He squeezed, \"You dare to threaten me with Muriel? You don’t have to worry about that Mike France. I won\u0027t be going near him—I don’t need to. You fuck up enough that I don’t need to threaten his career.\" He licked his lips, \"So Jacqueline, which is it? The nut house, rehab, or Phil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth of the matter. I was never going to get away. I was now a danger to myself. I shook my head, \"Whatever you have on Dr. Michaels must be impressive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, \"You would never believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, I probably wouldn’t. My father had a flair for finding peoples’ weaknesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears didn’t come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart didn’t flutter or break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went completely numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at him with the fake, frozen smile my mother always gave him, \"Phil it is, then.\" I understood then, she hated him as much as I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed my hand again and kissed the top of it, \"There\u0027s my good girl.\" He winked and let my hand drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the room with a smug saunter. Phil came in after him. He looked exhausted and worn out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"Drank too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked worried, \"The blood work showed ecstasy, speed, and pharmaceuticals. It looks like you tried to kill yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"Phil, when have I ever seemed like I could be strong enough to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat on the bed, \"This is because of Ashley, isn’t it? I just feel sick. J.D. I wish I could take it all back. I have pushed you to this. I hate myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized then, he was still drunk from his bachelor party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"I need to get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed up onto the bed with me and wrapped himself around me. I laid there, frozen and dead inside as he whispered, \"I love you. I will make this up to you. I am so sorry.\" He slipped a new ring on my thin finger. It was ridiculous in size, \"I will make you happy again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday, One Week later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wedding Day\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dress was loose. I had basically stopped eating when Phil\u0027s mother insisted on spending every waking moment with me, trying to make up for what her son had driven me to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father had relished in the glory of the thing he now held over the Bernard family. Their son\u0027s infidelity with a child had driven me to suicide instead of a bachelorette party. Like I was so feeble and fragile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had spent the week desperately searching for a moment to escape. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-18.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
