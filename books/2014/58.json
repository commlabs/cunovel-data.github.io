But there remains another charge as serious: that I purchased her father’s debt price, and thus her bond of slavery, illegally. I am sworn to the church. It is slander to suggest that I dealt dishonestly or unfairly in such a transaction.” For an instant, she heard real anger in his voice, honor stung by false accusation. He did not look at her. She looked away from him quickly and became aware all at once that many people in the crowd were watching her watching him. What had her face revealed? More than his did, surely. He went on. “As for the books, to whom could she have expected to sell books? And for what price? To a freeholder to burn in the hearth for heat over the winter? I must point out that after the sale of his remaining belongings, her father still left debts totaling fully two nomias—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurmurs arose in the crowd. People pointed. Whispers buzzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Two nomias! For a slave! That’s as much as for a fine stallion!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo one side, she glimpsed Count Lavastine slipping into place among the crowd of nobles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In truth, Your Majesty,” Hugh went on smoothly, “she could not have met the debt price, books or no books, no matter what she believes—or wishes to believe. I kept her safe, clothed, fed, and housed. And I was repaid in this manner: Your Eagle, Wolfhere, stole her from me without my consent—and, evidently, without yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I pray you, Your Majesty!” The words burst out of Wolfhere. “May I speak?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king considered for a long time. Finally, he lifted a hand in consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolfhere spoke crisply. “Liath came with me freely. I paid the full debt price that Father Hugh had taken on himself: two nomias. The transaction was witnessed by Marshal Liudolf of Heart’s Rest, and sealed with your own mark—the mark of the Eagles which you grant to each of us who serves the crown of Wendar and Varre. It is well known that your servants hold the right to take what they need when they need it. I had need of more Eagles, in such troubled times. Liath and Hanna served me well, and indeed I lost two Eagles at Gent, one of them my own discipla. I did not purchase Liath’s freedom trivially, but out of necessity. She has served you well, Your Majesty. I beg you to take her service into account.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But she was still taken without my consent,” said Hugh quietly. “I did not take the nomias that were offered me. I did not agree to the transaction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry shifted in his chair. “Do you begrudge me a gift as insignificant as this girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not at all, Your Majesty,” he replied without missing a beat. His golden-blond hair gleamed in the sun, as did he. “But I dislike seeing such disgrace brought onto your Eagles, for isn’t it true that Eagles must be free men and women to ride in your service?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Freeborn men and women,” said Wolfhere quickly. “It was no fault of Liath’s that her father died in debt. But she is freeborn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do we know that?” asked Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will swear it on the Holy Verses!” cried Liath fiercely. “Both my mother and father were freeborn—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peace,” said the king softly, and she winced, cursed herself. Could she never just keep quiet? This was not the way to win the king’s favor. He regarded Hugh and Wolfhere with a frown, but she could not guess at his thoughts. Finally, he gestured toward Sister Rosvita. “You wish to speak, Sister?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only in this way, Your Majesty. I advise you to send this young woman to the convent of St. Valeria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat surprised him. “I begin to think there is more here than meets the eye. St. Valeria! Why should I send her to St. Valeria? To see why Theophanu is delayed for so long there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A good enough reason, Your Majesty. One that will serve the purpose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You speak in riddles, my good counselor. Is there more you would say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosvita hesitated. Liath’s heart beat so hard she thought everyone around her could hear its hammering. Rosvita knew what was written in The Book of Secrets; her testimony alone could condemn Liath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nay, Your Majesty,” she said at last, and reluctantly. “There is nothing more I would say in such an assembly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhispers threaded through the crowd like a weaving gone awry. Hugh’s eyes narrowed as he gazed at the cleric; then he recalled himself and bowed his head modestly. He did it so well. Never a hair out of place, never a smile too many or a frown at the wrong time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry chuckled, but more in exasperation than good cheer. He gestured expansively. “Are there others who wish to speak?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-burning-stone-crown-of-stars-3/page-58.html","bookId":2014,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:51:22 PM"}
