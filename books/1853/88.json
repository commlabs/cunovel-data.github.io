What the f**k was wrong with my life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry I\u0027m late! Claire, were you surprised?\" Jenny asked as she pushed her way past Liz and Jim, stopping suddenly when she saw the position we were in. On the counter. With both of our asses showing, covered in chocolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heh, heh, Claire has boobs and penises stuck to her ass!\" Drew laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that explains the weird bumps I felt on her ass. I was a little worried there for a minute that she might have boils or some creepy skin condition I didn\u0027t know about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope to God you bleach this counter,\" Liz scolded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my eyes,\" Jim mutter with his back still to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire hadn\u0027t moved or said a word and I almost wanted to stick my finger under her nose to see if she was still breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wanted to surprise you with a \"Good luck with the store opening\" cake but it looks like you guys started celebrating without us,\" Jenny laughed. \"Drew, why haven\u0027t we played with chocolate yet? We need to remedial that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remedy, babe. Remedy,\" Drew corrected as he grabbed another chocolate boob from the counter a few inches from Claire\u0027s ass and ate it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy the f**k was everyone still standing in this kitchen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought you a sample of my new edible lotion. It\u0027s funnel cake flavor. I figured you and Carter-boy could spice it up by playing dirty carnie and innocent fair-goer,\" Liz said as she tossed the bottle of lotion on the counter. \"Looks like I should have brought you a drop cloth instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m guessing you and Jim already tested out the funnel cake lotion, right? Did you pretend to be the slutty clown car with millions of midgets flocking out of your vagina?\" Claire said sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the Butler Broadcasting System, coming to you live from the kitchen of the snacks side of \"Seduction and Snacks,\" the new business opening tomorrow, right in the heart of Butler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman in a business suit suddenly walked through the door with a microphone in her hand and a man with a camera followed behind her. The giant spotlight on top of the camera blinded us and everyone started yelling, but not before we heard the words, \"Coming to you live...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a dream. It has to be a f**king dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe perfectly coiffed woman with the bouffant hair stopped in her tracks when she saw my chocolate covered ass. Her shout of, \"Holy f**k,\" was now being broadcast into several thousand Butler living rooms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, the camera man took in the scene in front of him and reacted faster than she did. He whipped around, smacking his camera into Jim\u0027s head before stumbling backwards, slipping through the spilled, melted chocolate and crashing down on the floor on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Son of a bitch that hurt,\" Jim could be heard shouting off-camera as the view on the television suddenly flew to a shot of the ceiling and a loud \"ooomf\" came through the speakers, signifying the point in the broadcast when the camera man landed on his ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz fell off the couch, landing on her side in a fit of giggles. Jim managed to stay on the couch but bent over at the waist, holding on to his stomach as he laughed right along with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Claire and I could do was stare in shock at the replay of tonight\u0027s broadcast that Liz managed to catch on her DVR. After the kitchen debacle and plenty of apologies from the staff of BBS for deciding a surprise interview would be fun, we came back to Liz and Jim\u0027s house to clean up and see if by some miracle there was a cable outage in the area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo such luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooooh, here comes my part!\" Drew said excitedly as he jumped up from his spot on the floor and reached over to turn up the volume on the television.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew\u0027s face suddenly came into the shot as he bent over the downed camera man, the view of the shop\u0027s kitchen ceiling behind his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop by Seduction and Snacks for the grand opening tomorrow and try some of Claire\u0027s boobs. They\u0027re delicious!\" he said with a smile as he bit off one of the chocolate boobs he held in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera turned to the side where the stunned TV anchor stood with Liz and Jenny, waving frantically into the camera behind her and Jim off to the side rubbing his head and muttering, \"Fuck that hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-b-back to you in the studio, Sam,\" she stuttered as she stared wide eyed into the camera without blinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shot went back to the studio where they immediately began talking about the weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the good news is the camera man managed to avoid showing Butler that you guys were taste testing the chocolate with your penis and vagina,\" Liz said from her spot on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s the good news, what the hell is the bad news?\" Claire asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Drew is now the face of Seduction and Snacks,\" Liz laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all glanced over at Drew as he picked lint off of the front of his shirt that had been the main focus of the camera shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess there were worse things Seduction and Snacks could be famous for than a tee shirt that read, \"Have you seen Mike Hunt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21. Itchy Feet and Fading Smiles\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly the airing of our dirty laundry, or should I say dirty kitchen and mouths, didn\u0027t deter anyone from stopping by the grand opening of Seduction and Snacks today. But if one more person asks me if Mr. Hunt is available, I\u0027m going to punch them in the kidney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarter, Gavin, Liz, Jim and I all arrived at the shop a few hours before we opened to finish last-minute details and set everything up. Thankfully, today\u0027s opening didn\u0027t require the chocolate boobs and penises. Drew ate all the ones that weren\u0027t stuck to my ass last night. Come to think of it, he may have eaten those as well. I remembered him saying something about a \"Five Second Ass Rule\", not to be confused with the original \"Five Second Rule\" for when you drop food on the floor. I tuned him out when he told Carter, \"Her ass better be so clean you can see your face in it!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-88.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:55 PM"}
