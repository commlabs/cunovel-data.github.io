Only then did I realize he was barefoot On closer examination, his shirt was inside out and his shorts weren\u0027t zipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you in a big hurry to leave?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" He stared at me with innocent Adam-eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your... um - \" I waved vaguely. \"Barn door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced down, then presented me with his back. \"I forgot to X-Y-Z.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the zipper being zipped punctuated his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s X-Y-Z?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Examine your zipper.

This was the family home - despite its disarray. Why hadn\u0027t Adam brought him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate that place, I wish it would rot, but de damn thing never will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cut through the swamp,\" Luc said. \"Wasn\u0027t far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you walk around the swamp a lot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure that was such a good idea He was so little, the things out there so big.

What was I going to do with him until Adam showed up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would show up. Wouldn\u0027t he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d wait a half an hour; then I\u0027d take Luc back myself and head into town as I\u0027d planned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you... hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"I\u0027ve got crackers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a face. \"That\u0027s not food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cookies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dug out the package, handed it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many can I have?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was probably the wrong thing to say to a kid, but he wasn\u0027t my kid, and Adam had made it clear he never would be. If Luc went home on a sugar high, well, that was no more than the man deserved. What kind of father allowed a child to roam the swamp?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did I know about it? Maybe down here, or anywhere for that matter, a four-year-old was plenty old to swamp-wander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eyed Luc\u0027s size, then thought of his speech, his behavior. Maybe he was older than four. Regardless, he wasn\u0027t twenty-four. Which is how old I thought he should be before he went into the swamp alone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t polite to ask a woman her age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come? Don\u0027t you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, he was cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re older than my dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, wasn\u0027t that special?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much older?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my opinion, that didn\u0027t count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, your turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a cookie myself, earning a scowl of reproof from Luc. Did he plan to eat them all? From the way he was wolfing them down - stupid question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m little, but I\u0027m quick.

Badly. Several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI forgot about \"just one game.\" I forgot about leaving in a half an hour.

I was so surprised, I let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad likes you.\" He shifted his butt, snuggled his head under my chin, and put his arms around my waist. \"I can tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left out not enough and not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s never mumbled a girl\u0027s name in his sleep before.

That\u0027s when I watch hold \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was Adam up to all night that made him sleep when the sun shone? I had a feeling I didn\u0027t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we\u0027d been talking, my arms had automatically circled the child. My cheek rested on his hair.

I wasn\u0027t going to be taking Luc home anytime soon. He might be little, but he was probably too big for me to carry. Besides, I didn\u0027t want to wake him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched out on the bedroll, letting his body tumble onto the cover next to me. When he mumbled and shifted, I stroked his hair and whispered, \"I like you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fell back to sleep, his hand resting in mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself fascinated by that tiny, soft hand. He had a scrape on one knuckle, a scab on the palm; his fingernails were encrusted in dirt. Had he been digging with them? I suspected that might be something little boys did, but I wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuc looked so much like Adam. From the blue eyes, to the dark hair, to the skin that turned bronze beneath the sun. Was there anything of Luc\u0027s mother in him at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never had a maternal yearning in my life. Never heard the biological clock ticking. Never went gaga over babies. I didn\u0027t drool over sunsuits and tiny shoes. So why did holding Luc Ruelle\u0027s hand make my stomach flutter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA movement at the corner of my vision made me glance up. I wasn\u0027t surprised to find Adam watching me from the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his expression, Luc was wrong.
