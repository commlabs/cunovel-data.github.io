I\u0027d deliberately chosen to clock the short trip during a busy time on a Monday, so I was pleased when I reached the Crossfire Building, which housed Waters Field \u0026amp; Leaman, in less than thirty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tipped my head back and followed the line of the building all the way up to the slender ribbon of sky. The Crossfire was seriously impressive, a sleek spire of gleaming sapphire that pierced the clouds. I knew from my previous interviews that the interior on the other side of the ornate copper-framed revolving doors was just as awe-inspiring, with golden-veined marble floors and walls, and brushed aluminum security desk and turnstiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my new ID card out of the inner pocket of my pants and held it up for the two guards in black business suits at the desk. They stopped me anyway, no doubt because I was majorly underdressed, but then they cleared me through. After I completed an elevator ride up to the twentieth floor, I\u0027d have a general time frame for the whole route from door to door. Score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was walking toward the bank of elevators when a svelte, beautifully groomed brunette caught her purse on a turnstile and upended it, spilling a deluge of change. Coins rained onto the marble and rolled merrily away, and I watched people dodge the chaos and keep going as if they didn\u0027t see it. I winced in sympathy and crouched to help the woman collect her money, as did one of the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said, shooting me a quick harried smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back. \"No problem. I\u0027ve been there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d just squatted to reach a nickel lying near the entrance when I ran into a pair of luxurious black oxfords draped in tailored black slacks. I waited a beat for the man to move out of my way and when he didn\u0027t, I arched my neck back to allow my line of sight to rise. The custom three-piece suit hit more than a few of my hot buttons, but it was the tall, powerfully lean body inside it that made it sensational. Still, as hot as all that magnificent maleness was, it wasn\u0027t until I reached the man\u0027s face that I went down for the count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. Just...wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sank into an elegant crouch directly in front of me. Hit with all that exquisite masculinity at eye-level, I could only stare. Stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something shifted in the air between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he stared back, he altered...as if a shield slid away from his eyes, revealing a scorching force of will that sucked the air from my lungs. The intense magnetism he exuded grew in strength, becoming a near tangible impression of vibrant and unrelenting power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReacting purely on instinct, I shifted backward. And sprawled flat on my ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy elbows throbbed from the violent contact with the marble floor, but I scarcely registered the pain. I was too preoccupied with staring, riveted by the man in front of me. Inky black hair framed a breathtaking face. His bone structure would make a sculptor weep with joy, while a firmly etched mouth, a blade of a nose, and intensely blue eyes made him savagely gorgeous. Those eyes narrowed slightly, his features otherwise schooled into impassivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dress shirt and suit were both black, but his tie perfectly matched those brilliant irises. His eyes were shrewd and assessing, and they bored into me. My heartbeat quickened; my lips parted to accommodate faster breaths. He smelled sinfully good. Not cologne. Body wash, maybe. Or shampoo. Whatever it was, it was mouthwatering, as was he.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held out a hand to me, exposing onyx cuff links and a very expensive-looking watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a shaky inhalation, I placed my hand in his. My pulse leaped when his grip tightened. His touch was electric, sending a shock up my arm that raised the hairs on my nape. He didn\u0027t move for a moment, a frown line marring the space between arrogantly slashed brows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was cultured and smooth, with a rasp that made my stomach flutter. It brought sex to mind. Extraordinary sex. I thought for a moment that he might be able to make me orgasm just by talking long enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips were dry, so I licked them before answering. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood with economical grace, pulling me up with him. We maintained eye contact because I was unable to look away. He was younger than I\u0027d assumed at first. Younger than thirty would be my guess, but his eyes were much worldlier. Hard and sharply intelligent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt drawn to him, as if a rope bound my waist and he was slowly, inexorably pulling it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking out of my semi-daze, I released him. He wasn\u0027t just beautiful; he was...enthralling. He was the kind of guy that made a woman want to rip his shirt open and watch the buttons scatter along with her inhibitions. I looked at him in his civilized, urbane, outrageously expensive suit and thought of raw, primal, sheet-clawing f**king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent down and retrieved the ID card I hadn\u0027t realized I\u0027d dropped, freeing me from that provocative gaze. My brain stuttered back into gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was irritated with myself for feeling so awkward while he was so completely self-possessed. And why? Because I was dazzled, damn it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up at me and the pose - him nearly kneeling before me - skewed my equilibrium again. He held my gaze as he rose. \"Are you sure you\u0027re all right? You should sit down for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face heated. How lovely to appear awkward and clumsy in front of the most self-assured and graceful man I\u0027d ever met. \"I just lost my balance. I\u0027m okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking away, I caught sight of the woman who\u0027d dumped the contents of her purse. She thanked the guard who\u0027d helped her; then turned to approach me, apologizing profusely. I faced her and held out the handful of coins I\u0027d collected, but her gaze snagged on the god in the suit and she promptly forgot me altogether. After a beat, I just reached over and dumped the change into the woman\u0027s bag. Then I risked a glance at the man again, finding him watching me even as the brunette gushed thank-yous. To him. Not to me, of course, the one who\u0027d actually helped. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-2.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
