She drapes her clothes over the rocks near the fire and watches the steam rise from them in wispy gray tongues while they dry. The night wind comes cool and her skin prickles all over with goose bumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watches the fire and feels sleepy, and when she pokes it with a stick, the embers fly up into the air like a crazy squadron of insects and then simply disappear as if they’ve gotten lodged in one of the many folds of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at the man sitting next to her, his flat eyes brimful of contemplation of the flames. There is only so much room in that head of his, and right now the space is occupied with the shape-shifting vision of the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing that happened back there, she says. I mean, it ain’t like you asked—but anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t take his eyes off the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean I guess I been around meatskins too long, she continues. Sometimes it happens where I’ll lose it. Like a switch got flicked somewhere in my brain, you know? And then my hands’ll start rippin and tearin and they don’t care about the whys or wherefores.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire pops and sizzles with the sap from the branches they found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it’s wrong, it’s a sin as big as the world we live in, bigger even—to lay your hands on a creation of God’s and snuff it out. It don’t matter how ugly a thing it is, it’s a sin, and God will send a terrible vengeance down on you for it—I know, I seen it. But the truth is—the truth is I don’t know where I got off on the wrong track. Moses, he says I ain’t evil, but then if I ain’t evil . . . If I ain’t evil then what am I? Cause my hands, see, they ain’t seem to got no purpose except when they’re bashin in a skull or slittin a throat. That’s the whole, all around truth of the matter. Them meatskins, they kill—but they ain’t get any satisfaction out of it. Maury, you sure are wanderin a lonely earth—full of breach and befoulment—but the real abomination is sittin right next to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, the moon is just a sliver in the sky, like a candle flame, delicate and tenuous against the irreducibility of night. Like you should hold your breath for fear of blowing it out altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the big man next to her has comprehended a word of what she has said, he does not show it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess what I’m sayin is, she announces at last, we better get you to Texas so you can get shut of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDays of waft and wayfaring. They follow the tracks and keep the morning sun behind them. Maury walks beside her, his feet trammeling along invariably—a gravitational movement, he is given direction only by her. When she walks into the woods because she thinks she hears something coming, he follows without question or confusion. When she stops to look at the sun or soak her feet in the river that still runs parallel to them, he stops also.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the crackers are gone, they eat berries and fish caught from the river in a burlap sack she finds among the rubble of the railroad tracks. Where the tracks cross roads, she looks for cars suitable for driving, but the railroad has taken them out beyond the urban areas, and she considers trying to get back to the main highways but decides instead they may be better off where people are unlikely to follow. Besides, it’s peaceful here with the tracks and the river running straight and twinned. They go for hours at a time without seeing a single meatskin—and the ones they do find are sluggish from hunger, some not even able to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, in the morning, while she is splashing water on her face, she sees a figure floating aimlessly down the river. It’s a meatskin, flailing about with slow movements, unable to right itself or keep its head above water, carried forward by the slow current—perhaps, she imagines, as far as to the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother time, in a clearing next to the tracks, they come across a pile of cremated human corpses. The brittle mass is higher than she is, and all the tangled, burnt limbs fused together and petrified into something resembling a black igloo. When the wind blows, the charred flakes of papery skin whip back and forth like tinsel. There are no signs of life anywhere, and she wonders what such a construction could mean out here away from the common flow of human discourse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the third afternoon, they are passed by a motorboat going upriver carrying ten or fifteen people, including two children who look at her through oversized sunglasses. The driver of the boat swings it around but does not cut the noisy motor. He waves to Temple, and she waves back. Then he does a dithering thumbs-up, thumbs-down gesture with his hand, questioning her status. She gives him a thumbs-up in return, and he signals back, circling his thumb and forefinger into an okay. Then he swings the boat back around and continues to drive it upriver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the day, the dry dust is kicked up under their feet, and they have to keep moving so it stays behind them. If they stop, the cloud of their own passage catches up to them, and they choke and cough and sputter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes they find caved-in shacks in overgrown clearings, and they search these for useful items and curiosities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt night she boils water in old cans she finds by the tracks. She adds berries and aromatic leaves she knows are not poisonous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiverwater, she says. It ain’t the elixir of the gods, but it goes down all right when you’re thirsty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes she sings to keep herself company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was light and like a fairy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd her shoes was number nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerring boxes without topses\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas sandals for that Clementine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrove her ducklins to the water\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery mornin just at nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHit her foot against a splinter,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFell into the foamin brine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby lips above the water,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlowin bubbles clear and fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut alas I weren’t no swimmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither was my Clementine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a churchyard near the canyon,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the murple do entwine,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrow some rosies and some posies,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFertilized by Clementine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my dreams she still doth haunt me,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobed in garments soaked with brine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she rises from the waters,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I kiss my Clementine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow I missed her, how I missed her,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow I missed my Clementine,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTill I kissed her little sister\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd forgot my Clementine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she laughs and laughs, kicking at the dry dirt with the toes of her shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet it, Maury? Clementine’s sister, she must be a peach!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clouds come, and then the rain, and the scorched earth swallows it through every pore. It could rain for days straight and never collect a puddle, so ashen and raw is the hard dirt they tread. They do not take shelter but continue to walk, liking the tonic feel of the droplets on their skin. She turns her face to the sky and sticks out her tongue and lets the rain trickle down her throat. The low tintamarre of thunder in the distance sounds like a medieval cannon reaching them not just over a stretch of miles but over a stretch of centuries—as though they are following the river back into their own primitive pasts. When it gets too close, the lightning turning the sky stark white for photographic instants, Maury begins to moan and refuses to move farther, his hands opening and closing on air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s okay, Maury, she says. That shivaree ain’t gonna hurt you. It’s just God makin a spectacle of himself at the marryin of earth and heaven. He’s gotta do it every now and then so we don’t forget who’s in charge. Come on, just keep your eyes on the tracks, and give a listen to my vocal melodies. I’ll sing you through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes him by the hand and the two march on, her voice carrying high and far into the gray sky above until the clouds pass and the sun shows through in long straight ribbons so clear and defined it looks like you could slide down them if there were a ladder that could reach that high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a big rock jutting out over the river, they lie flat on their backs and let their clothes dry out, and she feels the tickle of the droplets on her skin and it feels excruciating and delightful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you close your eyes and look at the sun, she explains to Maury, you can see the miniature animals that live on your eyeballs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she looks over, she sees Maury has fallen asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs and looks again at the receding clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lord, she says, a girl can sure enough cover some ground in this life. I bet I got places to go that I don’t even know exist yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT IS their fifth day walking when she hears the noise. At first she thinks it’s thunder again, but the sound lasts too long, it just keeps going, not like thunder or a crashing wave, the things of nature that break once and then sputter out. She reaches down and feels the steel rail with her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe best step to the side, Maury. This could be our ride if they ain’t a trainful of mutants—but I’m guessing the inheritors of the earth ain’t the ridin-the-rails type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes the gurkha knife from her sack and holds it behind her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould be trouble, she says, but truth be told my feet could use a break. Stand up straight, Maury, and try not to look so evil of portent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA diesel engine comes into view from the east followed by three boxcars, their doors slid open like the black maws of giant fish. It begins to slow immediately after coming around the bend, and when it stops it stops for her, the beast of steel and chain and grease inching to a halt on the tracks just feet from where she stands with Maury, its air brakes coughing and metal straining against metal—and she thinks of David and Goliath or other stories where the monster pauses and kneels down, its limbs creaking, to take the measure of its puny foe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grips the blade tighter behind her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe neither smiles nor frowns. She is aware of all the sounds around her, the chirping birds and the rippling of the river in the distance and the wind through the trees. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-reapers-are-the-angels-reapers-1/page-27.html","bookId":2516,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:20:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:20:50 PM"}
