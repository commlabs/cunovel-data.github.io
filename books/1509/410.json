It had been a sort of dagger, dark gold and about seven inches long. Seven jewels were affixed to it, and they each glimmered with a strange light. The brightest was the first one, and with the dagger moving so quickly it almost looked like nothing more than a streak of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, it was stopped in place about an inch from his nose. The air around him sizzled and a hundred thousand tiny daggers shimmered almost invisible in the air around him. He couldn’t move, he could hardly breathe. Any wrong move and those daggers could fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took gasping breathes, and in a quavering voice said, “I-I concede!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pharmacist lifted her hand, and the golden dagger obediently returned to her grasp. She walked away from the arena without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pair of eyes were carefully studying the fight. Constantine watched from the sidelines, quiet. As representative for the Pontiff’s Citadel he’d been given an important task – win champion for the glory of the Pontiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recent losses suffered by his compatriots lately was far too bitter, both in cost and reputation. The infiltration by Jue Di’s apprentice had undermined their authority terribly. It was just the people of the Holy City who were grumbling, but skeptical tones were coming from the Western government as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, the most important thing was to recover their standing among the Adept population. If he were able to come out with the crown, not only would the Pontiff look better but the earlier problems would quickly be forgotten. This was why his master made him come. He even let him bring the Spear of Fate. He knew his objective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere weren’t very many who could stand up to Constantine, as far as he could tell. But the Pharmacist was one of them – probably the strongest of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered the Pharmacist from when they met on the Avenue. She had left quite the impression. She looked so young, but commanded incredible power. The likely reason for that was evident by her abilities. She used skills passed down from Former Era China… skills that were most famously used by the second strongest Paragon alive, Celestial Master Qian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelestial Master Qian was the oldest known Paragon – he’d drawn breath for hundreds of years. Whether he was \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e alive was a matter of debate, but if he was that made him over four hundred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJue Di was considered strongest, but he and Celestial Master Qian had never really fought to see who was strongest. The reality was that no one really knew just how strong he was, many still thought that he was never second to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was customary to remove a Paragon’s name from the lists if they hadn’t been heard from in over a hundred years. The cut-off was drawing near for Celestial Master Qian. If he didn’t show himself within the next three years, then his name would be stricken from record.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConstantine was even more sure of his estimations once he saw the dagger. The Flying Daggers – was that not a skill old-time cultivators mastered? The story went that during a time of great prosperity for these hermits, their numbers swelled so high they could have swept across the world and taken it for their own. They were the strongest living beings on the planet. Jue Di was said to come from Former Era China, too. The Taiji skills he employed were likewise remnants from that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was right, then this was going to be a tricky fight. He wasn’t scared of her, especially not with the Spear of Fate. If the two of them ended up on the same field, it would be a toss-up who came out the victor, from what he could see. They’d have to see when they got there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did have to be careful, though. His people were already in trouble with one of Jue Di’s Disciples. He wouldn’t want to provoke one of Celestial Master Qian’s. That would prove messy. The Pontiff was strong, but even he couldn’t win a war on a dozen fronts. The most important thing for him was to find a way to deal with the situation, otherwise the Pontiff would never know peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not now. Now he had a job to do. The thoughts that troubled him passed away as he focused on the present. The first thing was to make the Citadel’s name mean something again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pharmacist walked away without any word or action. There was no honor in boasting over the defeat of a first rank contender. Like any other fight, she made her way back up to the VIP viewing platform to retrieve Jun’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she saw her daughter in the Gourmet’s arms, instead of with the Terminator like the last few days, she knew something wasn’t right. Her eyes hardened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gourmet, seeing the look in her eye, immediately shook his head to warn her off. Nothing’s wrong, the motion said, relax. And she did as she walked to the Gourmet’s side and took her little one back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you so much, Your Majesties, for looking after her.” She bowed politely to the two Paragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Terminator smiled at her. “You have quite the extraordinary daughter!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” She didn’t understand. Perhaps he was joking? “You’re too kind, Your Majesty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gourmet rose to his feet. “I’ll explain later,” he said. “Your Majesty, we’ll be heading back first.” He shot the Pharmacist a dire look then motioned for them to go. He followed behind protectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gourmet had a lot on his plate, and found it difficult to think of much else. Jun’er predictive powers were very important for the Avenue, and word had to be sent back right away. A reliable method had to be sought to bring the little one safely back. He also had to let the Clairvoyant know – he would tell them what to do about her future lineage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Terminator didn’t stop them, or make any effort to complicate things. If he were in their position he would do the same thing. The reason the gourmet hadn’t left upon immediately discovering her abilities was because the Pharmacist was still fighting. Now that her day was done, they had work to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, Lucifer and Metatron watched . They hadn’t seen what happened, but they knew something was going on. What would make the Gourmet take Jun’er back all of a sudden? What would make them so quick to leave? It was incredibly disrespectful to their host, the Terminator. However the Paragon didn’t seem bothered by it. Curiouser and curiouser, they thought – could the East and North be this close?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the three Avenue denizens left the sports arena, Lan Jue was waiting for them. He had already changed his clothes, and removed his mask. Qianlin remained inside to watch the fights, so as not to confuse or trouble Jun’er. It was very good for her to watch these powerful Adepts compete, since she’d just started to study combat herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon seeing the gourmet accompanying them, Lan Jue also had an inkling that something had happened. He didn’t say anything at first, and greeted them warmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re so great, daddy!” Jun’er swung her arms wide as Lan Jue picked her up, then draped them around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and bounced her a little on his waist. “So are you! What brings you out here, Gourmet? It seems wrong to leave so early… did the Terminator go as well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gourmet looked at him and shook his head. “Not here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis suspicions were confirmed. The Gourmet’s discreet bearing meant something had indeed happened. He didn’t press the Paragon any further as they returned to the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gourmet’s station was enough to demand the Presidential suit, which they now inhabited. They filed in, and he shut the door behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes became a boundless grey, and in that instant the whole room was submerged in a murky aura. Everything was muted, colors and sounds – Nether Isolation. Anyone passing by from outside would get the distinct sense of death hanging over the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue’s face was grave. “It’s this serious?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gourmet nodded adamantly. “It concerns the future of Skyfire Avenue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJun’er knew it, too. She was calm on the outside, and sat quietly on the sofa. Her eyes said something troubled her, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pharmacist was less reticent to speak. “What in the world is all of this about, Gourmet? Why are you and the Terminator acting so strange?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis caused the Infernal Vanguard to sigh. “You should thank your lucky stars Jun’er and the Terminator got on so well. All of this has to do with her. Unless we both were wrong – and I don’t think we are – then Jun’er’s Dsicipline has awakened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwakened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth the Pharmacist and Lan Jue were stunned at the revelation, and pleased. Both their faces bore smiles of delight. An awakened Discipline at five years old meant she would be very strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pharmacist immediately went to her daughter and gave her a hug. “But that can’t be the reason for such a big reaction from the two of you. There isn’t any Discipline that would make you so skittish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gourmet fixed her with his gaze. “What if it was a prophetic Discipline?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue’s eyes nearly popped out of his head. The Pharmacist looked at him with her mouth hanging wide open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pro…. Prophetic? So, like the Clairvoyant’s? Wha-…” The Pharmacist trailed off. Now she understood why the Terminator and the Gourmet were acting so strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruly prophetic beings were very rare in the realm of humanity. \u003cem\u003eExceedingly\u003c/em\u003e rare, but possible. The ones that did appear were usually half-prescient, like those who could commune with the spirit world. Fully prophetic abilities never really awakened before the age of twenty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJun’er wasn’t even six. If this was a full-prophetic Discipline awakening within her, it was completely unprecedented! By comparison, the Clairvoyant had been \u003cem\u003eten\u003c/em\u003e when his Discipline awoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-407\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-409\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-408","bookId":1509,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:07 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:07 AM"}
