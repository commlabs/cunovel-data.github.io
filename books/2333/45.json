One man dusted for prints, another bagged the clothes in the hamper, a third was going through the closet. In the bathroom, a man I didn\u0027t envy at all got to take up the shower drain and fish out a wad of hair and unidentifiable crud, all of which went into a plastic bag, and not a moment too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said it right there,\" Wentworth said. \"The bit about tossing the Kleenex into the bucket. Maybe he wiped away prints, maybe he took back his hundred bucks, but do you think he went through her scum bucket looking for the wad he just shot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow I doubt it,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to him,\" he said, \"he shot a big load. Oughta be enough DNA to convict him six times over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said it was satisfying,\" I said, \"but something else within him was entirely untouched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the system\u0027s done with him,\" he said, \"my guess is he won\u0027t be able to make that claim. I want to get an all-points out, and you know what we don\u0027t have? A picture of the son of a bitch. He\u0027s got an ego the size of Montana, how come he hasn\u0027t got any pictures of himself anywhere in the place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he figures everybody knows what he looks like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you? Know what he looks like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but the building staff must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a point. Have to get a description from the doorman, sit him down with a police artist. That way the papers can print something that won\u0027t look a bit like him, but what the hell. You got any idea where we\u0027ll find him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know his name until earlier today. I couldn\u0027t even have proved he existed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess that\u0027s a no, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d watch the Hollander house,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got men there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? The authorization came through?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a face. \"I called in, told them to assign a couple of uniforms to sit in a car and stake the place out. If anybody approaches the house, they\u0027re to stop him and question him. As soon as I\u0027ve got a description I\u0027ll give it to them, narrow it down a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good,\" I said, \"but tell them not to go inside the house. There\u0027s a man in there who\u0027ll take their heads off if they try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Hollander house,\" he said. \"Where else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had a place in the Village,\" I said, \"on Broadway, but he got out of there when he moved in here. He left owing a lot of back rent. I don\u0027t think he\u0027d be crazy enough to try going back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He got a girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had one at the massage parlor,\" someone else chimed in, \"and look what happened to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about this house in Brooklyn?\" Wentworth said. \"Anything there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coney Island,\" somebody said, and Dan Schering said, \"No, Coney Island Avenue. House itself is in Flatbush somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More like Midwood,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to buy it,\" Wentworth said. \"I\u0027m just wondering if the son of a bitch is likely to use it for a bolt-hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s rented,\" I said, \"as of the first of the month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s empty now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be a place for him to hole up,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a cop I talked with out there named Iverson,\" I said. \"At the Seventieth Precinct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody should call him,\" Wentworth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give him a call,\" somebody said. \"Which precinct was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Seven-oh,\" Wentworth said. \"Is that right, Matt? The Seven-oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that station house,\" one of the Homicide cops said. \"That\u0027s on Lawrence Avenue, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I met him at the location.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, the Seven-oh,\" he said. \"Ugly-looking station house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" Schering said, \"that\u0027d make it the only one of its kind in the five boroughs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWentworth said, \"The boyfriend. You mentioned something about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the others said, \"This asshole\u0027s got a boyfriend? Then what\u0027s he doing in a massage parlor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Breit,\" Wentworth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bright at all,\" the other said. \"Fucking stupid, you ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the perp who had the boyfriend,\" Wentworth said. \"Are you pulling my chain or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would I do that, Ira?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All day long,\" Wentworth said. To me he said, \"Hollander had a boyfriend, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Broke up over a year ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said something about counseling, that that\u0027s how Breit met her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s still counseling the boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"He might go there,\" I said. \"It\u0027s out by Bushwick Terminal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone wanted to know why anyone in his right mind would go there, and someone else said Breit wasn\u0027t exactly in his right mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Maybe you already did this, but why not station somebody downstairs next to the doorman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWentworth nodded. \"Right. Because the most likely place for Breit to turn up is right here, and it would be nice if someone would point him out to us when he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not difficult to buy a hunting knife in New York City.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s very difficult, prohibitively so, to buy a gun. You need a permit, and that\u0027s not the easiest thing in the world to obtain, and you need to show two pieces of photo ID along with the permit. A knife is easier, because the movement for knife control has not made much headway. There are, he learns, certain kinds of knives you can\u0027t purchase, because they\u0027re illegal. Switchblades, for instance, or gravity knives. It\u0027s possible, however, to buy a knife which can be converted into a switchblade, and the same dealer who sells it to you can also sell you a simple kit with which you can make the conversion. That\u0027s evidently legal- but, should you use the kit and convert the knife, you\u0027re then subject to arrest for possessing an illegal weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA switchblade is illegal because, just by pressing a button, you can convert it into a weapon. But a regular hunting knife that doesn\u0027t fold to begin with already is a weapon. You don\u0027t even have to press a button. But it\u0027s legal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, you can\u0027t carry it on your person if the blade is over a certain number of inches in length. Then it\u0027s a deadly weapon. You can buy it, and play mumblety-peg with it in the privacy of your own home, or take it in the woods with you to skin out big game. But if you carry it around within city limits, you\u0027re breaking the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is breaking the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knife is a Bowie-type, ten inches overall, with a six-inch blade. The handle is wrapped in dark brown leather, and the sheath that comes with it is of black leather reinforced with steel. The design tooled into the sheath shows two crossed flags, one the stars and stripes, the other the Confederate stars and bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheath is now attached to his belt, and as he walks along, his arm at his side, he can feel its comforting presence. His jacket is long enough to conceal it, but it\u0027s easy to reach under his jacket, easy to get his hand on the handle. There\u0027s a little strap that snaps closed, securing the knife, but he can leave it unsnapped if he wants, to make it that much easier to get at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a beautiful piece of workmanship. The manufacturer is located in Birmingham, Alabama, and much is made of this in the article\u0027s packaging. The clerk at the sporting goods store made a point of telling him the knife was American-made. Are the best knives those made in America? Or is it that customers for hunting knives like to support American industry?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t know, or much care. It pleases him to have the knife, even as it pleased him to have the gun. Long before he was ready to use it, almost from the day he took it from that Freudian idiot\u0027s desk, he\u0027d enjoyed carrying it concealed on his person, in a pocket or wedged under his belt, where he could touch it whenever he felt like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s very satisfying, walking about armed, carrying a concealed weapon. You know something no one knows. You\u0027re empowered, secretly empowered. Sitting in a subway car, you look at the man opposite you, knowing you can draw your gun and shoot him dead and there\u0027s nothing, nothing at all, that he can do about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, in a darkened movie theater, he\u0027d taken out the gun and pointed it at the back of the neck of the person sitting directly in front of him. Bang, he\u0027d thought to himself, and put the gun back in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he finally got to use the gun, on that fool Bierman, he\u0027d anticipated the moment a thousand times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where shall he go now, with his beautiful new knife? He has the whole day to himself, to use as he wishes. Shall he collect his car from the garage and go for a ride in the country? Go home, stretch out, curl up with a good book?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could return to the house. His house, his future home. The giant, the Irish thug, must have moved on by now. If not, he can see how the man does against six inches of steel, honed to razor sharpness and hardened to 400 on the Rockwell scale, whatever that\u0027s supposed to mean. It\u0027s evidently a selling point, as the manufacturer trumpeted it on the box and the salesman troubled to point it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt it means it\u0027s hard, as you\u0027d expect steel to be. He imagines the big man dismissing him, telling him to fuck off, then the green eyes widening at the sight of the knife in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, he thinks, perhaps not. A knife blade, whatever its numerical degree of hardness, might snap like a twig against that one\u0027s rough hide. More to the point, he can envision the man\u0027s hand darting out, quick as a cat, and taking the knife away from him…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants to try it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a restaurant where he eats a sandwich and drinks a cup of coffee, he locks himself in the men\u0027s room and practices drawing the knife, practices thrusting at an imaginary opponent. There\u0027s a mirror, and he can watch himself as he goes through his moves. It seems to him that he has a natural feeling for the weapon. He\u0027d been quick to master the gun (and, the job finished, sick at the thought of abandoning it) but it seemed to him that there was nothing to learn with the knife, or, more accurately, that his knowledge of the weapon was intuitive and innate, dormant and unsuspected for years, activated the moment he took the thing in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps he\u0027d been a knife fighter in a previous life. Perhaps he\u0027d been Jim Bowie himself, the man who\u0027d invented the damn thing. Died at the Alamo, didn\u0027t he? Went out in a blaze of glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a favorite knife in his hand? Why not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone tries the door. It\u0027s locked. And if it were open? A man walks in, starts to apologize, sees the knife, tries to back away…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he sees himself wiping the blade on the man\u0027s shirt, returning it to the sheath, and walking coolly out of the bathroom, drawing the door shut after him. Walking past the balding Korean attendant, down the stairs…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that was earlier, that was at the massage parlor. He\u0027s in a restaurant now, he\u0027s just eaten, just gone to the bathroom, and it\u0027s time to pay the check and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the street, he tells himself it was just imagination, that\u0027s all. A fantasy sideslipping into a memory. Nothing untoward in that, nothing to be alarmed about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what? Another massage parlor? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hope-to-die-matthew-scudder-15/page-45.html","bookId":2333,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:14 AM"}
