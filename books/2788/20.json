As he opened the passenger door, he pointed at my cheek. \"You have a little something there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat, misplaced lipstick? White residue from the blemish cream I was too old to need? I wiped at the spot. \"Did I get it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and leaned close. \"Oh, I see. It\u0027s a kiss.\" He pressed his lips against my face, butterfly soft, and we giggled in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too cheesy?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little, but I\u0027ll take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me again before I slid into the car. My kids were with Richard for the weekend and so I was free and easy for the next few days. Heavy on the easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I waited for Des to get in on his side, something sparkled on the floor. I reached over and picked it up. It was an earring. A nagging stir of deja moo passed over me. You know, that feeling of having experienced this bullshit before?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to find random stuff in Richard\u0027s car all the time, like matchbooks to restaurants I\u0027d never been to, loose strands of long, blonde hair, half-finished fast-food drinks with lipstick on the straw, and once I even found a condom wrapper. Richard told me a prankster-friend had put a Trojan on his stick shift just to be funny. Yeah, ha ha, very funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied the earring in silence as Des adjusted his seat and flipped down the visor. I stared at it as if it might evaporate if I wished hard enough. It was distinct, with colored glass beads and coiled wire. It wasn\u0027t stylish. In fact, it was hideous. And it was most definitely not mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the keys in the ignition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held up the earring. \"Whose is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me in surprise, glancing at the earring, then back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um...isn\u0027t it yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held it closer to his face, raising a quizzical brow. \"Does this look like one I\u0027d wear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked bewildered, as if it were a trick question. As if I\u0027d asked, \"Does this earring make me look fat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um...I guess not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then whose is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fussed with putting the car into gear. \"Oh, I picked it up in your driveway the other day and thought it must be Dody\u0027s. I kept forgetting to ask her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at the earring. Yes, it looked very much like some monstrosity she might wear. His explanation made perfect sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give it to her.\" I slipped it into my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Hey, how\u0027s Penny doing with everything? Is she feeling good?\" He backed the car up with a bit of a lurch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She feels OK. She\u0027s tired.\" I had told Des about Penny\u0027s pregnancy even though she\u0027d sworn me to secrecy. I knew he wouldn\u0027t say anything since he\u0027d likely never meet her. I\u0027d also told Fontaine, although completely by accident. He was as tricky as my mother when it came to interrogation techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they going to find out if it\u0027s a boy or girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they want to be surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. That\u0027s good. Do they have names yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. Why all the questions about Penny\u0027s baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes smiled over at me. \"No reason. Just making conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ate dinner at Arno\u0027s, where Jasper worked. Then we strolled along the Bell Harbor boardwalk, holding hands and leaning into one another until we found a divey little patio bar with live music. It overlooked the beach and was the perfect setting for whatever the night had in store. The tables were tiny. Our knees bumped underneath, giving me goose bumps as I anticipated them bumping again later on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sipped cocktails and talked about inconsequential things, like who invented daylight savings time and how weird was the musical Cats. I mean, seriously? It\u0027s a musical. About cats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him how, when we were little, Penny wanted to conserve energy way before it was trendy, so I would sneak around the house turning on random lights to annoy her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes replied, \"Bonnie and I were keen on blowing things up. Once we blew up a couch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You blew up a couch? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was lazy. \"It was there. We were bored. It was this beat-up old couch that somebody was throwing away, so we dragged it up to the top of a hill. And then we blew it up. Robin ratted us out though. She was always the tattler. My mum hit the roof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not imagine what my mother would have done under those circumstances. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes tapped his lips thoughtfully. \"Oh, let\u0027s see. I had to clean the garage, wash the car, scrub the kitchen, walk the dog...pretty much all the stuff she\u0027d been bugging me to do anyway. But I also had to confess to my dad. That was the real punishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is that?\" Again, hard to imagine, since I grew up with virtually no father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did not want to make my father mad, so I was petrified. I dragged my sorry ass into his office like a dead man walking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what did he do?\" I stretched out my leg, brushing against his calf oh so accidentally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flickered, thrilling me with my ability to distract him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He laughed. The engineer in him thought we were very clever, but he still put me under house arrest for about a week, and Mum kept me working like a dog. She always punished us with housework. Maybe that\u0027s why I\u0027m kind of a slob now. I subconsciously equate cleaning with getting in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I equate cleaning with a sense of world domination, like putting everything in its proper place grants me ultimate control over the universe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a big gulp from his drink. \"I think that\u0027s scarier than blowing stuff up. Hey, want to dance?\" he asked as the band started playing something slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s think. Would I like to press myself up against him, swaying back and forth while everyone whispered what a beautiful couple we made? That could be fun. \"Yes, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was right. It was fun. I don\u0027t know if anyone bothered to whisper about us, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. \"You\u0027re mighty light on your feet, Dr. McKnight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I?\" He sounded pleased. \"I have a confession to make. Bonnie and I took some lessons before she got married. Since our dad wasn\u0027t there she asked me to fill in. But she thought we should practice so we didn\u0027t embarrass ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that is so sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Every lesson we fought like cats and dogs. Nearly killed each other. Worst experience ever.\" His big smile said otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed against him. \"Well, for what it\u0027s worth, I\u0027m glad you practiced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me even closer, spinning us around and looking smug. \"I guess I\u0027m glad now too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he kissed me, right there in front of all the good people of Bell Harbor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have another confession.\" His voice was low, melting into my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" I asked, breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought about you all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" A delicious warmth started in my middle and spread out in every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Let\u0027s go to my place and I\u0027ll prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder rumbled. Rain pelted. The morning was gray and dismal, but I had sunshine on the inside. A sheer curtain swirled around in a sensual, film-noir way in Des\u0027s bedroom. We must have left the sliding door open in our haste to disrobe one another. I slipped from the bed, not wanting to wake him up. I liked to sneak into the bathroom, tidy my hair, and scrape the goop from my eyes, then slip back into bed so he\u0027d think I woke up looking fresh as a daisy. Beauty might be in the eye of the beholder, but a little primping never did any harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spruced up as best as I could, considering my purse and most of my clothes were in the other room. I had no beauty products and no secret techniques. I squirted toothpaste in my mouth and swished it around. My hair was a train wreck, and I was pretty sure that was a hickey on my neck, but there wasn\u0027t much to be done about that. I quietly flipped off the bathroom light and eased open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusted. Des gave me a lazy smile from the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ducked back behind the door, all except my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning.\" I remained still, not about to saunter out there in the broad light of day. Well, in this case it was the murky light of day, but still too bright for me to parade around in my altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, would you...close your eyes?\" I asked hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have anything on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why on earth would I close my eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m shy. I\u0027m embarrassed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes was beyond amused, folding both arms behind his head. \"That\u0027s ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it isn\u0027t. Come on, I feel like an idiot. Close your eyes.\" He was being annoying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get that I see people all the time without their clothes, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it shouldn\u0027t be a hardship to not look at me, you pervert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You also get that I\u0027ve seen you naked quite few times and enjoyed it plenty, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was lying down most of those times, and it was dark. This is different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter was deep. \"You\u0027re seriously not coming out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, because I\u0027m naked, and you\u0027re all covered up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that the problem?\" He flipped off the covers, proving he was as absent of clothing as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, my.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There, now we\u0027re even. Do you feel better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away, blushing furiously. I was a good girl deep down, and good girls avert their eyes when men expose themselves. But I wasn\u0027t that good, so about half a second later I looked again. He was stretched out, shamelessly comfortable, his skin dark against the white sheet. He patted the mattress playfully. \"Come on,\" he said, like he was talking to one of Dody\u0027s dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI weighed my options quickly. I couldn\u0027t very well spend the rest of the day in the bathroom. Eventually I\u0027d have to come out, and unless I fashioned a toga out of bath towels, I was going to have to do it naked. He\u0027d won this round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, sir, are no gentleman.\" I straightened my shoulders and stepped from behind the door, watching his expression change from lighthearted teasing to something else entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmm, maybe I had won this round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spent the next hour in bed, exploring the merits of nudity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, we spent nearly that entire day in bed, lying around, pillow talking, laughing, having fun not talking. We ate toaster waffles and microwave popcorn. We watched movies, took a bath in the Jacuzzi, fooled around some more, then took a nap. The food was not good, the movies were plotless and pointless, and I had the best day of my life. Doing nothing with Des was more fun than doing almost anything with anybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should probably head home,\" I said reluctantly from the couch as our date neared the twenty-four-hour mark. I was wearing a pair of Des\u0027s scrub pants, which were a foot too long, and one of his T-shirts. My hair was an unholy mess, and I craved my toothbrush with the intensity of Scooby longing for his Scooby snacks. Des was opening cupboards in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head popped into view. \"Got plans tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I thought you might be getting sick of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am. I can\u0027t stand the way you keep letting me pull off all your clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed. \"These are your clothes. Anyway, I thought I\u0027d played hard-to-get long enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shut a cupboard. \"Um, when were you playing hard-to-get?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up. \"Oh, now I am leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came out from the kitchen and pulled me close. \"You know I\u0027m just kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadie, don\u0027t go home,\" he murmured against my ear. \"Stay and have macaroni and cheese with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you can seduce me with carbs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d offer you something better, but it\u0027s about the only food I have. That and a jar of olives. But if you stay, you can pick out the next movie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a persuasive devil, offering carbs and B-list entertainment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am dying to brush my teeth. I need my toothbrush,\" I admitted fervently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Can\u0027t you just use mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yuck. That is disgusting. I really need to freshen up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I go back to work tomorrow for the next five nights. Are you going to send me off to the trenches with no kisses?\" He might have been begging me to stay for purely sexual reasons, but honestly, that was OK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve given you a thousand kisses. But tell you what...I\u0027ll go home and change my clothes and such and then come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed my nose. \"Perfect. I\u0027ll run to the store and grab a couple things to eat, and we can meet back here. I\u0027ll leave the front door unlocked in case you get back before me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDes dropped me off at Dody\u0027s on his way to buy groceries. I strolled in wearing his clothes and carrying my own in a plastic sack. I was pure class. Fontaine was sketching at the kitchen island while Jasper chopped peppers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, guys. Where\u0027s Dody?\" I dropped my baggie of clothes in a chair and plucked an apple from the fruit bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s at the Christopher Walken Film Festival with Harry,\" Jasper answered. \"Nice threads, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I mumbled, my mouth full of apple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you go to dinner last night, hoho?\" Fontaine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arno\u0027s. And tonight we\u0027re cooking at Des\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you been there for, like, a day and a half? Way to get back on that pony, cowgirl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Hey, Jas, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. There\u0027s something I wanted to show you.\" I ran up to my room, grabbed the little black velvet box I\u0027d brought back from Glenville, and trotted down to the kitchen. I was lightning fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the box in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper studied it as if it were a bomb to be diffused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" He picked up a towel and dried his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine stared at the box just as hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been thinking. I know you want that one ring for Beth and you don\u0027t have the cash for it. But if you take this one, you can trade it and probably get some cash back too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper\u0027s face looked like I\u0027d told him I was a cyborg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on. Open it,\" I urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the box and slowly eased it open. \"Sadie, you can\u0027t give me this! This ring is huge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"I know. But I don\u0027t need it. I don\u0027t want it. And I\u0027ll never make a necklace out of it because it will always remind me of Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine grabbed the ring from Jasper and held it up to the light, making it shimmer and glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you trade it in and get something else, but I can\u0027t take it.\" Jasper shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t need more jewelry, Jas. And you do. I would love for you to take this thing off my hands. You know I can\u0027t stand having stuff lying around that no one is using. It\u0027s clutter to me. But if it makes you and Beth happy, then I\u0027ll feel good too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine handed the ring back to his brother. \"That\u0027s a pretty good deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper looked back and forth between us and the ring. \"Do they even do that? Take trade-ins, I mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine nodded. \"I\u0027m sure they would at Mason\u0027s jewelry. I\u0027ve bought vintage stuff from there before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDody\u0027s Tweety Bird clock chimed in the hallway as I waited for his answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you absolutely certain, Sadie?\" Jasper asked solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was. It was the right thing to do. \"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper closed the box and hugged me as if we were about to jump from a plane and I had the only parachute. His voice cracked. \"Thanks.\" Then he strode from the room, muffling a sniffle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFontaine smiled at me, shaking his head. \"Sugarplum, I had no idea you could be so magnanimous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back. \"And I had no idea you knew what magnanimous meant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arrived back at Des\u0027s before him. I puttered around, tidying things up, washing the few dishes in the sink, arranging the sofa pillows, making the bed, and lining up all his shoes, which had been strewn in one big pile by the front door. Stacks of unopened mail were scattered around the kitchen and eating area. I couldn\u0027t resist. I sorted it all, putting the magazines in one pile, the junk mail in another, and whatever looked important into a third. I put the tidy stacks on the kitchen counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked in as I finished. \"Hi there.\" He glanced around, taking in my handiwork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, I realized I had been presumptuous again. Maybe he liked his shoes in a pile and his mail littered through every room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe set the grocery bags on the counter next to the crisply folded dishtowels. \"You\u0027ve been busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit my lip. \"I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s a habit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be sorry.\" He picked up the top magazine. \"Hmm, when did I get this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re in chronological order, oldest to most recent.\" My compulsion knew no boundaries. Let\u0027s put it all out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his fingertips against the counter and smiled. \"Let me guess. You have all the clothes in your closet arranged by color, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t everybody?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled wider still. \"My sister Robin is the same way. She\u0027s going to love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment hung suspended. He had broken the cardinal rule. Everyone knew it was bad luck to mention meeting a family member this early in a relationship. Almost as bad as saying \"I love you\" too soon. You know, premature love declaration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile faded as fast as it came. He turned to fuss with the bags while I restacked the perfectly stacked mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s for - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spaghetti,\" he answered before I finished the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpooning that night like a little old couple drifting off to sleep, I pondered the state of this union and fought back sadness. The summer was passing by. Des and I had very deliberately not discussed me going back to Glenville or where his next assignment might be. I knew the offer of an extended stay in Bell Harbor was on the table for him, but since he hadn\u0027t brought it up, neither had I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reality was this lovely affair was a detour, not a destination. Sooner than I wanted, I\u0027d be back to my real life and he\u0027d ride off into the sunset for his next grand adventure. We knew that from the start, so it would be childish to wish it was any other way. Right? There wasn\u0027t any way around it. We\u0027d been living in a bubble, pretending there was a future. But there wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Des?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fun being with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed my middle, mumbling in near sleep, \"You too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, I woke up before him, wisely grabbing his shirt from the floor and putting it on. Getting caught naked yesterday had turned out well enough, but I was still modest. I flipped on the bathroom light, and my heart gave a hop, a skip, and a flutter. Resting on the counter next to Des\u0027s was a brand new toothbrush. It had a little dental floss bow tied around it so I\u0027d know it was for me. That was about the cutest thing ever. He bought me a toothbrush. I picked it up reverently, as if it were Cinderella\u0027s glass slipper. This meant a lot to me, and not because of my meticulous attention to dental hygiene. This toothbrush was special because it meant he wanted me to come back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crazy-little-thing-bell-harbor-1/page-20.html","bookId":2788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:33:52 PM"}
