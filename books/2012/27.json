She must have given the ragged reaper a bubbly bath the day her time came, a hair-wash, a cave mouth’s spring run-off of black, stinking phlegm just gushing out, aye. Big women had a way, didn’t they? Especially after their fourth or fifth decade, when all their opinions had turned to stone and chipped flinty enough to draw blood with a single glance or sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d moved like a tree, her mother had, and just as shocking to see, too. After all, trees don’t walk much, not on a sober night, just like the earth didn’t move unless Burn was pitching or the man was better than he knew (and how rare was that?). Loomed, old Ma did, like midnight thunder. Death was a crowded chamber for women like her, and the crowd was the kind that parted with her first step into the room: a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasan Gilani wiped at her face – no sweat left. Bad news, especially this early in the morning. ‘I wanted to be big, Ma. I wanted to reach that ripe old age. Fifty, aye. Five bitching, rutting, terror-inspiring decades. I wanted to loom . Thunder in my eyes, thunder in my voice, a thing of great weights and inexorable masses. It ain’t fair, me withering away out here. Dal Hon, do you miss me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The day I set foot on that grassy sward, the day I shoo the first mob of flies from my lips and nostrils and eyes, why, that’s the day all will be right with the world once again. No, don’t leave me to die here, Dal Hon. It ain’t fair.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe coughed, squinted ahead. Something of a mess up there, those two rises, the valley sprawled in between. Holes in the ground. Craters? The slopes seemed to be swarming. She blinked, wondering if she was imagining that. Deprivation played nasty games, after all. Swarming – it was swarming all right. Rats? No. ‘Orthen.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA field of battle. She caught the gleam of picked bones, took note of ashy mounds on the far ridge, from pyres, no doubt. Sound practice, burning the dead, she knew. Kept disease to a minimum. She kicked her horse into a heavy canter. ‘I know, I know, not for long, sweetie.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dust devils whirled out past her now, spinning towards a ridge overlooking the valley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasan Gilani rode after them, to the top of the crest. There she reined in, scanning the wreckage filling the valley, and then the gaping entrenchments slashing across the opposite ridge, beyond which rose the humps of burned bones. Dread slowly seeped in, stealing all the day’s heat from her bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe T’lan Imass of the Unbound solidified in a rough line on her right, also studying the scene. Their sudden appearance after so many days of dust was strangely comforting to Masan Gilani. She’d only had her horse for company for far too long now. ‘Not that I’ll kiss any of you,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeads turned to regard her. None spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank Hood for that . ‘My horse is dying,’ she announced. ‘And whatever happened here happened to my Bonehunters and it doesn’t look good. So,’ she added, now glaring at the five undead warriors, ‘if you have any good news to tell me, or, gods below, any explanation at all, I really might kiss you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one named Beroke said, ‘We can answer your horse’s plight, human.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good,’ she snapped, dismounting. ‘Get to it. And a little water and grub for yours truly wouldn’t go amiss either. I won’t be eating orthen any more, just so you know. Who ever thought crossing a lizard with a rat was a good idea?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other T’lan Imass stepped out from the line. She couldn’t recall this one’s name, but it was bigger than the others and looked to be composed of body parts from three, maybe four individuals. ‘K’Chain Nah’ruk,’ it said in a low voice. ‘A battle and a harvest.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Harvest?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature pointed at the distant mounds. ‘They butchered. They fed upon their fallen enemy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasan Gilani shivered. ‘Cannibals?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Nah’ruk are not human.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That makes a difference? To me it’s cannibalism. Only white-skinned barbarians from the Fenn Mountains sink so low as to eat other people. Or so I hear.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They did not complete their feeding,’ said the oversized T’lan Imass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What do you mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘See the newborn mountain to the north?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ she drawled, ‘never noticed it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all studied her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Masan said, ‘Aye, the mountain. The storm.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Another battle,’ said Beroke. ‘An Azath was born. From this, we conclude that the Nah’ruk were defeated.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-27.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
