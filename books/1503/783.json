This was especially so for those original soldiers of the old Heavenly Bow Empire. To them, they had waited for this day for too long, way too long.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThree thousand figures rose up silently into the night sky. Under cover of the darkness, they flew towards the Kalise and Bai Da army encampments surrounding the Heavenly Bow City.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAmongst the ten thousand Peerless Army elites, the Peerless Archers numbered five thousand. Zhou Weiqing had already brought away two thousand of them, and the remaining three thousand had now been gathered together by Ming Yu.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEver since they returned to the Heavenly Bow Empire, the Peerless Archers’ flying capabilities had never been displayed in the battlefield. The main reason was exactly because it was being saved to be the critical factor to defeat their enemies in this final battle.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThree thousand figures, hidden in the night skies, soon rose to around a thousand metres height. At this point, let alone it being night time, even if it was in the day, as long as they were not looking specifically for it, it would be extremely difficult to detect them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMing Yu’s second order soon passed down. “First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Power Archer Battalions, prepare! Peerless Heavy Cavalry, Snow Deer Cavalry, move out. First, Second Heavy Cavalry Regiments, advance.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMing Yu had gained quite some inspiration from Zhou Weiqing, and towards the Heavenly Bow Empire armies, he had mainly focused on true quality over quantity. Although in such a short period of time he could not possibly develop their forces to the same level as the Peerless Regiment, with the support of Zhou Weiqing’s massive wealth and the resource support from the Fei Li Empire and ZhongTian Empire, it could be said that the current Heavenly Bow Empire armies were armed to the teeth.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe so-called Power Archer Battalions were not just simply equipped with normal longbows, but powerful, well-crafted\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePurple Dawn Bows.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFurthermore, each one of these archers were also prepared with a hand crossbow. As soon as they entered any fight, their hand crossbows would be prepared with a bolt. No matter if it was for self protection or offense, it would greatly improve these archers’ overall combat prowess.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThese archers were also armoured with leather; in a battlefield such defenses might not seem to amount to much, but if they were supported with Heavy Infantry soldiers and Cavalry soldiers, that was a different matter altogether.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the Heavenly Bow Empire, the military branch that lacked the least was definitely archers… after all, it was the Heavenly Bow Empire! As such, out of the entire over dozen Regiments in the army, Ming Yu had specially chosen the finest five thousand to form the five Power Archer Battalions. Besides them, there were still five entire Regiments of Archers, numbering about a third of the entire army. Of course, the other formations of troops were also well trained elite warriors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the current Heavenly Bow Empire, there wasn’t a true ‘light-armoured’ infantry, and they only had one type of infantry soldiers - Heavy Infantry. In fact, these Heavy Infantry soldiers were also outfitted with their own horses, to ensure their movement speed in the battlefield. Of course, their training was still different from the Heavy Cavalry soldiers, and their horses were not armoured.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs for light cavalry and heavy cavalry, that was Ming Yu’s speciality after all. With the Peerless Regiment leading the others, the actual formation and training was not difficult at all. Of course, having steady and abundant supplies was of utmost importance, otherwise Ming Yu could not have possibly formed such a powerful army in such a short period of time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe entire Heavenly Bow Empire armies had already made their move according to Ming Yu’s arrangements, advancing along in neat formations. Although they were all currently excited and in high morales, none of them dared to charge forward foolishly and break ranks. This was the effect of military disciple.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the air, the three thousand figures had already slowly reached their goal. Ming Yu had his head lifted as he constantly watched them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Kalise and Bai Da Empire armies had already long since been alerted by the commotion deep in the city. Their commander was no fool, and he knew that since the Heavenly Bow Empire Royal Palace seemed to have met with some problems, it was likely that the Heavenly Bow Empire armies would act soon. He had quickly roused all of his soldiers from their rest and organized them in their own formations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlas, in the end one side had been fully prepared, while the other was rushing to prepare. The difference was indeed clear. Furthermore, who else could have expected that the Heavenly Bow Empire armies would actually attack so swiftly. Their threat had been given for quite some time, and the Heavenly Bow Empire armies had remained quiet for so long. All of this had happened without any warning at all.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAbruptly, large patches of black, foul smelling objects fell from the skies.

In the first place, the Stars Forest was not large, and these forces were all arranged to protect the Heavenly Bow City.

In such a moment, most of the soldiers had only just woken up and received their orders, preparing to gather in their defensive formations. Alas, it was all too late.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was inherent human nature to be afraid of death, and such a sudden huge blaze caused these soldiers who were still drowsy from sleep to go into panic. They weren’t specially elite soldiers; the Bai Da Empire soldiers were still relatively better, but on the Kalise Empire side, they had fallen into absolute terror and panic. In a short time, the entire camp was filled with shouts and screams as trampling, burning… the entire camp had turned into disorderly chaos.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Kill!” On the other side, Ming Yu’s cold voice rang out.
