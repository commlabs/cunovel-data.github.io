As the weeks passed and the days grew warmer, I heard no more about contacting the ancient Egyptian necromancer-which was perfectly agreeable to me. But I still worried about the growing threat to my brother and the rest of the members of the Order. Dariya did not believe me when I said there was nothing useful in A Necromancer\u0027s Companion-though I had casually admitted to her that the book had been given to me by Princess Cantacuzene. Dariya had barely blinked an eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow the book must hold the key to stopping all of this madness,\" Dariya said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the princess is the one behind the undead army, then why would she give me a book that shows how to defeat them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDariya looked back at the book. \"What if she didn\u0027t know what spells were in there? And how would she know you would be able to use any of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not answer her question. My cousin was clever, and she was close to figuring out my secret. But I was afraid of losing her friendship once she knew. I took the book out of her hands and closed it. \"Besides, the Companion is nothing but parlor tricks and ancient myths.\" But even as I said it, I knew it wasn\u0027t true. The magic of the sheult spell was old, powerful magic. It felt old when the spell settled around me. It even tasted like old magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it frightened me that I had mastered the spell easily when Dariya could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTired of my cousin\u0027s relentless prodding, I once again reread A Necromancer\u0027s Companion and found a passage about Ankh-al-Sekhem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell-known for his ability to raise an army of undead soldiers for his country\u0027s protection during the thirteenth dynasty, he fell out of favor with the Egyptian court. He had attempted to bring a powerful but long-dead pharaoh back to life with an artifact called the Talisman of Isis. But when he released the dead pharaoh\u0027s soul trapped within the talisman, the necromancer was killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took twelve of the kingdom\u0027s most powerful magicians to return the lich pharaoh to the land of the dead. There was a picture of the talisman, shaped like the goddess Isis holding a large black stone above her head, her wings stretched out on either side of her. I shuddered, thankful we\u0027d not gone through with the seance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had to be another way to find the answers we needed. Once the Lenten fast and Easter were over, we had a visitor at Betskoi House: Anya\u0027s brother Rudolf. He had completed his medical school training in Kiev and was about to begin his internship in St. Petersburg. He and Lyudmila were to be married that weekend. Maman and I helped Anya and Lyudmila with the wedding preparations. Papa kept Rudolf in his study for hours discussing the latest in medical breakthroughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePapa and Rudolf argued over the cause of infections in wounded soldiers. Papa believed it due to physicians not washing their hands between patients. Rudolf said it was caused by flies and other insects that crawled over the soldiers. I had to admit both scenarios seemed likely. I asked Rudolf if he had ever met Louis Pasteur, and he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard the doctor deliver a lecture in Paris last year about bacteria in the blood. It was fascinating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask him if he\u0027d ever seen corpses reanimate, but decided it was not proper dinner table conversation. It would have to wait, I thought sadly. Besides, Papa kept plying poor Rudolf with a million questions, inviting him to use his medical library anytime. He also issued Rudolf an invitation to join his institute for experimental medicine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would be honored, Your Highness,\" Rudolf said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the morning of the wedding, Lyudmila\u0027s mother came to the house with a basket of fresh-baked wedding bread and other treats from their family\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebakery in Kiev. The quiet ceremony took place in the small St. Katerina Cathedral, with the young bride wearing a simple white gown with a lace collar and a lace veil that had belonged to her grandmother. Maman lent her a pair of diamond-and-pearl earrings, and I gave her my best pair of gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyudmila\u0027s little sisters looked sweet as pink-clad attendants strewing rose petals everywhere, and Anya was her maid of honor, crowned with a wreath of daisies in her hair. Anya cried harder than Lyudmila\u0027s own mother during the ceremony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small party was held afterward in our garden. Lyudmila\u0027s family had hired a Gypsy band to play, and we danced several folk dances, such as the matryoshka, in addition to a more formal polonaise and mazurka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe food was simple as well : fresh-baked breads and cold meats, fresh fruits and sorbets. Maman served a sweet spiced punch made with wine from her own family\u0027s French vineyards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpring was coming to life in St. Petersburg. Everything was starting to awaken out of the cold, sleeping earth. Including things that should have remained deep asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrincess Cantacuzene had told me of the folk tales that said vampires rose out of the earth in the spring and stalked the living between those two holy days: St. Yuri\u0027s Day in April and St. Andrew\u0027s Day in November. But I knew now that this was just a silly superstition. They stalked us all year round. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gathering-storm-katerina-1/page-42.html","bookId":2654,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:42 AM"}
