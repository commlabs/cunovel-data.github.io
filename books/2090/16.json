Since we were dealing with werewolves, there weren\u0027t a lot of rule books. Nowhere did it say I couldn\u0027t become different, even from what I was. Damien had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, he\u0027d been cursed. Blessed. Hell, I didn\u0027t know anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut since sex is a normal, physical function of both humans and wolves, perhaps in abstaining, I\u0027d done myself more harm than good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee, I could rationalize with the best of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jess? Will called. \"We\u0027re supposed to check in with Sheriff Stephenson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your pants on, Slick.\" Jessie moved past me and into the hall. \"Or maybe take them off,\" she murmured so only I could hear. \"He looks much better that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA muffled thump at the front of the house announced they\u0027d left, and weariness washed over me again. I stumbled into the room that was now mine, dumped my sweat-stained clothes, then crawled beneath the chilly sheets in nothing but Jessie\u0027s T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe windows were covered with heavy curtains - a J��ger-Sucher staple, issued right along with silver ammunition and fake IDs, since most of them slept in the daytime and hunted all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering that, a vampire would make a great werewolf hunter, if you could trust the bloodsucking undead. I\u0027m sure it goes without saying that you can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI awoke much later, rested but stiff. I\u0027d slept so heavily my body was in the same position as when I lay down. Unusual for me. I was an active sleeper. Lucky I slept alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept I wasn\u0027t alone. The instant I woke up, I heard someone breathing. The door was closed. I remembered leaving it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an attempt to fool whoever had invaded my place, I kept my respiration deep and even. I moved nothing except my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNear the window stood a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to pin his scent, but he\u0027d showered so recently I caught only a whiff of soap and damp hair. New clothes that smelled of the plastic they\u0027d come in, new shoes so fresh I could taste the rubber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest defense and all that, I bounded out of bed and had my elbow around his neck before he could turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to talk but I was cutting off his air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis close I didn\u0027t need to smell him. I knew the shape of that body, the texture of the skin. I loosened my hold, and he turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss me, sweetheart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rare occasion when I didn\u0027t know who was coming after me long before they got there. Those few seconds of not knowing had scared me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a death wish?\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stalked across the room and tapped the reading lamp on the bedside table. The muted glow barely reached into the corner where he hovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one throws me out of town,\" Nic said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think someone did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. \"I\u0027m here, aren\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when Edward sees you he\u0027ll have a temper tantrum. I don\u0027t want to watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s temper tantrums usually consisted of guns firing, blood spurting, bodies bursting into flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic crossed the room and crowded into my space. The action should have been intimidating. I\u0027m sure he meant it to be. Instead, I found his nearness, his attempt at dominance, arousing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did he have this effect on me? I wished the desire would go away. I wished he would go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if he\u0027d heard my thoughts, he grabbed my arms, and gave me a little shake. My breath caught on a gasp, not of shock, but excitement. I was pathetic. Since when had I enjoyed being manhandled?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the man doing the handling was Nic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers tightened as I tried to get away. I could have, easily, if I hadn\u0027t been enjoying the struggle so much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What hold does Mandenauer have on you, Elise? What is it that he knows?\" I froze, eyes going wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is he to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"M-my boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more to it than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right, but I couldn\u0027t tell him so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you disappeared,\" Nic murmured, \"I asked everyone if they\u0027d seen you, but no one had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust Edward to make sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except for the guy sneaking in from a night celebrating a solid C on his biology test.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He saw a beautiful blonde leaving with a skinny, scary old man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I\u0027ve met the skinny, scary old man and I wonder... He wasn\u0027t your boss then, so why did you leave with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head tilted; my hair, loose and wild, brushed his arm and his nostrils flared, even as his lips thinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as aroused as I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I left because I wanted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat much was true. I\u0027d wanted to get away from a place where everyone had suddenly smelled like meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were... too clingy,\" I blurted. \"You were pushing me into something I wasn\u0027t ready for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething sparked in his eyes, and for an instant I was afraid of him, which was foolish. He couldn\u0027t hurt me. At least not physically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth crushed down. Our teeth clashed. I tasted blood. Mine? Nic\u0027s? I didn\u0027t care. The taste, the scent, only tempted me to give in to the wildness I kept trapped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips opened. I welcomed him in. Our tongues dueled - touch, spar, retreat. I shuddered, fighting the urge to draw more blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers wound in my hair, pulling my head back so he could trace a heated path down my throat. His tongue pressed against my pulse; his teeth worried a fold of skin as his fingers stroked my already aroused nipple to an aching peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he come back for me, or for this? Didn\u0027t matter. I wanted him. Always had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed to hold on to something or fall, so I clutched his shoulders, then became fascinated with the thin line of his collarbone and the shape of his biceps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere along the line he\u0027d discarded the suit and found a bright, white T-shirt and a pair of jeans; his holster and his gun were gone. The lack of dress-up clothes and a weapon - his new, yet somehow old, outfit - reminded me of the boy I\u0027d fallen in love with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappier, more innocent times, when we\u0027d lie on the couch all tangled together, studying, kissing, unable to resist the fury of first sexual awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic\u0027s hands fluttered down my back, under the flimsy cover of the T-shirt, stilling when he encountered nothing but skin. His fingernails scraped the sensitive area where my thighs sloped into my rear, before he filled his palms and ground us together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to wrap my legs around his waist and ride the tide. As if he knew my thoughts, he lifted me, settled my knees over his hips, and buried his face between my breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed my ankles behind his back and clenched, pressing myself against him. Cursing, he whirled and dumped me onto the bed, then he lost the jeans and the T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lamplight turned his skin to gold. He\u0027d grown in the years we\u0027d been apart, and without his clothes he seemed taller, broader, stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders were wide, his waist narrow, his legs long and taut. The light dusting of dark hair across his chest led down his flat stomach and fed into a curling frame around another part that seemed a lot bigger without clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d touched him in college - my hand down his pants, his breath harsh and rasping as I worked him in my palm and made him come - but I\u0027d never seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t get much time to see him now. One look at my face and he joined me on the bed. He didn\u0027t ask, didn\u0027t hesitate, and I was glad. If I\u0027d had too much time to think, maybe I would have stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I doubted it. I\u0027d held Nic in my heart as the man of my dreams, the one I could never have, and if I couldn\u0027t have him, I didn\u0027t want anyone. So here I was, a twenty-nine-year-old virgin werewolf. Fat lot of good abstinence had done me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I lost my soul, so be it. They could always shoot me tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic took my mouth; and then he took my body. One deep thrust and I was no longer a virgin. The werewolf thing was going to be a little bit harder to get rid of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain was minute; I endured worse every full moon. However, Nic froze, then slowly lifted his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger still lurked in his eyes, but there was wariness now, and a gentleness I hadn\u0027t seen since he\u0027d returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t ask.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis forehead dropped to rest against mine. \"Elise - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t stop. If you stop, I just might have to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a half-laugh, but I wasn\u0027t kidding. My body was on fire. My skin felt too small for my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery sensation bubbled in my blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands clutched his back, learning the swell of his buttocks, the curves and the dips. Urging him closer, I asked the eternal question and was answered with another fierce thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire world narrowed to the one small area where we had joined. My virginity was history, and I was still a woman. Or as close to a woman as I got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie had asked: What more could the universe do to me? Right now, I only cared what else Nic could do to me and for how long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose to meet him, and his body responded, pulsing within me to the beat of our hearts. Eyes closed, head thrown back, with every movement he reached deeper, loomed larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More,\" I mumbled against his mouth, then bit his lip. \"Harder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll hurt - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t.\" I clasped his hips and showed him what I needed. \"You can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had started out rough became rougher. The slide of flesh against flesh incited me. Arching, I offered my breasts, only Jessie\u0027s T-shirt was in the way. I tried to tug it free, but the material was sandwiched between us and there was no way we were going to separate now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a growl that seemed to reach all the way to my toes, he put his hand in the neck and tore the garment down the front. Lowering his head, he captured one nipple, then scored it with his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body trembled, and I tightened around him. Shuddering, he suckled, his tongue pushing me against the roof of his mouth in a rhythm echoed by our bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could no longer keep my eyes open as a whole new world exploded in my mind. The forest, the trees, the sky - no moon, full moon - the answer to every question I\u0027d ever had, right there, so close, I could almost hear the words, see the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was no longer divided but whole. Not woman and wolf, just me. Two become one in a rite as old as time, and then...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climaxed with a startled gasp as he reached a place meant only for him. Over and over and over again, he moved within me, and the orgasm surged through us both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the last shudder fell away, and the air shifted from hot to cool, I ran my palm over his hair. My chest went tight. I wanted to both hold him close and fling him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNic rolled from my body and onto the bed. He didn\u0027t speak; I wasn\u0027t sure what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt both different and the same. How could that be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t what I came here for.\" His voice was remote. I wasn\u0027t sure what I\u0027d done, or maybe not done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a sound of disgust and sat up. \"I didn\u0027t use a condom. Dammit!\" He scrubbed a hand through his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t worried, since I couldn\u0027t get pregnant, and, since lycanthropy can heal a non-silver bullet to the head, STDs aren\u0027t even a blip on our radar. Too bad I couldn\u0027t explain any of this to Nic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been so stupid in my life,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly naked and alone, I glanced away and my gaze was caught by a smudge of blood on my inner thigh. Quickly I wrapped the covers around me so he wouldn\u0027t see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean it like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his hands, lowered them. \"You confuse the hell out of me, Elise. I see you, and it\u0027s like you never went away. Everything feels the same, but we\u0027re not the same people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had that right, I wasn\u0027t even a people anymore. Had I ever been?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look as if seven days have passed, instead of seven years.\" He tilted his head, stared at my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words reminded me, if I\u0027d needed any reminding, that we could never be together. Not really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSooner or later he\u0027d find out what I was, what I\u0027d done, and he\u0027d hate me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to hate you,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started. Could he read my mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze wandered over the bed, then over me. \"Did that feel like hate to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"But it wasn\u0027t love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why had it felt like love to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes burned and I stood. The languid, peaceful feeling fled, and as I paced the room, dragging the end of the bedspread behind me, a buzzing energy took its place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatching a glimpse of myself in the mirror above the dresser, I froze. My eyes had bled blue; not a hint of white surrounded the iris. Wolf\u0027s eyes, except for one difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost laymen aren\u0027t aware that only puppies have blue eyes. So if you see a wolf in the wild with orbs of blue? Better hope you have a silver bullet handy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic made my breathing shallow. When I was wolf, I had human eyes, so what did it mean that they had gone wolf when I wasn\u0027t? I doubted it was a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced into the mirror once more. Nic was getting dressed. Convenient, since I had to get rid of him right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted me,\" I said. \"You had me. Get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head lifted, he turned in my direction. I ducked my face so my hair would cover my eyes. If he saw them I was doomed. Or he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the calm I heard liquid steel, red hot and bubbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We both wanted to see what we\u0027d missed.\" I inched toward the door with a shrug. \"Now we know. It wasn\u0027t all that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lie almost as badly as you fuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced. He was lying, too. Despite my inexperience, even I knew what we\u0027d just shared had been as far from bad as it had been from a common fuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him coming after me but I didn\u0027t pause to see how close he was. If I could get into the hallway, he\u0027d never catch me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYanking open the door, I nearly screamed as a large, dark shadow swooped close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-dark-moon-nightcreature-3/page-16.html","bookId":2090,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:23 PM"}
