Les SaintPierre, the safety conscious ship\u0027s captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison hefted a stack of fifties. \"What the holy fuck—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later. Right now we get this to the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison looked dazed, but she helped me repack the ice chest, get it over the side of the boat, then wedge it under the storage unit\u0027s tin wall. On our way back to the Audi, each of us carrying one handle of the Igloo, we left the gate open for another family that was coming in to collect their boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe they too were stashing money and addresses in their shed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey smiled and waved their thanks. I smiled back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone is so damn friendly in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e40\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive back started out well enough. Allison was coming down off her twenty ounces of bad wine and was starting to warm up to the realization that we had fifty thousand dollars stashed under the backseat. By the time we got onto the highway she was recapping the afternoon in glowing terms, throwing out casual insults about her idiot husband and the Avalon County Sheriff\u0027s Department. She suggested we drive out to Miranda\u0027s gig at the Paintbrush, see if we could find any more deputies to beat up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But first better clothes,\" she insisted. She tugged on my Tshirt sleeve. \"I\u0027m not going with this. And you\u0027ve got to have cowboy boots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve worn cowboy boots exactly once. It was not a success.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she kept nagging until, reluctantly, I told her about the photo my mother still shows off whenever I\u0027m foolish enough to bring friends over—me two years old, thighdeep in the Sheriff\u0027s black Lucheses, trying not to fall over, my cloth diaper sagging obscenely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison laughed. \"You\u0027re due for another try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t tell Rhonda Jean at Sheppler\u0027s Western Wear about the diaper photo. We didn\u0027t tell her we looked so bad this evening because we\u0027d been breaking into places all around Medina Lake. We just told her we needed a quick change of clothes before the store closed, in fifteen minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhonda Jean smiled. A challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourteen minutes later she had me outfitted in boot cut Levi\u0027s and a cotton pieced red and white shirt and size eleven natural tan Justins. I vetoed the hat and the rattlesnake belt that she promised me she could have engraved with TRES on the back at no extra charge. Allison came out sporting a white fringed shirt and black boots and tightfitting jeans that only a woman with an excellent figure could\u0027ve gotten away with wearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison got away with it pretty well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhonda Jean nodded her approval, then sent us on to the cashier. I paid with the last of the fifties Milo had given me at Tycoon Flats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison watched as I emptied my wallet. \"You\u0027re paying out of pocket? With all we\u0027ve got stashed in the car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cashier gave us a very funny look. I smiled at Allison and said, \"Let\u0027s go, darlin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the Audi we drove with the windows down. The wind was almost cool now, whipping around the front seats and sending the medicine pouch beads on the rearview mirror into a little jellyfish dance. Allison had taken off the sunglasses and her eyes seemed softer and darker than they had been before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was starting to turn some things around in my head, ideas about the addresses we\u0027d found and the money and the trail Les SaintPierre had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know much about the record industry?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison held her hands far apart, like she was bragging about a fish. \"Two years with Les SaintPierre, cowboy. What you wanna know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CDs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you were importing them from overseas in large quantities, how would they be packed? Boxes? Crates?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uhunh. Spools.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cylinders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Big ones. The jewel cases and covers are only added in the destination country, with local suppliers. It\u0027s cheaper that way. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So much for keeping the business modest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited a half mile before responding. \"We should talk about the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s to talk about? Les was stupid enough to forget it when he ran, it reverts to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want a finder\u0027s fee, sweetie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Les probably embezzled that money from the agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison stared at me. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it isn\u0027t yours. I\u0027ll store it for a while, until I know what\u0027s what. Then, most likely, it\u0027ll go to the debtor\u0027s court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t respond. We had come all the way back to Loop 410 to hit Sheppler\u0027s and were now heading north again, ostensibly to go to the Paintbrush. I missed the Leon Valley exit and kept driving, circling the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to do Milo Chavez a fiftythousand dollar favour,\" Allison decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what I said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what it amounts to—bailing his ass out of debt and leaving me nothing. That\u0027s what you\u0027re thinking, isn\u0027t it? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking you\u0027re overreacting again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison stomped her shiny new boot against the floorboard. She crossed her arms and looked out into the hills. \"Shithead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe passed I10, kept going. I exited on West Avenue and turned left, toward downtown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I should just take you back,\" I suggested. \"Let you collect your car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove in silence. West Avenue. Hildebrand. Broadway. Saturday night was unfolding all along the avenues—neon bar signs and lowrider cars and slow cruising pickup trucks. The air was laced with the smell of family barbecues, pork ribs, and roasted peppers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we finally got back to Queen Anne Street I cut the engine and the lights. We sat there, staring at Allison\u0027s crookedly parked Miata, until Allison began to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned toward me. Her breath smelled faintly of fortified wine. \"All right. Don\u0027t get the wrong idea, sweetie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What wrong idea is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached over and pushed a couple of buttons on my new Western shirt. \"That I didn\u0027t appreciate the day with you. I got a little upset, that\u0027s all. I don\u0027t want you thinking—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The money is staying in storage, Allison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked slowly, processing what I said, then decided to laugh again. \"You think that\u0027s all I\u0027m interested in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you, then.\" She said it almost playfully. She leaned toward me slowly, tugging my shirt, inviting me to meet her halfway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething twisted in my throat. I managed to move her hand away and say, \"Not a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled back, raised her eyebrows. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got out of the car she slammed the door, then turned and smiled in the window at me. \"You and Milo have fun dividing up Les\u0027 estate, Tres. Thanks for the good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched her get in her car, start the engine and pull off the curb with a grind and a thump, and drive away. I reminded myself that was really what I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in the dark Audi, leaned my head against the back of the seat, and exhaled. Feel lucky, I thought. You just spent seven hours with that woman and neither of you shed any blood. But when I closed my eyes they burned. I tried to replay our afternoon ten different ways, going through all the placating things or the really nasty things I could\u0027ve said. It made me feel even more dissatisfied and infuriated than I had been before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should\u0027ve gone out to the Indian Paintbrush. I had plenty of new questions for Mr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheckly, some reports to give Milo, a lady to see who would be singing \"Billy\u0027s Senorita\" right about now, looking out at the audience with some very fine brown eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I got out of the car, my legs shaky from the long car ride, and wobbled toward my inlaw apartment with the feeling that somewhere under the waterline, somewhere toward the prow, I had just been torpedoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to treat Sunday morning like the start of any other day. I did my tai chi, had breakfast with Robert Johnson, made a fiftythousanddollar deposit under my landlord\u0027s antique rosebush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I drove to Vandiver Street before anyone would be awake at my mother\u0027s house, left the Audi out front and the key in the mailbox, and reclaimed the VW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed south toward the State Insurance Building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the tower had been downtown it would\u0027ve been invisible, but where it was—stuck in the middle of the flatlands south of SAC, surrounded by parks and one story office complexes, it looked huge. The parking lot only had a handful of cars, one of them being Samuel Barrera\u0027s mustard BMW.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI punched the elevator button for level six and was deposited in front of a frosted glass door that still bore faint discoloured outlines from the stencil letters that used to read: SAMUEL BARRERA, INVESTIGATIONS. Now there was a classy brass plaque above a classy ivory and gold buzzer. The plaque read LTECH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t opt for the buzzer. I walked into the waiting room and went up to the little sliding window like they have in dentists\u0027 offices. The window was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe receptionist was so short that she had to crane her neck to see me over the top of the counter. Her hair was mostly calcified hair spray that curled away from her face in capital letter U\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help you?\" she inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. I straightened my tie. \"Tres Navarre. I\u0027m here to see Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. People weren\u0027t supposed to come in on Sunday morning asking for Barrera, especially by first name. \"Won\u0027t you sit down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slidingglass panel shut in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the sofa and read the latest company bulletin from ITech headquarters in New York. There was some propaganda about how well the company was doing snapping up private firms in various states and selling them back to their owners like McDonald\u0027s franchises. One ad aimed at outside readers told me exactly what it took to be \"ITech material.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was just assessing my ITech potential when the inner office door opened and Sam Barrera came out. He walked up to me and said, \"What the fuck do you want, Navarre?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put down the news bulletin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrera was wearing the standard threepiece suit, brown this time. His tie was a shade of yellow that miraculously matched. His gold rings were newly polished and his cologne was strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No we don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went out to Medina Lake, Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sunglassmetal quality in Barrera\u0027s eyes got a little harder. \"You will be talked to, Navarre. But it won\u0027t be by me. You\u0027d better tell Erainya—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was more than a cabin out there, Sam. You missed something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust for a second, Sam Barrera wasn\u0027t sure what to say. It had probably been years since anyone dared to suggest he had missed something. It had probably never come from an amateur half his age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parks and Wildlife,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrera processed quickly. His face went through a chameleon phase—red to brown to coffee colour. \"Saint Pierre had a boat? He registered a freshwater boat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to know what I found, or would you like to threaten me some more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quiet long enough for the cement in his expression to resettle. \"You want to come in back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on his heel without waiting for my answer. I followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam\u0027s office was a shrine to Texas A \u0026amp; M. The carpet was plush maroon and the drapes were the same. On the mahogany bookshelf, pothos plants were carefully interspersed with Aggie diplomas and photos of Sam and his sons in their Corps uniforms. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-37.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
