Zhou Weiqing was no longer maintaining the façade of a six-Jeweled cultivation.\u0026nbsp;He simply sat there in the face of Dongfang Hanyue’s pressure, staring at her composedly.\u0026nbsp;He didn’t have the slightest bit of enmity in his gaze, which actually turned extremely gentle.\u0026nbsp;It was like he was watching his wife throw a minor tantrum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going to attack!” Dongfang Hanyue said viciously, taking a step forward as her aura grew even more threatening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go ahead.”\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing spread his arms wide, a smile on his face.\u0026nbsp;It was as though he was a martyr welcoming death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really aren’t afraid of dying?”\u0026nbsp;Dongfang Hanyue slowly raised her right hand as she stared at Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;Dense Tenebrous energies were flickering in her hand.\u0026nbsp;A full-force strength from a Heavenly Emperor could completely destroy even this beach with ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I’m afraid of death.\u0026nbsp;I’m terrified of death!\u0026nbsp;Who isn’t?\u0026nbsp;I haven’t had enough of life yet, and there are so many beautiful women waiting for me.\u0026nbsp;Buuuuut… you won’t kill me.\u0026nbsp;You can’t bear to.”\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing beamed merrily as he looked at Dongfang Hanyue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep, sharp breath.\u0026nbsp;Complex emotions flickered through her eyes, and she slowly retracted her uplifted hand to press it against her own chest as she nibbled at her lower lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at this moment, the dark storm clouds in the skies suddenly parted.\u0026nbsp;The dazzling moon was high in the sky, casting its gentle moonlight upon the world.\u0026nbsp;When the light of the moon shone down upon the vast sea, Zhou Weiqing’s gaze instantly turned rather dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bright moon over the ocean… a fairy maiden standing on the sands… this was a stirring image that caused his heart to begin thumping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDongfang Hanyue once more took a step forwards.\u0026nbsp;Finally, she made her move… except, it wasn’t against Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiiiip!\u0026nbsp;The high-pitched sound of fabric being torn wasn’t unpleasant at all to hear.\u0026nbsp;Instead, it was as though some sort of barrier holding these two people apart had been instantly shredded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat now appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing, bathed in the pristine light of the moon, was a body that seemed to have been forged from alabaster jade.\u0026nbsp;It was flawless and beautiful, and it seemed to be bathed in holy light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took another step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Little Fatty swallowed hard.\u0026nbsp;Even he himself felt that this wasn’t real.\u0026nbsp;He mumbled, “Don’t play so rough, alright?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDongfang Hanyue glared hatefully at him.\u0026nbsp;“Not alright!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled outwards with her two hands, causing the sound of fabric ripping to appear once more. This time, a bronzed chest which looked as sturdy as a steel wall was revealed. Her lips searched for his, almost frantically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen their lips actually locked together, he could clearly sense that her icy lips were trembling.\u0026nbsp;This probably represented her genuine emotions right now.\u0026nbsp;Her actions had been quite wild.\u0026nbsp;She had pushed Zhou Weiqing down onto the sand, then seized his hands and held them down… but to an old hand like him, her kiss showed that she was actually extremely shy and inexperienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an absolutely breathtaking kiss.\u0026nbsp;It felt as though the kiss would last until the seas dried up and the stones turned to dust, and it caused bestial feelings to pump through a certain someone’s veins.\u0026nbsp;It wasn’t until the two of them finally had to breathe that the kiss temporarily came to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDongfang Hanyue’s lithe body pressed down against Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;She was soft, lithe, yet incredibly agile and flexible, causing a certain someone to nearly let out a moan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them were panting for lack of breath.\u0026nbsp;Due to the panting and heaving, certain parts became pressed even more tightly against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter panting for a while, Dongfang Hanyue stopped moving and fell silent.\u0026nbsp;A certain someone who was filled with bestial instincts could no longer hold himself back.\u0026nbsp;Being pressed down like this was pretty fun, but for it to stop midway rendered him a bit speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh… so should we continue?”\u0026nbsp;Zhou Little Fatty asked probingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDongfang Hanyue clung tightly to his chest, still panting slightly.\u0026nbsp;“Didn’t you tell me not to play rough?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um…”\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing chuckled.\u0026nbsp;“Actually, what I really wanted to say was, ‘let the storm rage even harder’.”\u0026nbsp;He suddenly raised his head, only to see that Dongfang Hanyue’s beautiful face had turned as red as an apple.\u0026nbsp;She stared at him, rather lost, then said in a whisper, “B-but I’m not sure what to do…”\u0026nbsp;As she said this, she slightly loosened her tight grip over Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn’t this exactly how a man’s bestial instincts were aroused?\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing didn’t know how others might react, but he himself felt as though he truly had transformed into a Dark Demon God Tiger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next instant, the positions of ‘attacker’ and ‘defender’ were suddenly reversed.\u0026nbsp;The female Demon Draconian finally became the ‘defender’, while the Dark Demon Tiger God acted as though it had just caught a delicious little lamb to feast up.\u0026nbsp;Rain, thunder, lightning… the storm raged indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark storm clouds drifted across the bashful moon, turning the seas dark.\u0026nbsp;The only things within the darkness were the seas, the barren island, the sands, and an absolutely stirring mixture of draconic moans and tiger growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though she was twenty-nine years of age, this was her first time being together with a man.\u0026nbsp;This was the first man who had entered both her heart and her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eI owe him this.\u0026nbsp;I lost the bet\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026nbsp;At first, Dongfang Hanyue repeatedly told herself this excuse, but when a certain someone’s strong, muscular, scorching hot body took control over her, she completely lost the capability for rational thought.\u0026nbsp;The only thing left was her cries, which varied between high and quavering, between loud and soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had said he didn’t regret it.\u0026nbsp;What about her?\u0026nbsp;She didn’t regret it either.\u0026nbsp;Even if she knew they had no future together, and that she might in fact lose this man right away, she still didn’t hesitate to give herself to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps this was madness… but the most beautiful memory in Dongfang Hanxue’s entire life was this night of madness.\u0026nbsp;Sometimes, you didn’t need a perfect ending to the story.\u0026nbsp;Enjoying the story itself and gaining an indelible, unforgettable memory was sometimes even more beautiful than finding a happy ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDongfang Hanyue had never imagined that she could become so soft and weak.\u0026nbsp;She felt like she was a small boat that was being tossed about by the waves, rising and falling and then rising again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night of madness only came to a gradual end when the sun rose.\u0026nbsp;Dongfang Hanyue was in an very deep sleep, her head nestled against Zhou Weiqing’s firm shoulders.\u0026nbsp;She was utterly exhausted, but her slender and beautiful face had an unwavering, sweet smile on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing wasn’t able to fall asleep. Beneath them was a very soft blanket, which Zhou Weiqing had originally prepared for himself and Shangguan Bing’er to use as they traversed the oceans to Xuantian Continent via the Sea Emperor Shuttle. He didn’t expect that it would be put to use at a time like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis entire body felt incredibly comfortable, even after he had displayed the ferocity of a tiger and the spirit of a dragon.\u0026nbsp;Still, he had a rather puzzled look on his face.\u0026nbsp;How could he not?\u0026nbsp;He had come to this place for the sake of the Spatial Teleportation Gem.\u0026nbsp;It could be said that he was an enemy of Xuantian Palace… but somehow, the Xuantian Palace Lord was nestling in the crook of his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the energies of this beautiful Heavenly Emperor had caused the Saint Energy within his own body to advance dramatically.\u0026nbsp;Dongfang Hanyue had four Attributes and was incredibly powerful, as could be seen from how she had worked together with the Tenebrous Demon Dragon to subdue the Terror Sea Dragon.\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing’s cultivation base had dramatically after he took her virginity and gained her vital Yin essence.\u0026nbsp;Indeed, how could it not?\u0026nbsp;He was now actually at the verge of breaking through the thirty-eighth stage.\u0026nbsp;Normally speaking, even though Saint Energy had the mighty ability to assimilate other Attribute energies, there was no way he would’ve been able to break through without another half-year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill… Dongfang Hanyue had benefited even more from Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;She had only risen to become a Heavenly Emperor due to her father’s Heavenly Energy, which meant that her own bottleneck was far greater than that of any ordinary Heavenly Emperor’s.\u0026nbsp;After Zhou Weiqing had healed her and then intertwined his spirit and flesh with hers, she had been baptized by Saint Energy and her invisible bottleneck had been significantly lessened.\u0026nbsp;Even she herself never would’ve imagined this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm…”\u0026nbsp;Dongfang Hanyue let out a low moan, nearly setting Zhou Weiqing’s ardor alight once more.\u0026nbsp;She snuggled in his arms, trying to find a more comfortable position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh?\u0026nbsp;What’s this?”\u0026nbsp;Suddenly, Zhou Weiqing discovered that something was pressing against his arm.\u0026nbsp;He unconsciously glanced down, only to see that it was a small pendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slender string was made of a silvery-white metal, and it was attached to a large diamond-shaped jewel that hung around Dongfang Hanyue’s slender neck.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-252-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-253-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-253-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
