We\u0027ve been curled up on the couch together all day and now into the evening. Her head is resting against my chest, and so it is with extreme caution that I reach for the phone, careful not to jostle her around and wake her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpeaking softly, I order an enormous amount of Chinese food for delivery. Looking down at Mila, I quickly add dessert to our order. She needs to eat. She\u0027s lost weight. The curves that used to fit perfectly into my hands have become too thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I hang up the phone, I feel guilty about that. She was under stress because of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaring down, I stroke the hair away from her brow, watching her lips puff out with each breath. It\u0027s a trait about her that is cute as hell. She seems so innocent, like a child. She chooses this moment to open her eyes. They widen as she realizes that I\u0027m awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she murmurs, sitting up. I keep my arms wrapped around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I tell her with a smile. \"Did you sleep well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods guiltily, like she\u0027s ashamed of sleeping the day away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You needed the sleep,\" I tell her. \"You haven\u0027t been taking care of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks sheepish. \"I had trouble sleeping,\" she answers defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I tell her softly. \"I did, too. But we\u0027ll sleep better now, I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at me. \"Have your nightmares gone away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surprisingly, yes,\" I answer. \"For the most part. I\u0027ve had a couple since I was hypnotized, but not many. Even though it\u0027s been painful, remembering everything really was cathartic. Once I started talking about it and processing it, I\u0027ve been able to put some of my issues to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be talented,\" she tells me, taking my words from a long time ago. \"Sometimes issues don\u0027t want to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. \"You\u0027re right. Sometimes issues are insomniacs from hell. But mine are behaving for now. Let\u0027s hope they stay that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure they will,\" Mila answers confidently. \"Because you\u0027re talented. You\u0027ll whip them into shape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snuggles into my neck and I pull her even closer. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ever going to let you off my lap,\" I tell her. \"So I hope you\u0027re comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggles. \"You say that now, until your legs fall asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let me worry about that,\" I tell her. \"You weigh five pounds now. And by the way, we have food coming. You\u0027re going to eat all of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggles again. \"You let me worry about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after the delivery guy comes and I let Mila get off my lap, she does end up eating everything I put on her plate. I try to make her take seconds, but she refuses. I let it slide. I\u0027ll have all the time in the world now to feed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something for you,\" I tell her as we put our dishes into the dishwasher. She straightens up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? I don\u0027t need anything, though. I have everything I need now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by that, she means me. My heart swells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have everything I need now, too,\" I assure her. \"And you\u0027re never going anywhere which is why I\u0027m giving this to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stares at me curiously and I lead her to the second floor, positioning her in front of a closed door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re giving me a guest bedroom?\" she cocks an eyebrow as she turns to look at me. \"You don\u0027t want to sleep with me anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just open the door, Sassy Pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles and turns the knob, pushing it open. And then she gasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI transformed a guest room into a studio for her. An entire wall of windows face the lake, flooding the room with light. Two easels, built-in shelves filled with every possible art supply she could ever need, a sitting area and I even had skylights installed for nights when the moon is overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila is frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to say anything?\" I ask. \"Cat got your tongue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles slowly, mischievously. \"I thought we already established that the cat most definitely doesn\u0027t have my tongue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories from the night on my kitchen floor stir my groin and I quickly think of other things. Dead puppies, nuns, cold fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce my groin is under control, I tug on her hand, leading her from shelf to shelf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted you to have everything you would need to paint here,\" I tell her. \"Did I forget anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spins around, looking at everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is amazing,\" she breathes. \"You didn\u0027t forget a thing. But you must\u0027ve been working on this for a while. What if... what if we hadn\u0027t worked things out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrap my arms around her from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t an option,\" I answer. \"It was never an option. Love never fails, Mila. And I\u0027ll never fail you again. That\u0027s a promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull her around so that she is looking at me with her gorgeous green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mila, that day in your shop almost crushed me. When you said no to me, I didn\u0027t know if I would survive it, but I knew I had to. I knew that I had to change, for me and for you. And I think I have. I\u0027m still working on it... it\u0027s going to be a process. But I\u0027m willing to put in the work. Forever, if that\u0027s what it takes. So...I\u0027m going to ask you again, babe. Stay with me. Stay with me here in my house. It\u0027s only a five minute drive to your shop when it\u0027s open. And you can use this studio for your art. I promise to try not to snore. And to put the toilet seat down. Most of the time, anyway. Just stay with me. Please. I never want to be away from you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila stares at me, her eyes glittering. \"On one condition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the breath freeze on my lips. \"Name it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get to paint you nude any time I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chuckle rumbles through my chest and I grab her, crushing my lips to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any time,\" I mumble against her mouth. \"You can do anything to me at all, actually. Nude or otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs and I lift her up. Her legs wrap around my waist...right where they belong as her fingers rake through my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she tells me breathlessly. \"Yes. I\u0027ll stay with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tumble to the floor, grasping at each other, breathing each other in. Mila\u0027s tongue slips into my mouth, her breath sweet and warm. Her hands clutch me, pulling me closer and closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer legs are wrapped around me and I moan as she strokes me. Then my lips are on her neck, her collarbone, her breasts. After a few heated minutes, she pulls my face back up to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her forehead pressed to mine, she whispers, \"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin against her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly roll over with her in my arms and I hover above her before I slide my hand between her legs. She is panting within a minute and calling my name within two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile again and as she pulls me to her, I enter her slowly and sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI groan from the sheer, raw pleasure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amount of love in this room is incredible; it is thick and almost tangible. It is mind-blowing to me. I\u0027ve never made love to any other woman before. It was always fucking in its most primal. It was never like this...so achingly sweet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith each stroke that I take, warmth swells in my chest until I feel I can\u0027t contain it. I clutch Mila to me gently, not wanting to release her even for a moment. And when I am finally throbbing into her, I wrap her in my arms and we stay enmeshed together for what seems like forever, sticky and wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was perfect,\" she tells me sleepily, her fingers playing with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re perfect,\" I answer, closing my eyes. I don\u0027t even worry about the fact that it\u0027s a pussy thing to say. It\u0027s the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila snuggles into my side and lays her head on my chest. Eventually her breathing grows rhythmic as she slips into sleep and I hover on the edge of drifting off myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy last conscious thought is that Mila did what she promised. She chased my nightmares away. It\u0027s because of her that I even went to see Dr. Tyler. If I hadn\u0027t, I never would have remembered what happened to my mother. And if I hadn\u0027t remembered that, I never would have fixed the hole in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never would have been whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMila did that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll never tell her because she would just wave her hand and tell me that I\u0027m the one who fixed things, that I put in the work. She never takes enough credit. So I\u0027ll just have to love her every day of her life as a thank you. It\u0027s enough that I know the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027ll never hide from the truth again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can\u0027t hurt me anymore. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-26.html","bookId":2758,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:14 PM"}
