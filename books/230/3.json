The pageant of the river bank had marched steadily along, unfolding itself in scene-pictures that succeeded each other in stately procession.\u0026nbsp; Purple loosestrife arrived early, shaking luxuriant tangled locks along the edge of the mirror whence its own face laughed back at it.\u0026nbsp; Willow-herb, tender and wistful, like a pink sunset cloud, was not slow to follow.\u0026nbsp; Comfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the white, crept forth to take its place in the line; and at last one morning the diffident and delaying dog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew, as if string-music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a gavotte, that June at last was here.\u0026nbsp; One member of the company was still awaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for whom the ladies waited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the sleeping summer back to life and love.\u0026nbsp; But when meadow-sweet, debonair and odorous in amber jerkin, moved graciously to his place in the group, then the play was ready to begin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e当他们回顾夏天的一切时，就感到，那是多么绚丽多彩的一章啊！那里面有许多五色缤纷的插图。大河两岸，一支盛装的游行队伍在不停地庄严行进，展示出一场跟着一场富丽堂皇的景观。紫色的珍珠菜最先登场，抖开它那乱丝般丰美的秀发，垂挂在镜面般的河水边沿，镜中的脸，又冲它自己微笑。婀娜多姿的柳兰，犹如桃色的晚霞，紧跟着也上场了。雏菊，紫的和白的手牵着手，悄悄钻了上来，在队列中占取了一席地位。最后，在一个早晨，羞怯的野蔷薇姗姗来迟，轻盈地步上舞台。这时，就像弦乐以它辉煌的和弦转入一曲加沃特，向人们宣告，六月终于来到了。但是，戏班子里还缺一个角色没有到齐，那就是水仙女所追求的牧羊少年，闺秀们凭窗盼望的骑士，用亲吻唤醒沉睡的夏天的生命和爱情的王子。当身穿琥珀色紧身背心的笑靥菊，温文尔雅，芳香扑鼻，步履优美地登上舞台时，好戏就开场了。\u003c/p\u003e                                                                 \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/259/2442.html","bookId":230,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:25:12 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:25:12 AM"}
