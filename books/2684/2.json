{"id":69531,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eI remember my trepidation about the movie began on a warm October night three weeks prior to its theatrical release, in a screening room on the 20th Century Fox lot. I was sitting between Trent Burroughs and Julian, who wasn\u0027t clean yet and kept biting his nails, squirming in the plush black chair with anticipation. (I saw Blair walk in with Alana and Kim and trailing Rip Millar. I ignored her.) The movie was very different from the book in that there was nothing from the book in the movie. Despite everything - all the pain I felt, the betrayal - I couldn\u0027t help but recognize a truth while sitting in that screening room. In the book everything about me had happened. The book was something I simply couldn\u0027t disavow. The book was blunt and had an honesty about it, whereas the movie was just a beautiful lie. (It was also a bummer: very colorful and busy but also grim and expensive, and it didn\u0027t recoup its cost when released that November.) In the movie I was played by an actor who actually looked more like me than the character the author portrayed in the book: I wasn\u0027t blond, I wasn\u0027t tan, and neither was the actor. I also suddenly became the movie\u0027s moral compass, spouting AA jargon, castigating everyone\u0027s drug use and trying to save Julian. (\"I\u0027ll sell my car,\" I warn the actor playing Julian\u0027s dealer. \"Whatever it takes.\") This was slightly less true of the adaptation of Blair\u0027s character, played by a girl who actually seemed like she belonged in our group - jittery, sexually available, easily wounded. Julian became the sentimentalized version of himself, acted by a talented, sad-faced clown, who has an affair with Blair and then realizes he has to let her go because I was his best bud. \"Be good to her,\" Julian tells Clay. \"She really deserves it.\" The sheer hypocrisy of this scene must have made the author blanch. Smiling secretly to myself with perverse satisfaction when the actor delivered that line, I then glanced at Blair in the darkness of the screening room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the movie glided across the giant screen, restlessness began to reverberate in the hushed auditorium. The audience - the book\u0027s actual cast - quickly realized what had happened. The reason the movie dropped everything that made the novel real was because there was no way the parents who ran the studio would ever expose their children in the same black light the book did. The movie was begging for our sympathy whereas the book didn\u0027t give a shit. And attitudes about drugs and sex had shifted quickly from 1985 to 1987 (and a regime change at the studio didn\u0027t help) so the source material - surprisingly conservative despite its surface immorality - had to be reshaped. The best way to look at the movie was as modern eighties noir - the cinematography was breathtaking - and I sighed as it kept streaming forward, interested in only a few things: the new and gentle details of my parents mildly amused me, as did Blair finding her divorced father with his girlfriend on Christmas Eve instead of with a boy named Jared (Blair\u0027s father died of AIDS in 1992 while still married to Blair\u0027s mother). But the thing I remember most about that screening in October twenty years ago was the moment Julian grasped my hand that had gone numb on the armrest separating our seats. He did this because in the book Julian Wells lived but in the movie\u0027s new scenario he had to die. He had to be punished for all of his sins. That\u0027s what the movie demanded. (Later, as a screenwriter, I learned it\u0027s what all movies demanded.) When this scene occurred, in the last ten minutes, Julian looked at me in the darkness, stunned. \"I died,\" he whispered. \"They killed me off.\" I waited a beat before sighing, \"But you\u0027re still here.\" Julian turned back to the screen and soon the movie ended, the credits rolling over the palm trees as I (improbably) take Blair back to my college while Roy Orbison wails a song about how life fades away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real Julian Wells didn\u0027t die in a cherry-red convertible, overdosing on a highway in Joshua Tree while a choir soared over the sound track. The real Julian Wells was murdered over twenty years later, his body dumped behind an abandoned apartment building in Los Feliz after he had been tortured to death at another location. His head was crushed - his face struck with such force that it had partly folded in on itself - and he had been stabbed so brutally that the L.A. coroner\u0027s office counted one hundred fifty-nine wounds from three different knives, many of them overlapping. His body was discovered by a group of kids who went to CalArts and were cruising through the streets off of Hillhurst in a convertible BMW looking for a parking space. When they saw the body they thought the \"thing\" lying by a trash bin was - and I\u0027m quoting the first Los Angeles Times article on the front page of the California section about the Julian Wells murder - \"a flag.\" I had to stop when I hit upon that word and start reading the article again from the beginning. The students who found Julian thought this because Julian was wearing a white Tom Ford suit (it had belonged to him but it wasn\u0027t something he was wearing the night he was abducted) and their immediate reaction seemed halfway logical since the jacket and pants were streaked with red. (Julian had been stripped before he was killed and then re-dressed.) But if they thought it was a \"flag\" my immediate question was: then where was the blue? If the body resembled a flag, I kept wondering, then where was the blue? And then I realized: it was his head. The students thought it was a flag because Julian had lost so much blood that his crumpled face was a blue so dark it was almost black. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-2.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
