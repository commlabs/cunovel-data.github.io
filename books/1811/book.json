But it’s not our story. Ours is a lot more colorful. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eWhen I met Dee I knew right away that she was special. When she met me, she thought I was anything but special--I was exactly like every other guy who’d screwed her over and let her down. It took some time to convince her otherwise, but turns out I can make a convincing argument when sex is at stake. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eYou might know where this story’s headed. But the best part isn\u0027t where we ended up. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIt’s how we got there. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eTamed goes back in time to the Tangled days.
