{"id":101639,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"And so we commence,\" Christian said, his voice rich with satisfaction, desire, and just a hint of very flattering longing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I had committed myself to this, now that I had agreed to do everything my body ached to do, I felt uncomfortable, awkward, gauche. I didn\u0027t know what to do. Should I be the one to start things rolling, since I had made such a big deal about being in control? Or should I wait until Christian made the first move? The problem was, none of my past experience could be called on for help. All of the other men I\u0027d been with -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will forget them,\" Christian said as his fingertips brushed my jaw. \"There is you, and there is me, and there is no one else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started hyperventilating. What a stupid time for a panic attack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Christian.\" I gasped, wrapping my arms around myself. \"I\u0027m very sorry, but I don\u0027t think I can do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brave one, my goddess,\" he murmured, gently enveloping me in his arms. His hands stroked my back as he nuzzled my hair. \"You are distressing yourself to no purpose. If you are not ready for this, we shall simply wait until tomorrow night. If you are not ready then, we will wait for the following night, and so on until you feel the time is right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m only here for a little more than two weeks.\" I wheezed into his collarbone, the shaking within me slowly abating at the gentle strokes of his hand on my back. I pressed a little closer to him, wanting to breathe in his wonderful masculine scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not worry about the future when the present holds such promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered with the feeling of his soft breath in my ear, finally pulling a little bit away and looking at a spot just to the side of his face. \"Thank you for understanding. I think I\u0027d like to... er... give it a try. The only thing is\" - I swallowed back a lump approximately the size of Rhode Island - \"I\u0027m not quite sure what to do next. Should I... um...\" I looked at the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and pulled me toward the armchair, tugging me down onto his lap. \"Why don\u0027t we try this first? It was enjoyable at the restaurant; it should be so here, too, yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a watery smile, relaxing against him. He was giving me a choice, and had said he would stop at any time. Maybe this wouldn\u0027t be so bad after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour faith in my ability to stir your passion humbles me, he murmured in my mind, pulling me forward and kissing my lips until they parted for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day you\u0027re humble is the day hell will freeze over, I answered, kissing him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been to hell, his mind whispered into mine. His tongue teased my lips until I had to send my own out to tell his to stop fooling around and get down to proper tongue work. It is not a very likely place to freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo comment. I giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me thoroughly, let me kiss him just as thoroughly, and then engaged in a bit of a tongue tussle as we tried to outdo each other and push the fire burning between us to new heights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we finished I was squirming against him, my fingers tangled in his hair, tugging on it in silent demand that he take care of the ache that he had started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want, my demanding one?\" he asked, his lips nuzzling and nipping at an hitherto unknown sensitive spot on my collarbone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI released the earlobe I was gnawing on and looked down into his ebony eyes. \"I want to touch you. And I want you to touch me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue painted a line across my collarbone. \"It shall be as you order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up with me in his arms, letting me slide down his body until I was once again on my feet. I took a quick moment to assess my feelings, and decided I was in no danger, not threatened or feeling stifled as I had with other men. Christian had done everything he promised, holding back his own natural tendency to be the one in charge to allow me the time to proceed in a manner and a pace that left me burning with desire and wanting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a very clever man.\" I smiled against his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne glossy eyebrow rose. \"And you have only just discovered this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head dipped to take possession of my mouth once again, and I sagged against him, welcoming the solid strength of his arms, since my legs had apparently gone boneless and turned to jelly when I wasn\u0027t looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you wish for me to undress for you, or would it please you to undress me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed up against him, feeling wanton and wicked and extremely like a temptress who was no better than she should be. \"Which would drive you wild with excitement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands spread out to cup my breasts. \"Definitely the latter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned into his hands for a moment, astounded that breasts could feel so good in a man\u0027s hands, then pulled back and gave Christian a wicked smile. \"Then that is what we will do. Let\u0027s see... where shall I start... tie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An excellent choice,\" Christian said as I kissed his neck, his hands sliding up around my hips. I stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth eyebrows went up at that. \"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No hands. I get to undress you without you touching me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne side of his mouth quirked up in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you start touching me again, I won\u0027t be able to concentrate on driving you wild, and I very much want to do that. So no hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped his hands, his eyes turning the heat up a notch. I fanned myself. \"It\u0027s getting a bit hot in here, isn\u0027t it? Okay, so I was at your tie. Um... right, one tie, blue.\" I set the tie on the chair, then stepped back to consider him, ignoring the obvious bulge in his pants where men are wont to get a bit bulgy. \"That\u0027s a very handsome jacket, but I think it\u0027ll have to go as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am perfectly agreeable with your decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped his jacket off, tugging it down over his arms and laying it carefully across the back of the chair. I turned to eye him. \"Shoes next, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt down and untied his shoelaces, pulling off first one shoe, then the other. I refused to look up. I knew what was at eye level. \"Well, while I\u0027m down here, we might as well do the socks, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obligingly held up his foot while I pulled his sock off. I let my fingers trail down the long length of his feet, then repeated the action with his second foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have nice feet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. I have few complaints of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some men have hairy toes and ugly bits, but yours are nice.\" I gave both feet a little pat, then without looking at his midsection, stood up. \"Vest next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most assuredly so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped the vest off his arms, making sure to touch as much of him as I could. I looked at him and tipped my head to the side. \"Are you wild with excitement yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Not yet. You will have to try harder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, a challenge. I loved a challenge. I smiled to myself. \"Shirt, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the smile and answered it with one of his own. \"I look forward to that with the utmost expectations of enjoyment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Button one. Why, look, there\u0027s skin behind it!\" I kissed the exposed hollow of his throat. He sucked in a big wad of air. \"Button two. Oooh, chest hair. Nice.\" I kissed the bit of chest I\u0027d uncovered, and moved down the line. \"Button three. More chest hair, imagine that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m imagining, I\u0027m imagining.\" He groaned as I licked a trail down the vee of flesh I\u0027d bared. His hands were clenching and unclenching at his sides. I grinned up at him. \"You\u0027re being so good, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair of me to tease you anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you stop, I\u0027ll die,\" he said, his velvet voice rough with emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well, I wouldn\u0027t want that,\" I mumbled against his chest as I unbuttoned the next four buttons in quick succession. I crouched before him, holding on to his hips as I laved his belly button, watching with delight as his stomach muscles contracted under my touch. I stood up and tugged his shirt out of his pants, trailing my fingers across his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hand,\" I ordered, holding out my own. He put his hand in mine. I looked at it. It was a large hand, long-fingered and sensitive. \"Cuff link one.\" I switched hands. \"Cuff link two. And now...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid my hands up his belly, over the planes of his chest, over his shoulders, then down his arms, pushing the shirt off as I did so, pressing little kisses along a line to his collarbone. It was so much fun, I spent a little time doing that, but there was still more package to unwrap. I picked the shirt up and tossed it onto the chair, turning back to face that part of him that I\u0027d been avoiding looking at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll say one thing, you look a lot better without the cuts. Will you tell me what you were doing there that night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" he said, his beautiful voice thick with unspoken emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach wadded itself up into a little ball, feeling not at all like a stomach should feel. I stood looking at him, wondering if I were going to throw up, or if it was just a level of arousal that I\u0027d never felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allegra, if you do not wish to do this...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really was going to give me an out; I could see it in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I want to. I guess your belt is next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing, but his eyes spoke volumes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped forward and bit my lip as I unbuckled his belt, pulling it free from his pants and setting it on the chair with the rest of his clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That leaves just your pants. Are you... um... wearing underwear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darkened. \"I shall let you determine the answer to that question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked deeply into his eyes and told myself it was up to me. I didn\u0027t have to do anything I didn\u0027t want to do. I placed my hand on his zipper and felt him jump. The part behind the zipper, that is. \"I would say no on the underwear question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows rose. It took both hands, but at last I managed to unbutton the waistband and grab the little zipper tab, pulling it down as I stared into his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe boinged into my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I said as I looked down, thinking that when I\u0027d seen him before, he must have been really cold. \"My. Um. Okay. I\u0027ll just... um... hoo!\" I tore my eyes from his genitals and gently pushed his pants down his hips, carefully avoiding hitting my face on his erection as I tugged the material off each leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I guess that\u0027s it,\" I said a bit breathlessly as I tossed his pants onto the chair, unable to tear my gaze from his rampant parts. A thought suddenly intruded on my visual examination. I wetted my lips. \"You\u0027re not going to want me to... um...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristian tipped my chin up. \"I don\u0027t want you to do anything you don\u0027t desire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly I felt better. \"Good. Because I\u0027ve never really liked... well, good. Can I... would you mind if I just touched you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would very much enjoy that,\" he said gravely. I glanced quickly at his face to see if he was laughing at me, but there wasn\u0027t anything there but desire and want and approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was hot and silky and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um. You\u0027re not... er... circumcised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I noticed, because that bit just there isn\u0027t anything I\u0027ve seen before. What am I supposed to do with the extra bit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would you like to do with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI contemplated the extra bit. \"Well... does this do anything for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe veins stood out on his neck. \"Yes, yes, it does. You may do that anytime you are struck with the desire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, rather proud of myself. I can honestly say it\u0027s not often I\u0027ve made a man\u0027s eyes cross with just two fingers. I let my fingers do a little more walking, even daring to investigate the surrounding scenery. It was all very enjoyable, much more than I had ever imagined. Christian was just... right. It felt right to touch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you finished?\" Christian inquired politely as I gave his penis a fond pat. I looked up, concerned. His lovely, rich voice suddenly sounded as if he were gargling marbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now, unless you don\u0027t want me to do that again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, closed his eyes, then opened them back up. \"I can honestly say that the possibility of you repeating your actions will remain at the top of the list of events I fervently pray will occur. Frequently. Daily, if not hourly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" I smiled, pleased with myself. \"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now,\" he said, taking another deep breath and making an effort to smooth out the marbles to his usual silky smoothness, \"I believe it is my turn. Would you enjoy it more if you undressed yourself, or would you prefer for me to do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath caught and held as my mind squirreled around and around with the question. I reminded myself that I\u0027d done things with Christian that I\u0027d never enjoyed before, and that remaining in control did not mean one had to be a coward and take the easy path. \"I think I\u0027d like you to undress me. If you\u0027d like to, that is. I don\u0027t want to force you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swooped down on me with a noise deep in his chest that made something in my belly respond. His hands were everywhere, touching me, teasing me, plucking and pulling and unzipping and sliding my clothing off with such heated touches and whispered words of pleasure and little love nibbles that before I could catch my breath, I stood naked before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncluding my bad leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eeek,\" I said, hunching over and trying to cover up the length of scarred flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not eek when you stared at me - stared for at least an eternity - thus you are not allowed to hide yourself from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re telling me what to do,\" I told my kneecap, my arms around my leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m simply pointing out that what was fair for you is fair for me, Allegra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up as the teasing tone faded from his voice. He held his hand out for me. \"Let me see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My leg is ugly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if you believe it to be. Let me see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, how I wanted to believe he wouldn\u0027t look at all the ugly white, twisted tissue and not flinch. If anyone can do it, Christian can, an optimistic part of my mind said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027m going to straighten up. But if you stare at anything below my waist for more than two seconds, I\u0027m leaving. Deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand in his and let him haul me upright. His eyes burned into mine as he pulled me up against his body, never once looking down at the rest of me. There is no part of you that I will not worship as is your due. You are beauty and grace and everything a man can desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted as my nipples hardened against the soft brush of his chest hair. I caught an echo in my mind, a thought that I suspected he did not intend for me to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you are mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to let it go. He had kept his word, was making me feel desirable and excited and wanting more from him than I\u0027d ever wanted from a man, and all without feeling as if I were directed, controlled, just a bystander in the event. I made a seductive little purring sound I didn\u0027t know I could make, and rubbed up against him. \"You\u0027re poking me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands stroked up my behind to wrap around my waist, pulling me tighter against his arousal. His breath was hot on my ear as he kissed a hot path up my neck. \"I wish to make love to you; I wish to join our bodies and minds in the manner of Moravians. If you tell me to stop, I will, but understand that I will likely die in the process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid my fingers through his hair and licked his lips. I had no need to hesitate over the decision. I knew then that I could trust Christian to hold to his word no matter how intense things became. \"Yes, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me, his mouth taking possession in a way I had no objection to, scooping me up and carrying me to the mammoth bed, laying me down on cool satin sheets that rubbed erotically against my skin. He moaned as he followed me down on the bed, his hands and mouth stroking my breasts and belly until I was squirming with need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure foreplay is a very good thing, and I will be sure to appreciate it another time, but you know, I think right this moment I want something a little more substantial,\" I said, all without breathing. Christian was nibbling my belly, his hair trailing down my skin, leaving rivulets of fire behind. I squirmed against him as he looked down at the really personal part of me, then up to my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Command me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked and squirmed a bit more. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what you want me to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made an exasperated noise. \"This is your revenge, right? You want me to command you to make love to me? You want to hear the actual words?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would know exactly what you want me to do, yes. I am yours. Tell me what you want of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Okay, fine, whatever. I command you to make love to me. There, are you happy now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make love to you how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped stroking his arm and poked him in the shoulder. \"Do I have to draw you a picture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, causing his hair to feather out over my belly. I shivered and tried to will him up my body. \"Just tell me what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my legs up alongside his legs, uncaring for the moment that the scars were plainly visible. \"I want to feel you, all of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes? Where?\" he asked as he slid forward along my body until his mouth was level with my breasts. He paused to pay tribute to them. I arched my back and parted my legs wider, sliding them up his thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to feel you pressed against me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved up until his mouth was on my collarbone. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to feel you inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands cupped my hips as he moved up higher, the hard length of him parting those delicate parts of me that I\u0027d previously considered purely functional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a delicious sort of stretching as my body accommodated his, and then he opened his mind to me, flooding me with the feelings of heat and tightness and overwhelming pleasure that he felt. I wrapped my legs around his hips as he started to move within me, kissing his neck and clutching at his back as every tiny little atom of my body joined with his in absolute ecstasy. I drowned in his pleasure and fed him my own, pushing us both higher as our bodies danced in a rhythm that left us both straining, moving to please ourselves, moving to please each other, pushing our bodies together harder and faster until I felt us bursting into a white blaze of rapture. I heard Christian sing my name just before his teeth pierced the flesh beneath my ear. I arched against him, still locked in our shared orgasm, driven past that point by the exultation he felt as he feasted on my blood. What should have been a forbidden, repulsive act was instead erotic, wild, carnal, and built within me a need I hardly dared put a name to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue was hot on my neck, pulling me back from the euphoria our joining had brought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay trembling with wonderful little aftershocks, holding tightly to him, reveling in his ragged breath and heaving chest, warm and safe and for the first time in my life, truly at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat have you done? I asked, a languid hand lazily stroking the hard curves of his behind. What have you done to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head and looked down at me, his lips brushing a gentle salute on mine, his eyes burning red and gold and brown, more variations of color than I\u0027d thought existed. Slowly, ever so slowly, his lips curled up in an extremely smug, thoroughly male smile. The expression is, I believe, \"rocked your world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit his shoulder as he rolled us over. \"You bit me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bit me, as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I didn\u0027t guzzle down your blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not guzzle, I never guzzle. I sipped. Carefully. Worshipfully. Gratefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up from where my cheek was pressed against Christian\u0027s heart. The bed might be the very height of comfort, but he was much more comfortable. \"Worshipfully, eh? What did I taste like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled one of his patented lazy smiles. \"Like a woman who doesn\u0027t know the depth of her own passion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beast,\" I said, settling back down on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were warm on my behind. \"And have I captured Beauty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted upward until I had my chin resting on my hands, stacked together on his breastbone. \"I might be inclined to answer that if you answer a few more of my questions first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands trailed up my back, making random little swirly patterns that were sending shivers of heat out from my belly to every point on my body. \"Would I be correct in guessing that the first question was what I was doing in the basement of the inn, naked and covered in ninety-four cuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would.\" I nodded, breathing a little heavier as his hands moved downward again to paint circles on my behind. \"Ninety-four? How do you know there were ninety-four cuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes. \"Because I made them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned up at him, waiting for the rest of the explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve worn me out with your lustful demands. I\u0027m sleepy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vampires don\u0027t get sleepy. Tell me about your plan in the inn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a gentle little snore. I turned my head and took one pert little brown nipple in my mouth. His eyes shot open. I pulled away long enough to say, \"If you value this nipple\u0027s life, you\u0027ll finish answering the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed in mock regret. \"I have unleashed a dragon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have always been a dragon; I was just hidden in an innocent maiden\u0027s form. Why did you cut yourself ninety-four times and lie bleeding, if not to death, then at least to a weakened state that had to be dangerous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I had arranged through a contact that you do not need to know about for Guarda White and Eduardo Tassalerro to hear that another Dark One had been caught and was being held in an extremely weakened state in the basement of an old, abandoned inn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weakened, hence the need to appear as if you had lost lots of blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands slid off my behind, lower, to the tops of my thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. Unfortunately, just as White and Tassalerro arrived to examine the bait, a plucky Summoner came to save me from the horrors of eternal torment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers slid between my thighs, heading into an area that had me opening my eyes up very wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is something deeply erotic about a woman who mutters sweet nothings of the eep caliber into the chin of her partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers delved. They parted. They stroked. They did things that I had no idea fingers could do in the parts in question. Oh, I knew they could, I just didn\u0027t know they could, if you get my drift. I shifted and squirmed and wiggled around on him, feeling him harden beneath me as his fingers moved to a seductive dance in my heated flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, ignoring the stab of pain in my leg as I straddled him, my thighs on either side of his hips as I looked down at the man beneath me. His eyes were open now, hot with need and passion, bright with longing so strong it stripped the breath from my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my fingers around his hard length and leaned forward, swirling my tongue around the previously abused nipple. \"Tell me what you want, Christian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moaned. You.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stroked him as I kissed my way over to his other nipple. I suckled on it for a moment, scraping it gently with my teeth, enjoying the sound of him sucking in his breath. \"Tell me what you want me to do to you, Christian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands shifted to my hips, gripping them as he lifted me straight up in the air. I looked down. He was poised beneath me. I want you, Allegra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached down and teased him, pushing back the extra bit of skin and running my fingers around in investigative circles. You want me how?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered me as I directed him where I wanted him, his hardness nudging aside all the now tingly bits of me to push into the welcoming heat of my body. I want you around me, in me, joined with me. I want to feel our hearts beat together, our breaths merged until they cannot be separated, our minds one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I cried as I sank down upon him, sobs of pleasure catching in my throat. The darkness within him swirled around us and in us until he was torn between the joy of our joining and the pain of his torment. I moved upon him, finding a rhythm that I knew through our joined minds pleased him as much as it did me, and fed him my pleasure as I accepted his. Despair shadowed us until I opened my heart and took it into me, molding it, warping it, changing it into an intense sense of satisfaction that sank deep into our bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou are light, you are salvation, Christian breathed into my mind as our bodies quickened the pace, racing now for that final moment of completion so perfect it brought tears of happiness to my eyes. You take my pain and give me only joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes, wanting to see his as we reached our climax together, wanting to see deep inside him to the emptiness I knew I could fill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were created for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were an impossible, glowing midnight, so filled with emotion it almost hurt to look into them. Ecstasy coiled tighter and tighter within me until I felt as if I were going to fracture into a thousand pieces. Beneath me Christian\u0027s need built, raging through him, burning hot and hard, burning just for me. I leaned down over him, offering myself, wanting, needing him to take what only I could give him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cannot live without you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth pierced the skin above my breast, the sensation of pleasure so strong it pushed me over the edge until we were one body, one mind, one being as we succumbed to the power of our passion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeloved, his mind echoed in mine as we burned bright for an eternity. You are my Beloved. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sex-and-the-single-vampire-dark-ones-2/page-9.html","bookId":2203,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:00 PM"}
