It lifted its gloominess in a rocky, angular height that overshadowed the Imperial barracks beyond it, just as its shadow clutched at the Terrestrial malefactor far more than did the unexerted authority of the Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin its walls many an Earthman in past centuries had waited for the judgment that came to one who falsified or evaded the quotas of production, who lived past his time, or connived at another\u0027s such crime, or who was guilty of attempting subversion of the local government. Occasionally, when the petty prejudices of Terrestrial justice made particularly little sense to the sophisticated and usually blas�� Imperial government of the time, a conviction might be set aside by the Procurator, but this meant insurrection, or, at the very least, wild riots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrdinarily, where the Council demanded death, the Procurator yielded. After all. it was only Earthmen who suffered- Of all this, Joseph Schwartz, very naturally, knew nothing. To him, immediate optical awareness consisted of a small room, its walls transfused with but a dim light, its furniture consisting of two hard benches and a table, plus a small recess in the wall that served as washroom and sanitary convenience combined. There was no window for a glimpse of sky, and the drift of air into the room through the ventilating shaft was feeble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rubbed the hair that circled his bald spot and sat up ruefully. His attempt to escape to nowhere (for where on Earth was he safe?) had been short, not sweet, and had ended here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least there was the Mind Touch to play with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut was that bad or good?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the farm it had been a queer, disturbing gift, the nature of which he did not know, the possibilities of which he did not think of. Now it was a flexible gift to be investigated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith nothing to do for twenty-four hours but brood on imprisonment, he could have been courting madness. As it was, he could Touch the jailers as they passed, reach out for guardsmen in the adjacent corridors, extend the furthest fibrils of his mind even to the Captain of the Hall in his distant office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned the minds over delicately and probed them. They fell apart like so many walnuts-dry husks out of which emotions and notions fell in a sibilant rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe learned much in the process of Earth and Empire-more than he had, or could have, in all two months on the farm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course one of the items that he learned, over and over again, beyond any chance of mistaking, was just this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was condemned to death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no escape, no doubt, no reservation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might be today; it might be tomorrow. But he would diet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow it sank in and he accepted it almost gratefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened, and he was on his feet, in tense fear. One might accept death reasoningly, with every aspect of the conscious mind, but the body was a brute beast that knew nothing of reason. This was it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo-it wasn\u0027t. The entering Mind Touch held nothing of death in it. It was a guard with a metal rod held ready in his hand. Schwartz knew what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with me,\" he said sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz followed him, speculating on this odd power of his. Long before his guard could use his weapon, long before he could possibly know he should, he could be struck down without a sound, without a giveaway moment. His Mind was in Schwartz\u0027s mental hands. A slight squeeze and it would be over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why? There would be others. How many could he handle at once? How many pairs of hands were in his mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed, docilely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a large, large room that he was brought into. Two men and a girl occupied it, stretched out corpsewise on high, high benches. Yet not corpses-since three active minds were much in evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParalyzed! Familiar?...Were they familiar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was stopping to look, but the guard\u0027s hard hand was on his shoulder. \"Get on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a fourth slab, empty. There was no death in the guard\u0027s mind, so Schwartz climbed on. He knew what was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard\u0027s steely rod touched each of his limbs. They tingled and left him, so that he was nothing but a head, floating on nothingness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pola,\" he cried. \"You\u0027re Pola, aren\u0027t you? The girl who-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was nodding. He hadn\u0027t recognized her Touch as such. He had never been aware of it that time two months ago. At that time his mental progression had reached only the stage of sensitivity to \"atmosphere.\" In the brilliance of hindsight, he remembered that well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut from the contents he could still learn much. The one past the girl was Dr. Shekt; the one furthest of all was Dr. Bel Arvardan. He could filch their names, sense their despair, taste the last dregs of horror and fright in the young girl\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment he pitied them, and then he remembered who they were and what they were. And he hardened his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet them die!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other three had been there for the better part of an hour. The room in which they were left was evidently one used for assemblies of several hundred. The prisoners were lost and lonely in its size. Nor was there anything to say. Arvardan\u0027s throat bummed dryly and he turned his head from side to side with a futile restlessness. It was the only part of his body that he could move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShekt\u0027s eyes were closed and his lips were colorless and pinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan whispered fiercely, \"Shekt. Shekt, I say!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?...What?\" A feeble whisper at best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing? Going to sleep? Think, man, think!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? What is there to think of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is this Joseph Schwartz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePola\u0027s voice sounded, thin and weary. \"Don\u0027t you remember, Bel? That time in the department store, when I first met you-so long ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan wrenched wildly and found he could lift his head two aching inches. A bit of Pola\u0027s face was just visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pola! Pola!\" If he could have moved toward her-as for two months he might have and hadn\u0027t. She was looking at him, smiling so wanly that it might be a statue\u0027s smile, and he said, \"We\u0027ll win out yet. You\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was shaking her head-and his neck gave way, its tendons in panging agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shekt,\" he said again. \"Listen to me. How did you meet this Schwartz? Why was he a patient of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Synapsifier. He came as a volunteer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And was treated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan revolved that in his mind. \"What made him come to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then-Maybe he is an Imperial agent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Schwartz followed his thought well and smiled to himself. He said nothing, and he meant to keep on saying nothing.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShekt stirred his head. \" An Imperial agent? You mean because the High Priest\u0027s Secretary says he is. Oh, nonsense. And what difference does it make? He\u0027s as helpless as we...Listen, Arvardan, maybe, if we tell some sort of concerted story, they might wait. Eventually we might-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archaeologist laughed hollowly, and his throat burned at the friction. \"We might live, you mean. With the Galaxy dead and civilization in ruins? Live? I might as well die!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking of Pola,\" muttered Shekt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am too,\" said the other. \"Ask her...Pola, shall we surrender? Shall we try to live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePola\u0027s voice was firm. \"I have chosen my side. I don\u0027t want to die, but if my side dies, I\u0027ll go with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan felt somehow triumphant. When he brought her to Sirius, they might call her an Earthgirl, but she was their equal, and he would, with a great and good pleasure, smash teeth into the throat of any- And he remembered that he wasn\u0027t likely to bring her to Sirius-to bring anyone to Sirius. There wasn\u0027t likely to be a Sirius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as though to escape from the thought, to escape anywhere, he shouted, \"You! Whatchername! Schwartz!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz raised his head for a moment and allowed a glance to ooze out toward the other. He still said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" demanded Arvardan. \"How did you get mixed up in this? What\u0027s your part in it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at the question, all the injustice of everything descended on Schwartz. All the harmlessness of his past, all the infinite horror of the present burst in upon him, so that he said in a fury, \"1? How did I get mixed up in it? Listen. I was once a nobody. An honest man, a hard-working tailor. I hurt nobody, I bothered nobody, I took care, of my family. And then, for no reason, for no reason-I came here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To Chica?\" asked Arvardan, who did not quite follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not to Chica!\" shouted Schwartz in wild derision. \"I came to this whole mad world...Oh, what do I care if you believe me or not? My world is in the past. My world had land and food and two billion people, and it was the only world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan fell silent before the verbal assault. He turned to Shekt. \"Can you understand him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you realize,\" said Shekt in feeble wonder, \"that he has a vermiform appendix, which is three and a half inches long? Do you remember, Pola? And wisdom teeth. And hair on his face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes,\" shouted Schwartz defiantly. \u0027.And I wish I had a tail I could show you. I\u0027m from the past. I traveled through time. Only I don\u0027t know how, and I don\u0027t know why. Now leave me alone.\" He added suddenly, \"They will soon be here for us. This wait is just to break us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan said suddenly, \"Do you know that? Who told you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it the Secretary? Stocky man with a pug nose?\" Schwartz had no way of telling the physical appearance of those he Touched only by mind, but-secretary? There had been just a glimpse of a Touch, a powerful one of a man of power, and it seemed he had been a secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Balkis?\" he asked in curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" said Arvardan, but Shekt interrupted, \"That\u0027s the name of the Secretary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t say anything,\" said Schwartz. \"I know. It\u0027s death for an of us, and there\u0027s no way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan lowered his voice. \"He\u0027s mad, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder...His skull sutures, now. They were primitive, very primitive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan was amazed. \"You mean-Oh, come, it\u0027s impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always supposed so.\" For the moment Shekt\u0027s voice was a feeble imitation of normality, as though the presence of a scientific problem had switched his mind to that detached and objective groove in which personal matters disappeared. \"They\u0027ve calculated the energy required to displace matter along the time axis and a value greater than infinity was arrived at, so the project has always been looked upon as impossible. But others have talked of the possibility of \u0027time faults,\u0027 analogous to geological faults, you know. Space ships have disappeared, for one thing, almost in fun view. There\u0027s the famous case of Hor Devallow in ancient times, who stepped into his house one day and never came out, and wasn\u0027t inside, either...And then there\u0027s the planet, which you\u0027ll find in the Galactography books of the last century, which was visited by three expeditions that brought back fun descriptions-and then was never seen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then there are certain developments in nuclear chemistry that seem to deny the law of conservation of mass-energy. They\u0027ve tried to explain that by postulating the escape of some mass along the time axis. Uranium nuclei, for instance, when mixed with copper and barium in minute but definite proportions, under the influence of light gamma irradiation, set up a resonating system-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father,\" said Pola, \"don\u0027t! There\u0027s no use-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Arvardan\u0027s interruption was peremptory. \"Wait, now. Let me think. I\u0027m the one who can settle this. Who better? Let me ask him a few questions...Look, Schwartz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz looked up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yours was the only world in the Galaxy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz nodded, then said dully, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you only thought that. I mean you didn\u0027t have space travel, so you couldn\u0027t check up. There might have been many other inhabited worlds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no way of telling that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course. A pity. What about atomic power?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had an atomic bomb. Uranium-and plutonium-I guess that\u0027s what made this world radioactive. There must have been another war after all-after I left...Atomic bombs.\" Somehow Schwartz was back in Chicago, back in his old world, before the bombs. And he wits sorry. Not for himself, but for that beautiful world...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Arvardan was muttering to himself. Then, \" All right. You had a language, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Earth? Lots of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"English-after I was a grown man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, say something in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor two months or more Schwartz had said nothing in English. But now, with lovingness, he said slowly, \"I want to go home and be with my own people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan spoke to Shekt. \"18 that the language he used when he was Synapsified, Shekt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell,\" said Shekt, in mystification. \"Queer sounds then and queer sounds now. How can I relate them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, never mind...What\u0027s your word for \u0027mother\u0027 in your language, Schwartz?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. How about \u0027father\u0027... \u0027brother\u0027...\u0027one\u0027-the numeral, that is...\u0027two\u0027...\u0027three\u0027...\u0027house\u0027...\u0027man\u0027...\u0027wife\u0027...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis went on and on, and when Arvardan paused for breath his expression was one of awed bewilderment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shekt,\" he said, \"either this man is genuine or I\u0027m the victim of as wild a nightmare as can be conceived. He\u0027s speaking a language practically equivalent to the inscriptions found in the fifty-thousand-year-old strata on Sirius, Arcturus, Alpha Centauri, and twenty others. He speaks it. The language has only been deciphered in the last generation, and there aren\u0027t a dozen men in the Galaxy besides myself who can understand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I sure? Of course I\u0027m sure. I\u0027m an archaeologist. It\u0027s my business to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant Schwartz felt his armor of aloofness cracking. For the first time he felt himself regaining the individuality he had lost. The secret was out; he was a man from the past, and they accepted it. It proved him sane, stilled forever that haunting doubt, and he was grateful. And yet he held aloof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to have him.\" It was Arvardan again, burning in the holy flame of his profession. \"Shekt, you have no idea what this means to archaeology. Shekt-it\u0027s a man from the past. Oh, Great Space!...Listen, we can make a deal. This is the proof Earth is looking for. They can have him. They can-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz interrupted sardonically. \"I know what you\u0027re thinking. You think that Earth will prove itself to be the source of civilization through me and that they will be grateful for it. I tell you, no! I\u0027ve thought of it and I would have bartered for my own life. But they won\u0027t believe me-or you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s absolute proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t listen. Do you know why? Because they have certain fixed notions about the past. Any change would be blasphemy in their eyes, even if it were the truth. They don\u0027t want the truth; they want their traditions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bel,\" said Pola, \"I think he\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan ground his teeth. \"We could try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would fail,\" insisted Schwartz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know!\" And the words fell with such oracular insistence that Arvardan was silent before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Shekt who was looking at him now with a strange light in his tired eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asked softly, \"Have you felt any bad effects as a result of the Synapsifier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz didn\u0027t know the word but caught the meaning. They had operated, and on his mind. How much he was learning!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"No bad effects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I see you learned our language rapidly. You speak it very well. In fact, you might be a native. Doesn\u0027t it surprise you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always had a very good memory,\" was the cold response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And so you feel no different now than before you were treated?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Shekt\u0027s eyes were hard now, and he said, \"Why do you bother? You know that I\u0027m certain you know what I\u0027m thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz laughed shortly. \"That I can read minds? Well. what of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Shekt had dropped him. He had turned his white, helpless face to Arvardan. \"He can sense minds, Arvardan. How much I could do with him. And to be here-to be helpless...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What-what-what-\" Arvardan popped wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even Pola\u0027s face somehow gained interest. \"Can you really?\" she asked Schwartz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at her. She had taken care of him. and now they would kill her. Yet she was a traitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShekt was saying, \" Arvardan, you remember the bacteriologist I told you about, the one who died as a result of the effects of the Synapsifier? One of the first symptoms of mental breakdown was his claim that he could read minds. And he could. I found that out before he died, and it\u0027s been my secret. I\u0027ve told no one-but it\u0027s possible, Arvardan, it\u0027s possible. You see, with the lowering of brain-cell resistance, the brain may be able to pick up the magnetic fields induced by the microcurrents of other\u0027s thoughts and reconvert it into similar vibrations in itself. It\u0027s the same principle as that of any ordinary recorder. It would be telepathy in every sense of the word-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchwartz maintained a stubborn and hostile silence as Arvardan turned slowly in his direction. \"If this is so, Shekt, we might be able to use him.\" The archaeologist\u0027s mind was spinning wildly, working out impossibilities. \"There may be a way out now. There must be a way out. For us and the Galaxy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Schwartz was cold to the tumult in the Mind Touch he sensed so clearly. He said, \"You mean by my reading their minds? How would that help? Of course I can do more than read minds. How\u0027s that, for instance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a light push, but Arvardan yelped at the sudden pain of it..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did that,\" said Schwartz. \"Want more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArvardan gasped, \"You can do that to the guards? To the Secretary? Why did you let them bring you here? Great Galaxy, Shekt, there\u0027ll be no trouble. Now, listen, Schwartz-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Schwartz, \"you listen. Why do I want to get out? Where will I be? Still on this dead world. I want to go home, and I can\u0027t go home. I want my people and my world, and I can\u0027t have them. And I want to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s a question of all the Galaxy, Schwartz. You can\u0027t think of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t I? Why not? Must I worry about your Galaxy now? I hope your Galaxy rots and dies. I know what Earth is planning to do, and I am glad. The young lady said before she had chosen her side. Well, I\u0027ve chosen my side, and my side is Earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? I\u0027m an Earthman!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pebble-in-the-sky-galactic-empire-3/page-16.html","bookId":1726,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:11 AM"}
