I quickly tossed my unfolded sweater in my suitcase. It was only February. Even Vegas was cold in February.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo what do I owe the pleasure, Fang?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need to talk to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe. No. I don\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s going on, Fang?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, and I was suddenly alarmed to discover my normally dormant heart had picked up its pace. It thudded steadily against my ribs, rocking me slightly. Normally, my own beating heart went unnoticed, which wasn\u0027t too surprising since these days it generally only beat about five times a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong. Or something could potentially be wrong. Or something was just...off. For starters, Fang seemed unusually closed to me. Not to mention, he didn\u0027t seem to be picking up on my own increasingly worried thoughts. What the hell was going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little pencil icon appeared in the IM box, which meant Fang was typing something. A moment later, his words appeared:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently...met someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould this someone happen to be a female?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t horrible news. At least, not for me. I liked Fang. I appreciated his friendship and help. But I had always felt he had an ulterior motive: he wanted something from me. And what he wanted, he had made clear a year ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted me to turn him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I didn\u0027t doubt that he loved me, I always wondered where the love originated. Was it for me, or for what I am? A thought suddenly occurred to me, and I voiced it. Or, rather, wrote it:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs this woman a...vampire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA real vampire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA real vampire, Moon Dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay I ask her name?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething inside me turned to ice, which, for me, is saying something. I exhaled a steady stream of cold air, and wrote: Detective Rachel Hanner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did you two meet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came in the other night, sat at the bar. Ordered a glass of white wine, same as you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read his words and would have held my breath, except I was never sure when I held my breath these days. He went on:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something about her. Something...otherworldly. The way she stared at me. Her small, precise movements. Her faint accent. It wasn\u0027t long before I suspected what she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited, re-reading his words, thinking hard, puzzling through this. What did this mean? I didn\u0027t know yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until later, after her second glass of wine, that I realized she had been reading my mind. Her intrusion wasn\u0027t obvious. Not like the way I know when you\u0027re in there. I mean, I can always feel when you\u0027re in my mind, Moon Dance. Touching down here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused and I was truly feeling sick. Down the hallway, I heard Anthony snoring lightly. Music came from Tammy\u0027s room. The house was locked. I always kept it locked. What was Hanner up to? I didn\u0027t know, but I had that creepy-ass feeling of being watched. Of course, with me, it might be more than a feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood and walked over to my main window and looked out into the cul-de-sac. No one was out there. At least, not that I could see. All the cars on the street I recognized. But with Hanner - the only other vampire that I knew personally - she could be anywhere. She could be sitting on my roof, for all I knew. I shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back down and Fang\u0027s next message appeared almost instantaneously: I think within a few minutes, she knew all my secrets. All of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what Fang meant. The man had some killer secrets. Literally. The kind that would send him back to jail - or a mental institution - for the rest of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see, I wrote, mostly to let Fang know I was still here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe showed me her badge and told me she knew who I was. She called me by my name...my real name. She next gave me her home address and told me to meet her there after work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen was this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened next, Fang?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if Fang knew what had happened. After all, I knew that Hanner had a...gift for removing memories. Indeed, I sensed a lot of vagueness from Fang, and it was clear that our personal connection had been broken, somehow. I thought Hanner had something to do with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m...I\u0027m not really sure, he wrote, confirming my suspicions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a vision of blood, a lot of blood. Fang might have been more closed off to me than normal and, although I wasn\u0027t sure what the hell was going on, we still seemed to have some sort of connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough for me to see the blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut most disturbing of all -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote: You drank blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused only slightly before writing: Yes, Moon Dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sensed his shame, but I also sensed his excitement. Fang had grown up with elongated canine teeth, a rare defect that had grown into an even rarer psychosis: as a youth, he began to actually believe he was a vampire. Crazy, but that was exactly what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis psychosis had led to the death of his girlfriend, a teenage girl who had been partially bled to death...and partially consumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Fang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis escape from a high-security mental institution had been in all the papers, and his subsequent manhunt had been well documented. But he had slipped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd assumed a new identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAaron Parker, aka Fang, now went by the official name of Eli Roberts - and how he landed in my life was one of coincidence and obsession. Although I doubted he still saw himself as a real vampire, I knew he retained a hunger for blood. I knew this because every now and then I would see it in his thoughts. His hunger. But over the years, he had controlled himself. Controlled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were both silent. Or, rather, the IM message box remained silent. I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. I sensed that Hanner was working her way into his world, but for what reason, I didn\u0027t know. But one thing I did know: none of it was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what will you do now, Fang? I finally wrote, deciding on the direct path. What else could I say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know, Moon Dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she threaten you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have to. I understand the implications. I\u0027m a fugitive. She\u0027s a cop. Things could go very badly for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she say what she wanted?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom me? Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wants something from you, Fang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sensed him nodding, and after a moment, he wrote: I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I sensed he was holding something back, and finally wrote: There\u0027s something else, isn\u0027t there, Fang?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Moon Dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited, suddenly afraid of the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, he wrote: She wants to give me something, Moon Dance. The one thing you wouldn\u0027t do for me, the one thing you wouldn\u0027t give me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, Fang...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Moon Dance.
