Almost euphemistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what is our \u0027obvious value\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ward, each of us has approached a common problem - survival on this planet - in somewhat different ways.

We\u0027ll need fertile soil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Methane,\" he muttered. He forgot what point he was going to make in the wake of the new illumination dawning on him. \"You want our hydrogen facilities!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes went wide at the quickness of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need the hydrogen to get into space,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we need it for cooking, heating and driving our few engines,\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have methane, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We separate hydrogen electronically and -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very efficient,\" he said. He tried to keep the pride out of his voice, but it leaked through all the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You use those beautiful separation membranes and the high pressure of deep water,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Score one for organics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But organics are not the best way to build a whole technology,\" she said. \"Look how it\u0027s bogged you down. Your technology should support and protect you, help you to progress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was argued out generations ago,\" he said. \"Islanders know what you think about organics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That argument is not over,\" she insisted. \"And with the hyb tanks ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re coming to us, now,\" he said, \"because we have a way with tissues.\" He allowed himself a tight smile. \"And I note that you also come to us for the most delicate surgery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We understand that organics once represented the most convenient way for you to survive topside,\" she said. \"But times are changing and we -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are changing them,\" he challenged. He backed off at the frustration visible in her clenched jaw, noting the flash of something bright in her blue eyes. \"Times are always changing,\" he said, his voice softer. \"The question remains: How do we best adapt to change?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It requires all of your energies just to maintain yourselves and your organics,\" she snapped, not softening. \"Islands starve sometimes. But we do not starve. And within a generation we will walk beneath open sky on dry land!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel shrugged. The shrug irritated the prosthetic supports for his large head. He could feel his neck muscles growing tired, snaking their whips of pain up the back of his neck, crowning his scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think of that old argument in light of this change?\" she asked. It was voiced as a challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are creating sea barriers, new surflines that can sink Islands,\" he said. \"You do this to further a Merman way of life. An Islander would be foolish not to ask whether you\u0027re doing this to sink the Islands and drown us Mutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ward.\" She shook her head before continuing. \"Ward, the end of Island life as you know it will come in our lifetime. That\u0027s not necessarily bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot in my lifetime, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you understand that?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to facilitate your kind of change,\" he said. \"That makes me the Judas goat. You know about Judas, Kareen? And goats?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shadow of unmistakable impatience crossed her face. \"I\u0027m trying to impress on you how soon Islanders must change. That is a fact and it must be dealt with, distasteful or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re also trying to get our hydrogen facilities,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to keep you above our Merman political squabbles,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somehow, Kareen, I don\u0027t have confidence in you. I suspect that you don\u0027t have the approval of your own people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve had enough of this,\" Panille interrupted. \"I warned you, Kareen, that an Islander -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me handle this,\" she said, and quieted him with a lift of her hand. \"If it\u0027s a mistake, it\u0027s my mistake.\" To Keel, she said, \"Can you find confidence in retrieving the hyb tanks or settling the land? Can you see the value in restoring the kelp to consciousness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s an act, he thought. She\u0027s playing to me. Or to Shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what end and by what means?\" he asked, stalling for more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what end? We\u0027ll finally have some real stability. All of us. It\u0027s something that\u0027ll pull all of us together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seems so cool, so smooth, he thought. But something\u0027s not quite right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027re your priorities?\" he asked. \"The kelp, the land or the hyb tanks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My people want the hyb tanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are your people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Panille, who said, \"A majority, that\u0027s who her people are. That\u0027s how we operate down under.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel looked down at him. \"And what are your priorities, Shadow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Personally?\" His eyes left the screen reluctantly. \"The kelp. Without it this planet\u0027s an endless struggle for survival.\" He gestured to the screens, which, Keel reminded himself, somehow had Islander lives balancing on them. \"You saw what it can do,\" Panille said. \"Right now it\u0027s keeping Vashon in deep water. That\u0027s handy. It\u0027s survival.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that\u0027s a sure thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. We have everything that was recovered from the old Redoubt after the inundation. We\u0027ve a good idea what\u0027s in the hyb tanks. They can wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel looked at Ale. \"Sure, things worry me. I know what\u0027s supposed to be in those tanks. What do your records say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have every reason to believe the hyb tanks contain earthside plant and animal life, everything Ship considered necessary for colonization. And there may be as many as thirty thousand human beings - all preserved indefinitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel snorted at the phrase \"every reason to believe.\" They don\u0027t know after all, he thought. This is a blind shot. He looked up at the ceiling, thinking of those bits of plasteel and plaz and all that flesh swinging in a wide loop around Pandora, year after year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There could be anything up there,\" Keel said. \"Anything.\" He knew it was fear speaking. He looked accusingly at Ale. \"You claim to represent a majority of Mermen, yet I sense a furtiveness in your activities.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are political sensitivities -\" She broke off. \"Ward, our space project will continue whether I\u0027m successful with you or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Successful? With me?\" There seemed to be no end to her manipulative schemes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAle exhaled, more of a hiss than a sigh. \"If I fail, Ward, the chances for the Islanders look bad. We want to start a civilization, not a war. Don\u0027t you understand? We\u0027re offering the Islanders land for colonization.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhhh, the bait!\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel thought about the impact such an offer might have on Islanders. Many would leap at it - the poor Islanders, such as those of Guemes, the little drifters living from sea to mouth. Vashon might be another matter. But Merman riches were being exposed in this offer. Many Islanders harbored deep feelings of jealousy over those riches. It would worsen. The complexity of what Ale proposed began to lay itself out in his mind - a problem to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need information,\" he said. \"How close are you to going into space?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shadow,\" Ale said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanille punched keys on his console. The screen in front of him displayed a pair of images with a dividing line down the middle. On the left was an underwater view of a tower,- its dimensions not clear to Keel until he realized that the tiny shapes around it were not fish, but Mermen workers. The view on the right showed the tower protruding from the sea and, with the proportions clear from the left screen, Keel realized that the thing must lift fifty meters above the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will be one space launch today or tomorrow, depending on the weather,\" Ale said. \"A test, our first manned shot. It won\u0027t be long after that when we go up after the hyb tanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why has no Island reported that thing?\" Keel asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We steer you away from it,\" Panille said with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel shook his aching head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This explains the sightings you\u0027ve heard of, the Islander claims that Ship is returning,\" Ale said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How amusing for you!\" Keel blurted. \"The simple Islanders with their primitive superstitions.\" He glared at her. \"You know some of my people are claiming your rockets as a sign the world is ending. If you\u0027d only brought the C/P into this ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a bad decision,\" she said. \"We admit it. That\u0027s why you\u0027re here. What do we do about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel scratched his head. His neck ached abominably against the prosthetic braces. He sensed things between the lines here ... Panille coming in on cue. Ale saying mostly what she had planned to say. Keel was an old political in-fighter, though, aware that he could not tip his hand too soon. Ale wanted him to learn things - things she had planned for him to learn. It was the concealed lesson that he was after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do we make Islanders comfortable with the truth?\" Keel countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have time for Islander philosophizing,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel bristled. \"That\u0027s just another way of calling us lazy. Just staying alive occupies most of us full-time. You think we\u0027re not busy because we\u0027re not building rockets. We\u0027re the ones who don\u0027t have time. We don\u0027t have time for pretty phrases and planning -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it!\" she snapped. \"If the two of us can\u0027t get along, how can we expect better of our people?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel turned his head to look at her with one eye and then with the other. He suppressed a smile. Two things amused him. She had a point, and she could lose her composure. He lifted both hands and rubbed at his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAle was instantly solicitous, aware of Keel\u0027s problem from their many encounters on the debate floor. \"You\u0027re tired,\" she said. \"Would you like to rest and have a cup of coffee or something more solid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A good cup of Vashon\u0027s best would suit me,\" he said. He tugged at the prosthetic on his right. \"And this damned thing off my neck for a while. You wouldn\u0027t happen to have a chairdog, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Organics are rare down under,\" she said. \"I\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t provide Islander comforts for everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wanted a massage,\" he said. \"Mermen are missing a bet by not having a few chairdogs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure we can find you a massage,\" Kareen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have the high incidence of health problems that you have topside,\" Panille interrupted. Again, his eyes were on the screen filled with numbers and he spoke almost out of another consciousness. Still, Keel couldn\u0027t let the remark pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Young man,\" he said, \"I suspect you are brilliant in your work. Don\u0027t let the confidence of that accomplishment spill over into other areas. You have a great deal yet to learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning to lean on Ale\u0027s arm, he allowed himself to be assisted out into the passageway, feeling the stares that followed them. He was glad to get out of that room. Something about it wriggled chills up and down his spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I convinced you?\" Ale asked. He shuffled along beside her, his legs aching, his head filled with bits of information that he knew would soon inflict themselves upon his people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have convinced me that Mermen will do this thing,\" he said. \"You have the wealth, the organization, the determination.\" He lurched and caught himself. \"I\u0027m not used to decks that don\u0027t roll,\" he explained. \"Living on land is hard for an old-timer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone can\u0027t go onto the land at once,\" she said. \"Only the most needy at first. We think other Islands will have to be moored offshore ... or rafts may be built for such nearby moorage. They\u0027ll be temporary living quarters until the agricultural system is well along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel thought about this a moment, then: \"You have been thinking this out for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Organizing Islanders\u0027 lives for them and -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to figure out how to save the lot of you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" He laughed. \"By putting us on bedroom rafts near shore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027d be ideal,\" she said. He could see a genuine excitement in her eyes. \"As the need for them vanished, we could let them die off and use them for fertilizers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our Islands, too, no doubt - fertilizer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s about all they\u0027ll be good for when we have enough open land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeel could not keep the bitterness out of his voice. \"You do not understand, Kareen. I can see that. An Island is not a dead piece of ... of land. It\u0027s alive! It is our mother. It supports us because we give it loving care. You are condemning our mother to a bag of fertilizer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at him a moment, then: \"You seem to think Islanders are the only ones giving up a way of life. Those of us who go back to the surface -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will still have access to the deeps,\" he said. \"You are not cutting the umbilical cord. We would suffer more in the transition. You seem willing to ignore this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not ignoring it, dammit! That\u0027s why you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to end the sparring, he thought. Time to show her that I don\u0027t really trust her or believe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hiding things from me,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve studied you for a long time, Kareen. There\u0027s something boiling in you, something big and important. You\u0027re trying to control what I learn, feeding me selected information to gain my cooperation. You -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ward, I -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t interrupt. The quickest way to gain my cooperation is to open up, share everything with me. I will help if that\u0027s what should be done. I will not help, I will resist, if I feel you are concealing anything from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped them at a dogged hatch and stared at it without focusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know me, Kareen,\" he prompted. \"I say what I mean. I will fight you. I will leave ... unless you restrain me ... and I will campaign against -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right!\" She glared up at him. \"Restrain you? I wouldn\u0027t dare consider it. Others might, but I would not. You want me to share? Very well. The bad trouble has already started, Ward. Guemes Island is under the waves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, as if blinking would clear away the force of what she\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn entire Island, under the waves! \"So,\" he growled, \"your precious current controls didn\u0027t work. You\u0027ve driven an Island onto -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She shook her head for emphasis. \"No! No! Someone has done it deliberately. It had nothing to do with Current Control. It was a cruel, vicious act of destruction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" He spoke the word in a low, shocked voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know yet. But there are thousands of casualties and we\u0027re still picking up survivors.\" She turned and undogged the hatch. Keel saw the first signs of age in her slow movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s still holding something back, he thought as he followed her into her quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans spend their lives in mazes. If they escape and cannot find another maze, they create one. What is this passion for testing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\"Questions from the Avata,\" the Histories\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuque began to curse, rolling in the nutrient bath and pounding his fists against the organic sides until great blue stains appeared along the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guardians summoned the C/P.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late and Simone Rocksack had been preparing for bed. At the summons, Simone pulled her favorite robe over her head and let it drop over the firm curves of her breasts and hips. The robe in its purple dignity erased all but the slightest traces of womanliness from her bearing. She hurried down the passage from her quarters, pulling at her robe to restore some of its daytime crispness. She entered the gloomy space where Vata and Duque existed. Her anxiety was obvious in every moment. Kneeling above Duque, she said: \"I am here, Duque. It is the Chaplain/Psychiatrist. How can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me?\" Duque screamed. \"You wart on the rump of a pregnant sow! You can\u0027t even help yourself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked, the C/P put a hand over the flap covering her mouth. She knew what a sow was, of course - one of the creatures of Ship, a female swine. This she remembered well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pregnant sow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimone Rocksack\u0027s slender fingers couldn\u0027t help pressing against the smooth flatness of her abdomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only swine are in the hyb tanks,\" she said. She concentrated on keeping her voice loud enough for Duque to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you think!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you cursing?\" the C/P asked. She tried to keep a proper reverence in her tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vata\u0027s dreaming me into terrible things,\" Duque moaned. \"Her hair ... it\u0027s all over the ocean and she\u0027s breaking me into little pieces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C/P stared at Duque. Most of his form was a blurred hulk under the nutrient. His lips sought the surface like a bloated carp. He seemed to be all in one piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" she said. \"You appear intact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t I told you she dreams me?\" Duque moaned. \"Dreams hurt if you can\u0027t get out. I\u0027ll drown down there. Every little piece of me will drown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not drowning, Duque,\" the C/P assured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not here, baboon. In the sea!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaboon, she thought. That was another creature from Ship. Why was Duque recalling the creatures of Ship? Were they at last coming down? But how could he know? She lifted her gaze to the fearful watchers around the rim of the organic tank. Could one of them ... ? No, it was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice suddenly clear and extremely articulate, Duque proclaimed, \"She won\u0027t listen. They\u0027re talking and she won\u0027t listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who won\u0027t listen, Duque? Who are \u0027they\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her hair! Haven\u0027t you heard a thing I\u0027ve said?\" He pounded a fist weakly against the tank side below the C/P. She stroked her abdomen again, absently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are the creatures from Ship to be brought down to Pandora?\" Rocksack asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take them where you want,\" Duque said. \"Just don\u0027t let her dream me back into the sea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Vata wish to return to the sea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s dreaming me, I tell you. She\u0027s dreaming me away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are Vata\u0027s dreams reality?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuque refused to answer. He merely groaned and twisted at the edge of the tank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRocksack sighed. She stared across the tank at the mounded bulk of Vata, quiescent ... breathing. Vata\u0027s long hair moved like seaweed in the currents of Duque\u0027s disturbance. How could Vata\u0027s hair be in the ocean and here on Vashon simultaneously? Perhaps in dreams. Was this another miracle of Ship? Vata\u0027s hair was almost long enough to be cut once more, it had been over a year. Was all of that hair that had been cut from Vata ... was all of it somehow still attached to Vata? Nothing was impossible in the realm of miracles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how could Vata\u0027s hair speak?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no mistaking what Duque had said. Vata\u0027s hair spoke and Vata would not listen. Why would Vata not listen? Was it too soon to return to the sea? Was this a warning that Vata would lead them all back into the sea?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Rocksack sighed. The Chaplain/Psychiatrist\u0027s job could be troublesome. Terrible demands were made upon her. Word of this would be out by morning. There was no way to silence the guardians. Rumors, distorted stories. Some interpretation would have to be made, something firm and supportive. Something good enough to silence dangerous speculations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood, grimacing at a pain in her right knee. Looking at the awed faces around the tank\u0027s rim, she said, \"The next lot of Vata\u0027s hair will not go to the faithful. Every clipping must be cast into the sea as an offering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow her, Duque groaned, then quite clearly he shouted, \"Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRocksack placed this reference immediately, having been prepared by Duque\u0027s previous mutterings. Bitch was the female of the canine family. Great things were in store for Pandora, the C/P realized. Vata was dreaming Duque into wondrous experiences and Duque was calling forth the creatures of Ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking once more at the awed guardians, Rocksack explained this carefully. She was pleased by the way heads nodded agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll Pandorans will be free when the first hylighter breaks the sea\u0027s surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Sign over a Merman kelp project\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive water��drum tones sounded a musical call, pulling Brett up ... up ... lifting him out of a dream in which he reached for Scudi Wang but never quite touched her. Always, he fell back into the depths as he had sunk when the wavewall swept him off Vashon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett opened his eyes and recognized Scudi\u0027s room. There were no lights, but his light-gathering eyes discerned her hand across the short distance between their beds. The hand reached out from the covers and groped sleepily up the wall toward the light switch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a little higher and to the right,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can see?\" There was puzzlement in her voice. Her hand stopped its groping and found the switch. Brilliance washed the room. He sucked a deep breath, let it out slowly and rubbed his eyes. The light hurt him all the way out to the temples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScudi sat upright on her bed, the blankets pulled loosely around her breasts. \"You can see in the dark?\" she persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Sometimes it\u0027s handy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then modesty is not as, strict with you as I thought.\" She slipped from the covers and dressed in a singlesuit striped vertically in yellow and green. Brett tried not to watch her dress, but his eyes no longer would obey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I check instruments in a half-hour,\" she said. \"Then I ride outpost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should I do about ... you know, checking in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have reported. I should be finished in a few hours. Don\u0027t go wandering; you could get lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a guide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A friend,\" she said. Again, that quick smile. \"If hunger strikes, there is food.\" She pointed toward the alcove end of her quarters. \"When I get back, you will report in. Or they may send someone for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around the room, feeling that it would shrink without Scudi here and with nothing to do. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-12.html","bookId":2171,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:13 PM"}
