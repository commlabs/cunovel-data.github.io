He didn\u0027t, of course, for he was certain she\u0027d become terrified again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara, just give me a minute,\" he said in a clipped voice. \"I\u0027m afraid…\" He didn\u0027t finish that explanation, didn\u0027t tell her he was afraid he would hurt her if he touched her. That admission would only increase her fear, so he kept silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be afraid,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t believe what he was hearing. He opened his eyes to look at her. She couldn\u0027t really think… and yet the tenderness in her eyes indicated she did believe he was afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, Sara, I\u0027m not afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fingers slowly trailed down his chest. He caught hold of her hand when she reached the flat of his stomach. \"Stop that,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve only taken experienced women to your bed, haven\u0027t you, Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer was a low grunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Nathan, you like kissing me, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d asked her that very question not fifteen minutes earlier, when he\u0027d been trying to rid her of her fear. God\u0027s truth, he would have laughed if he hadn\u0027t been in so much pain. The woman was treating him as though he were the virgin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was about to straighten out her thinking when she edged closer to him. He suddenly realized that his bride was no longer afraid of him. \"Do you?\" she persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Sara, I like kissing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then kiss me again, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara, kissing isn\u0027t the only thing I had in mind. I want to touch you. Everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for her to go rigid on him again. God, he wished he had the patience for this. His nerves felt as though they were about to snap, and all he could think about was spilling his seed inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he felt her take hold of his hand. He opened his eyes just as she placed his hand on the side of her full breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t move for a long minute. She didn\u0027t either. They stared into each other\u0027s eyes. He waited to see what she would do next. She waited for him to get on with his duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara soon became impatient with him. He was gently stroking her br**sts. The feeling made her tingle inside. It made her reckless, too. She rubbed her toes against his legs and slowly leaned up to kiss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate the feeling of being trapped,\" she whispered between feathery-light kisses. \"But I don\u0027t feel trapped now, Nathan. Don\u0027t give up on me yet, husband. This is a new experience for me. Truly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gently caressed the side of her face. \"I\u0027m not going to give up,\" he whispered. There was a bit of laughter in his voice when he added, \"Truly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed against his mouth and kissed him just the way she wanted to. When her tongue moved inside to mate with his, Nathan\u0027s control snapped. He became the aggressor again, deepening the kiss even more with wild abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept up the gentle assault until she rolled onto her back and tried to bring him with her. Nathan didn\u0027t give in to her demand but leaned down to kiss the fragrant valley between her br**sts. His mouth teased first one and then the other nipple until they were both hard nubs. His tongue drove her wild. When she couldn\u0027t stand the sweet torment any longer she grabbed hold of his hair and began to tug on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt as if she\u0027d been hit with hot lightning when he finally took her nipple into his mouth. She arched up, demanding more. He began to suckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warm knot formed in the pit of her stomach. \"Nathan, please,\" she moaned. She didn\u0027t have any idea what she was begging him for, only knew the incredible heat was driving her beyond reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to her other breast even as his hand slid down between her thighs. She didn\u0027t clench against him but let out another ragged groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned up on one elbow so he could watch her expression. She tried to hide her face in the crook of his shoulder. He reached out and caught hold of her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like the way you respond to me,\" he whispered. \"Do you like the way I\u0027m touching you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe already knew the answer. He could feel how ready she was for him. How hot. His fingers rubbed against the nub hidden between her folds until she was slick with moisture. His finger slowly eased up inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands had been fisted at her sides until that minute. She came apart then. She stroked his shoulders, his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nails scraped his backside. \"Nathan,\" she whispered. \"Don\u0027t do that. It hurts. Oh, God, don\u0027t stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to contradict herself by arching up against his hand. Nathan could barely understand what she was saying to him. He shook with raw desire to have her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe silenced her weak protest with a kiss and moved to cover her. She didn\u0027t try to lock her legs together but moved to cuddle his hardness between her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted her hair in his hand to hold her steady for his kiss. The way she rubbed her pelvis against him drove him crazy. He wasn\u0027t being gentle. She wouldn\u0027t let him. Her nails stung. He liked that. She was moaning, too. He liked that even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly eased into her but stopped when he felt the thin shield of her resistance. He lifted his head up enough so that he could look into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your legs around me,\" he ordered, his voice harsh with determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she did as he commanded he let out a low growl. And still he hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at me, Sara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her eyes and stared into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to belong to me. Now and forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were misty with passion. She reached up to clasp the sides of his face. \"I have always belonged to you, Nathan. Always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth covered hers again. He thrust deep inside her in one swift motion, thinking to get the pain he knew she\u0027d feel over and done with as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hush, baby,\" he whispered when she cried out. He was fully embedded in her. Her tight heat surrounded him, squeezed him. \"God, that feels good,\" he said with a groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it doesn\u0027t feel good,\" she cried out. She tried to shift positions to ease the throbbing pain, but he held her h*ps and wouldn\u0027t let her move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will feel better in a minute,\" he told her. His breathing was labored. He sounded out of breath to her. His face rested in the hollow of her shoulder. He nipped at her skin with his teeth, tickled her at the same time with his tongue. The sweet torture made her forget some of the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t push against me like that, Sara,\" he ordered. His voice was harsh, strained. \"I\u0027m not stopping now. I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue rubbed her earlobe. She quit struggling and let out a sigh of pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pain won\u0027t last long,\" he whispered then. \"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reacted more to the tenderness, the caring in his voice than to the promise he\u0027d just given her. She hoped he was right, though. She still hurt. The throbbing was insistent, but after a minute it did begin to lessen. Yet when he started to move again the pain immediately returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t move, it isn\u0027t so terrible,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis groan was harsh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Nathan?\" she pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he answered, responding to the worry in her voice. It was a lie, of course, but she was too innocent to understand how much he needed to move. \"I won\u0027t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands began to stroke his hair, the back of his neck. His fever was burning out of control, and the pain of having to hold back was demanding to be appeased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t seem to quit touching him. \"Nathan, kiss me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pain\u0027s gone now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe deliberately withdrew just a little when he moved to kiss her again, then just as slowly eased back inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You moved,\" she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of agreeing with her he kissed her. When he tried to withdraw again her nails dug into his hard thighs. She was trying to keep him still against her. He ignored her protests and sought to make her burn the way he was burning. His hand slipped down between their joined bodies, and his thumb slowly stoked the fire inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head fell back on the pillows, and her grip on his thighs relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she began to move. Her h*ps pushed up against his. Her actions were instinctive, primal, uncontrollable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe soon became demanding, too. He responded to her by slowly pulling back and thrusting more powerfully inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed him tight and arched up against him just as forcefully. The mating ritual took over. The bed creaked from the rocking motion. Their bodies glistened with perspiration in the candlelight. Her sweet moans blended with his raw growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were both wild to find fulfillment. He couldn\u0027t stop his own cl**ax, nor the near shout he gave when he spilled his hot seed inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head dropped against her shoulder in complete surrender to the blazing orgasm that overtook him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew she was close to finding her own release. His thrusts continued to be just as forceful, and when he felt her tense against him, he forced her orgasm by driving hard into her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed. His name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis ears rang from the noise. He collapsed on top of her, giving her his full weight in an attempt to stop her trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither one of them moved for a long, long while. Nathan was too content. She was too exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a trickle of moisture near her ear, reached up to touch it, and only then realized she\u0027d been crying. Lord, she\u0027d really lost her composure, hadn\u0027t she? She was too pleased to worry about that, though. And too satisfied. Why hadn\u0027t anyone ever told her how wonderful making love would be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband\u0027s heartbeat pounded in unison with her own. She let out a happy sigh. She was his wife now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t call me bride anymore,\" she whispered against his neck. On impulse she tickled his skin with the tip of her tongue. The taste of him was salty, male, wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I too heavy for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded weary to her. She answered him, yes, he was getting heavy, and he immediately rolled onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want him to leave her just yet. She wanted him to hold her, to tell her what a fine woman she was, to give her the words of praise and love all new wives longed to hear. She wanted him to kiss her again, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t get anything. Nathan\u0027s eyes were closed. He looked peaceful and sleepy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have any idea of the war Nathan was waging with himself. He was desperately trying to understand what had just happened to him. He\u0027d never lost control so completely. She\u0027d bewitched him. Confused him, too. He was feeling vulnerable, and damn, that feeling scared the hell out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara rolled onto her side. \"Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiss me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiss me goodnight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll want you again if I kiss you,\" he finally explained. He didn\u0027t bother to look at her but stared at the ceiling. \"You\u0027re too tender.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up in bed, flinching over the discomfort she felt between her thighs. He was right. She was tender. It didn\u0027t seem to matter, though. She still wanted him to kiss her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the one who made me tender,\" she muttered. She poked him in his shoulder. \"I specifically remember telling you not to move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You moved first, Sara. Remember that?\" he drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed. She took heart. He wasn\u0027t sounding too surly. She cuddled up against him, wishing he\u0027d put his arms around her. \"Nathan, isn\u0027t the after as important as the during?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know what she was talking about. \"Go to sleep,\" he ordered for the second time. He jerked the covers up over the two of them, then closed his eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw her arm over him. She was exhausted. Frustrated, too. She told him so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Sara, I know you found fulfillment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That isn\u0027t what I\u0027m talking about,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for him to ask her to explain what she\u0027d meant, then gave up when he kept silent. \"Nathan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, what now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please don\u0027t take that mean tone with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara…\" he began in a warning tone of voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After you took those other women to your bed, well, after… what did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat in God\u0027s name was she getting at? \"I left,\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to leave me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara, this is my bed. I\u0027m going to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer patience was at an end. \"Not before I explain proper etiquette to you,\" she announced. \"After a man finishes… that, he should tell his wife what a fine woman she is. Then he should kiss her and hold her close. They fall asleep in each other\u0027s arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t stop himself from smiling. She said the damnedest things. Sounded like a general, too. \"It\u0027s called lovemaking, Sara, and how would you know what\u0027s proper and what isn\u0027t? You were a virgin, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just know what\u0027s proper,\" she countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t shout at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look at her. Hell, she looked as if she was going to cry. He didn\u0027t have the patience to deal with her tears. God, she was vulnerable… and beautiful. Her mouth was all rosy and swollen from his kisses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached over and hauled her into his arms. After giving her a quick kiss on the top of her head he pushed her face down into the crook of his shoulder and muttered, \"You\u0027re a fine woman. Now go to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t sound like he meant what he said, but she didn\u0027t care. He was holding her close. He was stroking her back. She thought that was a little telling. She snuggled up against him and closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chin rested on the top of her head. Each time the memory of their lovemaking came into his thoughts he blocked it. He wasn\u0027t ready to let his emotions get the upper hand. He was simply too disciplined to let a woman get that close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was just drifting off to sleep when she whispered his name again. He squeezed her to let her know he wanted her to keep quiet. She whispered his name again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" he answered with a deliberate yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what this holding and hugging each other is called?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t going to let up on him until she told him what was on her mind. Nathan squeezed her again, then gave in. \"No, Sara, what\u0027s it called?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cherishing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned. She smiled. \"It\u0027s a good start, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis snore was her only answer. Sara wasn\u0027t bothered that he had rudely fallen asleep in the middle of her fervent speech. She\u0027d simply explain it all to him again the next day. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-16.html","bookId":1790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM"}
