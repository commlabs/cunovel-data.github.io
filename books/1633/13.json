{"id":96829,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWELVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1750 Hours, November 27, 2525 (Military Calendar) / UNSC frigate Commonwealth en route to the UNSC Damascus Materials Testing Facility, planet Chi Ceti 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe view screen in the bunkroom of the UNSC frigate Commonwealth clicked on as the ship entered normal space. Ice particles showered the external camera and gave the distant yellow sun, Chi Ceti, a ghostly ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn watched and continued to ponder the word Mjolnir as they sped in-system. He had looked it up in the education database. Mjolnir was the hammer used by the Norse god of thunder. Project MJOLNIR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad to be some kind of weapon. At least he hoped it was; they needed something to fight the Covenant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it was a weapon, though, why was it here at the Damascus testing facility, on the very edge of UNSC-controlled space? He had only even heard of this system twenty-four hours ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and surveyed the squad. Although this bunkroom had one hundred beds, the Spartans still clustered together, playing cards, polishing boots, reading, exercising. Sam sparred with Kelly—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealthough she had to slow herself down considerably to give him a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn was reminded that he didn’t like being on starships. The lack of control was disturbing. If he wasn’t stuck in “the freezer”—the starship’s cramped, unpleasant cryo chamber—he was left waiting and wondering what their next mission would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the last three weeks the Spartans had handled a variety of minor missions for Dr. Halsey. “Tying up loose ends,” she had called it. Putting down rebel factions on Jericho VII. Removing a black-market bazaar near the Roosevelt military base. Each mission had brought them closer to the Chi Ceti System.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn had made sure every member of his squad had participated in these missions. They had performed flawlessly. There had been no losses. Chief Mendez would have been proud of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spartan-117,” Dr. Halsey’s voice blared over the loudspeaker. “Report to the bridge immediately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn snapped to attention and keyed the intercom. “Yes, ma’am!” He turned to Sam. “Get everyone ready, in case we’re needed. On the double.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Affirmative,” Sam said. “You heard the Petty Officer. Dog those cards. Get into uniform, soldier!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn double-timed it to the elevator and punched the code for the bridge. Gravity faded out and then back again as the elevator passed between rotating sections of the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors parted and he stepped onto the bridge. Every wall had a screen. Some showed stars and the distant red smear of a nebula. Other screens displayed the fusion reactor status and spectrums of microwave broadcasts in the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brass railing ringed the center of the bridge, and within sat four Junior Lieutenants at their stations: navigation, weapons, communications, and ship operations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn halted and saluted Captain Wallace, then nodded to Dr. Halsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Wallace stood with his right arm crooked behind his back. His left arm was missing from the elbow down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn remained saluting until the Captain returned the gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Over here, please,” Dr. Halsey said. “I want you to see this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn walked across the rubberized deck and gave his full attention to the screen Dr. Halsey and Captain Wallace were scrutinizing. It displayed deconvoluted radar signals. It looked like tangled yarn to John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There—” Dr. Halsey pointed to a blip on the screen. “It’s there again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Wallace stroked his dark beard, thinking, then said, “That puts our ghost at eighty million kilometers. Even if it were a ship, it would take a full hour to get within weapons range. And besides—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved at the screen. “—it’s gone again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“May I suggest that we go to battle stations, Captain,” Dr. Halsey told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see the point,” he said condescendingly; the Captain was clearly less than pleased about having a civilian on his bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We haven’t let this be widely known,” she said, “but when the aliens were first detected at Harvest, they appeared at extreme range . . . and then they were suddenly much closer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An intrasystem jump?” John asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey smiled at him. “Correctly surmised, Spartan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not possible,” Captain Wallace remarked. “Slipstream space can’t be navigated that accurately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean we cannot navigate with that kind of accuracy,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain clenched and unclenched his jaw. He clicked the intercom. “General quarters: all hands to battle stations. Seal bulkheads. I repeat: all hands, battle stations. This is not a drill. Reactors to ninety percent. Come about to course one two five.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge lights darkened to a red hue. The deck rumbled beneath John’s boots and the entire ship tilted as it changed heading. Pressure doors slammed shut and sealed John on the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commonwealth stabilized on her new heading, and Dr. Halsey crossed her arms. She leaned over and whispered to John, “We’ll be using the Commonwealth ’s dropship to go to the testing facility on Chi Ceti Four. We have to get to Project MJOLNIR.” She turned back and watched the radar screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Before they do. So get the others ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am.” John keyed the intercom. “Sam, muster the squad in Bay Alpha. I want that Pelican loaded and ready for drop in fifteen minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll have it done in ten,” Sam replied. “Faster if those Longsword interceptor pilots get out of our way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn would have given anything to be belowdecks with the others. He felt as if he were being left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radar screen flashed with blobs of eerie green light . . . almost as if the space around the Commonwealth were boiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe collision alarm sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brace for impact!” Captain Wallace said. He laced his arm around the brass railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn grabbed an emergency handhold on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething appeared three thousand kilometers off the Commonwealth ’s prow. It was a sleek oval with a single seam running along its lateral edge from stem to stern. Tiny lights winked on and off along its hull. A faint purple-tinged glow emitted from the tail. The ship was only a third the size of the Commonwealth .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Covenant ship,” Dr. Halsey said, and she involuntarily backed away from the view screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Wallace scowled. “COM officer: send a signal to Chi Ceti—see if they can send us some reinforcements.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue flashes flickered along the hull of the alien ship—so bright that even filtered through the external camera, they still made John’s eyes water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outer hull of the Commonwealth sizzled and popped. Three screens filled with static.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pulse lasers!” the lieutenant at the ops station screamed. “Communication dish destroyed. Armor in sections three and four at twenty-five percent. Hull breach in section three. Sealing now.” The Lieutenant swiveled in his seat, sweat beaded on his forehead. “Ship AI core memory overloaded,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the AI offline, the ship could still fire weapons and navigate through Slipstream space, but John knew it would take more time to make jump calculations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come to heading zero three zero, declination one eight zero,” Caption Wallace ordered. “Arm Archer missile pods A through F. And give me a firing solution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye aye,” the navigation and weapons officers said. “A through F pods armed.” They furiously tapped away on their keypads. Seconds ticked by. “Firing solution ready, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pods A through F firing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commonwealth had twenty-six pods, each loaded with thirty Archer high-explosive missiles. On screen, pods A through F opened, and launched—180 plumes of rocket exhaust that traced a path from the Commonwealth to the alien ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enemy changed course, rotated so that the top of the ship faced the incoming missiles. It then moved straight up at an alarming speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Archer missiles altered their trajectory to track the ship, but half their number streaked past the target, clean misses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others impacted. Fire covered the skin of the alien ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good work, Lieutenant,” Captain Wallace said, and he clapped the young officer on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey frowned and stared at the screen. “No,” she whispered. “Wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire flared, then dimmed. The skin of the alien ship rippled like heat wavering off a hot road in the summer. It fluttered with a metallic silver sheen, then brilliant white—and the fire faded, revealing the ship beneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was completely undamaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Energy shields,” Dr. Halsey muttered. She tapped her lower lip, thinking. “Even ships this small have energy shielding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lieutenant,” the Captain barked at the nav officer. “Cut main engines and fire maneuvering thrusters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRotate and track so that we’re pointing at that thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye aye, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distant rumbling of the Commonwealth ’s main engines dimmed and stopped and she turned about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer inertia kept the ship speeding toward the testing facility—now flying backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing, Captain?” Dr. Halsey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arm the MAC,” Captain Wallace told the weapons officer. “A heavy round.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn understood: Turning your back to an enemy only gave them an advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MAC—Magnetic Accelerator Cannon—was the Commonwealth ’s main weapon. It fired a super-dense ferric tungsten shell. The tremendous mass and velocity of the projectile obliterated most ships on impact. Unlike the Archer missiles, a MAC round was an unguided projectile; the firing solution had to be perfect in order to hit the target—not an easy thing to do when both ships were moving rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MAC capacitors charging,” the weapons officer announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant ship turned its side toward the Commonwealth .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” the Captain murmured. “Give me a bigger target.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePinpoints of blue light glowed and then flared along the alien hull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tactical view screens on the nose of the Commonwealth went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn heard sizzling overhead—then the muffled thumps of explosive decompressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More pulse laser hits,” the ops officer reported. “Armor in section three through seven down to four centimeters. Navigation dish destroyed. Hull breaches on decks two, five, and nine. We have a leak in the port fuel tanks.” The Lieutenant’s hand shakily danced over the controls. “Pumping fuel to starboard reverse tanks. Sealing sections.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn shifted on his feet. He had to move. Act. Standing here—unable to get to his squad, not doing anything—was counter to every fiber of his being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MAC at one hundred percent,” the weapons officer shouted. “Ready to fire!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fire!” Captain Wallace ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights on the bridge dimmed and the Commonwealth shuddered. The MAC bolt launched through space—a red-hot metal slug moving at thirty thousand meters per second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant ship’s engines flared to life and the ship veered away—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Too late. The heavy round closed and slammed into the target’s prow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant ship reeled backward through space. Its energy shields shimmered and glowed lightning-bright . . . then flickered, dimmed, and went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge crew let out a victory cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept Dr. Halsey. John watched the view screen as she adjusted the camera controls and zoomed in on the Covenant ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vessel’s erratic spinning slowed and it came to a stop. The ship’s nose was crumpled and atmosphere vented into vacuum. Tiny fires flickered inside. The ship slowly came about and started back toward them—gaining speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It should have been destroyed,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiny red blobs appeared on the hull of the Covenant ship. They glowed and intensified and drifted together, collecting along the lateral line of the craft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Wallace said, “Make ready another heavy round.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye aye,” the weapons officer said. “Charge at thirty percent. Firing solution online, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Dr. Halsey said. “Evasive maneuvers, Captain. Now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won’t have my command second-guessed, ma’am.” The Captain turned to face her. “And with respect, Doctor , second-guessed by someone with no combat experience.” He stiffened and placed his hand behind his back. “I cannot have you removed from the bridge because the bulkheads are sealed . . . but another outburst like that, Doctor, and I will have you gagged.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn shot a quick glance to Dr. Halsey. Her face flushed—he couldn’t tell from shame or rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MAC at fifty percent charge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red light continued to collect along the lateral line of the Covenant ship until it was a solid band. It brightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eighty percent charge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re turning, sir,” the nav officer announced. “She’s coming to starboard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ninety-five percent charge—one hundred,” the weapons officer announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Send them to Hades, Lieutenant. Fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights dimmed again. The Commonwealth shuddered and a bolt of thunder and fire tore through the blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant ship stood its ground. The bloodred light that had pooled on its lateral line burst forth—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estreaked toward the Commonwealth , passing the MAC round a mere kilometer away. The red light glowed and pulsed almost as if it were liquid; its edges roiled and fluttered. It elongated into a teardrop of ruby light five meters long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Evasive maneuvers,” Captain Wallace cried. “Emergency thrusters to port!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commonwealth slowly moved out of the trajectory path of the Covenant’s energy weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe MAC round struck the Covenant vessel amidships. Its shield shimmered and bubbled . . . then disappeared. The MAC round punched through the craft and sent it spinning out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inbound ball of light moved, too. It started tracking the Commonwealth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Engines—full power astern,” the Captain ordered. The Commonwealth rumbled and slowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light should have sped past them; instead, it sharply arced and struck her port amidships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air filled with a popping and sizzling. The Commonwealth listed to starboard, then rolled completely over and continued to tumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stabilize,” the Captain cried. “Starboard thrusters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fire reported in sections one through twenty,” the ops officer said, panic creeping into his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Decks two through seven in section one . . . have melted, sir. They’re gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt grew noticeably hotter on the bridge. Sweat beaded on John’s back and trickled down his spine. He had never felt so helpless. Were his teammates below decks alive or dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All port armor destroyed. Decks two through five in sections three, four, and five, are now out of contact, sir. It’s burning through us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Wallace stood without saying a word. He stared at their one remaining view screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey stepped forward. “Respectfully, Captain, I suggest that you alert the crew to get on respirator packs. Give them thirty seconds then vent the atmosphere on all decks, except the bridge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe COM officer looked to the Captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do it,” the Captain said. “Sound the alert.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Deck thirteen destroyed,” the ops officer announced. “Fire is getting close the reactor. Hull structure starting to buckle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vent atmosphere now,” Captain Wallance ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye aye,” the ops officer replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the sound of thumping through the hull . . . then nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fire is dying out,” the ops officer said. “Hull temperature cooling—stabilizing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell did they hit us with?” Captain Wallace demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Plasma,” Dr. Halsey replied. “But not any plasma we know . . . they can actually guide its trajectory through space, without any detectable mechanism. Amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain,” the navigator said. “Alien ship is pursuing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant vessel—a red-rimmed hole punched through its center—turned and started toward the Commonwealth .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How . . . ?” Captain Wallace said unbelievingly. He quickly regained his wits. “Ready another MAC\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheavy round.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weapons officer slowly said, “MAC system destroyed, Captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re sitting ducks, then,” the Captain murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey leaned against the brass railing. “Not quite. The Commonwealth carries three nuclear missiles, correct, Captain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A detonation this close would destroy us as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned and cupped her hand to her chin, thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, sir,” John said. “The alien’s tactics thus far have been unnecessarily vicious—like those of an animal. They didn’t have to take that second MAC round while they fired at us. But they wanted to position themselves to fire. In my opinion sir, they would stop and engage anything that challenged them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain looked to Dr. Halsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged and then nodded. “The Longsword interceptors?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Wallace turned his back to them and covered his face with his one hand. He sighed, nodded, and clicked on the intercom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Longsword Squadron Delta, this is the Captain. Get your ships into the black, boys, and engage the enemy ship. I need you to need to buy us some time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roger that, sir. We’re ready to launch. On our way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turn us around,” the Captain told the nav officer. “Give me best speed on a vector toward Chi Ceti Four orbit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coolant leaks in the reactor, sir,” the ops officer said. “We can push the engines to thirty percent. No more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me fifty percent,” he said. He turned to the weapons officer. “Arm one of our Shiva warheads. Set proximity fuse to one hundred meters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Commonwealth spun about. John felt the change in his stomach and he tightened his grip on the railing. The spinning slowed, stopped, then the ship accelerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reactor red-lining,” the ops officer reported. “Meltdown in twenty-five seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the speakers, there was a crackle, a hiss of static, then: “Longsword interceptors engaging the enemy, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the remaining aft camera, there were flickers of light—the cold blue strobes of Covenant energy weapons, and the red-orange fireballs of the Longswords’ missiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Launch the missile,” the Captain said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meltdown in ten seconds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Missile away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA plume of exhaust divided the darkness of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five seconds to meltdown,” the ops officer said. “Four, three, two—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shunt drive plasma to space,” the Captain ordered. “Cut power to all systems.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant ship was silhouetted for a split second by pure white—then the view screen snapped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge lights went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn could see everything, though. The bridge officers, Dr. Halsey as she clutched onto the railing, and Captain Wallace as he stood and saluted the pilots he had just sent to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hull of the Commonwealth rumbled and pinged as the shock wave enveloped them. It grew louder, a subsonic roar that shook John to his bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise seemed to go on forever in the darkness. It faded . . . then it was completely silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Power us back up,” the Captain said. “Slowly. Give me ten percent from the reactors if we can manage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge lights came on, dimly, but they worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Report,” the Captain ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All sensors offline,” the op officer said. “Resetting backup computer. Hang on. Scanning now. Lots of debris. It’s hot back there. All Longsword interceptors vaporized.” He looked up, the color drained from his face. “Covenant ship . . . intact, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” the Captain said, and made a fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s moving off, though,” the op officer said with a visible sigh of relief. “Very slowly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does it take to destroy one of those things?” the Captain whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t know if our weapons can destroy them,” Dr. Halsey said. “But at least we know we can slow them down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Captain stood straighter. “Best speed to the Damascus testing facility. We will execute a flyby orbit, and then proceed to a point twenty million kilometers distant to make repairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain?” Dr. Halsey said. “A flyby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have orders to get you to the facility and retrieve whatever Section Three has stowed there, ma’am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we fly by, a dropship will take you and your—” He glanced at John. “—crew planet side. If the Covenant ship returns, we will be the bait to lure them away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand, Captain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll rendezvous in orbit no later than 1900 hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey turned to John. “We need to hurry. We don’t have much time—and there is a great deal I need to show the Spartans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am,” John said. He took a long look at the bridge, and hoped he never had to return. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-fall-of-reach-halo-1/page-13.html","bookId":1633,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:12 PM"}
