We will force the obedience of no marath’damane save those who violate our borders\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And those borders are?\" Egwene asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As currently outlined, as I—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be more specific\", Egwene said. \"Tell me with your own voice, woman. What borders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortuona drew her lips to a line. Obviously, she was not accustomed to being interrupted. \"We control Altara, Amadicia, Tarabon, and Almoth Plain\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tremalking\", Egwene said. \"You’ll release Tremalking and the other Sea Folk islands?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not list those because they are not of your land, but the sea. They are not your concern. Besides, they were not part of the agreement with the Dragon Reborn. He did not mention it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a lot on his mind. Tremalking will be part of the agreement with me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn’t aware we were making such an agreement\", Fortuona said calmly. \"You require our assistance. We could leave in a moment, should I order it. How would you fare against that army without our aid, which you so recently begged me to lend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBegged? Egwene thought. \"Do you realize what happens if we lose the Last Battle? The Dark One breaks the Wheel, slays the Great Serpent, and all things will end. That’s if we’re lucky. If we aren’t lucky, the Dark One will remake the world according to his own twisted vision. All people will be bound to him in an eternity of suffering, subjugation, and torment\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am aware of this\", Fortuona said. \"You act as if this particular fight—here, on this battlefield—is decisive\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If my army were to be destroyed\", Egwene said, \"our entire effort would be jeopardized. Everything could indeed hinge on what happens here\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I disagree\", Fortuona said. \"Your armies are not vital. They are populated by the children of oathbreakers. You fight the Shadow, and for that I grant you honor. If you were to lose, I would return to Seanchan and raise up the full might of the Ever Victorious Army and bring it to bear against this . . . horror. We would still win the Last Battle. It would be more difficult without you, and I would not waste useful lives or potential damane, but I am confident we could stand against the Shadow on our own\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met Egwene’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo cold, Egwene thought. She’s bluffing. She must be. Reports from Siuan’s eyes-and-ears said that the Seanchan homeland was in chaos. A succession crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps Fortuona really did believe that the Empire could stand against the Shadow on its own. If so, she was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will fight alongside us\", Egwene said. \"You made the treaty with Rand, gave him your oath, I assume\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tremalking is ours\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" Egwene said. \"And you have set up a leader there? One of the Sea Folk, to acknowledge your rule?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortuona said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the allegiance of most of the other lands you’ve conquered\", Egwene said. \"For better or worse, the Altarans and Amadicians follow you. The Taraboners seem to as well. But the Sea Folk . . . I have no reports whatsoever of a single one of their kind supporting you or living peacefully beneath your thumb\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Borders—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The borders you just mentioned, as they exist on maps, show Tremalking as Sea Folk land. It is not yours. If our treaty holds current borders as they are, you would need a ruler in Tremalking to acknowledge you\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed a tenuous argument to Egwene. The Seanchan were conquerors. What did they care if they had any kind of legitimacy? However, Fortuona seemed to consider Egwene’s words. She frowned in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This . . . is a good argument\", Fortuona finally said. \"They have not accepted us. They are foolish to reject the peace we offer, but they have indeed done so. Very well, we will leave Tremalking, but I will add a condition to our agreement as you have\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your condition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will announce through your Tower and through your lands\", Fortuona said. \"Any marath’damane who wish to come to Ebou Dar and be properly collared must be allowed to do so\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think people would want to be collared?\" She was insane. She had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they would want to\", Fortuona said. \"In Seanchan, very occasionally one who can channel is missed in our searches. When they discover what they are, they come to us and demand to be collared, as is appropriate. You will not force anyone to stay away from us. You will let them come\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise you, none will\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you should have no trouble making the proclamation\", Fortuona said. \"We will send emissaries to educate your people on the benefits of damane—our teachers will come peacefully, for we will hold to the treaty. I believe you will be surprised. Some will see what is right\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what you wish\", Egwene said, amused. \"Break no laws, and I suspect most will allow your . . . emissaries. I cannot speak for every ruler\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What of the lands you control? Tar Valon? You will allow our emissaries?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they break no laws\", Egwene said, \"I won’t silence them. I’d allow in Whitecloaks, if they could say their piece without driving men to riot. But Light, woman. You can’t actually believe . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trailed off, watching Fortuona. She did believe it. So far as Egwene could tell, she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least she’s sincere, Egwene thought. Insane. Insane, but sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the damane you now hold?\" Egwene said. \"You’ll let them go, if they wish to be released?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None who are properly trained would wish that\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This must be equal on both sides\", Egwene said. \"What of a girl whom you discover to be able to channel? If she does not wish to be made damane, will you let her leave your lands and join ours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be like letting an enraged grolm free in a city square\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that people will see the truth\", Egwene said. \"If your way of life is strong, your ideals true, then people will see them for what they are. If they don’t, you shouldn’t force them. Let any who wish to be free go free, and I’ll let your people speak in Tar Valon. Light! I’ll give them room and free board, and I’ll see the same \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-160.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
