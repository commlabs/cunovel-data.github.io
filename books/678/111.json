After several months of preparation and an expenditure of a million dollars all was in readiness, and a series of tremendous explosions occurred on the earth and in the sky. This was followed by a great down-pour of rain, which washed the unfortunate Officer of the Government and the outfit off the face of creation and affected the agricultural heart with joy too deep for utterance. A Newspaper Reporter who had just arrived escaped by climbing a hill near by, and there he found the Sole Survivor of the expedition — a mule-driver — down on his knees behind a mesquite bush, praying with extreme fervour.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, you can’t stop it that way,” said the Reporter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“My fellow-traveller to the bar of God,” replied the Sole Survivor, looking up over his shoulder, “your understanding is in darkness. I am not stopping this great blessing; under Providence, I am bringing it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“That is a pretty good joke,” said the Reporter, laughing as well as he could in the strangling rain —“a mule driver’s prayer answered!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Child of levity and scoffing,” replied the other; “you err again, misled by these humble habiliments. I am the Rev. Ezekiel Thrifft, a minister of the gospel, now in the service of the great manufacturing firm of Skinn \u0026amp; Sheer. They make balloons, kites, dynamite bombs, and electrical apparatus.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/864/923.html","bookId":678,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 9:29:55 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 9:29:55 AM"}
