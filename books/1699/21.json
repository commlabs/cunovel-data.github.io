How do you think I learned the moves?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel brittle, like I might break. It did seem rehearsed, like Tobias had gone over the steps in his mind, recited the words in front of a mirror. He knew it by heart; he was just playing the other part this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say quietly. “No, I don’t feel sorry for him, not at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what, Tris?” His voice is rough; it could be the thing that breaks me. “You haven’t cared about what I do or say for the past week; what’s so different about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am almost afraid of him. I don’t know what to say or do around the erratic part of him, and it is here, bubbling just beneath the surface of what he does, just like the cruel part of me. We both have war inside of us. Sometimes it keeps us alive. Sometimes it threatens to destroy us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator beeps as it arrives. He gets on, and presses the CLOSE button so the doors shut between us. I stare at the brushed metal and try to think through the last ten minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This needs to stop,” he said. “This” was the ridicule, which was a result of the interrogation, where he admitted that he joined Dauntless to escape his father. And then he beat up Marcus—publicly, where all the Dauntless could see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? To salvage his pride? It can’t be. It was far too intentional for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn my way back to the cafeteria, I see a Candor man walk Marcus toward the bathroom. He walks slowly, but he isn’t hunched over, which makes me think Tobias didn’t do him any serious damage. I watch the door close behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had all but forgotten about what I heard in the Amity compound, about the information my father risked his life for. Supposedly, I remind myself. It may not be wise to trust Marcus. And I promised myself I wouldn’t ask him about this again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dawdle outside the bathroom until the Candor man walks out, and then walk in before the door has a chance to shut properly. Marcus is sitting on the floor by the sink with a wad of paper towel pressed to his mouth. He doesn’t look happy to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What, here to gloat?” he says. “Get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy am I here, exactly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me expectantly. “Well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you could use a reminder,” I say. “Whatever it is you want to get from Jeanine, you won’t be able to do it alone, and you won’t be able to do it with only the Abnegation to help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought we went over this.” His voice is muffled by the paper towels. “The idea that you could help—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know where you get this delusion that I’m useless, but that’s what it is,” I snap. “And I’m not interested in hearing about it. All I want to say is that when you stop being delusional and start feeling desperate because you’re too inept to figure this out on your own, you know who to come to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave the bathroom just as the Candor man comes back with an ice pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI STAND BEFORE the sinks in the women’s bathroom on the newly claimed Dauntless floor, a gun resting on my palm. Lynn put it there a few minutes ago; she seemed confused that I did not wrap my hand around it and put it somewhere, in a holster or under the waistband of my jeans. I just let it stay there, and walked to the bathroom before I started to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t be an idiot. I can’t set out to do what I’m doing without a gun. It would be crazy. So I will have to solve this problem I’ve been having in the next five minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI curl my pinkie around the handle first, then my second finger, then the others. The weight is familiar. My index finger slips around the trigger. I release a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to lift it, bringing my left hand to meet my right to steady it. I hold the gun out from my body, my arms straight, just as Four taught me, when that was his only name. I used a gun like this to defend my father and brother from simulation-bound Dauntless. I used it to stop Eric from shooting Tobias in the head. It is not inherently evil. It is just a tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see a flicker of movement in the mirror, and before I can stop myself, I stare at my reflection. This is how I looked to him, I think. This is how I looked when I shot him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoaning like a wounded animal, I let the gun fall from my hands and wrap my arms around my stomach. I want to sob because I know it will make me feel better, but I can’t force the tears to come. I just crouch in the bathroom, staring at the white tiles. I can’t do it. I can’t take the gun with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn’t even go; I am still going to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tris?” Someone knocks. I stand and uncross my arms as the door squeaks open a few inches. Tobias steps into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zeke and Uriah told me you were going to eavesdrop on Jack,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why should I tell you? You don’t tell me about your plans.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis straight eyebrows furrow. “What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m talking about beating Marcus to a pulp in front of all the Dauntless for no apparent reason.” I step toward him. “But there is a reason, isn’t there? Because it’s not like you lost control; it’s not like he did something to provoke you, so there has to be a reason!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I needed to prove to the Dauntless that I am not a coward,” he says. “That’s all. That’s all it was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you need to . . .” I start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would Tobias need to prove himself to the Dauntless? Only if he wanted them to hold him in high regard. Only if he wants to become a Dauntless leader. I remember Evelyn’s voice, speaking in the shadows in the factionless safe house: “What I am suggesting is that you become important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wants the Dauntless to ally with the factionless, and he knows the only way he can make that happen is to do it himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy he didn’t feel the need to share this plan with me is another mystery entirely. Before I can ask, he says, “So are you going to eavesdrop or not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does it matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re throwing yourself into danger for no reason again,” he says. “Just like when you stormed up to fight the Erudite with only a . . . a pocket knife to protect yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is a reason. A good one. We won’t know what’s going on unless we eavesdrop, and we need to know what’s going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crosses his arms. He is not bulky, the way some Dauntless boys are. And some girls might focus on the way his ears stick out, or the way his nose hooks at the end, but to me . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow the rest of that thought. He’s here to yell at me. He’s been keeping things from me. Whatever we are now, I can’t indulge thoughts about how attractive he is. It will just make it harder for me to do what needs to be done. And right now, that is going to listen to what Jack Kang has to say to the Erudite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not cutting your hair like the Abnegation anymore,” I say. “That because you want to look more Dauntless?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t change the subject,” he says. “There are four people going to eavesdrop already. You don’t need to be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you so insistent on me staying home?” My voice gets louder. “I am not the kind of person who just sits back and lets other people take all the risks!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as you are someone who doesn’t seem to value her own life . . . someone who can’t even pick up and fire a gun . . .” He leans toward me. “You should sit back and let other people take the risks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis quiet voice pulses around me like a second heartbeat. I hear the words “doesn’t seem to value her own life” again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you going to do?” I say. “Lock me in the bathroom? Because that’s the only way you’ll be able to keep me from going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touches his forehead and lets his hand drag down the side of his face. I have never seen his face sag that way before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to stop you. I want you to stop yourself,” he says. “But if you’re going to be reckless, you can’t prevent me from coming along.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is still dark, but just barely, when we reach the bridge, which is two-tiered, with stone pillars at each corner. We descend the stairs next to one of the stone pillars and creep with silent feet at river level. Large puddles of standing water gleam as the light of day hits them. The sun is rising; we have to get into position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUriah and Zeke are in the buildings on either side of the bridge so they can get a better view and cover us from a distance. They have better aim than Lynn or Shauna, who came because Lynn asked her to, despite her outburst in the Gathering Place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynn goes first, her back pressed to the stone as she inches along the lower lip of the bridge supports. I follow her, with Shauna and Tobias behind me. The bridge is supported by four curved metal structures that secure it to the stone wall, and by a maze of narrow girders beneath its lower tier. Lynn wedges herself under one of the metal structures and climbs quickly, keeping the narrow girders beneath her as she works her way to the middle of the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let Shauna go in front of me because I can’t climb as well. My left arm shakes as I try to balance on top of the metal structure. I feel Tobias’s cool hand on my waist, steadying me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crouch low to fit in the space between the bottom of the bridge and the girders beneath me. I don’t make it very far before I have to stop, my feet on one girder and my left arm on another. And I will have to stay that way for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias slides along one of the girders and puts his leg under me. It is long enough to stretch beneath me and onto a second girder. I breathe out and smile at him as a kind of thank-you. It’s the first time we have acknowledged each other since we left the Merciless Mart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles back, but grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe bide our time in silence. I breathe through my mouth and try to control the shaking of my arms and legs. Shauna and Lynn seem to communicate without speaking. They make faces at each other that I can’t read, and nod and smile at each other when they reach an understanding. I have never thought about what it would be like to have a sister. Would Caleb and I be closer if he were a girl?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city is so quiet in the morning that the footsteps echo as they approach the bridge. The sound comes from behind me, which must mean it’s Jack and his Dauntless escort, not the Erudite, who have arrived. The Dauntless know that we are here, though Jack Kang himself does not. If he stares down for more than a few seconds, he might see us through the metal mesh beneath his feet. I try to breathe as quietly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias checks his watch, and then holds his arm out to me to show me the time. Seven o’clock exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up and peer through the steel web above me. Feet pass over my head. And then I hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Jack,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s Max, who appointed Eric to Dauntless leadership at Jeanine’s demand, who implemented policies of cruelty and brutality in Dauntless initiation. I have never spoken to him directly, but the sound of his voice makes me shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Max,” Jack says. “Where’s Jeanine? I thought she would at least have the courtesy to show up herself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jeanine and I divide our responsibilities according to our strengths,” he says. “That means I make all military decisions. I believe that includes what we are doing today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown. I haven’t heard Max speak much, but something about the words he’s using, and their rhythm, sounds . . . off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” says Jack. “I came to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I should inform you that this will not be a negotiation,” Max says. “In order to negotiate, you have to be on even footing, and you, Jack, are not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean that you are the only disposable faction. Candor does not provide us with protection, sustenance, or technological innovation. Therefore you are expendable to us. And you have not done much to win the favor of your Dauntless guests,” says Max, “so you are completely vulnerable and completely useless. I recommend, therefore, that you do exactly as I say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You piece of scum,” says Jack through gritted teeth. “How dare—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now let’s not get testy,” Max says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chew on my lip. I should trust my instincts, and my instincts tell me that something is wrong here. No self-respecting Dauntless man would say the word “testy.” Nor would he react so calmly to an insult. He’s speaking like someone else. He’s speaking like Jeanine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe back of my neck prickles. It makes perfect sense. Jeanine would not trust anyone, particularly not a volatile Dauntless, to speak on her behalf. The best solution to that problem is to give Max an earpiece. And the signal from an earpiece can stretch only a quarter of a mile at most.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch Tobias’s eye, and slowly move my hand to point at my ear. Then I point above me, at my best approximation of where Max stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias frowns for a moment, then nods, but I’m not sure he understands me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have three requirements,” says Max. “First, that you return the Dauntless leader you currently hold in captivity unharmed. Second, that you allow your compound to be searched by our soldiers so that we can extract the Divergent; and third, that you provide us with the names of those who were not injected with the simulation serum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Jack says bitterly. “What are you searching for? And why do you need those names? What do you intend to do with them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The purpose of our search would be to locate and remove any of the Divergent from the premises. And as for the names, that is none of your concern.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurgent-divergent-2/page-21.html","bookId":1699,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM"}
