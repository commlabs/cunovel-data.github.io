Still, the impulse was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dialed 1-800-FLOWERSand sent a dozen roses to Mrs. Dale Whitlock in Rowayton, charging them to Whitlock’s American Express account. He asked them to enclose a card reading “Just because I love you-Dale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt it was the least he could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo days later he was on Taunton Place in White Plains, making his report. Accidents were always good, the man told him. Accidents and natural causes, always the best. Oh, sometimes you needed a noisy hit to send a message, but the rest of the time you couldn’t beat an accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good you could arrange it,” the man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould have taken a hell of an arranger, Keller thought. First you’d have had to arrange for Lyman Crowder to be speeding north in his pickup. Then you’d have had to get an unemployed sheepherder named Danny Vasco good and drunk and send him hurtling toward Martingale, racing his own pickup-Jesus, didn’t they drive anything but pickups?-racing it at ninety-plus miles an hour, and proceeding southbound in the northbound lane. Arrange for a few near misses. Arrange for Vasco to brush a school bus and sideswipe a minivan, and then let him ram Crowder head-on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome arrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the man in White Plains had any idea that the client was dead as well, or even who the client was, he gave no sign to Keller. On the way out, Dot asked him how Crowder pronounced his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rhymes withchowder, ” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew you’d find out,” she said. “Keller, are you all right? You seem different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just awed by the workings of Fate,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” she said, “that’ll do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the train back to the city he thought about the workings of Fate. Earlier he’d tried to tell himself that his side trip to Las Vegas had been a waste of time and money and human life. All he’d had to do was wait a day for Danny Vasco to take the game off the boards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever would have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout his trip to Vegas, there would have been no wreck on the highway. One event had opened some channel that allowed the other to happen. He couldn’t explain this, couldn’t make sense out of it, but somehow he knew it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything had happened exactly the way it had had to happen. Encountering June in the Meet ’n’ Cheat, running into Hobie at the Burnout Bar. He could no more have avoided those meetings than he could have kept himself from buying the paperback western novel that had set the tone for everything that followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped Mrs. Whitlock liked the flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3 Keller\u0027s Therapy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had thisdream,” Keller said. “Matter of fact I wrote it down, as you suggested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore getting on the couch Keller had removed his jacket and hung it on the back of a chair. He moved from the couch to retrieve his notebook from the jacket’s inside breast pocket, then sat on the couch and found the page with the dream on it. He read through his notes rapidly, closed the book, and sat there, uncertain how to proceed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you prefer,” said Breen. “Sitting up or lying down, whichever is more comfortable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd which was more comfortable? A seated posture seemed more natural for conversation, while lying down on the couch had the weight of tradition on its side. Keller, who felt driven to give this his best shot, decided to go with tradition. He stretched out, put his feet up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “I’m living in a house, except it’s almost like a castle. Endless passageways and dozens of rooms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it your house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I just live here. In fact I’m a kind of servant for the family that owns the house. They’re almost like royalty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you are a servant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Except I have very little to do, and I’m treated like an equal. I play tennis with members of the family. There’s this tennis court in back of the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And this is your job? To play tennis with them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that’s an example of how they treat me as an equal. And I eat at the same table with them, instead of eating downstairs with the servants. My job is the mice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The mice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house is infested with mice. I’m having dinner with the family, I’ve got a plate piled high with good food, and a waiter in black tie comes in and presents a covered dish. I lift the cover and there’s a note on it, and it says, ‘Mice.’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just the single word?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all. I get up from the table and I follow the servant down a long hallway, and I wind up in an unfinished room in the attic. There are tiny mice all over the room, there must be twenty or thirty of them, and I have to kill them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By crushing them underfoot. That’s the quickest and most humane way, but it bothers me and I don’t want to do it. But the sooner I finish, the sooner I can get back to my dinner, and I’m very hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you kill the mice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Keller said. “One almost gets away but I stomp on it just as it’s getting out the door. And then I’m back at the dinner table and everybody’s eating and drinking and laughing, and my plate’s been cleared away. Then there’s a big fuss, and finally they bring my plate back from the kitchen, but it’s not the same food as before. It’s… ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mice,” Keller said. “They’re skinned and cooked, but it’s a plateful of mice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you eat them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s when I woke up,” Keller said. “And not a moment too soon, I’d have to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” Breen said. He was a tall man, long-limbed and gawky, wearing chinos and a dark green shirt and a brown corduroy jacket. He looked to Keller like someone who had been a nerd in high school, and who now managed to look distinguished, in an eccentric sort of way. He said “Ah” again, and folded his hands, and asked Keller what he thought the dream meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re the doctor,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think it means that I am the doctor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I think you’re the one who can say what it means. Maybe it just means I shouldn’t eat Rocky Road ice cream right before I go to bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me what you think the dream might mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I see myself as a cat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or as an exterminator?” Keller didn’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let us work with this dream on a very superficial level,” Breen said. “You’re employed as a corporate troubleshooter, except that you used another word for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They tend to call us expediters,” Keller said, “but troubleshooter is what it amounts to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most of the time there is nothing for you to do. You have considerable opportunity for recreation, for living the good life. For tennis, as it were, and for nourishing yourself at the table of the rich and powerful. Then mice are discovered, and it is at once clear that you are a servant with a job to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I get it,” Keller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go on, then. Explain it to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it? There’s a problem and I’m called in and I have to drop what I’m doing and go and deal with it. I have to take abrupt arbitrary action, and that can involve firing people and closing out whole departments. I have to do it, but it’s like stepping on mice. And when I’m back at the table and I want my food-I suppose that’s my salary?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your compensation, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I get a plate of mice.” He made a face. “In other words, what? My compensation comes from the destruction of the people I have to cut adrift. My sustenance comes at their expense. So it’s a guilt dream?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think it’s guilt. My profit derives from the misfortunes of others, from the grief I bring to others. That’s it, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the surface, yes. When we go deeper, perhaps we will begin to discover other connections. With your having chosen this job in the first place, perhaps, and with some aspects of your childhood.” He interlaced his fingers and sat back in his chair. “Everything is of a piece, you know. Nothing exists alone and nothing is accidental. Even your name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peter Stone. Think about it, why don’t you, between now and our next session.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think about my name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About your name and how it suits you. And”-a reflexive glance at his wristwatch-“I’m afraid our hour is up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerrold Breen’s office was on Central Park West at Ninety-fourth Street. Keller walked to Columbus Avenue, rode a bus five blocks, crossed the street, and hailed a taxi. He had the driver go through Central Park, and by the time he got out of the cab at Fiftieth Street he was reasonably certain he hadn’t been followed. He bought coffee in a deli and stood on the sidewalk, keeping an eye open while he drank it. Then he walked to the building where he lived, on First Avenue between Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth. It was a prewar high-rise, with an Art Deco lobby and an attended elevator. “Ah, Mr. Keller,” the attendant said. “A beautiful day, yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beautiful,” Keller agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller had a one-bedroom apartment on the nineteenth floor. He could look out his window and see the UN building, the East River, the borough of Queens. On the first Sunday in November he could watch the runners streaming across the Queensboro Bridge, just a couple of miles past the midpoint of the New York marathon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a spectacle Keller tried not to miss. He would sit at his window for hours while thousands of them passed through his field of vision, first the world-class runners, then the middle-of-the-pack plodders, and finally the slowest of the slow, some walking, some hobbling. They started in Staten Island and finished in Central Park, and all he saw was a few hundred yards of their ordeal as they made their way over the bridge into Manhattan. Sooner or later the sight always moved him to tears, although he could not have said why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was something to talk about with Breen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a woman who had led him to the therapist’s couch, an aerobics instructor named Donna. Keller had met her at the gym. They’d had a couple of dates, and had been to bed a couple of times, enough to establish their sexual incompatibility. Keller still went to the same gym two or three times a week to raise and lower heavy metal objects, and when he ran into her they were friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne time, just back from a trip somewhere, he must have rattled on about what a nice town it was. “Keller,” she said, “if there was ever a born New Yorker, you’re it. You know that, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’ve always got this fantasy, living the good life in Elephant, Montana. Every place you go, you dream up a whole life to go with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that bad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s saying it’s bad? But I bet you could have fun with it in therapy.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hit-man-keller-1/page-8.html","bookId":2312,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:25 PM"}
