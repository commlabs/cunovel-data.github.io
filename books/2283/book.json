The Krewe of Hunters, a special FBI unit of paranormal investigators. In this case, it\u0027s agent Jane Everett. Jane\u0027s also a talented artist who creates images of the dead as they once were. But the Krewe always works with local law enforcement, and here that means Sloan Trent, former Houston cop and now sheriff. His great-great-grandmother was an actress at the Gilded Lily... and she\u0027s not resting in peace. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThen more remains appear in the nearby desert. As they search for answers, using all the skills at their disposal, Jane and Sloan find themselves falling into danger â€” and into love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-night-is-watching-krewe-of-hunters-9.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-watching-krewe-of-hunters-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:30 PM"}
