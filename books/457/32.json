Albert Edward blew a kiss. \"Afternoon, Algy. How chit he looks in his pink and all!

We\u0027ve named them \u0027The Maconochies,\u0027 which, being interpreted, meaneth a little of everything.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And how many hares have you killed?\" Algy inquired.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We haven\u0027t exactly killed any as yet,\" said I, \"but we\u0027ve put the breeze up \u0027em; their moral is very low.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, my bold Nimrods,\" said Algy, \"I\u0027m sorry to say the game is up.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you mean by \u0027game\u0027?\" objected Albert Edward. \"I\u0027ve told you before that this is a serious attempt to avert a plague of rodents.

But some people who have not enjoyed your harrowing Colonial experience are a trifle sceptical. Listen. Last evening, as I was driving home with the old man through Vaux-le-Tour, whom should I see but you two sportsmen out on the hillside riding down a hare, followed at some distance by three mounted bargees——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The Padre, the Field Cashier and O.C.

By the way, don\u0027t you get your hunt the wrong way round, the cart before the horse, so to speak?

You woke him up yourself, my son, by tootling on your little tin trumpet. He heard it through his dreams, shot up with a \u0027Good Lord, what\u0027s that?\u0027 popped his head out of the window and saw the brave cavalcade reeling out along the sky-line like a comic movie. He drank in the busy scene, then turned to me and said——\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Albert Edward interrupted. \"I know exactly what he said. He said, \u0027Algy, me boy, that\u0027s the spirit. Vive le sport! How it reminds us of our young days in the Peninsular! Oft-times has our cousin of Wellington remarked to us how Waterloo was won on the playing——\u0027\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Algy cut off the flow and continued with his piece. \"He said to me, \u0027God bless my soul, if those young devils aren\u0027t galloping a hare!\u0027 I said, \u0027Sir, they maintain that they are doing good work by averting a threatened plague of rodents, a state of affairs which has proved very detrimental to the Anti-podes.\u0027\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Threatened plague of grandmothers!\u0027 replied the old warrior. \u0027They\u0027re enjoying themselves, that\u0027s what they\u0027re doing—having a splendid time. Mind you, I\u0027ve no objection to you young chaps amusing yourselves in secret, but this is too damn flagrant altogether. Just imagine the hullabaloo in the House if word of these goings-on got home. \"B.E.F. enjoying themselves! Don\u0027t they know there\u0027s a war on? Cherchez le général and off with his head!\" Trot round and see your dog-fancying friends and tell \u0027em that if they\u0027re fond of good works I recommend crochet.\u0027 Thus the General. I must be off now, got to take the old bird up to have a peep at the War. Good-byee.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Algy tripped daintily off home again, twirling his cane and whistling cheerfully. Sourly we watched him depart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I believe that youth positively revels in spreading gloom,\" Albert Edward growled. \"Oh, well, I suppose we\u0027ll have to get rid of the dogs now. Orders is orders.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But do you think they\u0027ll go?\" I asked. \"We\u0027ve been feeding \u0027em occasionally of late.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We\u0027ll herd \u0027em down to where they can get wind of the infantry cookers,\" said Albert Edward; \"once they sniff the rare old stew they\u0027ll forget all about us.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Accordingly an hour later we released our pack from the hen-house for the last time. They immediately gave chase to an errant tabby kitten, which threw off a noise like many siphons and shot up a tree, baffling them completely. We speedily herded them out of the chateau grounds, Albert Edward ambling in front, wringing mournful music out of his horn, and I bringing up the rear, snapping my whip-cracker under the sterns of the laggards. We had no sooner left the park for the open grass country beyond when up jumped a buck hare, right from under our feet, and away went the pack rejoicing, bass and falsetto.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Albert Edward tugged his excited mare to a standstill. \"Look at those blighters!\" he shouted. \"Hunting noses down in pukka style for the first time, just because they know we can\u0027t follow them. Oh, this is too much!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t see why we shouldn\u0027t follow them at a distance,\" said I. \"We can pretend there\u0027s no connection—there is no connection really, we didn\u0027t lay \u0027em on. They\u0027re hunting on their own. We\u0027re just out for a ride.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Albert Edward winked an eye at me and gave his mare her head. The pack by this time was well across the plain, the wolf leading, noisily supported by the Maconochies and the bloodhound. Thrice the hare turned clear and squatted, but, thanks to the blood dog\u0027s infallible nose, he was ousted each time and pushed on, failing visibly. He made a sharp curve towards the windmill, and Albert Edward and I topped the miller\u0027s fence in time to see the Maconochies roll him over among the weeds. We also saw something on the highway behind the mill which we had not previously noticed, namely a grey Limousine. On a fallen tree by the wayside sat the General, his face as highly coloured as his hat. Towards us down the garden-path tripped Algy, twirling his cane and whistling cheerily. Albert Edward groaned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Something in the demeanour of yon youth tells me he beareth our death-warrants. Here, you hold the horses while I feed the guillotine. This is by far, far the best thing that I have ever done.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He slung his reins and tottered to his doom. I watched him approach within five yards of the old man when a strange thing happened. The General suddenly uttered a loud cry and, leaping to his feet, commenced to dance up and down the road, tearing and belabouring himself and swearing so outrageously that I had difficulty in holding the horses. His chauffeur and Algy rushed to his side, and they and Albert Edward grouped in a sympathetic circle while he danced and raved and beat himself in their midst. Presently the air seemed to be full of flying tunics, shirts, camisoles, etc., and a second later I beheld the extraordinary spectacle of a Lieutenant-General dancing practically nude (expecting for his cap and boots) in the middle of a French highway, while two subalterns and a private smacked him all over, and most heartily. For nearly a minute it continued, and then he seemed to get himself under control and was led away by Algy to his car, the chauffeur following, retrieving apparel off trees and bushes. Albert Edward, one quivering smirk, wobbled up and took his reins. \"By Jove! saved again. He can\u0027t very well bite the hand that spanked him, can he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But what on earth was the matter?\" I asked. \"A fit, religious mania, a penance—what?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He sat on a waspodrome,\" said Albert Edward, \"and they got on his tail.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3294/90107.html","bookId":457,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:31:54 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:31:54 AM"}
