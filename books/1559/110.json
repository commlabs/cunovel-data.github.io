The sword was heavy now, three dead beasts changed the balance, and Inigo wanted to clear the weapon, but now another flutter, a single one, and no veering this time, straight and deadly for his face and he ducked and was lucky; the sword moved up and into the heart of the lethal thing and now there were four skewered on the sword of legend, and Inigo knew he was not about to lose this fight and from his throat came the words, “I am Inigo Montoya and still the Wizard; come for me,” and when he heard three of them fluttering, he wished he had been just a bit more modest but it was too late for that, so he needed surprise, and he took it, shifting position against the beasts, standing straight, taking their dives long before they expected it, and now there were seven king bats and his sword was completely out of balance and that would have been a bad thing, a dangerous thing, except for one important aspect: there was silence now in the darkness. The fluttering was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some giant you are,” Inigo said then, and he stepped over Fezzik and hurried down the rest of the darkened stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFezzik got up and lumbered after him, saying, “Inigo, listen, I made a mistake before, you didn’t lie to me, you tricked me, and father always said tricking was fine, so I’m not mad at you any more, and is that all right with you? It’s all right with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned the knob on the door at the bottom of the black stairs and stepped onto the fourth level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInigo looked at him. “You mean you’ll forgive me completely for saving your life if I completely forgive you for saving mine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re my friend, my only one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pathetic, that’s what we are,” Inigo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Athletic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s very good,” Inigo said, so Fezzik knew they were fine again. They started toward the sign that said, “To Level Five,” passing strange cages. “This is the worst yet,” Inigo said, and then he jumped back, because behind a pale glass case, a blood eagle was actually eating what looked like an arm. And on the other side there was a great black pool, and whatever was in it was dark and many armed and the water seemed to get sucked toward the center of the pool where the mouth of the thing was. “Hurry,” Inigo said, and he found himself trembling at the thought of being dropped into the black pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey opened the door and looked down toward the fifth level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first place, the door they opened had no lock, so it could not trap them. And in the second place the stairs were all brightly lit. And in the third place the stairs were absolutely straight. And in the fourth place, it wasn’t a long flight at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the main place, there was nothing inside. It was bright and clean and totally, without the least doubt, empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe it for a minute,” Inigo said, and, holding his sword at the ready, he took the first step down. “Stay by the door—the candles will go out any second.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-110.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
