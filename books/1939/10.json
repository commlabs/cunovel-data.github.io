Rather than explain, rather than reveal how deeply his total disregard and lack of concern had cut her, Winter bounded to her feet and headed out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winter...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we could have a decent conversation for once,\" she said, struggling to hold back her own anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You come to me after weeks of silence because you want my permission to date another man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a matter of fact, you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going to argue about semantics?\" she asked. How quickly they\u0027d fallen back into the same old patterns. A few minutes earlier, Winter had been nearly breathless with anticipation. Now she was close to tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want to date this other man, don\u0027t let me stand in your way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" she said and smiled sweetly. \"He\u0027s a doctor, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that was mature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About as mature as telling me you\u0027re dating a doctor. Just leave, Winter, before I say something I regret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the one with regrets, Pierre. I never should\u0027ve come here, never should\u0027ve assumed that being apart would make any difference. I can see nothing\u0027s changed. I thought I loved you... I thought you loved me, too, but I can see how wrong I was.\" She rushed through the kitchen, blinded by anger and sorrow, and almost ran to the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierre didn\u0027t follow, and that was just as well. She\u0027d learned the answer to her unspoken question. Pierre was completely and utterly indifferent to her. His one concern was whether she might be pregnant. He was no more ready to be a husband and father than...than the man in the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurrying into the street, Winter paused, her pulse beating in her ear like a sledgehammer. Breathless, she leaned against the building and placed both hands over her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting had gone so much worse than she\u0027d expected. Pierre didn\u0027t need three months to decide about their relationship. Apparently, he didn\u0027t even need three weeks. His decision had been made. Which meant hers was, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer life with Pierre had come to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Dr. Michael Everett was interested in pursuing a relationship, then Winter needed to open her heart to the possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday morning I met Ritchie at the gym. The Saturday afternoon we\u0027d spent together had lifted my spirits. Max\u0027s softball game had gone well--his team had won--and it felt good to sit in the bleachers with the other parents and cheer on my nephew. Max, at almost nine, was a terrific kid. Afterward, the two of us played Xbox until Steph called us down for dinner. As soon as we\u0027d finished, we both went upstairs again, eager to get back to our game. Ritchie eventually joined us, but his expertise was on a level with mine. Max beat us both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy had been a great favorite of Hannah\u0027s. She\u0027d loved spending time with him; she used to buy him books, take him to movies and attend his Little League games whenever she could. Losing his adored aunt was hard for Max, and he hardly ever mentioned Hannah anymore. That didn\u0027t bother me. I knew Max treasured his memories of Hannah the same as I did. I saw her picture in his bedroom when he showed me the latest addition to his baseball card collection. My gaze fell on the photograph, and Max, ever sensitive and kind, had simply walked over and hugged me. I hugged him back. We didn\u0027t need to talk; his gentle embrace said far more than words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hear from Winter?\" Ritchie asked as we walked out of the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d wondered when he\u0027d get around to asking me that. I\u0027d just about made a clean escape, but I should\u0027ve known my brother-in-law wouldn\u0027t let it pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She left a message on Sunday afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t going to tell me, were you?\" Ritchie chastised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\" No point in lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought.\" We walked toward the parking garage, and I hoped that would be the end of the subject. Wishful thinking on my part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t pick up, did you?\" Ritchie said when I didn\u0027t elaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was continually surprised by how well Ritchie could predict my behavior. It was almost as if he\u0027d been sitting in the same room with me. \"No,\" I admitted reluctantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did she say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Nothing much. She asked me to return the call when it was convenient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long do you suppose it\u0027ll be before you find it convenient?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy delaying tactic wasn\u0027t working as successfully as I\u0027d hoped. \"I thought I\u0027d give her a call later this afternoon.\" Maybe. I wasn\u0027t convinced Winter and I were a good match, despite what Hannah seemed to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t disappoint me,\" Ritchie warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was grateful when I reached my car, eager to bring this awkward conversation to a close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about poker on Thursday night?\" Ritchie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes I swore he had radar and knew exactly how hard to push before backing off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steve\u0027s got a meeting,\" he went on, \"and can\u0027t make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. I used to play with Ritchie and the other guys every Thursday. In fact, I\u0027d been the one to instigate the poker game. Patrick O\u0027Malley, one of my partners, Steve Ciletti, an internal-medicine specialist, Ritchie and I used to get together for poker every week. At first we took turns hosting and then we settled on Ritchie and Steph\u0027s place because it\u0027s centrally located and easily accessible to all of us. We never played past midnight and the wagers were friendly. I\u0027d given up poker and all other unnecessary distractions after Hannah was diagnosed with cancer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" I said automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill\u0027s been substituting for you for two years now. Isn\u0027t it time you rejoined the group?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I will,\" I said. I wasn\u0027t sure why I hesitated. I used to enjoy our poker nights, and I didn\u0027t understand my own reluctance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had hospital rounds that morning. We did it on a rotation basis and this was my week. Because Hannah had spent so much time in this hospital, I\u0027d had the opportunity to see the situation from two different perspectives-- first, as a physician, and secondly, as the spouse of a patient. I could write a book on what I\u0027d learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I arrived at the hospital, I noticed signs everywhere for the annual picnic. The children\u0027s ward put on a huge charity function each year, one specially designed for children with cancer. This wasn\u0027t a fund-raising event. The sole purpose was to let them be kids and forget about chemo and surgery for an afternoon. Hannah and I had volunteered at the picnic for several years and since I often had a patient or two in the pediatric oncology ward, it was very personal for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael.\" Patrick O\u0027Malley called my name as he walked down the wide corridor to meet me. I hadn\u0027t expected to see him; he must\u0027ve been there for one of his patients. \"What\u0027s this I hear about you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I didn\u0027t know anyone had much of anything to discuss about me. I\u0027d pretty much stayed under the radar, especially when it came to social activities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friday night at the clinic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that.\" Actually, I was embarrassed by the altercation and wished I\u0027d kept my cool. I\u0027d just...snapped. I didn\u0027t know what had brought it on and had regretted it ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you threatened some guy within an inch of his life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to talk about it. \"His wife fell down the stairs--\" I made quotation marks with my fingers \"--three times in three months. I figured someone should do something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wouldn\u0027t press charges?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently not. She wouldn\u0027t admit the guy even touched her.\" I might have maintained my professional attitude, but her chart confirmed that her injuries had become more extensive with each assault. Shamika didn\u0027t seem to realize she was risking her life if she stayed with the creep. Still, I was appalled by my own behavior; the audacity of it was completely unlike anything I\u0027d ever done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You only did what all of us have felt like doing a dozen times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter, I\u0027d been out of line. \"I don\u0027t think the clinic wants me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\" Patrick said. \"It\u0027s hard enough for them to get volunteers. They\u0027ll look the other way, at least this once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought so, too, but my decision was made. I\u0027d resigned. My uncharacteristic act of violence simply disturbed me too much. A replacement doctor had already been found, according to Mimi, but I didn\u0027t tell Patrick any of this. He\u0027d find out soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of volunteers,\" Patrick said, glancing pointedly at the posters decorating the hallway. \"The picnic\u0027s on Saturday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a little early this year, isn\u0027t it?\" I asked, stalling for time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. It\u0027s always in May.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t attended last year\u0027s. Hannah\u0027s funeral had been only a couple of weeks before that and I was barely coping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could use a few more volunteers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got plans,\" I said, although it wasn\u0027t true. Again, my own reluctance baffled me. Until Hannah\u0027s illness and death, I\u0027d enjoyed being part of the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you change your plans?\" Patrick asked. \"We\u0027re really shorthanded. We need someone to help with the games.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need a volunteer to flip burgers, too, if that\u0027s more to your liking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see Patrick wasn\u0027t going to make this easy. \"I might be able to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need every worker we can get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long would I need to be there?\" I asked, hedging. If I could find a way out of this I\u0027d gladly take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatrick shrugged. \"A couple of hours should do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll rearrange my plans,\" I said, continuing the farce. The only thing I had scheduled for Saturday was my routine five-mile run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, buddy.\" He slapped me on the back and hurried off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word that I\u0027d signed up as a volunteer at the Kids with Cancer event spread faster than a California brushfire. Clearly Patrick hadn\u0027t wasted any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of other physicians stopped me during my rounds to say how pleased they were that I was socializing again. In my opinion, the news that I was volunteering at a charity function shouldn\u0027t be treated like a public announcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, I wasn\u0027t socializing. I\u0027d been pressured into helping what I considered a good cause. I wouldn\u0027t be doing this at all if Patrick hadn\u0027t cornered me and practically blackmailed me into it. Naturally, I couldn\u0027t say that. I smiled at the two physicians and quickly extricated myself from the conversation so I could go about my business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t taken more than a few steps when I noticed a couple of the nurses with their heads together, whispering. They looked up a bit guiltily as I approached them, and I realized they were probably talking about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning, Dr. Everett,\" the first one said. She seemed impossibly young and energetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning,\" I responded and picked up my pace. Over the course of the past year I\u0027d received quite a bit of attention from certain women in the medical field. I was fairly young and presentable...and I was available, at least in theory. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-10.html","bookId":1939,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:23 AM"}
