He knew that the Kig-Yar, after leaving their homeworld, had chosen to settle out among the asteroids of their home system. It was what had made them so hard for the Prophets to ferret out while battling them when the Kig-Yar had initially resisted joining the Covenant. \"Yes. We will seed the asteroid belt with sensor buoys. We will leave no stone unturned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhar nodded. \"It will be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel leaned over. \"Veer, would you do me the ...\" his voice dripped with sarcasm, \"... honor of contacting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Psalm Every Day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeer nodded, and the three-dimensional image of Pellius appeared in front of Thel. The Jiralhanae stood eye-to-eye with Thel. Behind the giant, furred chieftain sat the Kig-Yar Ship-mistress, Chur \u0027R-Mut, her lanky arms draped over her chair\u0027s arms. He grinned his needle-sharp grin and the quills on his head twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePellius curled his lip slightly. \"What do you want? We\u0027re preparing to land and search the destroyed capital city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will not find anything there,\" Thel said, and explained what he\u0027d already told his bridge crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jiralhanae chieftan looked disappointed. For a second. \"You still search, though?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" And then the image faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"jiralhanae,\" spat Saal from his weapons console. \"Uncivil and untrustworthy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they are,\" Thel agreed. \"The Prophets in their inscrutable wisdom have assigned them to us. They are here to stay. Zhar move us out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout seeding the system with navigation buoys the ship\u0027s own long-range scanners weren\u0027t good enough to root out a hiding enemy. Unless\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething was moving around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo catch sneaking ships, they\u0027d need to lay some traps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel settled into his chair, getting ready for the Slipspace hop they\u0027d have to make to the asteroid belt, when Veer straightened in his chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shipmaster,\" Veer hissed. \"Our long range instruments are detecting multiple signals. They are not even trying to hide!\" Thel hid his excitement before them. \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gas giant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot where he\u0027d been expecting. But nonetheless, they had something!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take us there,\" Thel ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetribution\u0027s Thunder poked a hole through space and time as the ship made the sudden leap from Madrigal to a trailing orbit just behind 23 Librae\u0027s sole gas giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a great location Thel thought. Gas giants tended to have small rocky clusters both in front of their orbit and behind them -- it was a natural place to hove his ship to and spy on whatever was going on near the gas giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetribution\u0027s Thunder\u0027s screens lit up with contact symbols. Alarms wailed as the crew scrambled for damage control and fire stations, and Thel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erealized he hadn\u0027t been the only one with that particular idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Situation?\" Thel barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are everywhere!\" a Sangheili shouted from the deck. \"We are surrounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel whipped around at the outburst to look at the unnamed and slightly unnerved Sangheili. \"Get off my bridge!\" Thel turned to Saal. \"Take his console. What do we face -- numbers and weapons strength?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My honor, Shipmaster,\" Saal replied quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel watched the shamed Sangheili slink off the bridge, disgusted that someone so incompetent could end up on his bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Human contacts,\" Saal reported. \"But they do not appear to be warships. And they are not moving to engage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell Pellius to hold his fire and follow our lead.\" Thel stood up and walked toward the screens, a long shipmaster\u0027s cloak pulling off the chair with him. His ancestors had worn thick, doarmir-fur cloaks like this at sea to stay warm and dry on long voyages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel had made his by hand during a long recuperation in the Vadam Keep after a training accident the family had tried to hide. Thel remembered the shame of seeing his own blood spilled on the sand of the training ring in the courtyard, due to his own mistake. He recalled the faintness and the tall snowcapped mountains that rose above Vadam Keep as he pitched to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe family had a recently promoted shipmaster in their bloodline, and they had been loath to lose that particular honor. They\u0027d secretly called for a doctor in the night and held Thel down by his limbs as he was operated on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel kept the cloak as a reminder to himself that he could make grave mistakes when he let his guard down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMistakes like letting an inexperienced minor Sangheili aboard the bridge who panicked at the thought of being surrounded by human warships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make sure that coward gets his rations revoked,\" Thel said to Veer, letting his mind dwell on that particular incident now that he knew the ship was not in danger. \"Maybe with a hunger in his belly he will find the hunger in his soul that he needs to be a real warrior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A well thought-out solution, shipmaster,\" Veer said, and leaned over to send out the command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saal, report.\" Thel gathered the cloak around. Be sharp, he reminded himself. Keep your mind open, and think sideways instead of walking forward into a pit-trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I have to show you,\" Saal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA complex set of scans appeared on the screens. Thel narrowed his eyes, then opened his mandibles in shock. \"These are all asteroids,\" he said. \"They are all connected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were hundreds of connected worldlets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is unlike anything I have ever seen the humans do,\" Thel said out loud. \"There was nothing like it when the human world here was destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps they built it after that?\" Zhar suggested. He looked intrigued by the scans. \"You have to admit, that demonstrates some strong blood on their part, to remain here and build after the Prophets ordered them destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strong indeed,\" Thel agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it does them little good ultimately,\" Jora said. \"Their blasphemy still cannot stand, and they must all still die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What bothers me,\" Thel grumbled, \"is that they have gone this long unnoticed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I know why,\" Zhar said. He tapped his console, and before the bridge crew the long-distance image of a Kig-Yar freighter appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was docked against one of the many asteroids in the superstructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA human structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What new treachery is this?\" Thel hissed. The Kig-Yar, pirates and scum, worked under contracts given out by the ministries. They were hardly loyal fighters; they had little nobility. But they usually remained in line due to the dual methods of Unggoy Deacons aboard their ships, as well as the contracts and payments the Prophets offered them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel could hardly believe what he saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brace for impact!\" Saal warned, just as the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetribution\u0027s Thunder shivered, throwing Thel from his feet against a pillar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the humans had found them and were attacking, Thel thought as he sprang for his shipmaster\u0027s throne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second impact stabbed through the heart of Thel\u0027s ship, a violent, metal-boiling line of light that just missed the bridge. But this wasn\u0027t human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans employed kinetic or explosive ordnance, not plasma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Psalm Every Day was preparing a second volley. It was very obvious that the plasma salvo was from another Covenant vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir own escort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Traitors!\" Thel seethed. \"Evasive maneuvers!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a firing solution,\" Jora yelled, turning to Thel. \"Permission to fire, Shipmaster?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fire at will! Saal tactical Slipspace, now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut getting past the shock of being fired upon by their own escort had cost them critical seconds. Even as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetribution\u0027s Thunder fired back, another salvo of blue plasma ripped through the heart of Thel\u0027s ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel some of the engines firing, but they had been too slow. Sangheili double hearts could take far more acceleration than Jiralhanae or Kig-Yar, but the incredible random high-speed evasive maneuvers Thel had braced himself for didn\u0027t come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Status,\" Thel snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not like the returning reports. They were venting precious air into space. The number of casualties was rising. Long range communications were down. Life support was failing. The last volley had taken their core engines offline, and their ability to generate plasma had gone with it. While most of their sensors were still operational, they could go nowhere and do nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePellius appeared in hologram before Thel. The Jiralhanae looked pleased with himself, his large teeth bared. \"A mighty shipmaster Sangheili, helpless before me. I shall savor this moment for the rest of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel stared at Pellius and wondered where the Kig-Yar ship-mistress had gone. She was nowhere to be seen on the bridge. \"It will be a short life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as short as yours. Good-bye, Shipmaster.\" Pellius faded away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has released boarding craft and Spirits!\" Saal reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will not have the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetributions\u0027 Thunder,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel said, staring at the spot Pellius had faded from. \"Alert the crew. Get in protective gear and draw the boarders in deep. Rig every section to explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will leave nothing to salvage!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shipmaster! A Psalm Every Day has engaged their slipspace drive!\" Zhar said. \"They\u0027re leaving!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leaving?\" Jora growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The humans are not likely to go anywhere as are we. He will report whatever his feeble mind can concoct when he reaches\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh Charity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They get the glory for reporting this structure and the humans hiding here,\" Zhar concluded with frustration. \"Cursed cowards,\" hissed Jora. \"The Spirits are approaching to attack!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are their boarding craft?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are hanging back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, the outer hull shook and shivered as Spirits flew up and down the length of the ship, strafing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel broke the arm off his chair in frustration. \"Those who wish to escape the ship may do so now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a rhetorical statement. But it did serve one purpose: to weed out any dishonorable Sangheili who might falter by your side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel pressed his mouth parts firm against each other as they waited in silence for a handful of dishonorable crew to desert. Maybe they were serfs who had risen far enough to work simple duties aboard the ship, or Sangheili who\u0027d managed to hide their lack of real blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for that, and for the Kig-Yar to get bolder and try to board the ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the screens showed Sangheili trying to escape aboard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpirits from inside\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetribution\u0027s Thunder\u0027s hold, and the Kig-Yar-run ships fell on them en masse, overwhelming them. Plasma ripped out and filled the space around the ship, and it wasn\u0027t long before the cowardly died in the vacuum at the hands of traitorous Kig-Yar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fitting fate, Thel thought. \"Fire the empty escape pods,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched those get destroyed, and it strengthened their resolve to fight. To run was to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the Kig-Yar felt that they could risk boarding, with what seemed like most of the crew of the ship gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel waited. Waited until Kig-Yar swarmed the hull and trooped through the heart of his ship, and then gave the order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExplosions ripped through the interior, section by section. The smooth, bulbous lines of his ship flexed and twisted, and fire gushed out from in between the cracks, roiling up through the corridors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air in the bridge heated up, and then rushed out. Thel found himself panting for air that no longer existed, and then a secondary explosion turned the cockpit inside out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThel hurtled through the air and struck a bulkhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter TWENTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHESIOD, 23 LIBRAE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel was a svelte smuggler of a ship, more engine than cargo bay. Even then, civilian engine technology didn\u0027t hold a candle to what the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night had at its heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night had been shadowing the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel for almost a week. UNSC sensor buoys had been put on high alert on the edges of the system, and caught the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel preparing for its jump into Slipspace. These were the same sensor buoys that had detected the inbound Covenant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDmitri Zheng had thrown the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night on a ripping course out to follow it. Badia Campbell at ops reported nervously that the ship\u0027s reactor was struggling to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the ship had been shaken out. No more pipes blew, or components failed. She\u0027d gotten up to speed, closing in on the Insurrectionist ship like a shark slipping up from the depths on its prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn their way out, they\u0027d all continued to watch broadcasts from sensor posts scattered throughout the system of the Covenant ships moving over\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharybdis IX, glassing the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mood onboard had remained somber and determined. The crew had been itching to fight, and now had to turn tail and run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one liked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they had a mission, and they\u0027d all had friends and family fall to the Covenant. Despite Zheng\u0027s anger, many had gotten used to the dull pain of human loss. Casualties mounted; they had for years. It had become a part of life for many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they were deep behind Covenant lines, hopping through what had once been the Outer Colonies, sticking close behind the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel as it seemed to randomly jump into Slipstream space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re close,\" Keyes announced. The last three jumps the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel had taken made a line on the star charts that Keyes could use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssuming that the jumps continued in their pattern, Keyes had run the charts. He posted the result to the bridge crew\u0027s screens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng took a look and frowned. \"You think they\u0027re headed to Madrigal? That planet was glassed by the Covenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be where they make their drops,\" Keyes suggested. He paused as his sensors showed the smuggler making another jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. The last several Slipspace jumps took them to the outer edge of the system, and then the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel began curving its way in-system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidsummer Night followed, invisible and silent. They coasted with the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKestrel all the way into the depths of the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t Madrigal,\" Keyes announced several shifts later, reviewing the navigation data left by a junior officer. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-cole-protocol-halo-6/page-17.html","bookId":1638,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:18 PM"}
