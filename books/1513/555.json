Even the soul force of a Morning Star Magus who had thousands of years of experience using the top meditation techniques might not be as strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If the Morning Star Magi in the Magus World learn about this, I’m afraid they will go mad over it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin stroked his chin, finding it a little puzzling, “A precious source like this is a fatal attraction to Morning Star Magi. If so, why would Jupiter’s Lightning use this world to trap the Elders despite risking the exposure of the coordinates? This doesn’t make sense...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, everything that had happened previously left Leylin confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe they had confidence in getting rid of the Elders, but did not expect that they could get away, which had them caught unprepared. Or maybe they didn’t even manage to find a source like the firasource stone? After all if they don’t have the help of the A. I. Chip, they will only know the amazing function of the firasource stone if they conduct an on-site inspection...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he could do was to speculate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, the reason the Triserpent Sect is so eager to get the firasource stone could very well be that their Morning Star Magus has already found out the function of it… Now I have to gather as many firasource stones as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth level of Kemoyin’s Pupil already had little effect on Leylin. It had helped his advancement for quite a while already, but there was no change to his soul force at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn actual fact, many Morning Star Magi faced the same difficulty. It was very hard to improve their soul force, even with top-grade meditation techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This trip to the Lava World was such a great decision!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin held his grid tightly, his eyes were filled with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the capital of the Atlan Union, a huge and prosperous place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA void was created deep underground, a massive flame ball staying in the middle of it like a sun, showing the vague figure of a phoenix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA continuous high-pitched whistling of the phoenix was transmitted through the flame ball, the entire ball breathing in and out as if it was alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a huge pentagram-shaped spell formation there, in the middle of which rays of crimson light were been drawn out and immersed into the flame ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Phoenix inside was extremely excited, just like it had benefited greatly from the rays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some remaining crimson light rays dropped down at the side of the spell formation, they solidified over sometime and turned into Fire stones!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, the Phoenix in the flame ball stopped the flame. It transformed into a human bathed in a stunning golden light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a handsome male, he had scarlet hair and brows, his aura filled with surging waves of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the void around him fluctuated, an aura of the peak power of a Radiant Moon Magus surrounded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scarlet-haired man had a regal crimson robe draping over his shoulders, fully dressed on the inside. He went to the other basement which was empty save for a giant mirror, leaving only large amounts of binding runes appearing regularly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“...We meet again, my dear President of Atlan Union, Your Highness Durut!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hologram of someone in Radiant Moon Magus robe with a crescent mark on his forehead appeared in the mirror. Weird dark power was released strangely, his aura somewhat able to compare to Durut’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Magus who appeared in the mirror was the leader of Jupiter’s Lightning, a rank 5 Magus!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, my guest from a foreign world!” Durut smiled, his crimson feathers radiating lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Magus in the mirror turned silent for a while, as if he had sensed something. Moments later, he opened his eyes and smiled, “It seemed like you have accepted my suggestion! How is the effect?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was great, my friend! Just some improvements to be made...” Durut nodded his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This requires me to put in more time and effort. Most importantly, I was unable to get enough on-site information. Unless you allow me to go over....” The Radiant Moon Magus in the mirror shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not! My friend, we are both the elites above the Morning Star realm, and this world needs protection!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDurut rejected immediately. Welcoming a foreign world’s elite was definitely a trouble for himself. Durut had only thought of making use of the Magus with caution, never had he thought of other possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright! Then next let’s talk about the deal.” The leader of Jupiter’s Lightning in the mirror said helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Morning Star Magus was like a little stone on a beach in the world, a little hard to recognise without careful inspection. A Radiant Moon Magus like him, on the other hand, was more obvious, an elephant in the room. The moment he tried to cross over, Durut would attack him mercilessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this matter, Durut was able to gain the support from the world’s will, which made him way more powerful than any ordinary rank 5 Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, despite being a similar rank 5, the man in the mirror had never thought of getting himself into trouble. He could only send some of his man over to run errands for him in secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right, my friend, as long you keep your promise, we of the Emberwing race will show great hospitality!” Durut smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Magus opposite rolled his eyes, “Since you are very satisfied with the Energy Withdrawing spell formation, I have quite a few others you can try it out... In return, I want 500 grams of Morning Star Gold, arcane ore, paradian feathers and also firasource stones...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued with the names of numerous resources, and Durut agreed without any hesitation, “Sure. As long your spell formations work, I will transfer them right away...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Durut had left the chamber, he sneered, “You think I wouldn’t know what you are really up to just by hiding the firasource stone among the long list of sources? How naive!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon reaching the study room had some documents viewed, he was outraged, “ The Triserpent Sect! And the Mobius Organisation! These foreign tribes are way too much! I have to warn them and give them a lesson!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately he took a device from the table which looked like a telephone, strings of letters appearing from his fingers and vanishing into the speaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All Special Task Force units in action, destroy every base of the Triserpent Sect and the Mobius Organisation in the Union’s territories!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDurut recalled something after he had put down the phone, and he passed down another urgent order, “Schiker, take charge of the East region!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That little pup should be back now after the contribution!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDurut’s face finally showed rare tinge of gentleness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The increasing of soul force feels really amazing...” Leylin was far from the capital, therefore he was not aware of the silent undercurrents that developed throughout the Atlan Union. He was still indulged in the joy of the advancement of his soul force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling of using the firasource stone was utterly fantastic, making him feel giddy as if he was drunk. Once the effect ended, his body was much more vigilant than before, and his soul force much more active than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin took a look at his stats:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[Leylin Farlier, Rank 4 Warlock Bloodline: Kemoyin’s Serpent(complete form) Strength: 50 Agility: 45 Vitality: 65 Spiritual Force: 539.7 Magic Power: 539(Magic power in synchronisation with spiritual force) Soul force:???]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even though the soul force is not shown, the spiritual force had increased by 30 plus units, it’s probably a side effect of the increase in soul force!” Leylin was over the moon. This advancement in soul force was comparable to the process of those Morning Star Magi having had to practice top-grade meditation techniques at least 10 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith how things looked, as long as he had enough firasource stones, his soul force would continue to increase at an incredible rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is this firasource stone related to Fireplume? How is this produced?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s eyes brightened. He had even put behind the rescue mission, and finding and gathering of enough firasource stone had become his top priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boss! Boss!” At the same time, Mies’s call sounded from outside, making Leylin frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it? Didn’t I tell you not to disturb me?” Leylin pulled opened the door, displeased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not me, it’s Instructor Schiker. We’ve got a big mission now!” Mies’s face reddened due to agitation, and he was still panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Big mission?” Leylin remained calm before Mies, “Look at how you’re behaving! All those trainings went down the drain…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a weird premonition had taken shape in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it related to the Triserpent Sect?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not too confident in handling this organisation for now, despite there being a huge possibility that it was established by the three Elders. Now that the firasource stone had popped up, however, there were a lot of variables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was very likely that those Morning Star Magi under Jupiter’s Lightning to found out about the secret of the firasource stone. Thus, they were forming connections underground and gathering them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh! And Instructor Schiker wants to see you now in his office!” Mies finally caught his breath and finished the message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it. Wait for me here.” Leylin closed the door and left Mies, dumbfounded, standing outside the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not have to wait long. Minutes later, Leylin had changed into his military outfit and shown up in Schiker’s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ley! Here are your orders. Clear out these bases with your squad.” Schiker signed some documents before handing them over to Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-554\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-556\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-555","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
