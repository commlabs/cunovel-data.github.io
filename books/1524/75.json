But his attack was halted in mid-swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting around, she saw him hanging from the hatch, gurgling, his neck caught in the sliding door. It closed with a pressure meant to hold back six hundred meters of water pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBones cracked. Blood splattered the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away as his body fell to the floor, headless, twitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran a few steps away and vomited, remaining bent over, her stomach quivering. She knew she had no other choice. Kill or be killed, Jack had told her once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn intercom at the control station buzzed. A voice spoke. “Neptune, this is Topside Control. We’re reading an emergency hatch closure. Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren straightened, heart thudding. The Argus must be on its way down. She could not risk being caught. Hurrying to the controls, she frantically tried to remember how to work the radio, moving toggles and dials. Finally, she thumbed the right switch and leaned to the mike. “Topside, this is Neptune. Do not attempt evacuation. I repeat, do not attempt evacuation. The station has been damaged. Implosion imminent. Do you copy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice returned, somber. “Read you. Implosion imminent.” A long pause. “Our prayers are with you, Neptune.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Topside. Over and out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren bit her lip. Finally free, she now turned her attention to more important concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell was Jack?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:35 A.M., Nautilus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack limped down the last canyon. He spotted lights ahead. It was the crash site! He was so close. He pumped the foot pedals, trying to eke a little more power from the drained batteries. The thrusters whined weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf nothing else, the frantic chase through the seamounts had brought him within a quarter mile of the base. After watching David’s lifeboat implode, it had taken Jack only eight minutes to reach the site. However, his computer screen was riddled with blinking warning lights in hues of red and yellow. Worst of all, the battery power level read zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe charge was so low that he’d been forced to turn off all immediately unnecessary systems: lights, carbon dioxide scrubbers, even heaters. After such a short trip, he was already shivering violently, lips blue from the icy cold of these depths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now with the lights of the base illuminating the last of the canyon, Jack turned off his sonar. This earned him another half minute of power to his thrusters. He glided the Nautilus forward. The sub’s skids, bent and twisted, rode an inch above the sandy bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt long last he pulled free of the canyons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter so long in the dark, the lights glared. He squinted. The pillar lay twenty yards to his right, the sea base straight ahead, its three doughnut-shaped sections lit up brightly. He swore under his breath at the distance yet to travel. Why had they constructed the base so far away? He’d never make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProving his words true, the thrusters whined down and stopped with an ominous silence. Jack pounded the foot pedals. “C’mon, not when we’re this damn close!” He managed to earn a weak whine, but nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe settled back, thinking. He rubbed his hands together, his fingertips numb from the cold. “Now what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:48 A.M., Neptune base\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren wiped the blood from her hands onto her pants. She had climbed back up to Level 2 after disengaging the emergency lock-down. For the past five minutes, she had been fruitlessly trying to raise Gabriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCut off, she felt blind and deaf. What was she going to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up, trying to pace away her nervousness. She considered calling topside and coming clean. The fate of the world depended on someone taking action…anyone. But she knew her chances of convincing somebody in authority were futile. The disk with the data from the Fathom was gone, missing along with the body of Dr. Cortez. And who would believe a woman who had just decapitated a decorated member of the U.S. military?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren scratched her head, her heart pounding. There had to be a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she paced, a small temblor shook underfoot. She stopped. The vibrations rattled up her legs. She held her breath. All she needed right now was a deep-sea quake. She moved to one of the portholes. As she peered out, the rattling died away. A fading light caught her eye. It was coming from the pillar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren narrowed her eyes, studying it. Strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the light flared up in the pillar. The ground shook again. She gripped the walls, holding herself steady. For the briefest moment, as the light flared, she spotted the glint of something shiny and metallic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quake ended, and the light faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared, straining, squinting—but could discern nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that?” she mumbled to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she stood, arms tight around her, Karen thought of a way to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:18 A.M., Nautilus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth chattering and weak from stale air, Jack struggled to grab another rock from the silt with the sub’s manipulator arm. Of the first four stones, he had managed to hit the pillar twice. Not bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarlier, as the sub had rested dead on the seabed floor, he’d remembered Charlie’s lesson about the pillar’s sensitivity to energy, even kinetic energy, like something striking its surface. He had just enough battery power to work one of the manipulator arms and lob stones at the pillar. The ground trembled, the pillar flared. But was there anyone to see his SOS? Had the base been abandoned already? He had no way of knowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe struggled to dig free another stone. His vision blurred. The cold and the carbon dioxide were taking their toll. As he fought to stay conscious, the manipulator arm froze up. He tugged at the controls. Not enough power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried the radio one last time. The batteries’ remaining dribble of juice was enough to power a final call. “Can anyone hear me? Charlie…anyone…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroaning, Jack collapsed back into his cold seat. No answer. He shivered and trembled all over. Waiting. The deep waters had sucked all heat from the small sub. His vision dimmed again. He began to swim in and out of consciousness. He fought it, but the ocean was stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his last flicker of consciousness, he spotted the large monster bearing down at him…then darkness swallowed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:21 A.M., Neptune base\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren sat before the control station on Level 1. She manipulated the joystick for the ROV robot named Huey, guiding its arms to grab onto Jack’s sub. On the monitor before her, she watched her work from remote. The grips extended and latched onto a section of the sub’s titanium tubing, clamping tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatisfied she had a firm hold, she backed Huey along the path toward the base. The sub seemed to resist for a moment, then budged slowly. Karen wiped sweat from her eyes. “You can do it, Huey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Volkswagen Bug-size robot continued backing, dragging the sub with it. As it retreated, Karen swiveled the remote camera’s eye, making sure to avoid obstructions while ensuring that she didn’t lose Jack and his sub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the acrylic dome she watched Jack’s form jostle around as the sub was hauled. His head lolled and his arms hung limp. Unconscious? Dead? She had no way of knowing, but refused to give up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking quickly, her eyes darted from the screen to the clock on the wall. Her grip grew slick on the joystick. Less than two hours. How could they possibly hope to succeed? On the screen, she watched Huey trundle backward, hauling the dead sub. Either way, she wasn’t going to leave Jack out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStruggling with the joystick, she steadily drew the sub along the silt. Luckily, the track between the pillar and the station had already been cleared by workers. Even the stray bits of jet pieces had been vacuumed from the silt. Karen worked as quickly as safety allowed, praying for more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a familiar voice rose from the control station’s speakers. “Dr. Grace, if you can hear us, please respond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren cried out with relief. Keeping one hand on the joystick, she used her free hand to patch into the communication system. “Gabriel!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, Dr. Grace, please hold for the Deep Fathom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the monitor, Huey finally reached the station. Karen slowed the robot and carefully pulled Jack’s sub underneath the base. She tilted the camera, coordinating to position the sub under the docking bay doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Karen!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miyuki! Oh, thank God!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore her friend could respond, a new voice came on. It was the ship’s geologist, his Jamaican accent giving him away. “Professor Grace, time is of the essence. Have you heard from Dr. Cortez? What is going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren gave him a summary as she initiated the docking bay pressurization. The two quickly compared notes. She learned the support ships topside were all leaving, steaming under full power away from the site and abandoning the Fathom. Once they were gone, communications had reopened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are they leaving?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gabriel picked up a coded transmission. He was able to decrypt it. Apparently some fail-safe command was initiated. To wipe out the area. It seems they’re not taking any chances on losing whatever resources lie down there to a foreign power. The place has been targeted for a missile strike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gabriel is still trying to work that out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren suddenly felt faint, light-headed. From how many different directions could death aim their way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Jack?” Charlie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren focused back on the monitors. “I’m trying to get him on board, but I don’t know. The robot can’t lift his sub into the bay. Jack has to do that himself, and I think he’s out of power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll have Gabriel patch you over to the sub. See if you can wake him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she waited, Karen leaned over and peered through the observation window. The bay was flooded and the doors were gliding open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Grace, you are hooked up to the deep-water radio of the Nautilus.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deep-fathom/page-75.html","bookId":1524,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:47:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:47:13 AM"}
