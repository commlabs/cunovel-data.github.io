said, \"We can\u0027t guarantee that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis field must be three hundred meters wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s say the enemy is a hundred and fifty meters

they would not be visible against the dark mass of the vines, provided they kept their heads down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA van came along the road from the village with its lights off It pulled up by the gate to the potato field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA female figure jumped out and swung the gate wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van pulled in and its engine was silenced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more people got out, another woman and a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quiet, now,\" Dieter whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the hush was shattered by the blare of a car horn, incredibly loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter jumped and cursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came from immediately behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus!\" he exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the Mercedes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaped to his feet and ran to the open window of the driver\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw immediately what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel had sprung forward, leaning across the front seat, and before Hans could stop him he had pressed on the horn with his bound hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans, in the front passenger seat, was now trying to aim his gun, but Gilberte had joined in, and she was lying half over Hans, hampering his movements so that he kept having to push her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter reached in and shoved Michel, but Michel resisted, and Dieter\u0027s position, with his arms extended through the car window, was too awkward for him to exert much force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horn continued to sound a deafening warning that the Resistance agents could not fail to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter fumbled for his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel found the light switch, and the car\u0027s headlights came on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe riflemen were hideously exposed in the glare of the lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both got up off their knees, but before they could throw themselves out of the beam there was a rattle of machine-gun fire from the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne rifleman cried out, dropped his gun, clutched his belly, and fell across the hood of the Mercedes; then the other was shot in the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp pain stung Dieter\u0027s left arm, and he let out a yell of shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was a shot from within the car, and Michel cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans had at last flung Gilberte off himself and got his pistol out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fired again, and Michel slumped, but Michel\u0027s hand was still on the horn, and his body now lay over his hand, pressing it down, so the horn continued to blare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans fired a third time, uselessly, for his bullet thudded into the body of a dead man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilberte screamed and threw herself at Hans again, grabbing at his gun arm with her manacled hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter had his gun out but could not shoot at Gilberte for fear of hitting Hans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a fourth shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Hans\u0027s gun again, but now it was somehow pointing upwards, and he shot himself, the bullet hitting him under the chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a horrid gurgle, blood came out of his mouth, and he slumped back against the door, his eyes staring lifelessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter took careful aim and shot Gilberte in the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached through the window with his right arm and shoved the corpse of Michel away from the steering wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horn was silenced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the light switch and killed the headlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked across the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van was still there, but the Jackdaws had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFLICK CRAWLED THROUGH the

conspicuous moon shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had firmly instructed Paul and Ruby to stay behind, hiding at the edge of the field near the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree people made
