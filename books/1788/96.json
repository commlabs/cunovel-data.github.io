I\u0027d like to find out if my grandmother is still alive.\" He paused. \"And I want to ask some questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing her hand to his forearm, Cam pressed it to his tattoo. \"This.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking of Merripen\u0027s identical tattoo, and the strange, impossible coincidence of it, Amelia frowned in curiosity. \"What kind of connection might there be between you and Merripen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea.\" Cam smiled ruefully. \"God help me, I\u0027m half afraid to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever it is,\" she said, \"we\u0027ll trust in fate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam\u0027s smile widened. \"So you believe in fate now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And luck,\" Amelia said, her hand tightening on his arm. \"Because of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That reminds me? He raised himself on one elbow and looked down at her, dark lashes sweeping over glowing amber. \"I have something to show you. Don\u0027t move?I\u0027ll bring it here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t it wait?\u0027\u0027 she protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ll be back in a few minutes. Don\u0027t fall asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the bed and drew on his clothes, while Amelia took possessive pleasure in the sight of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo keep from falling asleep while he was gone, she went to the washstand and used a cold cloth to freshen herself. Hurrying back to the bed, she sat and tucked the covers beneath her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam returned, noiseless as a cat, carrying an object that was approximately the shape and size of a slipper box. Amelia regarded it quizzically as he set it beside her. The heavy box was made of wood and heavily tarnished and pitted silver, the whole of it giving off an acid-sweet reek. As Amelia ran her fingers experimentally over the surface, she discovered the surface was slightly tacky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fortunately it was wrapped in oilcloth,\" Cam said. \"Otherwise it would have been soaked in fermented honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia blinked in astonishment. \"Don\u0027t say this is the treasure that Christopher Frost was looking for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found it when I was getting the crushed bees for Merripen\u0027s poultice. I brought it back for you.\" He looked vaguely apologetic. \"I meant to tell you about it earlier, but it slipped my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia stifled a laugh. The average man would hardly forget something like a cache box possibly containing treasure ... but to Cam, it probably had little more significance than a box of hazelnuts. \"Only you,\" she said, \"could go looking for bee venom and find hidden treasure.\" Lifting the box, she shook it gently, feeling the movement of weighty objects within. \"Blast, it\u0027s locked.\" She reached in the wild disarray of her coiffure. Finding a hairpin, she handed it to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you assume I can pick a lock,\" he asked, a sly flicker in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have complete faith in your criminal abilities,\" she said. \"Open it, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObligingly he bent the pin and inserted it into the ancient lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell Mr. Frost that you\u0027d already found the treasure?\" Amelia asked as he worked to find the catch. \"Then you might have been spared being swarmed by all those bees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to save this for your family. Frost had no right to it.\" Before another minute had passed, the lock had clicked and the box was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia\u0027s heart pounded with excitement as she lifted the lid. She found a sheaf of letters, perhaps a half-dozen, tied with a thin braided lock of hair. Gingerly she picked up the bundle, pulled the top letter out, and unfolded the ancient yellowed parchment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was indeed a love letter from a king, signed, simply, \"James.\" Scandalous, ardent, and sweetly written, it seemed far too intimate for her to read. It had never been meant for her eyes. Feeling like an interloper, she closed the brittle folds and set it aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam, meanwhile, had begun to pull objects from the box and lay them in her lap; a loose ruby at least an inch in diameter, pairs of diamond bracelets, ropes of massive black pearls, a brooch made of an oval-shaped sapphire easily the size of a sovereign, with a teardrop diamond hanging beneath, and an assortment of jeweled rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it,\" Amelia said, jostling the glittering heap. \"This must be enough to rebuild Ramsay House twice over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite,\" Cam said, casting an experienced glance over the lot, \"but close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned as she sorted through the trove of priceless jewels. \"Cam?\" she asked after a long moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmmm?\" He seemed to have lost interest in the treasure, absorbed in playing with a loose lock of her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you mind if we kept this from Leo until he\u0027s... well, a bit more rational? Otherwise I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll go out and do something irresponsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say that\u0027s a valid concern.\" He picked up the jewelry in careless handfuls, dumping it into the box and closing it. \"Yes, we\u0027ll wait until he\u0027s ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think,\" Amelia asked hesitantly, \"that Leo will change from the way he is now? Will he get better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing the worry in her tone, Cam reached out and nestled her against him. \"As the Rom say, \u0027No wagon keeps the same wheels forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe covers slipped between them. Amelia shivered as the cool air wafted over her na**d back and shoulders. \"Come back to bed,\" she whispered. \"I need you to warm me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam stripped away his shirt, and laughed quietly as he felt her hands plucking at the buttons of his trousers. \"What happened to my prudish gadji?\"T \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-96.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
