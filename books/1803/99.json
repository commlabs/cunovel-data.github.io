Certainly, you\u0027ll find it preferable to working for the Skeffingtons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUneasiness doused Sheridan\u0027s momentary happiness at his mention of an offer. \"What sort of proposition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s obvious that despite our many differences, we are extremely compatible, sexually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t believe he could sit there and describe the stormy intimacies they had just shared with such clinical calm. \"What is your proposition?\" she asked shakily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You share my bed when I\u0027m wishful of your body. In return for that, you will have a home of your own, servants, gowns, a coach, and the freedom to do as you please so long as no other man is given the use of what I\u0027m already paying for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re suggesting I become your mistress,\" she said dully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? You\u0027re ambitious and clever, and it\u0027s a hell of a lot better than what you\u0027re doing now.\" When she didn\u0027t respond, Stephen said in a bored drawl, \"Please tell me you didn\u0027t expect me to offer to marry you because of what just happened. Tell me you aren\u0027t that naive or that stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlinching from the sting of his tone, Sherry looked at his hard, handsome face, at the cynicism she hadn\u0027t recognized in his eyes before. Swallowing convulsively, she shook her head and answered him honestly. \"I did not know what to expect, of anything we did, but I did not expect it would make you ask me to marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. There\u0027s been enough deceit and misunderstanding between us before. I wouldn\u0027t like to think you misled yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought he saw the sheen of disappointed tears in her wide gray eyes and stood up, pressing a perfunctory kiss on her forehead. \"At least you are wise enough not to indulge in a fit of ire over my offer. Think about it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSherry stared at him in mute misery as he added with a chilling bite in his voice, \"Before you decide, there\u0027s a warning I feel obliged to give you. If you ever lie to me about anything, ever—just one time—I will throw you out on the street.\" He reached for the door as he added over his shoulder, \"There\u0027s one more thing—Don\u0027t ever say \u0027I love you\u0027 to me. I never want to hear those words from you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word or a backward glance, he walked out. Sherry laid her forehead on her knees and let the tears slide, but she was crying for her own lack of character and restraint when he took her in his arms, and for actually being tempted, for just a few moments, to accept his indecent, coldhearted proposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e55\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe full realization of what she had done last night had set in long before Sheridan dragged herself out of bed and got dressed the next morning. In the bright light of full day, there was no way to deny the awful truth: she had sacrificed her virtue, her principles, and her morals, and now she would have to live with the shame of that until the end of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had done it all in one desperate gamble to regain his love—if he had ever really loved her—and how had he reacted to the enormity of her deed? The agonizing answer to that question was below her bedchamber window—on the side lawn, where everyone was having luncheon—and it was there for her to see in every humiliating detail: the man she had lain with last night was dining with Monica, who was turning herself inside out to entertain him, and he looked perfectly willing to be entertained this morning. As Sheridan watched from her window, he leaned back in his chair, his gaze intent on Monica\u0027s face, then he threw back his head, laughing at whatever she was telling him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheridan was a mass of shame and anxiety, while he looked more contented and more relaxed than she had ever seen him. Last night, he had taken everything she had to give and thrown it in her face with an offer to prolong her humiliation by making her his mistress. Today, he was socializing with a woman who\u0027d never have been stupid enough to do what Sheridan had… a woman worthy of his own inflated opinion of himself, she thought bitterly. A woman to whom he would offer marriage, not some tainted liaison in exchange for her virtue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll those thoughts and more marched through Sheridan\u0027s tormented mind as she stood at the window, staring down at him, refusing to cry. She wanted to remember this scene, she wanted to remember it every single moment of her life, so that she would never, ever soften in her thoughts of him. She stood still, welcoming the icy numbness that was sweeping away her anguish and demolishing all her tender feelings for him. \"Bastard,\" she whispered aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheridan started and whirled around at the sound of Julianna\u0027s voice. \"Yes, of course,\" she said, trying for a bright smile that felt as strained as her voice sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you standing up here when I was having breakfast. Would you like me to bring something up here for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not hungry, but thank you for thinking of me.\" Sheridan hesitated, knowing some explanation was in order for her behavior yesterday when she had offered Stephen her favor, but she hadn\u0027t been able to think of a single reasonable excuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering if you would like to leave here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave?\" Sheridan said, trying not to sound as desperate as she felt to do exactly that. \"We aren\u0027t to leave until tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulianna walked over to the window and stood beside her, quietly looking down at the same tableau that Sheridan had been torturing herself with. \"Julianna, I feel I ought to explain about what happened yesterday, when I said what I did to the Earl of Langford about holding him in deepest respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need to explain,\" Julianna answered with a reassuring smile that made Sheridan feel like the seventeen-year-old ingénue instead of her paid chaperone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do,\" Sheridan persevered doggedly. \"I know how much your mother was hoping for a match between you and Lord Westmoreland, and I know you must wonder why I—why I behaved to him in such a forward, and familiar way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn what seemed like a change of subject, Julianna said, \"Several weeks ago, Mama was quite despondent. In fact, I remember that it was less than a week before you came to stay with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeizing her conversational reprieve like the coward she was at the moment, Sheridan said brightly, \"Why was your mama upset?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3/page-99.html","bookId":1803,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM"}
