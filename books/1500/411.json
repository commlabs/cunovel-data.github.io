If one only listened to his voice, one definitely wouldn’t think that Victor was sweating so profusely that some of his gray hair was sticking to his forehead. After enthusiastically and simply discussing a few matters with Su, they came to a conclusion. Su already cut off the communications, but Victor was still staring at the long distance communications device in his hands with a stupefied expression. Only after a long time had passed did he release a heavy sigh and turn around. His face was covered under a bitter smile.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLora gave Victor’s expression a look, and then her face became serious as well. “He isn’t willing to cooperate?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“No, he is quite willing to, only, the cooperation method was a bit different from what we had previously anticipated.” Victor sighed, and only after remaining silent for a while did he seem to recover a bit of his stamina. “His intention is to become the sword that sweeps through all enemies, while our main role will be to become his logistics and training base.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What?!” Lora jumped up from the couch. She originally wanted to loudly berate Su for being egotistical and ignorant, but when these words reached her throat, she didn’t know why, but for some reason, she couldn’t say them out at all.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eVictor took a deep breath, and after calming down, said, “Actually, if we think about this deeply, this isn’t that big of a deal. We are already no longer soldiers but instead businessmen, don’t you agree? Not only me, Lora, even you already lost the bravery to fight with your life on the line. Midnight City’s success has brought us unprecedented comfort, joy, but at the same time, flattened our great ambitions and ideals. Otherwise, we would have long captured N69. Isn’t it just fighting against Steel Gate and Kelan City at a disadvantage? Twenty years ago, how many of our battles did we fight with an advantage? In reality, having Su control our military strength isn’t too bad of an idea. After all, he will shoulder the most dangerous tasks.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You trust him that much?

We are businessmen, so it is enough as long as we pay attention to benefits and pleasure. You, me, Ramos, and the others, the five of us won’t live for that much longer. For us, enjoying life and waiting for breakthroughs in medical technologies is what’s most important. Even though we cannot control Su, we can help guide his military strength towards Steel Gate and Kelan City. Regardless of which side wins, in the end, we are the ones that will benefit, even if we don’t obtain the greatest rewards possible. Right now, we just need to supply him with goods and manpower. We then just have to observe him, that is already enough.” Victor said coldly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLora also began to calm down from her previous anxiousness, saying, “Perhaps we should control the goods we supply him with.

Further away, and Li and Li Gaolei were leaning against trees, watching Su from afar. This was also the closest distance they could tolerate, because the mutants’ smell was definitely more potent than their combat prowess.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Don’t you feel like leader has changed a bit?” Li suddenly asked.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“How so?” Li Gaolei also looked at Su while looking pensive.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi scratched her short hair.

He then said, “Leader is not someone who can become vicious. However, in this blasted place, how can one survive if one doesn’t become a bit fierce?
