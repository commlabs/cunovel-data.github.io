He spotted him by the big picture window, silhouetted against the glow of the snowy city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree and a half hours on the road to get here, dreading and anticipating this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken didn\u0027t turn from the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re asking me if he lives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I blew him up, set him on fire, and blew him up again. But I couldn\u0027t confirm the kill. What\u0027s left of him is somewhere on or under Gardiner\u0027s Bay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken sighed. \"He lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack dropped onto the couch and let his head drop back. \"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But barely. Just barely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Glaeken turned but Jack could not see his features. He imagined a pretty grim expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever since his rebirth he has been a presence, a dissonant hum between my ears. That hum is still there, yet it has grown so faint in the past few hours that it hovers on the edge of perception. He is severely wounded, perhaps mortally so. He is dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s not dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silhouette shook its head. \"No. Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack didn\u0027t know what more he could do. Be great if he knew someone in the Coast Guard. He could commandeer a cutter and go out in the storm with a harpoon, searching for what was left of Rasalom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me the circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack recounted the progression of events during the four fateful minutes in Nuckateague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlaeken shook his head. \"I don\u0027t see what else you could have done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could have gotten more up close and more personal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you had, you might not be here describing your travails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack banged the arm of the couch with a fist. \"I don\u0027t know what else to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wait. From the sound of what you put him through, he must die soon. Unless...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing Jack wanted to hear right then was an unless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless someone helps him. But his two attendants are dead, and the storm is keeping everyone inside. Where could he find help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could wash up near the house and some rescue worker could spot him and pull him out. Some CPR, some IV fluids, some hypothermia treatment, and some do-gooder could assure the end of life as we know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are the chances?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows? I listened to the radio all the way in. Plenty of talk about the fire and the three bodies, but not a word about a survivor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack nodded. \"Let\u0027s turn on the TV and keep posted as to whether there\u0027s a sole survivor of this terrible tragedy. Because if there is, he\u0027s going to require a late-night consultation by Doctor Jack to finish the job.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-59.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
