{"id":51350,"no":176,"title":"Chapter 52 Ye Pao Pao and A Test (2)","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eChapter 52 Ye Pao Pao and A Test (2)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYe Paopao nodded in agreement, smiling happily as he said: “In that case, I’ll choose two. Speaking of which, Junior should indeed leave some for the academy. After all, our academy has indeed put in a lot of effort for Junior! I have never seen the academy take such large measures for a single student.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said in surprise: “Large measures?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYe Paopao nodded and said: “It looks like Junior hasn’t heard about the news yet. Yesterday, after the opening ceremony ended, the Academy looked for me and some of the other nobles who have commoner followers to give us a scolding, and also gave us a serious warning not to take any actions against to you. If not, we will be kicked out of school. To my knowledge, this has never happened in the history of the academy, and Junior can be said to have created history! That truly shows how much importance the academy places on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Zhou Weiqing was agreeable and willing to accept his peace offering, and furthermore willing to sell him Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, Ye Paopao naturally had to give a plum in return for a peach[1. Direct translation of 投桃报李, basically means return the favour], and give him some news. He was very different from the short sighted Ye Lou, and was definitely thinking of the long term. After listening to Ye Lou’s description of what had happened yesterday, as well as being called by the Academy to speak, he knew that this junior of his, Zhou Weiqing, was definitely not to be touched. Whoever did so would definitely get into trouble of their own. Since that was the case, he might as well try to mend relations, and try to get on his good side. That would allow him to get the most value out of the situation. In this thinking, it was the same as Ming Wu. Originally, Ye Paopao was still a little worried, but now it seemed that this Zhou Weiqing was quite an intelligent person as well. It was naturally easier for two intelligent people to have dealings with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing Ye Paopao’s words, Zhou Weiqing was rather surprised. Although Dean Xiao had promised him to look into the matter, he had not expected that the Dean would actually go so far for him, to even warn the noble student leaders. That was indeed quite a favour that he would owe. Of course, in front of Ye Paopao, Zhou Weiqing did not reveal his feelings, and just smiled faintly and said: “That’s indeed the kindness and generosity of the teachers, I am embarrassed by such undeserved attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYe Paopao smiled as well, and said: “Well, we shouldn’t stay here and block the main entrance, let’s wrap this up. Out of the five sets of scrolls, I’ll pick two. Currently, the market price of Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls is around 150-200 thousand gold coins. Since Junior is so kind as to let me have two sets, I shall reciprocate with a good price. Will 450 thousand gold coins do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e450 thousand gold coins? That was indeed a good price! It’s indeed true that the higher the level of Consolidating Equipment Scroll, the greater the profit margin!\u003c/i\u003e Even Zhou Weiqing was rather startled by the price, after all just these two sets of Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls had netted him a greater income than the ten lower level ones he had sold to the Skill Storing Palace. Furthermore, Mid Level Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were only a hundred scrolls per Set as compared to the thousand for the lower level. Although the materials required were more valuable and expensive, but overall it was even slightly lower cost per set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior, that price is a little high, 400 thousand gold coins will do.” Zhou Weiqing laughed heartily and said, feeling satisfied in his heart. Having one less enemy, and earning money at the same time, how could he not be happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYe Paopao said seriously: “No no, I will not let Junior lose out as well, I ultimately still want to buy more Scrolls from Junior. In the future, I hope that when Junior becomes a greater Consolidating Equipment Master, you will still remember me. Although my price is higher than the market price, but currently the supplies of these Consolidating Equipment Scrolls are very low, and many of the rich are unable to buy them even though they can easily afford it. Such a price is definitely worth it to me, Junior does not need to be too courteous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he motioned to the other noble students to help him hold the five boxes, and chose two from among them. After which, he returned the other three to Zhou Weiqing, with a little reluctance. At the same time, he also passed him a gold storage card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This storage card can be used anywhere in the Fei Li Empire, and there is 500 thousand gold coins stored within. The excess fifty thousand Junior does not need to return me, let’s count it as a deposit for future transactions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccepting the remaining boxes and the gold storage card, Zhou Weiqing laughed and said: “In that case, I shall help myself. When my next batch of scrolls is complete, if there are any extras, I will definitely save some for Senior.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them exchanged more pleasantries, before Ye Paopao led his followers and walked off. Zhou Weiqing stood there watching them leave, before finally turning to Shangguan Bing’er beside him and asking her in a low voice. “Bing’er, what do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er was still a little angry from earlier, and gave a humph before saying: “Two false fellows. You two are just in competition for who is more false.” She could naturally see that both Zhou Weiqing and Ye Paopao were dealing with each other courteously but without sincerity. After seeing Zhou Weiqing deal with Ye Paopao in such a manner easily, she was a little surprised. She originally thought that although her Little Fatty had a smart mouth, he was still relatively innocent. Now, she realised that the two years in the Heavenly Bow Unit, her Little Fatty had really grown up. Alas, as the saying goes, love is blind… She did not feel that Zhou Weiqing as scheming, but just intelligent and steady. Such a man would give her a sense of safety, at least they would not easily be taken advantage of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed and said: “You’re right, this is originally a game, and trickery is just means to an end. However, I never expected that the Dean yesterday would treat me so well. It looks like Consolidating Equipment Masters are indeed a rare resource in the entire Continent! My dear wife Bing’er, your husband is now an attractive treasure you know!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go already, we’re going to be late for class soon. Remember to spend wisely, if possible, we should bring some back when we return home.” Shangguan Bing’er said exasperatedly as she pulled on him. The two of them then headed towards their classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now, most of their classmates had already reached, and seeing Zhou Weiqing and Shangguan Bing’er enter, they all revealed smiles. On seeing Zhou Weiqing, the few female students’ eyes lit up. As for Shangguan Bing’er, despite her great beauty, none of the other youths dared look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKou Rui approached them and greeted him: “Boss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said: “Call me by my name, not Boss, I don’t want us to be like some mafia group.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKou Rui shook his head, saying: “How can I, since I have already said that I will follow you, then there are some rules to follow. Boss, you’ve just reached the academy for more than a day, and you’re already famous. Have you heard? Yesterday, after the opening ceremony, the academy called upon the noble student leaders and gave them a scolding, warning them to tone it down a little. More importantly, they warned them against taking action against you. In fact, currently, not just our academy, even the other two top academies have already heard of you, the Consolidating Equipment Master student in our academy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed and said: “You are truly an expert in information gathering! Have you completed collecting all the registrations from our classmates yesterday?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKou Rui took out a stack of papers and passed it to Zhou Weiqing and said: “All registered and collated. We have 29 students in our class. Beside you four Heavenly Jewel Masters, there are nineteen Physical Jewel Masters and six Elemental Jewel Masters. I have recorded all their current circumstances in detail on these papers, with each sheet for a student.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was growing to like Kou Rui, who was indeed giving him a good impression over the past 2 days. Although his Jewel Master talent in terms of cultivation was a little lacking, in terms of completing all his assigned tasks, he had done so quickly and efficiently. With such a competent assistant, it would definitely ease the pressure on him. Just like what he told Shangguan Bing’er, he did not need to be talented in everything, just to be able to gather and lead the talented people. If he had to do everything himself, he would be exhausted to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving his hand to his Spatial Necklace, a wooden box with a set of Consolidating Equipment Scrolls appeared in his hands, and he passed it to Kou Rui, saying: “This is for you. You still do not have any Consolidated Equipment, and when you go back to the dorm, you can Consolidate this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah?” Kou Rui started, and the gazes of all the classmates were drawn to them. After all, talking was one thing, but having it actually happen in front of them was another matter. The other classmates were still relatively quiet and reserved, the main thing being that none of them had actually witnessed Zhou Weiqing giving them any Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Now with Zhou Weiqing actually giving Kou Rui a set, even Yan Zhexi and Ma Qun stared at them with glowing hot eyes, let alone the other commoner students, some of whom hadn’t even seen a Consolidating Equipment Scroll before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing winked at Kou Rui, smiling as he said: “You are the first one to join me, and to help me. Naturally, you should be the first to get a reward. I thought hard about your situation… You are a Physical Jewel Master, with half agility and coordination, which is actually quite an underestimated combination. The only issue with the combination is the lack of offensive power. Amongst all the Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipments, being both suited to your attributes and yet having a powerful attack, it is undoubtedly a bow. As such, I have designed and created this bow for you. I call it the Tyrant Bow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he said that, he opened up the box, taking out a single scroll and passing it to Kou Rui to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time. He lifted up his right hand, and in a thick icy mist, the Overlord Bow appeared in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This tyrant bow is based on my Overlord Bow, of course without the Sockets. After all, the sockets can only be used by Heavenly Jewel Masters. I also customized it a little based on your situation, changing it from the original Strength Attribute. As such, its offensive capabilities and draw power is a little weaker, but since it originally adds on an explosive nature, this point alone allows it to have sufficient attacking strength. At the same time, I increased its attack speed, and if used properly, can definitely be a very good Physical Jewel Consolidated Equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing Zhou Weiqing’s words, Kou Rui’s gaze turned fanatical, his hands even shaking. He had never dreamt before that he would get a Consolidated Equipment so easily. Furthermore, it was even custom designed for him! Feelings of gratitude overwhelmed him, and as he took hold of the wooden box, he was so excited that he was rendered speechless. The entire class was dead silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-52-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-52-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-6-chapter-52-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:13 AM"}
