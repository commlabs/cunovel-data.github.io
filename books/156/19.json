\u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;And he went up and down among the lions and became a young lion, learning to go after beasts for his food;

\u0026nbsp;[kjv] \u0026nbsp;And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;[bbe] \u0026nbsp;And fire has gone out from her rod, causing the destruction of her branches, so that there is no strong rod in her to be the ruler\u0027s rod of authority.
