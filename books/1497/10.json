As she looks upward, her gaze focuses toward the youth standing next to the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the youth, Xiao Xun felt surprised. Even though it had only been a couple of hours, she noticed that compare to before, Xiao Yan has obtained something…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen their eyes meet, she finally realized what Xiao Yan has regained.

Suddenly Xiao Yan feels dizzy, remembering the girl who would be drooling all the time and following Xiao Yan everywhere. She’s so pretty now…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLightly smiling, Xiao Yan’s gaze softens and he rudely pinches Xiao Xun’s face underneath her shocked look: “Xun Er’s grown up! But you turned out fine, not forgetting how Xiao Yan ge-ge would be covered with bruises trying to pick fruit from the trees.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned at Xiao Yan’s intimate actions, Xun Er stiffens for a whole second before her pitch-black, free of impurities, eyes smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was still small, Xiao Yan loved to pinches her cheeks but ever since the event three years ago, he set up an invisible wall next to his heart and pushed everyone out. No matter how hard she tried, she would always be disappointed by the cold and impassive attitude of his…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s back… But, it seems like he still considers me to be immature, he’s such a log… Xun Er complains in her heart after an instant, Xun Er criticizes herself for being too greedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xun Er, for these past three years, please don’t blame Xiao Yan ge-ge for being like that. I was living day by day but thankfully you were always by my side.” Xiao Yan awkwardly nods his head and apologizes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXun Er sweetly smiles. The grievances she had endured for the past three years disappeared with the awkward apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah, oh right. Xun Er… How much money do you have?” Letting go of Xun Er’s face, Xiao Yan does a hollow laugh and asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his clan, with the exception of his father, Xun Er was the only person that was in a good relationship with him. He had just shamed his father this morning so he could not bear to face his father to ask for money, which is why he asked Xun Er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egun truyện: TruyệnYY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Money?” Blinking her crystal clear eyes, Xun Er is taken by surprise: “Xiao Yan ge-ge needs money?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes… I want to buy some items, though I’m a bit short.” Xiao Yan felt embarrassed, this was the first time he borrowed money from a girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the usual frigid Xiao Yan now in distress, Xiao Xun Er looks at a completely different person. Covering her mouth and smiling cutely: “I have more than a thousand gold coins, is that enough? If not…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile speaking, Xun Er’s fingers behind her swiftly flick and a purple gold card suddenly appears between her fingers.

It’s almost night now, tomorrow I’ll bring you to Wu Tang City for a walk.” Xiao Yan waved towards the girl and cheerfully descended the mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding still, Xun Er delightfully looked at the youth who had regained his boldness from three years ago, Smiling softly, she murmured: “Nalan Yanran, should I despise you or be grateful to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly morning, the sun shone warmly through the window onto the body of the cross-legged youth in meditation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whew…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter meditating nearly all night, Xiao Yan inhaled deeply, a translucent white airflow that was visible to the naked eyes went through his mouth and nose and into his body, nursing his body and bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite light shined from his eyes as he suddenly opened his eyes. Xiao Yan stretched himself and passionately says “This is exactly this feeling, after three years, the feeling of Qi has returned!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly gets out of his bed, exercises himself a bit, before starting changing. From outside the room, Xun Er’s voice softly carries inside: “Xiao Yan ge-ge, still sleeping?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arrived here so early. Shaking his head, Xiao Yan turned around and then searched his drawers. Finally, with reluctance, he pulled out a small box and carefully opened it. He narrowed his eyes from the glint of silver inside that box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And this is my entire savings…” Holding his money box, Xiao Yan smiled bitterly while shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan gently smiled as he walked out of his room and saw the dazzling girl in front of his door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXun Er had changed into a pale green outfit that made her looked even more naturally beautiful. She also had a pair of tight pants that stretched across her slender thighs and long legs, emphasizing her curves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith long legs, Xun Er can be compared to young girls on earth, full of youthful vitality and seductivity, of course, she has her special elegance which Xiao Yan had never seen on any other girl but her…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here, it’s what you’ll need.” Looking at Xiao Yan exiting his room, Xun Er smiled and handed him a black card. This is a common card, the maximum it can contain is only 5000 gold coins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReceiving the black card, Xiao Yan teases: “Little girl, why are you wearing such an attractive outfit? Could it be you’re having a date with somebody else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, this is the first time in three years that Xiao Yan ge-ge has invited me out, Xun Er is very flattered so of course I have to dress up a little.” Xiao Yan’s intimate tease made Xun Er’s eyes bend into a shallow crescent shape while smiling coquettishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly shaking his head, Xiao Yan smiles back happily. They chat while walking together towards the city, at about halfway, they were greeted by some clansmen looking at their affectionate conversation with a strange face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXun Er, be it beauty or talent, is the brightest pearl of the young generation in the clan. She usually is friendly to everybody but under her light smile is indifference, greetings with her are easy, but to start a long conversation would be very difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring the looks of the other clansmen, Xian Yan quickly leads Xun Er out of the clan before slowing down and leisurely peeking at the stall on the side of the street…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu Tang City lives up to its name of being one of the larger cities in Jia Ma Empire by the sheer number of people living in it. Even though the sun was beating down, on the streets were thousands if not tens of thousands of people, there would even be one or two bizarre races.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was because of Xiao Yan beside her, but Xun Er became a lot more active after she exited the clan. She tugged the reluctant Xiao Yan into a variety of stall. Her tender laughter made the scorching street a little cooler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Xun Er finally got tired, Xiao Yan finally brang her to the nearby Pharmacy. After spending about 900 gold coins, he bought 3 stalks of 20 year Purple Leaved Bluegrass along with two stalks of 5 year Bone Washing Grass. These were both low end materials and would be able to bought at a regular pharmacy. For higher end materials, Xiao Yan would have had to find them himself or buy them at an auction or if he was lucky, in a high end pharmacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at the rapidly decreasing funds, Xiao Yan bitterly smiled. He realized how important money was in Dou Qi Mainland…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways, he got all of the herbs, all that was left was the level one wood attributed monster core!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-9\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-11\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-10","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:52 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:52 AM"}
