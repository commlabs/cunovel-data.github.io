The rest of you can do whatever you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what about the plan?” Jimmy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have some details to work out. We’ll talk in a couple of days.” I looked Claire de Lune directly in the eye. “We’ll talk after we get the guns.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy’s head swiveled from me to her and back again. “What are you talking to her for?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dyson doesn’t trust me,” Claire answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s my girl,” Jimmy told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s Fenelon’s girl,” Josie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is not.” Jimmy turned to Claire for confirmation. “Is not,” he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love you, not him,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, puhleez,” the old man said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered the family feud the old man described the day earlier and decided this was the beginning of round two and quite honestly, I wasn’t in the mood. I had phone calls to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You kids work it out on your own,” I said. “Preferably somewhere else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—” Josie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But nothing. I’m tired, Josie. In the words of a very wise and wonderful bar owner of my acquaintance—you don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Must you always call so late?” Bullert asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I forgot. Government work is strictly nine-to-five.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a funny guy, McKenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what, you’re the second person who told me that tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talk to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re getting close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy explanation included an almost verbatim account of my conversation with John Brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can get my people in place in just a few hours,” Bullert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The fewer hours the better. When this happens, I think it’ll happen in a hurry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBullert explained exactly what he wanted me to do once I received the call from Brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem,” I said. “Except…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Except what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brand can’t be trusted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kinda goes without saying, doesn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I mean is, we should have a Plan B.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you have in mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not going to like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did—in glorious detail. I was right. He didn’t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not a chance,” Bullert asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Before you say no, talk to Finny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Finnegan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and your nicknames. Fine. I’ll talk to him in the morning. I guarantee, he’s not going to like it any more than I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re probably right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just for argument’s sake, though—what will you need from us to make this happen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Besides immunity? You’re not going to like that, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWELVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes snapped open the way they do when you hear a noise that shouldn’t be there, and I reached under the pillow for the SIG Sauer. My hands were closing around the butt when I heard her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, did I startle you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI released the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, Josie. What are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosie sat on the foot of the bed. I rolled on my back and looked up at her. After I had shooed everyone out of the cabin the previous night, I retired to the master bedroom. Now a bright sun was shining through the window, giving her face a near-beatific aura, and it occurred to me that when we first met I didn’t think she was particularly attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou must have caught her in the wrong light, my inner voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to talk,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed a fistful of sheet and blanket and pulled them up around my chest. “What time is it?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little before eight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the morning? Josie, one of the reasons a guy might turn to a life of crime is so he doesn’t have to get up early.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eight o’clock is early?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suddenly you’re worried…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you awake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Yes, I’m awake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sound cranky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“JoEllen…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like that you call me that. Almost no one ever does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a gun. I will shoot you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you one of those people that need a cup of coffee before they can start the day? I’ll make it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, no,” I said. “I’ll make it.” I swung my legs off the edge of the bed even while gathering the sheet and blanket around my waist. “Give me a minute to take a shower and get dressed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re going to do that, I’m going to go jump in the lake.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-kind-word-mac-mckenzie-10/page-68.html","bookId":2217,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:15 PM"}
