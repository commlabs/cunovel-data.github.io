Although a Corrupt Wolf wasn’t considered too strong, it had a robust and hardy body. To cut a wolf in half from the waist took at least 80 or 90% of Shi Linkai’s strength. Once he chopped too many times, his arm began to feel sore.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut every time Lin Ming shot out with his spear, he would pierce seven or eight beasts.

Especially after he had completed a small portion of Tempering Marrow within his right hand, his strength had risen to another level. It could simply be called unstoppable, able to break through even the toughest defenses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNot only that, but the Purple Comet Spear was an incomparably sharp weapon. Although the Corrupt Wolf had a strong defense, that was only in comparison to a normal martial artist. In front of the top high-grade earth-step Purple Comet Spear, the defensive capabilities of a Corrupt Wolf were no different than tofu!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming killed his way around the battlefield, Corrupt Wolves were reaped like wheat. Against these second-level Corrupt Wolves, there was no need to use his vibrating true essence. Slaughtering them with the spear was the best way to conserve his strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe spear was a weapon that was inherently forged to engage in mass warfare.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this moment, Lin Ming heard a roar and saw a massive two-headed black wolf rushing towards him.

Its strength was no less than that of the two-headed Corrupt Wolf. And what was terrifying was that the Iron Storm Bear had an amazing defensive power. Within all of the third-level vicious beasts in the Seven Profound territory, it had the absolute strongest defense!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a massive assault of forces, a vicious beast with astounding defense was much more formidable and difficult to deal with than an agile vicious beast!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTwo top third-level vicious beasts appeared, charging straight towards the army’s formation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf these vicious beasts were to rush into the formation, they would easily be able to rip their way through the soldiers’ tower shield wall, creating a massive opening. Once a gap was opened in the defenses, vicious beasts would begin pouring in from there!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming chose to greet them first.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShi Linkai’s eyes widened as he watched Lin Ming run over. He also wanted to run over and help, at least to divert the attention of the Corrupt Wolves surrounding him so that Lin Ming would be able to kill those two top third-level vicious beasts more easily. But at this moment, Lin Ming’s speed reached an extreme, and he suddenly turned into a fading afterimage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs his steps treaded forwards with Golden Roc Shattering the Void, the packs of Corrupt Wolves that tried to block Lin Ming were simply useless.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePu pu pu!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBlood sprayed into the air.

The Two-headed Corrupt Wolf King also howled, rushing towards Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t even pause, his spear pierced forwards!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKa!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAn azure spear light cut through the void, slashing straight towards the Iron Storm Bear. Its chest was ripped in half, blood gushing out!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe azure spear light actually hadn’t even been given the slightest pause by the Iron Storm Bear’s tenacious body. This was a top third-level vicious beast known for having the strongest level of defensive power within the Seven Profound territory, but in front of the Purple Comet Spear, its vaunted defenses were nothing more than thin paper!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter the azure spear light ripped through the Iron Storm Bear, its forward force still hadn’t stopped, cutting towards the Two-Headed Corrupt Wolf King. The Two-Headed Corrupt Wolf King was famous for its speed, but it simply didn’t have a chance to respond; its body was split vertically in half, one head on each side!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA single spear move slayed two top third-level vicious beasts!

Even Zhuang Fan, Lu Wuyin, and the others sucked in a breath of cold air. What sort of cultivation was that? They couldn’t imagine how an early Pulse Condensation period martial artist could be so strong that they could instantly kill two third-level vicious beasts that were equal to peak Pulse Condensation martial artists. Not only that, but he had only used a single spear move to kill both of them!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBefore, they didn’t know just what it meant for Lin Ming to become champion of the Seven Profound Valleys’ Total Faction Martial Meeting. They only knew that Lin Ming was a great and powerful figure, and had created a record that had never existed in the past 200 years in the 36 countries by becoming the champion of the Total Faction Martial Meeting. But they never knew just what sort of concept that was. But now that they had a front-seat view, they were able to experience what this title truly meant.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter he killed the two third-level vicious beasts, Lin Ming’s footsteps suddenly paused, and his spear slowed down. In that instant, he had once again felt a faint hidden murderous intent from the crowds of people around him…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You want to hide yourself with the help of the crowd?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming coldly snorted. His soul force and perception already far surpassed the Seven Profound Valleys’ Mirage Faction’s. When he first struck out, he had felt this faint murderous intent. Now, after killing the two third-level vicious beasts, he felt it again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut by the time he expanded his perception, he had lost trace of this person, and was unable to find him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis caused Lin Ming to furrow his eyebrows. This enemy of his must be well versed in concealment techniques, and was able to use the killing intent of the 10,000 strong army to hide from him. Was this someone sent by Ouyang Boyan?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter the Moon Seizing Sect had been annihilated, all of the Xiantian masters were recalled to the Seven Profound Valleys’ Total Faction. With the collaboration of the Array Faction and an array master of Divine Phoenix Island, they had been able to set up a giant reinforced array formation around the mountain rage and close it off, to prevent a sneak attack from the South Sea Demon Region. Since this happened, Ouyang Boyan had probably left behind several trustworthy subordinates within Sky Fortune Kingdom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMurdering a Seven Profound Valleys direct disciple was no minor matter. If this matter was made known, then Ouyang Boyan would most likely be put to death. He could probably only trust his personal apprentice…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLogically speaking, an apprentice of Ouyang Boyan should be someone from the Acacia Faction. But Lin Ming didn’t think that a disciple from the Acacia Faction would be so proficient in concealment techniques. If it wasn’t for Lin Ming’s prodigious soul perception, he would never have been aware of this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a hidden enemy lurking behind him, Lin Ming couldn’t feel at ease. ‘I can’t expose any more of my strength! This enemy probably hasn’t noticed that I’ve discovered him. In this case, I have to keep my cards in hand and lure him in, take him by surprise, and kill him in that moment.’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s single spear move that had killed two third-level vicious beasts may have been shocking to a common martial artist, but it was simply nothing to a genius of the Seven Profound Valleys. Not to mention Lin Ming, Jiang Lanjian, Qin Wuxin, or even the most disappointing direct disciple Fang Qi, would be able to accomplish the same.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThose two monsters were equal to a normal peak Pulse Condensation martial artist, but Huan Xiaodie and Fang Qi had battle power that reached the early Houtian realm, or even the middle Houtian realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith such a difference in strength, instantly killing a pair of third-level vicious beasts was simple!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThus, Lin Ming’s performance just now was all within this hidden killer’s expectations.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had to keep his other cards hidden. He needed to hide his strength so he could play the pig to eat the tiger.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e‘I will suppress my strength to the peak of the normal middle Houtian realm, and lure you in!’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDuring the stampede of the beast tide, this surrounding chaos was naturally the best time to assassinate Lin Ming. But it was also the best time for Lin Ming to kill this hidden enemy of his. Lin Ming didn’t want to leave a ticking time bomb at his side; he wanted to completely uproot and eradicate all of Ouyang Boyan’s influence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Total Annihilation!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Sweeping Wind, Scattering Clouds!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEvery move that Lin Ming made was a wide-range attack.

As he saw Lin Ming rush into the depths of a pack of vicious beasts, and be no different than a tiger within a flock of sheep, he couldn’t help but envy. “Brother Wanshan, your Lin Family has truly produced a peerless monstrous talent. Within the next several hundred years, your Lin Family will probably become the top family of Sky Fortune Kingdom.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Wanshan wasn’t as happy as Zhuang Fang expected.
