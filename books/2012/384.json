The K’Chain Che’Malle had shattered its halberd some time earlier, and now wielded a double-bladed axe in one hand and a falchion in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forkrul Assail stood with his face stretched as if in agony, tilted back, the eyes shut and the mouth stretched wide open. When the Ve’Gath advanced, he gave no sign of awareness. Two swift thumping strides and the falchion swung down, taking the motionless Pure between his right shoulder and neck. The blade tore down through the chest, ripped free in a spray of bone shards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Ve’Gath had followed its kin and now came in from the left. An instant after the first Ve’Gath’s attack, its heavy single-bladed axe slammed into the side of the Assail’s head in an explosion of skull fragments and gore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forkrul Assail collapsed in red ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as Grub struggled to wheel the beast round, two heavy quarrels hissed across – between him and the Ve’Gath’s head – and punched into the side of the other Ve’Gath. The impact staggered the giant reptile, and then it fell over, hind legs scything the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Back! Back across!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe K’Chain Che’Malle burst into motion, sprinting down the length of the berm – fifteen, twenty paces, and then wheeling to plunge down amidst crowds of Kolansii in the first trench. Weapons hammered down, slashed and chopped a carnage-strewn path through to the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePike blades glanced across the armour encasing Grub’s legs and girdling his hips – and then they were clawing up the other side, winning free atop what remained of the first bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrub looked round for the prince – for any officer – but the chaos reigned on all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad Brys fallen? There was no way of knowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Grub now saw Letherii soldiers lifting their heads, saw them tracking his thumping trek across the front of the warring forces – watching the Ve’Gath clear attackers from its path with devastating sweeps of its bladed weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’re looking to me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I know nothing .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFool! Nothing but a life of war! Look well – decide what must be done! Twisting in the saddle, he scanned the climbing slope to his left, squinted at the succession of fortified tiers – and saw soldiers streaming from the highest positions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut between them and the Letherii … four trenches. No, this is impossible. We’ve lost a third of the army against this first trench alone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrub faced the Letherii ranks once more. ‘Withdraw!’ he shouted. ‘By the prince’s command, withdraw!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he saw, all along the front, the Letherii soldiers disengaging, shields up as they backed away, others dragging wounded comrades with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother quarrel hissed past – too close. Cursing, Grub kicked at the sides of the Ve’Gath. ‘Down from the ridge – along the front – put those weapons away and find us some shields! Better yet, pick up some of the wounded – as many as you can carry!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast skidded down the slope, righted itself and, staying low beneath the cover of the first berm, began picking its way through heaps of bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrub stared down at the terrible carnage. I remember on the wall and that man and all the ones who fell around him – he fought and fought, until they overcame him, brought him down, and then there was a cross and he was nailed to it and the crows spun and screamed and fell from the sky .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember the old man on his horse, reaching down to collect me up – and the way he wheeled outside the gate, to stare back – as if he could see all the way we’d come – the bloody road where I was born, where I came alive .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember that world. I remember no other .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the brave soldiers, I am yours. I was always yours .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kolansii counter-attack from troops stationed in the next two trenches met the advance of Saphii and Evertine legionnaires in an avalanche of iron fury. Rolling down with the slope, along the wide descent tracks or up and over the berms, they slammed into the Bolkando forces like a storm of studded fists. For all the wild fury of the Saphii, they were not sufficiently armoured against heavy infantry, and the Evertine soldiers were unable to close a solid shieldwall with the Saphii in their midst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first lines were overwhelmed, driven underfoot, and the entire Bolkando front reeled back, yielding once more the second berm and then the first trench, and, finally, the first bank of earthworks. With the enemy gaining momentum, the legion was pushed back still further. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-384.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
