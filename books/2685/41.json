It takes the operator a swift seven minutes to connect me to the number. Matt’s fourth wife, Ursula, answers, sighing when I tell her who it is. I wait five minutes for her to come back and I’m imagining Matt standing next to Ursula in the kitchen of a house in Woodland Hills, head bowed down.

Pause. “The one about the car, man?” Pause. “I saw John Travolta buy a copy at Tower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m, um, really gratified by your response, man,” I say. “Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you, um, doing anything, like, now?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve fooled around with some stuff,” Matt says. “Might be ready to go into the studio in a couple of months.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ter-rif-ic,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you … talked to Sam?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just about … well, maybe it was a month ago?
