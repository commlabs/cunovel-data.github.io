She tried to put him out of her mind, but everything reminded her of Adam: A chance phrase, the back of a stranger\u0027s head, a tie similar to the one he had worn. There were many men who tried to date her. She was propositioned by clients, by attorneys she had opposed in court and by a night-court judge, but Jennifer wanted none of them. Lawyers invited her out for what was cynically referred to as \"funch,\" but she was not interested. There was an independence about her that was a challenge to men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Bailey was always there, but that fact did nothing to assuage Jennifer\u0027s loneliness. There was only one person who could do that, damn him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe telephoned on a Monday morning. \"I thought I\u0027d take a chance and see if you happened to be free for lunch today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not. She said, \"Of course I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer had sworn to herself that if Adam ever called her again she would be friendly yet distant, and courteous but definitely not available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment she heard Adam\u0027s voice she forgot all those things and said, Of course I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing in the world she should have said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had lunch at a small restaurant in Chinatown, and they talked steadily for two hours that seemed like two minutes. They talked about law and politics and the theater, and solved all the complex problems of the world. Adam was brilliant and incisive and fascinating. He was genuinely interested in what Jennifer was doing, and took a joyous pride in her successes. He has a right to, Jennifer thought. If not for him, I\u0027d be back in Kelso, Washington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jennifer returned to the office, Ken Bailey was waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a good lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Adam Warner going to become a client?\" His tone was too casual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Ken. We\u0027re just friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following week, Adam invited Jennifer to have lunch in the private dining room of his law firm. Jennifer was impressed with the huge, modern complex of offices. Adam introduced her to various members of the firm, and Jennifer felt like a minor celebrity, for they seemed to know all about her. She met Stewart Needham, the senior partner. He was distantly polite to Jennifer, and she remembered that Adam was married to his niece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam and Jennifer had lunch in the walnut-paneled dining room run by a chef and two waiters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is where the partners bring their problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer wondered whether he was referring to her. It was hard for her to concentrate on the meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer thought about Adam all that afternoon. She knew she had to forget about him, had to stop seeing him. He belonged to another woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, Jennifer went with Ken Bailey to see Two by Two, the new Richard Rodgers show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they stepped into the lobby there was an excited buzz from the crowd, and Jennifer turned to see what was happening. A long, black limousine had pulled up to the curb and a man and woman were stepping out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s him!\" a woman exclaimed, and people began to gather around the car. The burly chauffeur stepped aside and Jennifer saw Michael Moretti and his wife. It was Michael that the crowd focused on. He was a folk hero, handsome enough to be a movie star, daring enough to have captured everyone\u0027s imagination. Jennifer stood in the lobby watching as Michael Moretti and his wife made their way through the crowd. Michael passed within three feet of Jennifer, and for an instant their eyes met. Jennifer noticed that his eyes were so black that she could not see his pupils. A moment later he disappeared into the theater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer was unable to enjoy the show. The sight of Michael Moretti had brought back a flood of fiercely humiliating memories. Jennifer asked Ken to take her home after the first act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam telephoned Jennifer the next day and Jennifer steeled herself to refuse his invitation. Thank you, Adam, but I\u0027m really very busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all Adam said was, \"I have to go out of the country for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a blow to the stomach. \"How - how long will you be gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a few weeks. I\u0027ll give you a call when I get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Jennifer said brightly. \"Have a nice trip.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt as though someone had died. She visualized Adam on a beach in Rio, surrounded by half-naked girls, or in a penthouse in Mexico City, drinking margaritas with a nubile, dark-eyed beauty, or in a Swiss chalet making love to - Stop it! Jennifer told herself. She should have asked him where he was going. It was probably a business trip to some dreary place where he would have no time for women, perhaps the middle of some desert where he would be working twenty-four hours a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should have broached the subject, very casually, of course. Will you be taking a long plane trip? Do you speak any foreign languages? If you get to Paris, bring me back some Vervaine tea. I suppose the shots must be painful. Are you taking your wife with you? Am I losing my mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen had come into her office and was staring at her. \"You\u0027re talking to yourself. Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! Jennifer wanted to shout. I need a doctor. I need a cold shower. I need Adam Warner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I\u0027m fine. Just a little tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you get to bed early tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered whether Adam would be going to bed early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Ryan called. \"I went to see Connie Garrett. She told me you\u0027ve dropped by a few times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" The visits were to assuage her feeling of guilt because she was unable to be of any help. It was frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer plunged herself into work, and still the weeks seemed to drag by. She was in court nearly every day and worked on briefs almost every night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slow down. You\u0027re going to kill yourself,\" Ken advised her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jennifer needed to exhaust herself physically and mentally. She did not want to have time to think. I\u0027m a fool, she thought. An unadulterated fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was four weeks before Adam called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just got back,\" he said. The sound of his voice thrilled her. \"Can we meet for lunch somewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027d enjoy that, Adam.\" She thought she had carried that off well. A simple Yes, I\u0027d enjoy that, Adam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Oak Room in the Plaza?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the most businesslike, unromantic dining room in the world, filled with affluent middle-aged wheelers and dealers, stockbrokers and bankers. It had long been one of the few remaining bastions of privacy for men, and its doors had only recently been opened to women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer arrived early and was seated. A few minutes later, Adam appeared. Jennifer watched the tall, lean figure moving toward her and her mouth suddenly went dry. He looked tanned, and Jennifer wondered if her fantasies about Adam on some girl-ridden beach had been true. He smiled at her and took her hand, and Jennifer knew in that moment that it did not matter what logic she used about Adam Warner or married men. She had no control over herself. It was as though someone else were guiding her, telling her what she should do, telling her what she must do. She could not explain what was happening to her, for she had never experienced anything like it. Call it chemistry, she thought. Call it karma, call it heaven. All Jennifer knew was that she wanted to be in Adam Warner\u0027s arms more than she had ever wanted anything in her life. Looking at him, she visualized his making love to her, holding her, his hard body on top of her, inside her, and she felt her face becoming red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam said apologetically, \"Sorry about the short notice. A client canceled a luncheon date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer silently blessed the client.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I brought you something,\" Adam said. It was a lovely green and gold silk scarf. \"It\u0027s from Milan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s where he had been. Italian girls. \"It\u0027s beautiful, Adam. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever been to Milan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027ve seen pictures of the cathedral there. It\u0027s lovely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not much of a sightseer. My theory is that if you\u0027ve seen one church, you\u0027ve seen them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when Jennifer thought about that luncheon, she tried to remember what they had talked about, what they had eaten, who had stopped by the table to say hello to Adam, but all she could remember was the nearness of Adam, his touch, his looks. It was as though he had her in some kind of spell and she was mesmerized, helpless to break it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point Jennifer thought, I know what to do. I\u0027ll make love with him. Once. It can\u0027t be as wonderful as my fantasies. Then I\u0027ll be able to get over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen their hands touched accidentally, it was like an electric charge between them. They sat there talking of everything and nothing, and their words had no meaning. They sat at the table, locked in an invisible embrace, caressing each other, making fierce love, naked and wanton. Neither of them had any idea what they were eating or what they were saying. There was a different, more demanding hunger in them and it kept mounting and mounting, until neither of them could stand it any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of their luncheon, Adam put his hand over Jennifer\u0027s and said huskily, \"Jennifer - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispered, \"Yes. Let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer waited in the busy, crowded lobby while Adam registered at the desk. They were given a room in the old section of the Plaza Hotel, overlooking 58th Street. They used the back bank of elevators, and it seemed to Jennifer that it took forever to reach their floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Jennifer was unable to remember anything about the luncheon, she remembered everything about their room. Years later, she could recall the view, the color of the drapes and carpets, and each picture and piece of furniture. She could remember the sounds of the city, far below, that drifted into the room. The images of that afternoon were to stay with her the rest of her life. It was a magic, multicolored explosion in slow motion. It was having Adam undress her, it was Adam\u0027s strong, lean body in bed, his roughness and his gentleness. It was laughter and passion. Their hunger had built to a greed that had to be satisfied. The moment Adam began to make love to her, the words that flashed into Jennifer\u0027s mind were, I\u0027m lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey made love again and again, and each time was an ecstasy that was almost unbearable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours later, as they lay there quietly, Adam said, \"I feel as though I\u0027m alive for the first time in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer gently stroked his chest and laughed aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam looked at her quizzically. \"What\u0027s so funny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what I told myself? That if I went to bed with you once, I could get you out of my system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted around and looked down at her. \"And - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wrong. I feel as though you\u0027re a part of me. At least\" - she hesitated - \"part of you is a part of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew what she was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll work something out,\" Adam said. \"Mary Beth is leaving Monday for Europe with her aunt for a month.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-13.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM"}
