We are hunting him down.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Rhulad Sengar seemed indifferent, his head turning to one side, eyes lowering until they fixed on the gore-spattered sword. ‘The Toblakai.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Emperor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who murdered Binadas. My brother.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed, sire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head slowly lifted. ‘Is it dawn?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad’s command was soft as a breath. ‘Bring him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey let the poor fool go once he had shown them the recessed door leading under the city wall. It was, of course, locked, and while the rest of the squads waited in the slowly fading darkness-seeking whatever cover they could find and it wasn’t much-Fiddler and Cuttle went down into the depression to examine the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Made to be broken down,’ Cuttle muttered, ‘so it’s like the lad said-we go in and then the floodgates open and we drown. Fid, I don’t see a way to do this, not quietly enough-so as no-one hears and figures out we’ve taken the trap.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler scratched at his white beard. ‘Maybe we could dismantle the entire door, frame and all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We ain’t got the time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No. We pull back and hide out for the day, then do it tomorrow night.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Adjunct should be showing up by then. Keneb wants us first in and he’s right, we’ve earned it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment they heard a thump from behind the door, then the low scrape of the bar being lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two Malazans moved to either side, quickly cocking their crossbows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grinding sound, then the door was pushed open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure that climbed into view was no Letherii soldier. It was wearing plain leather armour that revealed, without question, that it was a woman, and on her face an enamel mask with a modest array of painted sigils. Two swords strapped across her back. One stride, then two. A glance to Fiddler on her right, then to Cuttle on her left. Pausing, brushing dirt from her armour, then setting out. Onto the killing field, and away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBathed in sweat, Fiddler settled back into a sitting position, the crossbow trembling in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuttle made a warding gesture, then sat down as well. ‘Hood’s breath was on my neck, Fid. Right there, right then. I know, she didn’t even reach for those weapons, didn’t even twitch…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye,’ Fid answered, the word whispered like a blessing. A Hood-damned Seguleh. High ranked, too. We’d never have got our shots off-no way. Our heads would have rolled like a pair of oversized snowballs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I looked away, Fid. I looked right down at the ground when she turned my way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Me too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And that’s why we’re still alive.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuttle turned and peered down into the dark tunnel. ‘We don’t have to wait till tomorrow night after all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Go back to the others, Cuttle. Get Keneb to draw ‘em up. I’m heading in to check the other end. If it’s unguarded and quiet, well and good, If not…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, Fid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant dropped down into the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved through the dark as fast as he could without making too much noise. The wall overhead was damned thick and he’d gone thirty paces before he saw the grey blur of the exit at the end of a sharp slope. Crossbow in hands, Fiddler edged forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe need not have worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnel opened into a cramped blockhouse with no ceiling. One bench lined the wall to his right. Three bodies were sprawled on the dusty stone floor, bleeding out from vicious wounds. Should’ve averted your eyes, soldiers. Assuming she even gave them the time to decide either way-she’d wanted out, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opposite him was ajar and Fiddler crept to it, looked out through the crack. A wide street, littered with rubbish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d been listening to the riots half the night, and it was clear that mobs had swept through here, if not this night then other nights. The garrison blocks opposite were gutted, the windows soot-stained. Better and better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned round and hastened back down the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the other end he found Cuttle, Faradan Sort and Fist Keneb, all standing a few paces in from the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler explained to them what he had found. Then said, ‘We got to go through right away, I think. Eight hundred marines to come through and that’ll take a while.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeneb nodded. ‘Captain Faradan Sort.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Take four squads through and establish flanking positions. Send one squad straight across to the nearest barracks to see if they are indeed abandoned. If so, that will be our staging area. From there, I will lead the main body to the gate, seize and secure it. Captain, you and four squads will strike into the city, as far as you can go, causing trouble all the way-take extra munitions for that.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-442.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
