SORROW AND REJOICING.","content":"The pain of death hath bitterness\n\u003cbr\u003e Too deep for man to nameâ€”\n\u003cbr\u003e But, ah! the poignant sting of grief\n\u003cbr\u003e Accompanied with shame!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Words can hardly convey the feelings of wonder, sorrow and relief that followed each other in rapid succession through Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s mind at the old Captain\u0027s story.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked upon the undeniable proof of her own photograph with tears of thankfulness in her eyes, while the last repentant words of her only child, brought pain too deep for utterance or demonstration. It seemed that two lads of about the same age, strangers to each other, became inspired with the mutual desire to run away from parental authority and try their luck upon the ocean.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 164]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Neither of the lads dreamed for an instant that their unexpected entree into the Captain\u0027s family, when they were safely out of port, would be greeted with less than cheers and congratulations, or that other than ease and glory would be their portion for the remainder of the voyage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fortunately, for the success of their expectations, the Commander of the \"Water Sprite\" had a gentle heart under his rough exterior, and moreover, had boys of his own at home, so he only insisted on their earning their glory by keeping the brass work shining and allowed them to eat their fill at the second table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The boys were singularly alike in feature but widely different in expression and disposition, Maurice being mischievous and happy, while Jack Fenton, the other lad, was ill-natured and vicious in his dealings with his companion in the adventure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the day preceding the terrible storm, Maurice was taken violently ill, and notwithstanding all was done that could be under such limited circumstances, he passed away almost at the very moment, when, rudderless and with her rigging[Pg 165] swept away, the \"Water Sprite\" drifted helplessly at the mercy of wind and wave.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were all saved through the timely assistance of an outgoing steamer, but Maurice\u0027s dead body was left to find a watery grave, through sheer inability to remove it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The other lad was safely landed in Calcutta, and the Captain soon lost track of him in the press of his many duties.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To the old Captain, Maurice had told much of his home surroundings and the letter to his mother, on the day of his death, was written at his instigation, when his experienced eye saw that the black shadow was fast settling down upon the frail lad\u0027s features. Before he died he gave his ring, his clothing and the few other trifles that he had managed to conceal about him when leaving home, to his comrade, Jack Fenton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Afterward the Captain regretted that he had not retained these treasures with the photograph and letter, but years passed by and in the varied excitements and dangers of his adventurous life the incident was only remembered in connection with the terrible disaster to his favorite vessel, but[Pg 166] the letter and picture had traveled about with him for twelve long years, so safely hidden in the case of his miniature pocket compass that their very existence was forgotten until the moment of Sir Frederic\u0027s astounding revelation. The night was far spent before he had finished his narrative and answered the almost innumerable questions of his excited hearers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They little heeded the violence of the storm, so great was the tempest of sorrow and rejoicing that raged within their hearts. When morning broke, the ladies were more composed, and a peaceful smile rested upon Mrs. Sinclair\u0027s face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Truly, the grief for a loved one whom death has taken from our hearts and homes, is nothing in comparison to the shame and sorrow for one upon whom evil deeds have left an ineffaceable stigma. A load seemed lifted from her heart and although sorrow fell like a pall around her, still the bitterness had been removed and even in her bereavement she could find great cause for heartfelt thankfulness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sick woman was slowly recovering and the little Elsa was like a ray of sunshine, lighting[Pg 167] up each grief darkened heart with her merry prattle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Promptly upon their arrival in New York the suffering woman was placed in the wards of St. Luke\u0027s Hospital, but the little girl was gladly retained under the watchful eye of motherly Mrs. Sinclair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Some way, in the bustle and confusion of disembarking, Sam Lee was totally forgotten, but the beady eyes of the Mongolian watched their every movement and in his own quiet way he soon discovered the destination of both the woman and the little girl.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was not long before Sir Frederic secured the lease of a handsomely furnished house, and removed, not only Mrs. Sinclair and Stella, but also the now convalescent woman and her child, to this beautiful, although transient, home.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74785.html","bookId":1421,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:46:09 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:46:09 AM"}
