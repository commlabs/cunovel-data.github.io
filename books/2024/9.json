{"id":107786,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"OKAY, WHERE\u0027S YOUR CLUTCH?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed to the lever on my left handlebar. Letting go of the grip was a mistake. The heavy bike wobbled underneath me, threatening to knock me sidewise. I grabbed the handle again, trying to hold it straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob, it won\u0027t stay up,\" I complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will when you\u0027re moving,\" he promised. \"Now where\u0027s your brake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Behind my right foot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed my right hand and curled my fingers around the lever over the throttle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the brake you want. Don\u0027t use the back brake now, that\u0027s for later, when you know what you\u0027re doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t sound right,\" I said suspiciously. \"Aren\u0027t both brakes kind of important?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget the back brake, okay? Here��\" He wrapped his hand around mine and made me squeeze the lever down. \"That is how you brake. Don\u0027t forget.\" He squeezed my hand another time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Throttle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted the right grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gearshift?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nudged it with my left calf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good. I think you\u0027ve got all the parts down. Now you just have to get itmoving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh,\" I muttered, afraid to say more. My stomach was contorting strangely and I thought my voice might crack. I was terrified. I tried to tell myself that the fear was pointless. I\u0027d already lived through the worst thing possible. In comparison with that, why should anything frighten me now? I should be able to look death in the face and laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach wasn\u0027t buying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared down the long stretch of dirt road, bordered by thick misty green on every side. The road was sandy and damp. Better than mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to hold down the clutch,\" Jacob instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my fingers around the clutch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now this is crucial, Bella,\" Jacob stressed. \"Don\u0027t let go of that, okay? I want you to pretend that I\u0027ve handed you a live grenade. The pin is out and you are holding down the spoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Do you think you can kick-start it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I move my foot, I will fall over,\" I told him through gritted teeth, my fingers tight around my live grenade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll do it. Don\u0027t let go of the clutch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step back, and then suddenly slammed his foot down on the pedal. There was a short ripping noise, and the force of his thrust rocked the bike. I started to fall sideways, but Jake caught the bike before it knocked me to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steady there,\" he encouraged. \"Do you still have the clutch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plant your feet��I\u0027m going to try again.\" But he put his hand on the back of the seat, too, just to be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took four more kicks before the ignition caught. I could feel the bike rumbling beneath me like an angry animal. I gripped the clutch until my fingers ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try out the throttle,\" he suggested. \"Very lightly. And don\u0027t let go of the clutch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHesitantly, I twisted the right handle. Though the movement was tiny, the bike snarled beneath me. It sounded angry and hungry now. Jacob smiled in deep satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember how to put it into first gear?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, go ahead and do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited for a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Left foot,\" he prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said, taking a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you want to do this?\" Jacob asked. \"You look scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I snapped. I kicked the gearshift down one notch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" he praised me. \"Now, very gently, ease up on the clutch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step away from the bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to let go of the grenade?\" I asked in disbelief. No wonder he was moving back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how you move, Bella. Just do it little by little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I began to loosen my grip, I was shocked to be interrupted by a voice that did not belong to the boy standing next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is reckless and childish and idiotic, Bella,\" the velvet voice fumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh!\" I gasped, and my hand fell off the clutch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bike bucked under me, yanking me forward and then collapsing to the ground half on top of me. The growling engine choked to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" Jacob jerked the heavy bike off me with ease. \"Are you hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wasn\u0027t listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you so,\" the perfect voice murmured, crystal clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" Jacob shook my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I mumbled, dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than fine. The voice in my head was back. It still rang in my ears��soft, velvety echoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind ran swiftly through the possibilities. There was no familiarity here��on a road I\u0027d never seen, doing something I\u0027d never done before��no deja vu So the hallucinations must be triggered by something else�� I felt the adrenaline coursing through my veins again, and I thought I had the answer. Some combination of adrenaline and danger, or maybe just stupidity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was pulling me to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you hit your head?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\" I shook it back and forth, checking. \"I didn\u0027t hurt the bike, did I?\" This thought worried me. I was anxious to try again, right away. Being reckless was paying off better than I\u0027d thought. Forget cheating. Maybe I\u0027d found a way to generate the hallucinations��that was much more important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You just stalled the engine,\" Jacob said, interrupting my quick speculations. \"You let go of the clutch too fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Let\u0027s try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" Jacob asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Positive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I tried to get the kick-start myself. It was complicated; I had to jump a little to slam down on the pedal with enough force, and every time I did that, the bike tried to knock me over. Jacob\u0027s hand hovered over the handlebars, ready to catch me if I needed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took several good tries, and even more poor tries, before the engine caught and roared to life under me. Remembering to hold on to the grenade, I revved the throttle experimentally. It snarled at the slightest touch. My smile mirrored Jacob\u0027s now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy on the clutch,\" he reminded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to kill yourself, then? Is that what this is about?\" the other voice spoke again, his tone severe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled tightly��it was still working��and ignored the questions. Jacob wasn\u0027t going to let anything serious happen to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go home to Charlie,\" the voice ordered. The sheer beauty of it amazed me. I couldn\u0027t allow my memory to lose it, no matter the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ease off slowly,\" Jacob encouraged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" I said. It bothered me a bit when I realized I was answering both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice in my head growled against the roar of the motorcycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to focus this time, to not let the voice startle me again, I relaxed my hand by tiny degrees. Suddenly, the gear caught and wrenched me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was flying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was wind that wasn\u0027t there before, blowing my skin against my skull and flinging my hair back behind me with enough force that it felt like someone was tugging on it. I\u0027d left my stomach back at the starting point; the adrenaline coursed through my body, tingling in my veins. The trees raced past me, blurring into a wall of green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this was only first gear. My foot itched toward the gearshift as I twisted for more gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Bella!\" the angry, honey-sweet voice ordered in my ear. \"Watch what you\u0027re doing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt distracted me enough from the speed to realize that the road was starting a slow curve to the left, and I was still going straight. Jacob hadn\u0027t told me how to turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brakes, brakes,\" I muttered to myself, and I instinctively slammed down with my right foot, like I would in my truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bike was suddenly unstable underneath me, shivering first to one side and then the other. It was dragging me toward the green wall, and I was going too fast. I tried to turn the handlebar the other direction, and the sudden shift of my weight pushed the bike toward the ground, still spinning toward the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motorcycle landed on top of me again, roaring loudly, pulling me across the wet sand until it hit something stationary. I couldn\u0027t see. My face was mashed into the moss. I tried to lift my head, but there was something in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was dizzy and confused. It sounded like there were three things snarling��the bike over me, the voice in my head, and something else��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella!\" Jacob yelled, and I heard the roar of the other bike cut off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motorcycle no longer pinned me to the ground, and I rolled over to breathe. All the growling went silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" I murmured. I was thrilled. This had to be it, the recipe for a hallucination��adrenaline plus clanger plus stupidity. Something close to that, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella!\" Jacob was crouching over me anxiously. \"Bella, are you alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m great!\" I enthused. I flexed my arms and legs. Everything seemed to be working correctly. \"Let\u0027s do itagain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\" Jacob still sounded worried. \"I think I\u0027d better drive you to the hospital first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027mfine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, Bella? You\u0027ve got a huge cut on your forehead, and it\u0027s gushing blood,\" he informed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clapped my hand over my head. Sure enough, it was wet and sticky. I could smell nothing but the damp moss on my face, and that held off the nausea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m so sorry, Jacob.\" I pushed hard against the gash, as if I could force the blood back inside my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you apologizing for bleeding?\" he wondered as he wrapped a long arm around my waist and pulled me to my feet. \"Let\u0027s go. I\u0027ll drive.\" He held out his hand for the keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the bikes?\" I asked, handing them over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought for a second. \"Wait here. And take this.\" He pulled off his T-shirt, already spotted with blood, and threw it to me. I wadded it up and held it tightly to my forehead. I was starting to smell the blood; I breathed deeply through my mouth and tried to concentrate on something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob jumped on the black motorcycle, kicked it to a start in one try, and raced back down the road, spraying sand and pebbles behind him. He looked athletic and professional as he leaned over the handlebars, head low, face forward, his shiny hair whipping against the russet skin of his back. My eyes narrowed enviously. I was sure I hadn\u0027t looked like that on my motorcycle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised at how far I\u0027d gone. I could barely see Jacob in the distance when he finally got to the truck. He threw the bike into the bed and sprinted to the driver\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really didn\u0027t feel bad at all as he coaxed my truck to a deafening roar in his hurry to get back to me. My head stung a little, and my stomach was uneasy, but the cut wasn\u0027t serious. Head wounds just bled more than most. His urgency wasn\u0027t necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob left the truck running as he raced back to me, wrapping his arm around my waist again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, let\u0027s get you in the truck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m honestly fine,\" I assured him as he helped me in. \"Don\u0027t get worked up. It\u0027s just a little blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a lot of blood,\" I heard him mutter as he went back for my bike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, let\u0027s think about this for a second,\" I began when he got back in. \"If you take me to the ER like this, Charlie is sure to hear about it.\" I glanced down at the sand and dirt caked into my jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, I think you need stitches. I\u0027m not going to let you bleed to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" I promised. \"Let\u0027s just take the bikes back first, and then we\u0027ll make a stop at my house so I can dispose of the evidence before we go to the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Charlie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he had to work today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me. I\u0027m an easy bleeder. It\u0027s not nearly as dire as it looks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob wasn\u0027t happy��his full mouth turned down in an uncharacteristic frown��but he didn\u0027t want to get me in trouble. I stared out the window, holding his ruined shirt to my head, while he drove me to Forks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe motorcycle was better than I\u0027d dreamed. It had served its original purpose. I\u0027d cheated��broken my promise. I\u0027d been needlessly reckless. I felt a little less pathetic now that the promises had been broken on both sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then to discover the key to the hallucinations! At least, I hoped I had. I was going to test the theory as soon as possible. Maybe they\u0027d get through with me quickly in the ER, and I could try again tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRacing down the road like that had been amazing. The feel of the wind in my face, the speed and the freedom�� it reminded me of a past life, flying through the thick forest without a road, piggyback while he ran��I stopped thinking right there, letting the memory break off in the sudden agony. I flinched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still okay?\" Jacob checked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" I tried to sound as convincing as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way,\" he added. \"I\u0027m going to disconnect your foot brake tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt home, I went to look at myself in the mirror first thing; it was pretty gruesome. Blood was drying in thick streaks across my cheek and neck, matting in my muddy hair. I examined myself clinically, pretending the blood was paint so it wouldn\u0027t upset my stomach. I breathed through my mouth, and was fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI washed up as well as I could. Then I hid my dirty, bloody clothes in the bottom of my laundry basket, putting on new jeans and a button-up shirt (that I didn\u0027t have to pull over my head) as carefully as I could. I managed to do this one-handed and keep both garments blood-free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry up,\" Jacob called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay,\" I shouted back. After making sure I left nothing incriminating behind me, I headed downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I look?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But do I look like I tripped in your garage and hit my head on a hammer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob hurried me out the door, and insisted on driving again. We were halfway to the hospital when I realized he was still shirtless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned guiltily. \"We should have grabbed you a jacket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would have given us away,\" he teased. \"Besides, it\u0027s not cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\" I shivered and reached out to turn the heat on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Jacob to see if he was just playing tough so I wouldn\u0027t worry, but he looked comfortable enough. He had one arm over the back of my seat, though I was huddled up to keep warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob really did look older than sixteen��not quite forty, but maybe older than me. Quil didn\u0027t have too much on him in the muscle department, for all that Jacob claimed to be a skeleton. The muscles were the long wiry kind, but they were definitely there under the smooth skin. His skin was such a pretty color, it made me jealous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob noticed my scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he asked, suddenly self-conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. I just hadn\u0027t realized before. Did you know, you\u0027re sort of beautiful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the words slipped out, I worried that he might take my impulsive observation the wrong way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jacob just rolled his eyes. \"You hit your head pretty hard, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, thanks. Sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned. \"You\u0027re sort of welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to have seven stitches to c lose the cut on my forehead. After the sting of the local anesthetic, there was no pain in the procedure. Jacob held my hand while Dr. Snow was sewing, and I tried not to think about why that was ironic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were at the hospital forever. By the time I was done, I had to drop Jacob off at his home and hurry back to cook dinner for Charlie. Charlie seemed to buy my story about falling in Jacob\u0027s garage. After all, it wasn\u0027t like I hadn\u0027t been able to land myself in the ER before with no more help than my own feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis night was not as bad as that first night, after I\u0027d heard the perfect voice in Port Angeles. The hole came back, the way it always did when I was away from Jacob, but it didn\u0027t throb so badly around the edges. I was already planning ahead, looking forward to more delusions, and that was a distraction. Also, I knew I would feel better tomorrow when I was with Jacob again. That made the empty hole and the familiar pain easier to bear; relief was in sight. The nightmare, too, had lost a little of its potency. I was horrified by the nothingness, as always, but I was also strangely impatient as I waited for the moment that would send me screaming into consciousness. I knew the nightmare had to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next Wednesday, before I could get home from the ER, Dr. Gerandy called to warn my father that I might possibly have a concussion and advised him to wake me up every two hours through the night to make sure it wasn\u0027t serious. Charlie\u0027s eyes narrowed suspiciously at my weak explanation about tripping again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should just stay out of the garage altogether, Bella,\" he suggested that night during dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI panicked, worried that Charlie was about to lay down some kind of edict that would prohibit La Push, and consequently my motorcycle. And I wasn\u0027t giving it up��I\u0027d had the most amazing hallucination today. My velvet-voiced delusion had yelled at me for almost five minutes before I\u0027d hit the brake too abruptly and launched myself into the tree. I\u0027d take whatever pain that would cause me tonight without complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This didn\u0027t happen in the garage,\" I protested quickly. \"We were hiking, and I tripped over a rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since when do you hike?\" Charlie asked skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working at Newton\u0027s was bound to rub off sometime,\" I pointed out. \"Spend every day selling all the virtues of the outdoors, eventually you get curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie glared at me, unconvinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be more careful,\" I promised, surreptitiously crossing my fingers under the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind you hiking right there around La Push, but keep close to town, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we\u0027ve been getting a lot of wildlife complaints lately. The forestry department is going to check into it, but for the time being��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, the big bear,\" I said with sudden comprehension. \"Yeah, some of the hikers coming through Newton\u0027s have seen it. Do you think there\u0027s really some giant mutated grizzly out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis forehead creased. \"There\u0027s something. Keep it close to town, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, sure,\" I said quickly. He didn\u0027t look completely appeased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie\u0027s getting nosy,\" I complained to Jacob when I picked him up after school Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we should cool it with the bikes.\" He saw my objecting expression and added, \"At least for a week or so. You could stay out of the hospital for a week, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we going to do?\" I griped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled cheerfully. \"What ever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that for a minute��about what I wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated the idea of losing even my brief seconds of closeness with the memories that didn\u0027t hurt��the ones that came on their own, without me thinking of them consciously. If I couldn\u0027t have the bikes, I was going to have to find some other avenue to the danger and the adrenaline, and that was going to take serious thought and creativity. Doing nothing in the meantime was not appealing. Suppose I got depressed again, even with Jake? I had to keep occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe there was some other way, some other recipe�� some other place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house had been a mistake, certainly. But his presence must be stamped somewhere, somewhere other than inside me. There had to be a place where he seemed more real than among all the familiar landmarks that were crowded with other human memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could think of one place where that might hold true. One place that would always belong to him and no one else. A magic place, full of light. The beautiful meadow I\u0027d seen only once in my life, lit by sunshine and the sparkle of his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis idea had a huge potential for backfiring��it might be dangerously painful. My chest ached with emptiness even to think of it. It was hard to hold myself upright, to not give myself away. But surely, there of all places, I could hear his voice. And I\u0027d already told Charlie I was hiking��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking about so hard?\" Jacob asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well��\" I began slowly. \"I found this place in the forest once��I came across it when I was, um, hiking. A little meadow, the most beautiful place. I don\u0027t know if I could track it down again on my own. It would definitely take a few tries��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could use a compass and a grid pattern,\" Jacob said with confident helpfulness. \"Do you know where you started from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, just below the trailhead where the one-ten ends. I was going mostly south, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool. We\u0027ll find it.\" As always, Jacob was game for anything I wanted. No matter how strange it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Saturday afternoon, I tied on my new hiking boots��purchased that morning using my twenty-per-cent-off employee discount for the first time��grabbed my new topographical map of the Olympic Peninsula, and drove to La Push.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t get started immediately; first, Jacob sprawled across the living room floor��taking up the whole room��and, for a full twenty minutes, drew a complicated web across the key section of the map while I perched on a kitchen chair and talked to Billy. Billy didn\u0027t seem at all concerned about our proposed hiking trip. I was surprised that Jacob had told him where we were going, given the fuss people were making about the bear sightings. I wanted to ask Billy not to say anything about this to Charlie, but I was afraid that making the request would cause the opposite result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we\u0027ll see the super bear,\" Jacob joked, eyes on his design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Billy swiftly, fearing a Charlie-style reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Billy just laughed at his son. \"Maybe you should take a jar of honey, just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake chuckled. \"Hope your new boots are fast, Bella. One little jar isn\u0027t going to keep a hungry bear occupied for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only have to be faster than you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck with that!\" Jacob said, rolling his eyes as he refolded the map. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have fun,\" Billy rumbled, wheeling himself toward the refrigerator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie was not a hard person to live with, but it looked to me like Jacob had it even easier than I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove to the very end of the dirt road, stopping near the sign that marked the beginning of the trailhead. It had been a long time since I\u0027d been here, and my stomach reacted nervously. This might be a very bad thing. But it would be worth it, if I got to hear him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out and looked at the dense wall of green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went this way,\" I murmured, pointing straight ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" Jake muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the direction I\u0027d pointed, then at the clearly marked trail, and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have figured you for a trail kind of girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not me.\" I smiled bleakly. \"I\u0027m a rebel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, and then pulled out our map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a second.\" He held the compass in a skilled way, twisting the map around till it angled the way he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay��first line on the grid. Let\u0027s do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell that I was slowing Jacob up, but he didn\u0027t complain. I tried not to dwell on my last trip through this part of the forest, with a very different companion. Normal memories were still cangerous. If I let myself slip up, I\u0027d end up with my arms clutching my chest to hold it together, gasping for air, and how would I explain that to Jacob?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t as hard as I would have thought to keep focused on the present. The forest looked a lot like any other part of the peninsula, and Jacob set a vastly different mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whistled cheerfully, an unfamiliar tune, swinging his arms and moving easily through the rough undergrowth. The shadows didn\u0027t seem as dark as usual. Not with my personal sun along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob checked the compass every few minutes, keeping us in a straight line with one of the radiating spokes of his grid. He really looked like he knew what he was doing. I was going to compliment him, but I caught myself. No doubt he\u0027d add another few years to his inflated age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind wandered as I walked, and I grew curious. I hadn\u0027t forgotten the conversation we\u0027d had by the sea cliffs��I\u0027d been waiting for him to bring it up again, but it didn\u0027t look like that was going to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey�� Jake?\" I asked hesitantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are things�� with Embry? Is he back to normal yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was silent for a minute, still moving forward with long paces. When he was about ten feet ahead, he stopped to wait for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He\u0027s not back to normal,\" Jacob said when I reached him, his mouth pulling down at the corners. He didn\u0027t start walking again. I immediately regretted bringing it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"StillwithSam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his arm around my shoulder, and he looked so troubled that I didn\u0027t playfully shake it off, as I might have otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they still looking at you funny?\" I half-whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob stared through the trees. \"Sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"AndBilly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As helpful as ever,\" he said in a sour, angry voice that disturbed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our couch is always open,\" I offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, breaking out of the unnatural gloom. \"But think of the position that would put Charlie in��when Billy calls the police to report my kidnapping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed too, glad to have Jacob back to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped when Jacob said we\u0027d gone six miles, cut west for a short time, and headed back along another line of his grid. Everything looked exactly the same as the way in, and I had a feeling that my silly quest was pretty much doomed. I admitted as much when it started to get darker, the sunless day fading toward a starless night, but Jacob was more confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as you\u0027re sure we\u0027re starting from the right place��\" He glanced down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll find it,\" he promised, grabbing my hand and pulling me through a mass of ferns. On the other side was the truck. He gestured toward it proudly. \"Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re good,\" I admitted. \"Next time we bring flashlights, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll save hiking for Sundays from now on. I didn\u0027t know you were that slow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yanked my hand back and stomped around to the driver\u0027s side while he chuckled at my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you up for another try tomorrow.\u0027\" he asked, sliding into the passenger seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Unless you want to go without me so I don\u0027t tie you down to my gimpy pace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll survive,\" he assured me. \"If we\u0027re hiking again, though, you might want to pick up some moleskin. I bet you can feel those new boots right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little,\" I confessed. It felt like I had more blisters than I had space to fit them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope we see the bear tomorrow. I\u0027m sort of disappointed about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, me, too,\" I agreed sarcastically. \"Maybe we\u0027ll get lucky tomorrow and something will eat us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bears don\u0027t want to eat people. We don\u0027t taste that good.\" He grinned at me in the dark cab. \"Of course, you might be an exception. I bet you\u0027d taste good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks so much,\" I said, looking away. He wasn\u0027t the first person to tell me that. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-9.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
