People can talk up anything, can make a snivelling dollop of shit the god’s own mountain, given enough time and enough lies and enough silences .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a Bonehunter now. Got nothing to do with any of you any more – which is what I was trying to tell Hedge .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fine. Now go hunt down some bones.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, why not? Whose bones do you want us to hunt for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhiskeyjack rode slightly ahead and swung his mount round, blocking Fiddler’s path. But his old sergeant wasn’t looking good – he was a damned half-mummified corpse, and his mount wasn’t much better off. ‘Whose do you think, Fid?’ And yet that voice was his – no question. Whiskeyjack .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where’d you come by that name, Fid?’ And that was Mallet, but he was badly chopped up, the wounds crusted with dried blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name? Bonehunters? It was finger bones, I think .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Whose hand?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? Nobody’s – lots of people. Nameless ones, long dead ones – just nameless bones!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all fading from his vision now. But he wanted them to stay. They were supposed to be here with him, to take up his soul when he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhiskeyjack was backing his horse even as he grew translucent. ‘Bones of the fallen, Fiddler. Now, who fell the furthest ?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore him now nothing but that distant, flat line. Nothing but the horizon. Fiddler rubbed at his face. Fucking hallucinations. Least they could’ve done was give me a drink of water .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe resumed walking. No reason to. No reason not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who fell the furthest. Funny man, Whiskeyjack.’ But maybe it was so. Maybe she made us and named us to hunt down the bones of a damned god. Maybe she was telling us what she wanted all along, and we were too thick to know it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut look at that line. That perfect flat line. Just waiting for our bones to make us a shore, and once we’ve made it, why, we go no farther .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost time .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge, I’ll find you if I can. A few words. A clasp of hands, or a clout upside the head, whichever best suits the moment .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonehunters. Oh. Nice one .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara Yil wanted her god back. She wanted to feel that flow of strength, that appalling will. To take her out of here. To feel a sudden, immortal power filling her body, and she would reach out to draw Henar Vygulf under her shadowy wing. Others too, if she could. This whole army of sufferers – they didn’t deserve this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenar walked close by her side, ready to steady her when she stumbled. He had seemed indomitable, but now he was bent like an old man. Thirst was crushing them all, like a vast hand pressing down. The Adjunct was ten paces ahead, Banaschar off to her right, and far ahead walked Fiddler, alone, and she imagined she could hear music from him, a siren call pulling them ever forward. But his fiddle was broken. There was no music, no matter what she thought she heard, just the sluggish dirge of her own blood, the rasps of their breaths and the crunch of their worn boots on the hard ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jade Strangers hung now over the northern sky, casting confused shadows – those terrible slashes would circle round over the course of the day, now visible even through the sun’s bright glare, making the light eerie, unearthly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct’s march was unsteady, drifting to the right for a time, and then back to the left. It seemed only Fiddler was capable of managing a straight line. She remembered back to the reading. Its wild violence – had it all been for nothing? A rush of possibilities, not one realized, not one borne out in the days to follow. It seemed the Adjunct – who alone warranted no card – had taken them all from their destinies, taken them into a place with no end but death, and a death bereft of glory or honour. If that was so, then Fiddler’s reading had been the cruellest of jokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he walking out there, ahead of the rest of them, out of some desperate desire? To drag them all into the truth of his visions? But the desert still stretched empty – not even the bones of the children of the Snake could be seen – they had lost them, but no one knew precisely when, and the path that might have led them to the mythical city of Icarias was now nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze found the Adjunct again, this woman she had chosen to follow. And she didn’t know what to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond Tavore, the horizon, pale as the water of a tropical sea, now showed a rim of fire. Announcing the end of the night, the end of this march. Shadows spun round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler halted. He turned round to face them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct continued until she was ten paces from him and then slowed, and with her last step, she tottered and almost fell. Banaschar moved close but stopped when Tavore straightened once more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-313.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
