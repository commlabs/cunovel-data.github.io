No such luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling out my makeup case, I tell Jess to hold up the mirror so I can brush on more blush and fix any smudged eyeliner. Then I hold up the mirror for Jess so she can do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you girls doing?\" Nathan asks, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fixing ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a beauty pageant, you know. It\u0027s the IDF.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know,\" Jess says, dipping the lip gloss applicator in the tube and applying it to her lips. \"But who says just because you\u0027re in the army you have to look like crap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously, Nathan. Don\u0027t you know anything about girls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently not.\" He turns to Miranda and puts his hands in a praying position. \"Don\u0027t be like them, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like the way they look,\" Miranda tells him. \"If I was as pretty as them, I\u0027d do the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slaps his palm against his forehead. \"I cannot believe what I\u0027m hearing. Miranda, you\u0027re fine as-is.\" Great, Nathan, treat her as if she\u0027s a defective as-is item sold on the clearance rack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miranda, I need makeup to look good,\" I tell her. \"You\u0027re naturally pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the bus passes through the checkpoint, my heart starts racing. I wonder when we\u0027ll have free time to explore the base so I can search for Avi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t volunteer for anything,\" a guy in the seat behind us whispers through the space between the seats. \"Pass it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pass the message down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard if you volunteer, you\u0027ll be stuck doing some crappy assignment,\" Jess says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote taken. I will not volunteer. I have a major aversion to crappy assignments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy couldn\u0027t God have given humans doggie sweat glands, so we could gracefully pant our sweat away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur military leaders, or hamefa\u0027ked\u0027m Hebrew (if you say it fast it sounds like I\u0027m a [insert cuss word]), are named Ronit and Susu. They\u0027re both Israeli, both in the military, and their crappy assignment is being in charge of us during boot camp. Susu is in charge of the twenty guys and Ronit is in charge of the twenty girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonit stands next to the bus driver with her clipboard in hand. \"Girls, please find your suitcases and follow me to the bittan. Boys, follow Susu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe gather our backpacks and file off the bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they\u0027re gonna separate the guys from the girls, can we at least have co-ed showers?\" Nathan mumbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a pig,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh, don\u0027t say the word \u0027pig\u0027 so loud, Amy,\" Nathan whispers in my ear. \"Pigs aren\u0027t kosher, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever, Nathan. It\u0027s not like I\u0027m gonna eat it. I just said it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the stronger American guys from our trip are unloading our luggage. I would be searching for my luggage, but I\u0027m too consumed with Avi-scanning and fanning my face with my hand because it\u0027s so hot outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027d think God\u0027s holy land wouldn\u0027t be as hot as hell, but it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find your luggage fast, ladies!\" Ronit\u0027s voice booms from behind us. \"And follow me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does she have to be so cheery all the time?\" Jess asks. \"It\u0027s irritating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she loves her job,\" Miranda chimes in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort, on purpose. \"Maybe she\u0027s got a personality disorder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as Nathan joins the other guys following Susu. I have to give major credit to Nathan for always fitting in as \"one of the guys.\" He\u0027s never an outcast or out of place, because everyone likes him. It\u0027s a trait that totally annoys someone like me--I only feel comfortable with people who know me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spot my hot pink luggage that I bought for my trip. One big rolling suitcase and one smaller one. My father wanted me to buy a dorky duffel or some boring luggage that had been \"rated highly\" (my dad\u0027s words, not mine) by Consumer Reports, but I\u0027d axed that suggestion because the only colors available were black and black with dark gray trim. I have one word to describe them: BOR-ING!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want my luggage to reflect my personality. And I\u0027m anything but boring. I pull out the handles to my girlie suitcases and start wheeling them away from the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRonit holds her hand high in the air and says, \"Follow me, girls!\" as she heads down the road. \"Yala, zooz! Hurry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the girls in our group are lugging duffels (okay, I admit the brochure might have recommended them, but it\u0027d be impossible to shove all my stuff in a duffel... and I\u0027d never be able to carry it even if I could). How these girls can fit their necessities into one bag is beyond me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda, Jessica, and I are lagging behind. I mean, come on... who can hurry when it\u0027s so damn hot outside? Jessica has two pink suitcases, just like me, but hers have huge rhinestone/diamond studs spelling out JESSICA across the side. Miranda only has one painfully boring black suitcase. The poor girl is sweating so much there are wet spots in the shape of half-moons under her boobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027m going to die,\" Miranda says, yanking a portable fan out of her suitcase and hanging it around her neck. \"Where are the barracks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would feel sorry for her, except my boobs have the same half-moon wet spots and I don\u0027t have a portable fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything from your sunglasses to your suitcase should reflect your unique style and attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith my designer sunglasses protecting my eyes, my backpack on my back, and a suitcase rolling in each hand, I\u0027m walking slowly down the road. We\u0027re passing offices and off-white buildings made out of cement. I\u0027m painfully aware of the many Israeli soldiers pointing to the three of us and snickering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, gawk at the American girls struggling with their luggage, I want to say, but don\u0027t. We must look totally out of place with our Abercrombie outfits and pimped-out suitcases. Listen, I don\u0027t blame them for laughing. I\u0027m definitely out of my element.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI silently pray for Avi to come to my rescue and take my luggage to the barracks for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat rolls down my forehead. Where is my boyfriend? And how big is this army base anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, girls!\" Ronit urges from far down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess puts on a huge fake smile and waves to our leader. \"We\u0027re coming!\" she says, mimicking Ronit s cheery tone. Jess and I know she\u0027s making fun of Ronit, but I doubt anyone else does. \"Don\u0027t they have a bellman?\" She wipes her upper lip that\u0027s beading with sweat. \"They better have air-conditioned rooms. I just got my lip waxed and don\u0027t have anything for the sweat to cling to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh, TMI,\" I tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true, Amy. Do you have another portable fan with you, Miranda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look left and right to see if I can catch a glimpse of my boyfriend. \"Avi has got to be around here somewhere, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess sighs. She misses Tarik, her boyfriend. He\u0027s Palestinian, and although he\u0027s not thrilled about her spending part of her summer on an Israeli military base, he understands her commitment to her religion because he feels the same about his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica is Jewish and Tarik is Muslim. You\u0027d think they\u0027d avoid each other like I avoid political debates, but ever since they met they\u0027ve chosen to ignore the obvious obstacles in their relationship. So who am I to bring it up? I\u0027m a huge fan of living in ignorant bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m wondering when this lugging-luggage torture will be over. My suitcases are kicking up dust from the gravel road. Now I\u0027m not only sweaty, but dirty too. I pull harder. Visions of a hot shower with my papaya-scented bath gel and a nice relaxing nap on a featherbed dance in my brain. Suddenly, I hear a snap and watch one of the wheels on my beautiful, designer, hot-pink suitcase roll away from me and bounce to the bottom of a ditch. I suck in a horrified breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt boggles my mind that there\u0027s a direct correlation between lack of quality and bling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least in the suitcase department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa, that sucks,\" Jess says slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda points to the offending wheel. \"Amy, is that yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\" So now I have a broken piece of luggage and I\u0027m still not at our barracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow my ego and start walking toward the stupid broken wheel. I eye it in the ditch where it stopped. I\u0027m wearing a pink tank and white jean shorts, and I know if I slip as I go down I\u0027m going to have dirt all over me. Oh, don\u0027t go blaming me about wearing white shorts... climbing down into a ditch to retrieve a stupid wheel wasn\u0027t exactly one of the warnings in the Sababa brochure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take one step down. My foot slides a little, then stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI probably should tell you now that I\u0027m wearing these really cute pink mules that aren\u0027t really made for traction--but they sure do match my tank perfectly. I\u0027m not about to take out the gym shoes I bought for this trip, because they\u0027re at the bottom of one of my suitcases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take another step, and wobble because I\u0027m walking on an angle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful,\" Miranda warns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I take another step, a boy in uniform walks up to us. \"Mah karah? he asks. He\u0027s got short hair and beautiful olive skin without a trace of acne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Angleet, b\u0027vakashah,\" I say. My dad taught me that phrase, which means \"English, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need help?\" He has a big Israeli accent along with a big Israeli smile (he\u0027s also got a big Israeli rifle slung on his back).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Desperately,\" I admit, pointing to the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scrambles down the bank as if he does it every day of his life, and picks up the wheel. On his way back up, he grabs my elbow and helps me back to the gravel road. Then attempts to reattach the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This suitcase is a piece of sheet,\" he informs me. \"It can\u0027t be fixed.\" He hands me the plastic wheel. I almost laugh at the word \"sheet\"--American profanity with an Israeli accent comes out really funny. But I\u0027m sweaty and unhappy and cannot physically laugh right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shove the wheel in the front pocket of my suitcase. \"Well, thanks for trying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, thanks,\" Miranda chimes in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy holds out his hand. \"I\u0027m Nimrod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really, what\u0027s your name?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nimrod.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not just say Nimrod, did he? With the Israeli accent it sounds like Nim-road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my sunglasses on top of my head, eyeing him suspiciously. \"Nimrodi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nimrod. I guess in America this is not a popular name, no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess is trying not to laugh. Miranda just looks confused. Some names in Israel do not translate to English well. Avi has friends named Doo-Doo, Moron, and O\u0027dead. And my cousin\u0027s name is pronounced O\u0027snot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Amy. And this is Jessica and Miranda,\" I say, pointing to each of my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimrod heaves the entire suitcase up into his arms. \"Your group is at the bittan on the other side of the hill. I\u0027ll help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I say, noting that my hot pink suitcase looks very out of place in Nimrod\u0027s arms and I still have no clue what a bittan is. I roll my smaller suitcase behind him. As we pass other soldiers, they make comments in Hebrew to Nimrod, who laughs and shrugs as he leads us up the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy isn\u0027t breaking a sweat in this heat, which is not normal. Looking around, I notice that none of the Israeli soldiers milling around are sweating. It makes me wonder if Israelis are born without sweat glands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you girls from?\" Nimrod asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chicago,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never been there, but there\u0027s a guy in my unit whose girlfriend lives there.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-2.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
