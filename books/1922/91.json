Eva, Corinne Giroux. An old friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI extended my hand to her and she shook it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any friend of Gideon\u0027s is a friend of mine,\" she said with a warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope that applies to girlfriends as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her gaze met mine, it was knowing. \"Especially girlfriends. If you could spare him a moment, I\u0027ve been hoping to introduce him to an associate of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" My voice was calm; I was anything but.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon gave me a perfunctory kiss on the temple before he stepped closer to Corinne and offered his arm to her, leaving Magdalene standing awkwardly next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually felt sorry for her, she looked so dejected. \"Your new hairstyle is very flattering, Magdalene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at me, her mouth tight, and then it softened with a sigh that sounded filled with resignation. \"Thank you. It was time for a change. Time for many changes, I think. Also, there was no reason to imitate the one who got away now that she\u0027s back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned in confusion. \"You lost me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m talking about Corinne.\" She studied my face. \"You don\u0027t know. She and Gideon were engaged, for over a year. She broke it off, married a wealthy Frenchman, and moved to Europe. But the marriage fell apart. They\u0027re now getting divorced and she\u0027s moved back to New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngaged. I felt the blood drain from my face, my gaze shifting to where the man I loved stood with the woman he must\u0027ve once loved, his hand moving to the small of her back to steady her as she leaned into him with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs my stomach twisted with jealousy and sick fear, it struck me that I\u0027d assumed he had never had a serious romantic relationship before me. Stupid. As hot as he was, I should\u0027ve known better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagdalene touched my shoulder. \"You should sit down, Eva. You\u0027re very pale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I was breathing too fast and my speeding pulse rate was dangerously high. \"You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving to the nearest available chair, I got off my feet. Magdalene sat beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You love him,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t see it. I\u0027m sorry. And I\u0027m sorry for what I said to you the first time we met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You love him, too,\" I replied woodenly, my gaze unfocused. \"And at that time, I didn\u0027t. Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t excuse me, does it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gratefully accepted another glass of champagne when it was offered to me and took a second for Magdalene before the waiter straightened to move on. We clinked glasses in a pitiful display of scorned female solidarity. I wanted to leave. I wanted to get up and walk out. I wanted Gideon to realize I\u0027d left, to be forced to leave after me. I wanted him to feel some of the pain I felt. Stupid, immature, hurtful imaginings that made me feel small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took comfort from Magdalene sitting silently beside me in commiseration. She knew how it felt to love Gideon and want him too much. That I sensed she was as miserable as I was confirmed what a threat Corinne might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad he been pining for her this whole time? Was she the reason he\u0027d closed himself off from other women?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up as Gideon found me. Of course Corinne was still on his arm and I got the full effect of the two of them as a couple. There were, quite simply, impossibly gorgeous together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorinne took a seat beside me and Gideon brushed his fingertips over my cheek. \"I have to speak with someone,\" he said. \"Would you like me to bring you back anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stoli and cranberry. Make it a double.\" I needed a buzz. Bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" But he frowned at my request before he walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad to meet you, Eva,\" Corinne said. \"Gideon has told me so much about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t have been too much. You two weren\u0027t gone that long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We talk nearly every day.\" She smiled, and there was nothing fake or malicious in her expression. \"We\u0027ve been friends a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More than friends,\" Magdalene said pointedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorinne frowned at Magdalene and I realized I wasn\u0027t supposed to know. Was it she or Gideon or both of them that had decided it was best not to tell me? Why cover up something if there was nothing to hide?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s true,\" she admitted with obvious reluctance. \"Although that was some years ago now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted in my seat to face her. \"You still love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t blame me for that. Any woman who spends time with him falls in love with him. He\u0027s beautiful and untouchable. That\u0027s an irresistible combination.\" Her smile softened. \"He tells me you\u0027ve inspired him to start opening up. I\u0027m grateful to you for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to say, I didn\u0027t do it for you. Then an insidious doubt drifted through my mind, making a vulnerable spot inside me fold in on itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I doing it for her without knowing it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted the base of my empty champagne flute around and around on the table. \"He was going to marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it was the biggest mistake of my life walking away.\" Her hand went to her throat, her slender fingers restlessly stroking, as if toying with a necklace she\u0027d normally find there. \"I was young and in some ways he frightened me. He was so possessive. It wasn\u0027t until after I married that I realized possessiveness is much better than indifference. At least for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away, fighting the nausea that rose in my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re awfully quiet,\" she said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-91.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
