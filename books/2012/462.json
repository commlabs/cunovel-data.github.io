But that was then and this isn’t. You want me to stay? A few more years, maybe? Till it’s your time, I mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he spoke at all, Fiddler knew that he would lose control. So he simply nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge faced Whiskeyjack. ‘Not yet, sir. Besides, I was talking with my sergeants just the other day. About buying us a bar, back in Malaz City. Maybe even Smiley’s.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler shot the man a glare. ‘But no one can find it, Hedge. Kellanved went and hid it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kitty-corner to the Deadhouse, that’s where it is. Everyone knows, Fid.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But they can’t find it, Hedge!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man shrugged. ‘I will.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fiddler,’ Whiskeyjack said. ‘Pay attention now. Our time is almost done here – sun’s soon to rise, and when it does, we will have left this world for the last time.’ He gestured and Mallet stepped forward, carrying a satchel. He crouched down and removed the straps, and then drew out a fiddle. Its body was carved in swirling Barghast patterns. Seeing that, Fiddler looked up at Trotts. The warrior grinned, showing his filed teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did that, Fid. And that mistake there, up near the neck, that was Hedge’s fault. He tugged my braid. Blame him. I do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallet carefully set the instrument down, placing the bow beside it. The healer glanced up, almost shyly. ‘We all had a hand in its making, Fid. Us Bridgeburners.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Take it,’ ordered Whiskeyjack. ‘Fiddler, you were the best of us all. You still are.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler looked over at Quick Ben and Kalam, saw their nods, and then at Hedge, who hesitated, as if to object, and then simply shrugged. Fiddler met Whiskeyjack’s ethereal eyes. ‘Thank you, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost then surprised him by stepping forward, reaching down and touching the fiddle. Straightening, he walked past them, to stand facing the lowland to the west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler stared after him, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Hedge spoke low at his side. ‘She’s out there, sembled now – they’re keeping their distance. They’re not sure what’s happened here. By the time she comes, it’ll be too late.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Who? By the time who comes?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The woman he loves, Fid. Korlat. A Tiste Andii.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiste Andii. Oh … no .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge’s grunt was strained with emotion. ‘Aye, the sergeant’s luck ain’t never been good. He’s got a long wait.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut wait he will .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he caught a blur of motion from a nearby jumble of boulders. A woman, watching them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler hugged himself, looked over once more at Mallet and Trotts. ‘Take care of him,’ he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Whiskeyjack was marching past. ‘Time to leave, you two.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallet reached down and touched the fiddle before turning away. Trotts stepped past him, squatted and did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they were down over the edge of the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, Fiddler heard horses – but in the gloom he could not see his friends riding away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice spoke beside Cotillion. ‘Well done.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patron god of assassins looked down at the knives still in his hands. ‘I don’t like failure. Never did, Shadowthrone.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then,’ and the ethereal form at his side giggled, ‘we’re not quite finished, are we?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah. You knew, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course. And this may well shock you, but I approve.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCotillion turned to him in surprise. ‘I knew you had a heart in there somewhere.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t be an idiot. I just appreciate … symmetry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether they turned back to face the barrow once again, but now the ghosts were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowthrone thumped his cane on the ground. ‘Among all the gods,’ he said, ‘who do you think now hates us the most?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The ones still alive, I should imagine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re not done with them either.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCotillion nodded towards the barrow. ‘They were something, weren’t they?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘With them we won an empire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I sometimes wonder if we should ever have given it up.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Bloody idealist. We needed to walk away. Sooner or later, no matter how much you put into what you’ve made, you have to turn and walk away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shall we, then?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-462.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
