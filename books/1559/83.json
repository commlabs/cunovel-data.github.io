{"id":109065,"no":83,"title":"Page 83","content":"\u003cp\u003ePrince Humperdinck ordered new doctors brought in. (There was still the last miracle man alive, Max, but since they had fired him long before, bringing him back on the case now was simply not deemed wise; if he was incompetent then, when Lotharon was only desperately ill, how could he suddenly be a cure-all now, with Lotharon dying?) The new doctors all agreed on various tried-and-true medications, and within forty-eight hours of their coming on the case, the King was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wedding date of course, was unchanged—it wasn’t every day a country had a five hundredth anniversary—but all the festivities were either curtailed entirely or vastly cut down. And Prince Humperdinck became, forty-five days before the wedding, King of Florin, and that changed everything, because, before, he had taken nothing but his hunting seriously, and now he had to learn, learn everything, learn to run a country, and he buried himself in books and wise men and how did you tax this and when should you tax that and foreign entanglements and who could be trusted and how far and with what? And before her lovely eyes, Humperdinck changed from a man of fear and action to one of frenzied wisdom, because he had to get it all straight now before any other country dared interfere with the future of Florin, so the wedding, when it actually took place, was a tiny thing and brief, sandwiched in between a ministers’ meeting and a treasury crisis, and Buttercup spent her first afternoon as queen wandering around the castle not knowing what in the world to do with herself. It wasn’t until King Humperdinck walked out on the balcony with her to greet the gigantic throng that had spent the day in patient waiting that she realized it had happened, she was the queen, her life, for whatever it was worth, belonged now to the people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood together on the castle balcony, accepting the cheers, the cries, the endless thunderous “hip hips,” until Buttercup said, “Please, may I walk once more among them?” and the King said with a nod that she might and down she went again, as on the day of the wedding announcement, radiant and alone, and again the people swept apart to let her pass, weeping and cheering and bowing and—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—and then one person booed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the balcony watching it all Humperdinck reacted instantly, gesturing soldiers into the area where the sound had come from, dispatching more troops quickly down to surround the Queen, and like clockwork Buttercup was safe, the booer apprehended and led away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold a moment,” Buttercup said, still shaken by the unexpectedness of what had happened. The soldier who held the booer stopped. “Bring her to me,” Buttercup said, and in a moment the booer was right there, eye to eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an ancient woman, withered and bent, and Buttercup thought of all the faces that had gone by in her lifetime, but this one she could not remember. “Have we met?” the Queen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old one shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why? Why on this day? Why do you insult the Queen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you are not worthy of cheers,” the old woman said, and suddenly she was yelling. “You had love in your hands and you gave it up for gold!” She turned to the crowd. “It is true what I tell you—there was love alongside her in the Fire Swamp and she dropped it from her fingers like garbage, and that is what she is, the Queen of Garbage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I had given my word to the Prince—” Buttercup began, but the old woman would not be quieted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ask her how she got through the Fire Swamp? Ask her if she did it alone? She threw love away to be the Queen of Grime, the Queen of Muck—I am old and life means nothing to me, so I am the only person in all this crowd to dare to tell truth, and truth says bow to the Queen of Feculence if you want to, but not I. Cheer the Queen of Slime and Ordure if you want to, but not I. Rave over the beauty of the Queen of Cesspools, but not I. Not I!” She was advancing on Buttercup now. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-83.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
