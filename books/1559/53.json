But if that is true, then why are you smiling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because,” Inigo answered, “I know something you don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what is that?” asked the man in black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not left-handed,” Inigo replied, and with those words, he all but threw the six-fingered sword into his right hand, and the tide of battle turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black retreated before the slashing of the great sword. He tried to side-step, tried to parry, tried to somehow escape the doom that was now inevitable. But there was no way. He could block fifty thrusts; the fifty-first flicked through, and now his left arm was bleeding. He could thwart thirty ripostes, but not the thirty-first, and now his shoulder bled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wounds were not yet grave, but they kept on coming as they dodged across the stones, and then the man in black found himself amidst the trees and that was bad for him, so he all but fled before Inigo’s onslaught, and then he was in the open again, but Inigo kept coming, nothing could stop him, and then the man in black was back among the boulders, and that was even worse for him than the trees and he shouted out in frustration and practically ran to where there was open space again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no dealing with the wizard, and slowly, again, the deadly Cliffs became a factor in the fight, only now it was the man in black who was being forced to doom. He was brave, and he was strong, and the cuts did not make him beg for mercy, and he showed no fear behind his black mask. “You are amazing,” he cried, as Inigo increased the already blinding speed of the blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. It has not come without effort.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe death moment was at hand now. Again and again Inigo thrust forward, and again and again the man in black managed to ward off the attacks, but each time it was harder, and the strength in Inigo’s wrists was endless and he only thrust the more fiercely and soon the man in black grew weak. “You cannot tell it,” he said then, “because I wear a cape and mask. But I am smiling now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I’m not left-handed either,” said the man in black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he too switched hands, and now the battle was finally joined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Inigo began to retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” he screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one of import. Another lover of the blade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I must know!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get used to disappointment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey flashed along the open plateau now, and the blades were both invisible, but oh, the Earth trembled, and ohhhh, the skies shook, and Inigo was losing. He tried to make for the trees, but the man in black would have none of it. He tried retreating to the boulders, but that was denied him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the open, unthinkable as it was, the man in black was superior. Not much. But in a multitude of tiny ways, he was of a slightly higher quality. A hair quicker, a fraction stronger, a speck faster. Not really much at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey met in center plateau for the final assault. Neither man conceded anything. The sound of metal clashing metal rose. A final burst of energy flew through Inigo’s veins and he made every attempt, tried every trick, used every hour of every day of his years of experience. But he was blocked. By the man in black. He was shackled. By the man in black. He was baffled, thwarted, muzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeaten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the man in black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA final flick and the great six-fingered sword went flying from his hand. Inigo stood there, helpless. Then he dropped to his knees, bowed his head, closed his eyes. “Do it quickly,” he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-53.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
