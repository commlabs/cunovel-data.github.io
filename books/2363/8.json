Do you have a car available?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir, we do. How long will you be needing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood question. An hour? A month? Maybe a year or two? \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you plan to return the car to this airport?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk looked at him strangely. \"Very well. Will you fill out these papers, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert paid for the car with the special black credit card General Milliard had given him. The clerk examined it, perplexed, then said, \"Excuse me.\" He disappeared into an office and when he returned, Robert said, \"Any problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. None at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car was a grey Opel Omega. Robert got onto the Airport Highway and headed for downtown Zurich. He enjoyed Switzerland. It was one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Years earlier, he had skied there. In more recent times, he had carried out assignments there, liaising with Espionage Abteilung, the Swiss intelligence agency. During World War II, the agency had been organized into three bureaux; D, P and I, covering Germany, France and Italy, respectively. Now its main purpose was related to espionage operations conducted under cover of United Nations diplomacy, from the various UN organizations in Geneva. Robert had friends in Espionage Abteilung, but he remembered General Hilliard\u0027s words: You\u0027re not to get in touch with any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive into the city took twenty-five minutes. Robert reached the Diibendorf downtown off-ramp and headed for the Bolder Grand Hotel. It was exactly as he remembered it: an overgrown Swiss chateau with turrets, stately and imposing, surrounded by greenery and overlooking Lake Zurich. He parked the car and walked into the lobby. On the left was the reception desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guten Tag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guten Tag. Haben sie ein Zimmer fur eine Nacht?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ja. Wie mochten Sie bezahlen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mil Kreditkarte.\" The black and white credit card that General Hilliard had given him. Robert asked for a map of Switzerland, and was escorted to a comfortable room in the new wing of the hotel. It had a small balcony that overlooked the lake. Robert stood there, breathing in the crisp, autumn air, thinking about the task that lay ahead of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had nothing to go on. Not one damned thing. All the factors in the equation of his assignment were completely unknown. The name of the tour bus company. The number of passengers. Their names and whereabouts. Are the witnesses all in Switzerland? That\u0027s our problem. We have no idea where they are or who they are. And it wasn\u0027t enough to find some of the witnesses. You must find every one of them. The only information he had was the date: Sunday, October 14th, and the place: Uetendorf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed a handle, something to grab onto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he remembered correctly, all-day tour buses left from only two major cities. Zurich and Geneva. Robert opened a desk drawer and took out the bulky Telefonbuch. I should look under M, for miracle, Robert thought. There were more than half a dozen tour companies listed. SUNSHINE TOURS, SWISSTOUR, TOUR SERVICE, TOURALPINO, TOURISM A REISEN ... He would have to check each of them. He copied down the addresses of all the companies and drove to the offices of the nearest one listed: Tour Service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two clerks behind the counter, taking care of tourists. When one of them was free, Robert said, \"Excuse me. My wife was on one of your tours last Sunday and she left her purse on the bus. I think she got excited because of seeing that weather balloon that crashed near Uetendorf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk frowned, \"Es tut mir viel leid. You must be mistaken. Our tours do not go near Uetendorf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Sorry.\" Strike one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next stop promised to be more fruitful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do your tours go to Uetendorf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, ja.\" The clerk smiled. \"Our tours go everywhere in Switzerland. They are the most scenic. We have a tour to Zermatt, the Tell Special. There is also the Glacier Express and the Palm Express. The Great Circle Tour leaves in fifteen ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have a tour Sunday that stopped to watch that weather balloon that crashed? I know my wife was late getting back to the hotel and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk behind the counter said, indignantly, \"We take great pride in the fact that our tours are never late. We make no unscheduled stops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then one of your buses didn\u0027t stop to look at that weather balloon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Strike two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third office Robert visited was located at Bahnhofplatz, and the sign outside said SUNSHINE TOURS. Robert walked up to the counter. \"Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you about one of your tour buses. I heard that a weather balloon crashed near Uetendorf and that your driver stopped for half an hour so the passengers could look at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. He only stopped for fifteen minutes. We have very strict schedules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHome run!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was your interest in this, did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert pulled out one of the identification cards that had been given him. \"I\u0027m a reporter,\" Robert said earnestly, \"and I\u0027m doing a story for Travel \u0026amp; Leisure magazine on how efficient the buses in Switzerland are, compared with other countries. I wonder if I might interview your driver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would make a very interesting article. Very interesting, indeed. We Swiss pride ourselves on our efficiency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that pride is well deserved,\" Robert assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would the name of our company be mentioned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prominently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk smiled. \"Well, then I see no harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could I speak with him now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is his day off.\" He wrote a name on a piece of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Bellamy read it upside down. Hans Beckerman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk added an address. \"He lives in Kappel. That\u0027s a small village about forty kilometres from Zurich. You should be able to find him at home now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Bellamy took the paper. \"Thank you very much. By the way,\" Robert said, \"just so we have all the facts for the story, do you have a record of how many tickets you sold for that particular tour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. We keep records of all our tours. Just a moment.\" He picked up a ledger underneath the counter and flipped a page. \"Ah, here we are. Sunday. Hans Beckerman. There were seven passengers. He drove the Iveco that day, the small bus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven unknown passengers and the driver. Robert took a stab in the dark. \"Would you happen to have the names of those passengers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, people come in off the street, buy their ticket and take the tour. We don\u0027t ask for identification.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonderful. \"Thank you again.\" Robert started toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk called out, \"I hope you will send us a copy of the article.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first piece of the puzzle lay in the tour bus, and Robert drove to Talstrasse where the buses departed, as though it might reveal some hidden clue. The Iveco bus was brown and silver, small enough to traverse the steep Alpine roads, with seats for fourteen passengers. Who were the seven, and where had they disappeared to? Robert got back in his car. He consulted his map and marked it. He took Lavessneralle out of the city, into the Albis, the start of the Alps, toward the village of Kappel. He headed south, driving past the small hills that surround Zurich, and began the climb into the magnificent mountain chain of the Alps. He drove through Adliswil and Langnau and Hausen, and nameless hamlets with chalets and colourful picture-postcard scenery, until almost an hour later, he came to Kappel. The little village consisted of a restaurant, a church, a post office, and a dozen houses scattered around the hills. Robert parked the car and walked into the restaurant. A waitress was clearing a table near the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Entschuldigen Sie bitte, Fraulein. Welche Richtung ist das Haus von Herr Beckerman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ja.\" She pointed down the road. \"An der Kirche rechts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert turned right at the church and drove up to a modest two-storey stone house with a ceramic tiled roof. He got out of the car and walked up to the door. He could see no bell, and knocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heavyset woman with a faint moustache answered the door. \"Ja?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to bother you. Is Mr Beckerman in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed him suspiciously. \"What do you want with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert gave her a winning smile. \"You must be Mrs Beckerman.\" He pulled out his reporter\u0027s identification card. \"I\u0027m doing a magazine article on Swiss bus drivers, and your husband was recommended to my magazine as having one of the finest safety records in the country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brightened and said proudly, \"My Hans is an excellent driver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what everyone tells me, Mrs Beckerman. I would like to do an interview with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An interview with my Hans for a magazine?\" She was flustered. \"That is very exciting. Come in, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led Robert into a small, meticulously neat living room. \"Wait here, bitte. I will get Hans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house had a low, beamed ceiling, dark wooden floors and plain wooden furniture. There was a small stone fireplace and lace curtains at the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert stood there, thinking. This was not only his best lead, it was his only lead. People come in off the street, buy their ticket and take the tour. We don\u0027t ask for identification ... There\u0027s no place to go from here, Robert thought grimly. If this doesn\u0027t work out, I can always place an ad: Will the seven bus passengers who saw a weather balloon crash Sunday please assemble in my hotel room at 1200 tomorrow morning? Breakfast will be served.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thin, bald man appeared. His complexion was pale, and he wore a thick, black moustache that was startlingly out of keeping with the rest of his appearance. \"Good afternoon, Herr ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smith. Good afternoon.\" Robert\u0027s voice was hearty. \"I\u0027ve certainly been looking forward to meeting you, Mr Beckerman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My wife tells me you are writing a story about bus drivers.\" He spoke with a heavy German accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert smiled ingratiatingly. \"That\u0027s right. My magazine is interested in your wonderful safety record and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scheissdreck!\" Beckerman said rudely. \"You are interested in the thing that crashed Sunday afternoon, no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert managed to look abashed. \"As a matter of fact, yes, I am interested in discussing that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do you not come out and say so? Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Robert took a seat on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeckerman said, \"I am sorry I cannot offer you a drink, but we do not keep schnapps in the house anymore.\" He tapped his stomach. \"Ulcers. The doctors cannot even give me drugs to relieve the pain. I am allergic to all of them.\" He sat down opposite Robert. \"But you did not come here to talk about my health, eh? What is it you wish to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to talk to you about the passengers who were on your bus Sunday when you stopped near Uetendorf where the weather balloon crashed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHans Beckerman was staring at him. \"Weather balloon? What weather balloon? What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe balloon that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the spaceship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Robert\u0027s turn to stare. \"The ... spaceship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ja, the flying saucer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment for the words to sink in. Robert felt a sudden chill. \"Are you telling me that you saw a flying saucer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ja. With dead bodies in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday, in the Swiss Alps, a NA TO weather balloon crashed. There were some experimental military objects aboard the balloon that are highly secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert tried hard to sound calm. \"Mr Beckerman, are you certain that what you saw was a flying saucer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. What they call a UFO.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there were dead people inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not people, no. Creatures. It is hard to describe them.\" He gave a little shiver. \"They were very small with big, strange eyes. They were dressed in suits of a silver metallic colour. It was very frightening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert listened, his mind in a turmoil. \"Did your passengers see this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.y\u0027a. We all saw it. I stopped there for maybe fifteen minutes. They wanted me to stay longer, but the company is very strict about schedules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert knew the question was futile before he even asked it. \"Mr Beckerman, would you happen to know the names of any of your passengers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mister, I drive a bus. The .passengers buy a ticket in Zurich and we take a tour southwest to Interlaken and then northwest to Bern. They can either get off at Bern or return to Zurich. Nobody gives their names.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert said, desperately, \"There\u0027s no way you can identify any of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bus driver thought for a moment. \"Well, I can tell you there were no children on that trip. Just men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeckerman thought for a moment. \"No. That\u0027s not right. There was one woman, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrific. That really narrows it down, Robert thought. Next question: Why the hell did I ever agree to this assignment? \"What you\u0027re saying, Mr Beckerman, is that a group of tourists boarded your bus at Zurich, and then when the tour was over, they simply scattered?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, Mr Smith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo there was not even a haystack. \"Do you remember anything at all about the passengers? Anything they said or did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeckerman shook his head. \"Mister, you get so you don\u0027t pay no attention to them. Unless they cause some trouble. Like that German.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert sat very still. He asked softly, \"What German?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Affenarsch! All the other passengers were excited about seeing the UFO and those dead creatures in it, but this old man kept complaining about how we had to hurry up to get to Bern because he had to prepare some lecture for the University in the morning ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA beginning. \"Do you remember anything else about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was wearing a black overcoat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. \"Mr Beckerman, I want to ask you for a favour. Would you mind driving out with me to Uetendorf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my day off. I am busy with ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be glad to pay you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ja?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hundred marks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make it four hundred marks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeckerman thought for a moment. \"Why not? It\u0027s a nice day for a drive, nicht?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed south, past the picturesque villages of Immensee and Meggen and through Luzern. The scenery was breathtakingly beautiful, but Robert had other things on his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed through Sarnen, and Briinig, the pass leading to Interlaken. They sped past Leissigen and Faulensee with its lovely blue lake dotted with white sailboats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much further is it?\" Robert asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon,\" Hans Beckerman promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been driving for almost an hour when they came to Spiez. Hans Beckerman said, \"It is not far now. Just past the next town, Thun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert felt his heart beginning to beat faster. He was about to witness something that was far beyond imagination, alien visitors from the stars. They drove through Thun, and a few minutes later, as they neared a grove of trees across the highway, Hans Beckerman pointed and said, \"There!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert braked to a stop and pulled over to the side of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Across the highway. Behind those trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert felt a growing sense of excitement. \"Right. Let\u0027s have a look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA truck was speeding by. When it had passed, Robert and Hans Beckerman crossed the road. Robert followed the bus driver up a small incline, into the stand of trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highway was completely hidden from sight. As they stepped into a clearing, Beckerman announced, \"It is right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying on the ground in front of them were the torn remains of a weather balloon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-8.html","bookId":2363,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM"}
