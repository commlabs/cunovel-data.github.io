{"id":44701,"no":35,"title":"7th April","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mercy! Isn\u0027t New York big? Worcester is nothing to it. Do you\n\u003cbr\u003e mean to tell me that you actually live in all that confusion? \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t believe that I shall recover for months from the bewildering\n\u003cbr\u003e effect of two days of it. I can\u0027t begin to tell you all the amazing\n\u003cbr\u003e things I\u0027ve seen; I suppose you know, though, since you live\n\u003cbr\u003e there yourself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But aren\u0027t the streets entertaining? And the people? And the shops? \n\u003cbr\u003e I never saw such lovely things as there are in the windows. \n\u003cbr\u003e It makes you want to devote your life to wearing clothes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie and Julia and I went shopping together Saturday morning. \n\u003cbr\u003e Julia went into the very most gorgeous place I ever saw, white and\n\u003cbr\u003e gold walls and blue carpets and blue silk curtains and gilt chairs. \n\u003cbr\u003e A perfectly beautiful lady with yellow hair and a long black silk\n\u003cbr\u003e trailing gown came to meet us with a welcoming smile. I thought we\n\u003cbr\u003e were paying a social call, and started to shake hands, but it seems\n\u003cbr\u003e we were only buying hats--at least Julia was. She sat down in front\n\u003cbr\u003e of a mirror and tried on a dozen, each lovelier than the last,\n\u003cbr\u003e and bought the two loveliest of all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I can\u0027t imagine any joy in life greater than sitting down in front\n\u003cbr\u003e of a mirror and buying any hat you choose without having first\n\u003cbr\u003e to consider the price! There\u0027s no doubt about it, Daddy; New York\n\u003cbr\u003e would rapidly undermine this fine stoical character which the John\n\u003cbr\u003e Grier Home so patiently built up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And after we\u0027d finished our shopping, we met Master Jervie\n\u003cbr\u003e at Sherry\u0027s. I suppose you\u0027ve been in Sherry\u0027s? Picture that,\n\u003cbr\u003e then picture the dining-room of the John Grier Home with its\n\u003cbr\u003e oilcloth-covered tables, and white crockery that you CAN\u0027T break,\n\u003cbr\u003e and wooden-handled knives and forks; and fancy the way I felt!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I ate my fish with the wrong fork, but the waiter very kindly gave\n\u003cbr\u003e me another so that nobody noticed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And after luncheon we went to the theatre--it was dazzling,\n\u003cbr\u003e marvellous, unbelievable--I dream about it every night.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Isn\u0027t Shakespeare wonderful?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hamlet is so much better on the stage than when we analyze it in class;\n\u003cbr\u003e I appreciated it before, but now, clear me!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I think, if you don\u0027t mind, that I\u0027d rather be an actress than\n\u003cbr\u003e a writer. Wouldn\u0027t you like me to leave college and go into a\n\u003cbr\u003e dramatic school? And then I\u0027ll send you a box for all my performances,\n\u003cbr\u003e and smile at you across the footlights. Only wear a red rose\n\u003cbr\u003e in your buttonhole, please, so I\u0027ll surely smile at the right man. \n\u003cbr\u003e It would be an awfully embarrassing mistake if I picked out the wrong one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We came back Saturday night and had our dinner in the train,\n\u003cbr\u003e at little tables with pink lamps and negro waiters. I never heard\n\u003cbr\u003e of meals being served in trains before, and I inadvertently said so.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Where on earth were you brought up?\u0027 said Julia to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `In a village,\u0027 said I meekly, to Julia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `But didn\u0027t you ever travel?\u0027 said she to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e `Not till I came to college, and then it was only a hundred\n\u003cbr\u003e and sixty miles and we didn\u0027t eat,\u0027 said I to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She\u0027s getting quite interested in me, because I say such funny things. \n\u003cbr\u003e I try hard not to, but they do pop out when I\u0027m surprised--\n\u003cbr\u003e and I\u0027m surprised most of the time. It\u0027s a dizzying experience,\n\u003cbr\u003e Daddy, to pass eighteen years in the John Grier Home, and then\n\u003cbr\u003e suddenly to be plunged into the WORLD.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But I\u0027m getting acclimated. I don\u0027t make such awful mistakes as I did;\n\u003cbr\u003e and I don\u0027t feel uncomfortable any more with the other girls. I used\n\u003cbr\u003e to squirm whenever people looked at me. I felt as though they saw\n\u003cbr\u003e right through my sham new clothes to the checked ginghams underneath. \n\u003cbr\u003e But I\u0027m not letting the ginghams bother me any more. Sufficient unto\n\u003cbr\u003e yesterday is the evil thereof.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I forgot to tell you about our flowers. Master Jervie gave us each\n\u003cbr\u003e a big bunch of violets and lilies-of-the-valley. Wasn\u0027t that sweet\n\u003cbr\u003e of him? I never used to care much for men--judging by Trustees--\n\u003cbr\u003e but I\u0027m changing my mind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eleven pages--this is a letter! Have courage. I\u0027m going to stop.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours always,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59757.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
