To the three women who fussed over a photo album near the copy machines. To the Hispanic man wearing a shirt identical to the one he wore who was operating a printer behind him. He slid his hand across the counter to Jace’s hand. She welcomed it; their fingers curled and twisted into a tight knot—a knot they did not untie even when they saw me approaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first thought—something had shifted in their relationship. They weren’t hiding anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy second was more paternal. Why wasn’t Jace in school?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why aren’t you in school?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seniors get to leave campus if they want, and I had a free period.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re spending it here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to visit my boyfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither Jace nor Tapia looked to see if anyone heard, but I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What am I missing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing, we just decided not to keep our love a secret any longer,” Jace said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” said Tapia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” Jace repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” I said. It was my turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it wasn’t just our decision,” Jace said. “My dad said—This morning he told me if I liked R.T. I should date him. Openly. Just don’t sneak around. ‘No one likes a sneak,’ he said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs hard as I tried, and with as much reason as I had, it was difficult to dislike the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ ’Course, he still wants me to go to college.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So do I,” Tapia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And leave you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is important to get a good education if you are to become wealthy and keep me in the style to which I want to become accustomed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You love me for my money?” asked Jace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why else?” said Tapia before he kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t mind me, kids,” I said. “I’m just standing here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What can I do for you, Mr. McKenzie?” asked Tapia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Se?or Tapia,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sí.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Last Friday night, during your anniversary celebration, did you happen to keep a guest book?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sí.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That you encouraged people to sign?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“May I see it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think the person who sent the e-mail is in the book?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The e-mail was sent at 6:57 P.M. You said that you closed down at about five so you could throw a party for your regular customers. That means one of those people sent the e-mail. I’m just hoping that they signed the guest register.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you know who just by looking at the name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll get the book.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gracias.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re still looking for that person who sent the e-mail, the one R.T. told me about,” Jace said while Tapia slipped into his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I take it you two tell each other everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have no secrets, if that’s what you mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should we have secrets?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wouldn’t be the first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t want to live like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t blame her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTapia returned, carrying a leather-bound book with a spiral binding. “I want to thank you for breaking Brian Reif’s hand,” he said as he gave me the book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was my pleasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began flipping pages slowly. I was looking for a name, any name that I might recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Breaking his hand isn’t going to make him any less of a racist,” Jace told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t break it because he was a racist. I broke it because he was a stupid racist. It was the stupid part that got him hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are a lot of stupid racists here,” Jace said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes it feels that way,” Tapia said. “But I’m not so sure. That group of Reif’s, the Nicholas County Coalition for Immigration Reduction he calls it—it has only a dozen members. There are many more people like Mr. Axelrod than Reif.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a good town,” Jace said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it is a good town,” Tapia agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found Tapia’s eyes. He was looking at Jace so I looked at her, too. For stony limits cannot hold love out; And what love can do, that dares love attempt, Shakespeare wrote. Reif didn’t live in the same world as these two kids. When all was said and done, I suppose I didn’t, either. What a pity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to the book, studying each signature. Many were illegible, but then my handwriting wasn’t so hot, either. Tapia took care of his customers while I studied the book, first the women, then the older man. His employee dropped a carton on top of the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want me to take these across the street?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTapia told him he’d take care of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These are nice,” Jace said. The box was sealed, but a single printed sheet was taped to the top—the zodiac place mats meant for the Rainbow Cafe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went through the entire book, then started again. It was a long shot—worse than a long shot. It was impossible. Still, I kept at it until I discovered a name that I recognized, one that I had missed before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Troy Donovan.” I’ll be a sonuvabitch! “Troy Donovan was here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. Donovan?” said Tapia. “Yes, he was. Do you know him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We spoke last Monday. How do you know him? Why was he here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re partners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Partners?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. We have been for over a year.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3/page-76.html","bookId":2223,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:55 PM"}
