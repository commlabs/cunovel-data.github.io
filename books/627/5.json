The overcoat weighed thirty-five pounds. The red part weighed fifteen pounds, the blue part weighed fifteen pounds, and the hood weighed five pounds. Her eyelashes weighed a pound and a half.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She sat next to the window in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. She spent a lot of time just staring out the window. Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027t mind. Mrs. Jewls said that a lot of people learn best when they stare out a window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sharie often fell asleep in class. Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027tmind that, either.\n\u003cbr\u003e 17She said that a lot of people do their best learning when they are asleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e Sharie spent all of her time either looking out the window or sleeping. Mrs. Jewls thought she was the best student in the class.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One afternoon it was very hot. All of the windows were open, yet Sharie still wore her red and blue overcoat. The heat made her very tired. Mrs. Jewls was teaching arithmetic. Sharie pulled the hood up over her face, buried herself in the coat, and went to sleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Jewls,\" said Kathy, \"Sharie is asleep.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s good,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"She must be learning something.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls continued with the lesson.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sharie began to snore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mrs. Jewls, Sharie is snoring,\" said Kathy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I can hear her,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"She must be learning an awful lot today. I wish the rest of you could be like her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sharie began to toss and turn. She flopped over on top of her desk, and then rolled over on top of Kathy\u0027s desk. Then she rolled back the other way. Kathy screamed. Sharie rolled out the window. She was still sound asleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As you know, Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class was on the thirtieth story of Wayside School. So Sharie had a long way to go.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After she had fallen ten stories, Sharie woke up. She looked around. She was confused. She wasn\u0027t in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class, and she wasn\u0027t at home in bed. She couldn\u0027t figure out where she was.\n\u003cbr\u003e 18She yawned, pulled the hood back over her eyes, and went back to sleep. By that time she had fallen another ten stories.\n\u003cbr\u003e Wayside School had an exceptionally large playground. Louis, the yard teacher, was way over on the other side of it when he happened to see Sharie fall out the window. He ducked under the volleyball net, hurtled past the kickball field, hopped over the hopscotch court, climbed through the monkey bars, sped across the grass, and caught Sharie just before she hit the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The people in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class cheered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sharie woke up in Louis\u0027s arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Darn it, Louis,\" she said. \"What did you go and wake me up for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry, Sharie,\" said Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry,\" Sharie repeated. \"Is that all you can say? I was having a wonderful dream until you woke me up. You\u0027re always bothering me, Louis. I can\u0027t stand it.\" She laughed and hugged him around the neck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis carried her back up thirty flights of stairs to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That evening, when Sharie went to bed, she was unable to fall asleep. She just wasn\u0027t tired.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1988/56811.html","bookId":627,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:48:40 AM"}
