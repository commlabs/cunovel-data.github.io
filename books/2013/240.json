In the faith that a revelation on the meaning of time will unlock my own hidden history. I would find its true measure, Taralack Veed. And not just its measure, but its very nature. Consider this canal, and those linked to it. The water is pushed by current and tide from the river, then traverses the city, only to rejoin the river not far from where it first entered. We may seek to step out from the river and so choose our own path, but no matter how straight it seems, we will, in the end, return to that river.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As with the bells, then,’ the Gral said, ‘water tracks the passage of time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You misunderstand,’ Icarium replied, but did not elaborate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed scowled, paused to spit thick phlegm onto his palms, then swept it back through his hair. Somewhere in the crowd a woman screamed, but the sound was not repeated. ‘The canal’s current cannot change the law that binds its direction. The canal is but a detour.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, one that slows the passage of its water. And in turn that water changes, gathering the refuse of the city it passes through, and so, upon returning to the river, it is a different colour. Muddier, more befouled.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The slower your path, the muddier your boots?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Even so,’ Icarium said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Time is nothing like that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are you so certain? When we must wait, our minds fill with sludge, random thoughts like so much refuse. When we are driven to action, our current is swift, the water seemingly clear, cold and sharp.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’d rather, Icarium, we wait a long time. Here, in the face of what is to come.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The path to Rhulad? As you like. But I tell you, Taralack Veed, that is not the path I am walking.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother half-dozen strides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the Gral spoke. ‘They wrap the cord around them, Icarium, to keep them from breaking.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenior Assessor’s eyes glittered as he stood amidst a crowd twenty paces from where Icarium and Taralack Veed had paused in front of a potter’s stall. His hands were folded together, the fingers twitching. His breathing was rapid and shallow;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, Samar Dev rolled her eyes, then asked, ‘Are you about to fall dead on me? If I’d known this walk involved skulking in that Jhag’s shadow, I think I would have stayed in the compound.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The choices you make,’ he replied, ‘must needs be entirely of your own accord, Samar Dev. Reasonably distinct from mine or anyone else’s. It is said that the history of human conflict resides exclusively in the clash of expectations.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is it now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Furthermore-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never mind your “furthermore”, Senior Assessor. Compromise is the negotiation of expectation. With your wayward notions we do not negotiate, and so all the compromising is mine.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As you choose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about hitting him, decided she didn’t want to make a scene. What was it with men and their obsessions? ‘He is in all likelihood going to die, and soon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I think not. No, most certainly I think not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium and the Gral resumed their meander through the crowds, and after a moment Senior Assessor followed, maintaining his distance. Sighing, Samar Dev set off after him. She didn’t like this mob. It felt wrong. Tense, overwrought. Strain was visible on faces, and the cries of the hawkers sounded strident and half desperate. Few passers-by, she noted, were buying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Something’s wrong,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There is nothing here that cannot be explained by impending financial panic, Samar Dev. Although you may believe I am unaware of anything but him, I assure you that I have assessed the condition of Letheras and, by extension, this entire empire. A crisis looms. Wealth, alas, is not an infinite commodity. Systems such as this are dependent upon the assumption of unlimited resources, however. These resources range from cheap labour and materials to an insatiable demand. Such demand, in turn, depends on rather more ethereal virtues, such as confidence, will, perceived need and the bliss of short-term thinking, any one of which is vulnerable to mysterious and often inexplicable influences. We are witness, here, to the effects of a complex collusion of factors which are serving to undermine said virtues. Furthermore, it is my belief that the situation has been orchestrated.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind had begun to drift with Senior Assessor’s diatribe, but this last observation drew her round. ‘Letheras is under economic assault?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well put, Samar Dev. Someone is manipulating the situation to achieve a cascading collapse, yes. Such is my humble assessment.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-240.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
