Guybon frowned. \"Her Majesty took most of the Kinswomen with her, the strongest ones at least. She left four with enough power to make a gateway together, but—the attack—an assassin killed two of them before the other two could stop him. Alone, the two aren’t strong enough to send for help. They’re using their strength to Heal\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood and bloody ashes\", Talmanes said, though he felt a stab of hope as he said it. Perhaps these women could not make a gateway, but they might be able to Heal his wound. \"You should lead the refugees out of the city, Guybon. My men hold the southern gate\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent\", Guybon said, straightening. \"But you will have to lead the refugees. I must defend the Palace\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalmanes raised an eyebrow at him; he didn’t take orders from Guybon. The Band had its own command structure, and reported only to the Queen. Mat had made that clear when accepting the contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, Guybon didn’t take orders from Talmanes, either. Talmanes took a deep breath, but then wavered, dizzy. Melten grabbed his arm to keep him from toppling over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight, but it hurt. Couldn’t his side just do the decent thing and grow numb? Blood and bloody ashes. He needed to get to those Kinswomen. Talmanes said hopefully, \"Those two women who can Heal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have sent for them already\", Guybon said. \"As soon as we saw this force here\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that was something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do mean to stay here\", Guybon warned. \"I wont abandon this post\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? The city is lost, man!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Queen ordered us to send regular reports through gateways\", Guybon said. \"Eventually, she’s going to wonder why we haven’t sent a messenger. She will send a channeler to see why we haven’t reported, and that messenger will arrive at the Palace’s Traveling ground. It—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord!\" a voice called. \"My Lord Talmanes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuybon cut off, and Talmanes turned to find Filger—one of the scouts—scrambling up the bloodied cobbles of the hillside toward him. Filger was a lean man with thinning hair and a couple of days’ worth of scruff, and the sight of him filled Talmanes with dread. Filger was one of those they’d left guarding the city gate below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Lord\", Filger said, panting, \"the Trollocs have taken the city walls. They’re packing the ramparts, loosing arrows or spears at anyone who draws too close. Lieutenant Sandip sent me to bring you word\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blood and ashes! What of the gate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We’re holding\", Filger said. \"For now\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guybon\", Talmanes said, turning back. \"Show some mercy, man; someone needs to defend that gate. Please, take the refugees out and reinforce my men. That gate will be our only method of retreat from the city\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the Queen’s messenger—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Queen will figure out what bloody happened once she thinks to look here. Look about you! Trying to defend the Palace is madness. You don’t have a city any longer, but a pyre\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuybon’s face was conflicted, his lips a tight line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I’m right\", Talmanes said, his face twisted in pain. \"The best thing you can do is reinforce my men at the southern gate to hold it open for as many refugees as can reach it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps\", Guybon said. \"But to let the Palace burn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can make it worth something\", Talmanes said. \"What if you left some soldiers to fight at the Palace? Have them hold off the Trollocs as long as they can. That will draw the Trollocs away from the people escaping out this way. When they can hold no longer, your soldiers can escape the Palace grounds on the far side, and make their way around to the southern gate\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A good plan\", Guybon said, grudgingly. \"I will do as you suggest, but what of you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to get to the dragons\", Talmanes said. \"We cant let them fall to the Shadow. They’re in a warehouse near the edge of the Inner City. The Queen wanted them kept out of sight, away from the mercenary bands outside. I have to find them. If possible, retrieve them. If not, destroy them\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well\", Guybon said, turning away, looking frustrated as he accepted the inevitable. \"My men will do as you suggest; half will lead the refugees out, then help your soldiers hold the southern gate. The other half will hold the Palace a little longer, then withdraw. But I’m coming with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we really need so many lamps in here?\" the Aes Sedai demanded from her stool at the back of the room. It might as well have been a throne. \"Think of the oil you’re wasting\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need the lamps\". Androl grunted. Night rain pelted the window, but he ignored it, trying to focus on the leather he was sewing. It would be a saddle. At the moment, he was working on the girth that would go around the horse’s belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poked holes into the leather in a double row, letting the work calm him. The stitching chisel he used made diamond-shaped holes—he could use the mallet on them for speed, if he wanted, but right now he liked the feel of pressing the holes without it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up his stitch-mark wheel, measuring off the locations for the next stitches, then worked another of the holes. You had to line the flat sides of the diamonds toward one another for holes like this, so that when the leather pulled, it didn’t pull on the flats. The neat stiches would help keep the saddle in good shape over the years. The rows needed to be close enough together to reinforce one another, but not so close that there was danger of them ripping into one another. Staggering the holes helped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle things. You just had to make sure the little things were done right, and—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers slipped, and he punched a hole with the diamond pointing the wrong way. Two of the holes ripped into one another at the motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nearly tossed the entire thing across the room in frustration. That was the fifth time tonight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight, he thought, pressing his hands on the table. What’s happened to my self-control?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could answer that question with ease, unfortunately. The Black Tower is what happened. He felt like a multilegged nachi trapped in a dried-up tidal pool, waiting desperately for the water to return while watching a group of children work their way down the beach with buckets, gathering up anythin \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-14.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
