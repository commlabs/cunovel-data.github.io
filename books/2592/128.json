It took a moment to grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turned around I saw scrawled across the giant photomural of the deserted skate park, in massive red lettering:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eD I ss a pE AR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE r e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathed in but did not start panicking immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t panicking because something on the floor caught my eye and momentarily replaced the panic with curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was sitting next to the open door, off to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I neared it I thought I was looking at a large bowl made from chewed-up newspaper scraps (it was) that someone had placed two black rocks in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assumed it was an art project of some kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the black stones were wet. They were glistening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as I stood above the bowl, looking down into it, I realized what it actually was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a nest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the nest the black oval objects were not stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew immediately what they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were eggs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another nest next to the closet door. (And another one was later found in the guest room.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flashed on something Miller had warned me about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller had said that fumigation was necessary so nothing living would be left in the house once the cleansing began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was why the house had to be fumigated: the spirits, the demons, would try to find anything living to enter so they could “continue their existence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA question: What if a doll had hidden itself and waited?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if the Terby had hidden itself in the house?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it had survived the exterminators?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if something else had entered it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe connection between the doll and the nests was sane and immediate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember rushing out of the room and tumbling down the staircase, gripping the railing so I wouldn’t fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I hit the foyer I started dialing Robby’s number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I don’t remember this exactly, but as I waited to leave a message, I think that was when I noticed Victor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of Victor, again I didn’t leave a message for Robby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(But if I had called a third time—as any number of people did later—I would have been told that the cell phone had been deactivated.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor was lying in a fetal position, shivering, on the marble floor of the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grinning dog that had excitedly loped toward me minutes ago did not exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was whimpering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he heard me approach he looked up with sad, glassy eyes and continued to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Victor?” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog licked my hand as I crouched down to soothe him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of his tongue lapping the dry skin of my hand was suddenly overtaken by wet noises coming from behind the dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor vomited without lifting his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly stood upright and walked around to his backside, where the wet noises were coming from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I lifted the dog’s tail I tried leaping out of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog’s anus was stretched into a diameter that was perhaps ten inches across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom half of the Terby was hanging out of the dog and slowly disappearing into the cavity, undulating itself so it could slide in with more ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember instinctively reaching forward as the talons of the doll disappeared, causing the dog’s body to bulge and then settle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor quietly vomited again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything stayed still for one brief moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the dog began convulsing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was already slowly backing away from the dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut as I did this, Victor—or something else—noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head suddenly jerked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the dog was blocking the front door and I did not want to step over it I had started moving back up the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was moving deliberately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pretending to be invisible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictor’s whimpering had suddenly morphed into snarling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped moving, hoping this might calm Victor down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was taking deep breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog, still curled on the marble floor of the foyer, began foaming at the mouth. Foam, in fact, was simply pouring out of his mouth in a continuous stream. It was yellow at first, the color of bile, and then the foam darkened into red, and there were feathers in it as the foam continued pouring out. And then the foam became black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point I remember running up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in what seemed like an instant, something—it was Victor’s jaw—had clamped itself around my upper thigh as I was midway up the curving staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an immediate pressure, and a searing pain and then wetness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell onto the stairs face-first, shouting out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned over onto my side to kick the dog away, but he had already backed off. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-128.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
