What\u0027s in that basket?\" \"Some provisions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m Marie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI live in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m able to get extra food and I bring some for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor Mademoiselle.\" \"Ah,\" said Stephanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eguests.\" There was a rustling sound, and Dieter guessed Stephanie was looking through the paper-wrapped food in the basket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is wonderful!

thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, then,\" said Marie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know about Auntie\u0027s secret life, yes.\" Hearing her say \"Auntie,\" Dieter realized that neither he nor Stephanie had ever asked Mademoiselle Lernas\u0027s first name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pretense would be over if Marie found out that Stephanie did not even know the name of her \"aunt.\" \"Where is she?\" \"She went to Aix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you remember Charles Men- ton, who used to be dean at the cathedral?\" \"No, I don\u0027t.\" \"Perhaps you\u0027re too young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was the best friend of Auntie\u0027s father, until he retired and went to live in Provence.\" Stephane was improvising brilliantly, Dieter thought with admiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had cool nerves and she was imaginative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has suffered a heart attack, and she has gone to nurse him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe asked me to take care of any guests while she\u0027s away.\" \"When will she come back?\" \"Charles is not expected to live long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the war may be over soon.\" \"She didn\u0027t tell anyone about this Charles.\" \"She told me.\" It looked as if Stephanie might get away with it, Dieter thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she could keep this up a little longer, Marie would go away convinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would report what had happened, to someone or other, but Stephanie\u0027s story was plausible, and exactly the kind of thing that happened in Resistance movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not like the army: someone like Mademoiselle Lemas could easily make a unilateral decision to leave her post and put someone else in charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt drove Resistance leaders mad, but there was nothing they could do: all their troops were volunteers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to feel hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you from?\" said Marie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I live in Paris.\" \"Does your aunt Valerie have any other nieces hidden away?\" So, Dieter thought, Mademoiselle Lemas\u0027s name is Valerie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so-none that I know.\" \"You\u0027re a liar.\" Marie\u0027s tone had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething had gone wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter sighed and drew the automatic pistol from beneath his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie said, \"What on earth are you talking about?\" \"You\u0027re lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t even know her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not Valerie, it\u0027s Jeanne.\" Dieter thumbed the safety lever on the left of the slide up to the fire position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie carried on gamely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always call her Auntie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re being very rude.\" Marie said scornfully, \"I knew from the start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeanne would never trust someone like you, with your high heels and perfume.\" Dieter stepped into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a shame, Marie,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you had been more trusting, or less clever, you might have got away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it is, you\u0027re under arrest.\" Marie looked at Stephanie and said, \"You\u0027re a Gestapo whore.\" It was a wounding gibe, and Stephanie blushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter was so infuriated that he almost pistol- whipped Marie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll regret that remark when you\u0027re in the hands of the Gestapo,\" he said coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a man called Sergeant Becker who is going to question you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0027re screaming and bleeding and begging for mercy, remember that careless insult.\" Marie looked poised to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter almost hoped she would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he could shoot her and the problem would be solved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she did not run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment, her shoulders slumped and she began to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tears did not move him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lie facedown on the floor with your hands behind your back.\" She obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put away the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I saw a rope in the cellar,\" he said to Stephanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get it.\" She returned with a length of washing line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter tied Marie\u0027s hands and feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to take her to Sainte-Cecile,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t have her here in case a British agent comes in today.\" He looked at his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was two o\u0027clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had time to take her to the chateau and be back by three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to go to the crypt on your own,\" he told Stephanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use the little car in the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be in the cathedral, though you may not see me.\" He kissed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost like a husband going to the office, he thought with grim amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked Marie up and slung her over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to hurry,\" he said, and went to the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped outside, then turned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hide the bicycle.\" \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Stephanie replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carried the bound girl through the courtyard and into the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the trunk of his car and put her inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad it not been for the \"whore\" comment, he would have put her on the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed the lid and looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw no one, but there were always watchers in a street such as this, peering through their shutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would have seen Mademoiselle Lemas being taken away yesterday and would have remarked the big sky-blue car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he drove away, they would be talking about the man who had put a girl into the trunk of his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn normal times, they would have called the police, but no one in occupied territory would talk to the police unless they had to, especially where the Gestapo might be involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key question for Dieter was: Would the Resistance hear of the arrest of Mademoiselle Lemas? Reims was a city, not a village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were arrested every day: thieves, murderers, smugglers, black marketeers, communists, Jews.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a good chance that no report of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe events in the rue du Bois would reach the ears of Michel Clairet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no guarantee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDieter got into the car and headed for Sainte-Cecile. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-18.html","bookId":2681,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM"}
