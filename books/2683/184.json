Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon reads from a page in his folder. \"Jamie Fields, Bobby Hughes, Tammy Devol, Bentley Harrolds, Bruce Rhinebeck-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cut him off. \"Bruce Rhinebeck is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA professional silence.

I\u0027d know if he was staying in the house.\" I\u0027m realizing at the instant I say this that I probably would not know, that it would be easy not to know if Bertrand Ripleis was living in the house in the 5th or the 16th with us, because of how vast it is and how it keeps changing and how it seems new rooms are being built every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon leans in and hands me a photograph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this Bertrand Ripleis?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could be an Armani ad shot by Herb Ritts-a desert landscape, Bertrand\u0027s handsome face scowling seductively, jaw clenched and lips casually pursed, small sunglasses giving off a skull effect. But he\u0027s exiting a van, he doesn\u0027t realize this picture is being shot from a vantage point far away, he\u0027s holding a Skorpion machine pistol, he\u0027s wearing a Tommy Hilfiger T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s him,\" I say blankly, handing Palakon back the photo. \"But he doesn\u0027t live in the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anyone in the house have contact with Bertrand Ripleis?\" Crater asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say. \"I think they all do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you, Mr. Ward?\" Palakon asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes...

I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScribbling, a long silence, more scribbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance over at the Japanese man, staring at me, motionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon leans in and hands over another photo, startling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a head shot of Sam Ho, with Asian script running along the bottom of the photograph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you recognize this person?\" Palakon asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s Sam Ho,\" I say, starting to cry. My head drops forward and I\u0027m looking at my feet, convulsing, gasping out sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePapers are shuffled, extraneous sound caused by embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take in a deep breath and try to pull myself together, but after I say \"Bruce Rhinebeck and Bobby Hughes tortured and killed him in London a month ago\" I start crying again. At least a minute passes before the crying subsides. I swallow, clearing my throat. Russell leans over, offers a Kleenex. I blow my nose, mumble, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, Mr. Ward, we don\u0027t like to see you this distraught,\" Palakon says. \"Are you okay?

In the background people set up lights, hold plates of food, seem posed, talk guardedly into cell phones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah, that\u0027s him too,\" I say, blowing my nose again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrater, Delta and Palakon all share contemplative glances, then fix their attention back on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m staring over at the Japanese man when Palakon says, \"This picture of Sam Ho was taken in Miami.\" He pauses. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-184.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
