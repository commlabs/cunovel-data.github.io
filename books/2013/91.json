The sword in his right hand, point resting on the dais, was trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in an alcove to one side, Nisall wanted to hurry forward, reaching out for the beleaguered, frightened Edur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Triban Gnol stood facing the throne. This audience belonged to him and him alone; nor would the Chancellor countenance any interruption from her. He clearly detested her very presence, but on that detail Rhulad had insisted-Nisall’s only victory thus far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Highness, I agree with you. Your father, alas, insisted I convey to you his wishes. He would greet his most cherished son. Further, he brings dire news-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘His favourite kind,’ Rhulad muttered, eyes flickering as if he was seeking an escape from the chamber. ‘Cherished? His word? No, I thought not. What he cherishes is my power-he wants it for himself. Him and Binadas-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Forgive my interruption, Highness,’ Triban Gnol said, bowing his head. ‘There is news of Binadas.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor flinched. Licked dry lips. ‘What has happened?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is now known,’ the Chancellor replied, ‘that Binadas was murdered. He was commanding a section of the fleet. There was a battle with an unknown enemy. Terrible sorcery was exchanged, and the remnants of both fleets were plunged into the Nascent, there to complete their battle in that flooded realm. Yet, this was all prelude. After the remaining enemy ships fled, a demon came upon Binadas’s ship. Such was its ferocity that all the Edur were slaughtered. Binadas himself was pinned to his chair by a spear flung by that demon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How,’ Rhulad croaked, ‘how is all this known?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your father… dreamed. In that dream he found himself a silent, ghostly witness, drawn there as if by the caprice of a malevolent god.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What of that demon? Does it still haunt the Nascent? I shall hunt it down, I shall destroy it. Yes, there must be vengeance. He was my brother. I sent him, my brother, sent him. They all die by my word. All of them, and this is what my father will tell me-oh how he hungers for that moment, but he shall not have it! The demon, yes, the demon who stalks my kin…’ His fevered ramble trickled away, and so ravaged was Rhulad’s face that Nisall had to look away, lest she cry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Highness,’ the Chancellor said in a quiet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNisall stiffened-this was what Triban Gnol was working towards-all that had come before was for this precise moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Highness, the demon has been delivered. It is here, Emperor.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhulad seemed to shrink back into himself. He said nothing, though his mouth worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A challenger,’ Triban Gnol continued. ‘Tarthenal blood, yet purer, Hanradi Khalag claims, than any Tarthenal of this continent. Tomad knew him for what he was the moment the giant warrior took his first step onto Edur bloodwood. Knew him, yet could not face him, for Binadas’s soul is in the Tarthenal’s shadow-along with a thousand other fell victims. They clamour, one and all, for both freedom and vengeance. Highness, the truth must now be clear to you. Your god has delivered him. To you, so that you may slay him, so that you may avenge your brother’s death.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes,’ Rhulad whispered. ‘He laughs-oh, how he laughs. Binadas, are you close? Close to me now? Do you yearn for freedom? Well, if I cannot have it, why should you? No, there is no hurry now, is there? You wanted this throne, and now you learn how it feels-just a hint, yes, of all that haunts me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Highness,’ the Chancellor murmured, ‘are you not eager to avenge Binadas? Tomad-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomad!’ Rhulad jolted on the throne, glared at Triban Gnol-who visibly rocked back. ‘He saw the demon slay Binadas, and now he thinks it will do the same to me! That is the desire for vengeance at work here, you fish-skinned fool! Tomad wants me to die because I killed Binadas! And Trull! I have killed his children! But whose blood burns in my veins? Whose? Where is Hanradi? Oh, I know why he will not be found in the outer room-he goes to Hannan Mosag! They plunge into Darkness and whisper of betrayal-I am past my patience with them!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTriban Gnol spread his hands. ‘Highness, I had intended to speak to you of this, but at another time-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of what? Out with it!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A humble inquiry from Invigilator Karos Invictad, Highness. With all respect, I assure you, he asks your will in regard to matters of treason-not among the Letherii, of course, for he has that well in hand-but among the Tiste Edur themselves…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNisall’s gasp echoed in the suddenly silent room. She looked across to where Edur guards were stationed, and saw them motionless as statues.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-91.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
