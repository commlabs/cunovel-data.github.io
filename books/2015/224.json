Olikea, too, turned around and swung her gaze right past me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is nothing there. A Great One goes into his tree, Likari. Nevare will not walk as a ghost. He left nothing unfinished.” He patted the boy reassuringly on the shoulder as he released him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I saw…something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It didn’t even look like Nevare, Likari. Don’t dwell on it, or try to see it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Great One should not have a ghost,” Olikea said with great concern. “Unless…could the tree have refused him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said you saw the roots enter him. You said that he moved with them as you sang him his memories.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did. They did!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then all should be well. If you wish, tomorrow I will visit his tree and speak to him, to be sure he has been well received. He should be at home there by now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you would, please,” Olikea said gratefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I will go with you,” Likari announced as he sat down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As his feeder, that is your right,” the Great Man confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Likari start to roll his eyes toward me. Jodoli raised an eyebrow at him. Likari lowered his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not a ghost!” I said incredulously. “Is this a joke? Have I offended all of you in some way? I don’t understand! I’m hungry. I need help!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped closer into their circle. None of them reacted. Likari might have hunched his shoulders a little tighter. I reached toward the skewer of meat that Jodoli held. It had been a bird; I seized the wing and tore it free. If he felt or saw me take it, his face did not show it. I devoured the salty, greasy meat, chewed the gristle off the end of the bone and threw that tiny piece into the fire. The flames spat as they tasted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the fire, Firada spoke to Olikea as if nothing were out of the ordinary. “So. What will you do now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What I have always done. I’ll live.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirada shook her head. “It was wrong of Kinrove to keep all that treasure. He should have given at least some of it back to you. You tended Nevare well. Now, except for the lodge and what it holds, you are right back to where you were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer sister sounded sympathetic but Olikea still bristled. “Perhaps the lodge holds more than you know. Perhaps it was not all of Lisana’s treasure that he threw at Kinrove’s feet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirada lifted one eyebrow. “Truly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlikea smiled small. “I said perhaps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirada made a small sound in her throat. “You have always known how to take care of yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve had to,” Olikea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a skin of water on the ground beside Jodoli’s couch. I picked it up and drank, but spat it out as hastily. The taste was familiar; the water was flavored with a bark that Olikea had often mixed with my water. It was an herb that amplified the magic. But now it made my gorge rise. I had no sooner dropped the skin than Jodoli picked it up. He drank thirstily, and then returned to tearing meat from the skewered bird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Olikea,” I begged suddenly. “Please. Please help me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stretched out on the moss beside Likari and closed her eyes. A tear trickled down her cheek. I groaned and turned away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left their fireside and walked down the hill. A woman had set aside a stack of hearth cakes to cool. I took three from the top of the stack and ate them. No one noticed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grew bolder in my efforts to make someone acknowledge me, and also to satisfy my needs. I took a man’s cup that he had just filled with hot soup and set aside to cool, drank it, and set it down in a different place. He merely scowled over his forgetfulness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hunger sated, I returned to Jodoli’s fire, in time to see Likari and Olikea settling for the night. The night was mild. Olikea spread out a blanket for both of them to share between the roots of a tree. They settled quickly and soon fell asleep. Olikea’s pack was nearby. Shamelessly, I ransacked it. When I saw that she had my winter cloak among her possessions, I boldly took it from her pack, shook it out, and put it on. It was too big for me. I lapped it around my body twice. My shoes were there, too. I put them on. They fell off. I dug into her pack again and found her knife and sewing tools. I crudely tightened the soft leather shoes to fit my feet and put them on. I cannot express the comfort of them; it was as if my body had forgotten how to keep itself warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I was warm and had a full belly, sleep suddenly demanded to be indulged. Habit made me look for a place beside Olikea. But she had wedged herself and Likari into the space between two tree roots, the better to trap their own warmth. There was no room for me there. I found a place near them, lay down, then sat up and moved several small branches. My body seemed very mindful of being poked and prodded. I looked at the ground and recalled how the magic would answer me and prompt the forest into providing a soft bed for me. I could recall that I had done it, but could not remember how I had even begun to do such a thing. There was not even the smallest trace of magic left in my body. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/renegade-s-magic-the-soldier-son-trilogy-3/page-224.html","bookId":2015,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM"}
