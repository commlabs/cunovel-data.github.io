Faith has nothing to do with feelings, or with impressions, with improbabilities, or with outward appearances. If we desire to couple them with faith, then we are no longer resting on the Word of God because faith needs nothing of the kind. Faith rests on the naked Word of God. When we take Him at His Word, the heart is at peace.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGod delights to exercise faith, first for blessing in our own souls, then for blessing in the Church at large, and also for those without. But this exercise we shrink from instead of welcoming. When trials come, we should say: \"My Heavenly Father puts this cup of trial into my hands, that I may have something sweet afterwards.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTrials are the food of faith. Oh, let us leave ourselves in the hands of our Heavenly Father! It is the joy of His heart to do good to all His children.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut trials and difficulties are not the only means by which faith is exercised and thereby increased. There is the reading of the Scriptures, that we may by them acquaint ourselves with God as He has revealed Himself in His Word.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAre you able to say, from the acquaintance you have made with God, that He is a lovely Being? If not, let me affectionately entreat you to ask God to bring you to this, that you may admire His gentleness and kindness, that you may be able to say how good He is, and what a delight it is to the heart of God to do good to His children.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow the nearer we come to this in our inmost souls, the more ready we are to leave ourselves in His hands, satisfied with all His dealings with us. And when trial comes, we shall say:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I will wait and see what good God will do to me by it, assured He will do it.\" Thus we shall bear an honorable testimony before the world, and thus we shall strengthen the hands of others. --George Mueller.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　 四月十五日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“我信靠你的话”（诗一百十九：42）。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　我们信神的话有多少，就是我们的信心有多少。信心与感觉，影像，可能性，眼见，和外面的表征都无关。如果我们把它们与信心并列，我们就是不信神的话；因为信心用不着这种东西。信心单信神的话。当我们凭他的话抓住他的时候我们的心就得到了安息。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　神乐意锻炼我们的信心，为着我们个人的益处，教会的益处，世人的益处。但是这种锻炼，我们非但不欢迎，反常躲避。当试炼临到我们的时候，我们应当这样说：“我的天父把这试炼的杯放在我手中，为要叫我将来享受甘甜”。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　试炼是信心的粮食。让我们把我们自己交在我们天父的手中吧！因为他乐意赐好处给他的孩子。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　不只试炼和困难能锻炼，加增我们的信心；读经亦然。读经使我们熟识神，与神成为至交，因为神在圣经中显露，启示他的自己。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　你能否说，神是可爱的神呢？如果你还不能，让我用挚诚的心来劝你赶快求神给你养成读经的嗜好来，好使你知道他的温柔，仁爱；好使你能说：神是多好！神的心何等欢喜善待他的儿女！\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　我们越进入这种地步，我们越愿意把我们自己交托在神手中，越满意他对于我们的一切处置。这样，当试炼来到的时候，我们就会这样说：\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“我要等待看神这一次将要给我什么好处。无论如何，他必定叫我得益。”如此，我们就能在世人面前作美好的见证，同时也能坚固别的信徒的信心。——莫勒\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5041.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:41:35 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:41:35 AM"}
