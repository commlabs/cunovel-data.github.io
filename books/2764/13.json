My dancing better than my English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peer around him and take a peek at Avi, who is still dancing with his blond bimbo. Grabbing the guy\u0027s hand, I lead him to the middle of the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve taken classes at Julie\u0027s Dance Studio since I was four years old, so I\u0027m not afraid to let loose. Listen, I wouldn\u0027t choose this guy to dance with, but at this point I can\u0027t be picky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I listen to the music, I pretend I\u0027m dancing with my boyfriend. When the guy puts his hands around my waist, I want to think it\u0027s Mitch\u0027s hands holding me against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes. The only problem is that in my imagination they\u0027re not Mitch\u0027s hands. They\u0027re Avis. The guy I hate is haunting pure thoughts of me and my boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait a minute. I think the guy I\u0027m dancing with is feeling my back as if he\u0027s trying to locate the clasp on my bra. I open my eyes and whip around to face the perv. Lucky for me my bra fastens in the front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop dancing. The perv leans forward to talk to me-- it\u0027s too loud to hear unless the person is screaming in your ear. I think he\u0027s about to apologize, until I feel this slimy wet thing trying to climb into my ear canal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell is that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I realize Uncool Guy is trying to turn me on by sliding his Gene Simmons tongue around my ear and trying to shove it down my ear canal, I shriek and push him back. Anything to get his tongue as far away from my ear as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, I\u0027ve pushed him into some other people who were dancing. They\u0027re not too happy with me or the licker and push him back. This starts more pushing, and soon the place is out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m lost in the crowd, unable to move because the crowd has turned into a mob. When someone grabs my hand and leads me out, I\u0027m grateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil I recognize Avis bracelet attached to that hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stumble outside with Avi and the rest of the mob. They\u0027ve cleared out the club. When I see a police car with its lights flashing, I panic. Because someone over by the police car is talking to the soldiers and policemen while pointing at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit. Amy, don\u0027t say anything,\" Avi says. \"Let me talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the soldiers and policeman come up to us, I zip my mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mah aseet,\" the soldier says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Avi starts to talk, the guy puts up a hand and points to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to keep my mouth shut, I really did. My intentions were to stand here and stay silent. \"I speak English,\" I blurt out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you start pushing people on the dance floor?\" the soldier guy asks gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only because of the ear licker. I mean, at first he tried to feel me up but then, well, I thought he was going to apologize. Instead, my ear starts getting slimy and I realize he\u0027s not apologizing, he\u0027s giving my ear a tongue bath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I\u0027m rambling. I\u0027m scared, and I know I deserve to be punished for causing a whole club to clear out because of me. A cold knot is forming in my stomach and I clutch Avi\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, suddenly, out of the corner of my eye I catch a glimpse of the guy with the tongue. \"There he is!\" I yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe licker just backs up and disappears behind a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier barks out orders at Avi and storms off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To take you home now or else he\u0027ll arrest you. Come on,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a Q-tip?\" I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuh! \"So I can wipe that guy\u0027s germs out of my ear. I bet I already have an ear infection because of that dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s walking so fast I can hardly keep up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t blame me for what happened back there, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we reach Avi\u0027s car, he turns to me. \"You were turning that guy on with your dancing. What did you expect?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meet his accusing eyes without flinching. \"He knew I was American. Maybe Israelis like wet tongues in their ear, but in America--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knew you were American?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I told him when he bought me the beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beer? You were drinking alcohol with that guy? No wonder he thought you were easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For your information, I am not easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"American girls have a reputation around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop using me as proof of your stereotypes, Avi. It\u0027s not fair. Besides, you were shakin\u0027 it plenty tonight. You\u0027re just jealous because your blond bimbo didn\u0027t want to suck y our ear off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnotty and friends are walking toward us. I cross my arms in front of my chest, waiting for them so we can go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone started a fight inside the disco,\" Ofra says to me, offering her explanation of the commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite my tongue and keep silent, but Avi glances sideways at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You,\" Snotty says. \"You started it, didn\u0027t you? I should have guessed. You can\u0027t do anything right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave her alone,\" Doo-Doo says. I want to kiss him right now for sticking up for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling like I have support, I say to Snotty defiantly, \"I can do anything you can do.\" And then, because adrenaline is flowing through my body I add, \"And I can do it better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on her face is priceless. She\u0027s thinking. I can almost hear her rusty, unused brain creaking as it\u0027s working. \"Shear a sheep,\" she blurts out. \"Tomorrow morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" I say with confidence, even though on the inside I\u0027m shuddering at the thought of holding down a poor, defenseless sheep while I cut his fur off until he\u0027s naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027ll do it, just to prove to everyone I don\u0027t screw everything up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just hope I don\u0027t make a fool out of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan do anything you can do, and I can do it better. I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust call me Amy the Sheep Shearer. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been trying to convince myself of all morning. After I found the note that Snotty wants to meet me after breakfast for our little challenge, that is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, last night was not a nightmare. I really and truly challenged Snotty, and I hadn\u0027t even had any of that beer I was accused of consuming. Okay, I realize I\u0027m the stupid one here, but I\u0027m still determined to prove to her that I do not screw everything up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dress in jeans and a long-sleeve T-shirt for full protection. I don\u0027t have any protective goggles, so I put on my Coach sunglasses. Walking outside, I see Mutt bouncing toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You find my sandal yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo answer me, he rolls onto his back. His tongue is hanging out of his mouth like a beggar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t grovel,\" I say. \"It\u0027s not attractive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick the mutt up and carry him with me. He might prove useful when I\u0027m trying to corner the sheep. \"Okay,\" I say. \"Let\u0027s get a game plan. You make me look good, and I\u0027ll forget the sandal incident. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMutt\u0027s answer is a big fart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not going to be my day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reach the sheep pens, Ofra is the first person I see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to do this,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes I do. For me. For Mutt. For Americans all over the globe. Ofra\u0027s lack of confidence in me just furthers my resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay. I want to do it,\" I assure her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoo-Doo comes over to me and gives me pointers. \"Hold him down. Keep your eye on him. Don\u0027t drop the razor on your toe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s like a boxing coach, and in the ring is my opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027ve placed one sheep in the pen, along with a large razor hanging from the ceiling. Doo-Doo helps me strap the razor to my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI survey my surroundings. Snotty is sitting on top of a railing with O\u0027dead at her side. Ofra and Doo-Doo, my supporters, are beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi is nowhere in sight. I\u0027m surprised he didn\u0027t come to watch me get eaten alive by a sheep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the opposite pen is another sheep. Snotty\u0027s. I swear, it looks a lot smaller than mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, I enter the pen with the unsuspecting animal. He\u0027s even bigger than I thought. You\u0027d think Snotty would have enough compassion to give me a lamb like the one in the nursery rhyme, but no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is definitely not Mary\u0027s little lamb. And its fleece is as dirty as Mutt\u0027s, not white as snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnotty enters the other pen. She jumps right in, like she does this every day. Then she turns to me. \"You\u0027re really going to go through with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, yeah.\" I once saw a bumper sticker that showed a picture of an American flag and the caption below These Colors Don\u0027t Run. I\u0027m not about to chicken out. Even though I really, really want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she says, pure disbelief on her face. \"On the count of three we\u0027ll start. Whoever finishes first, wins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One. Two. Three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put Mutt down and whisper, \"Go do your thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, Mutt starts barking and the sheep scurries into the corner. I turn on the razor and head toward the menacing animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil it looks at me with those big, gray eyes. I keep thinking that Ron told me it\u0027s too hot for them with their hair all bushy. I understand and sympathize. Okay, I\u0027m trying to convince myself that I understand and sympathize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at Mutt, who\u0027s staring at me as if saying, Do it! He\u0027s right. There\u0027s no chickening out now. I have to face my fears and just do it. I hold up the razor like a sword and head into battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept the stupid sheep runs away in fear. When it passes me, I hold out the razor like an idiot. Now the thing has a bald stripe down its back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try not to listen to or look at the progress in the other pen. I\u0027m trying to concentrate solely on my mission. Mutt is barking up a storm, making the sheep nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrestle him to the ground and hold him there,\" I hear from my cheering section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I break the news that I never had a brother to teach me to wrestle? Or a sister, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mutt, you got to help me here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMutt is a great sheep herder. I realize this when the animal tries to move. Mutt expertly heads him off and gets him in the corner again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a swift move, I hold my weight against the wooly creature and start shearing. There\u0027s no rhyme or reason to it, I\u0027m just so happy when the dirty, wooly fur starts flying off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear lots of laughing, some cheering and various directions from Doo-Doo. I don\u0027t stop, I\u0027m like a sheep shearing nut gone wild.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step back and look at the poor animal. Okay, so I haven\u0027t done such a hot job. He has a Mohawk hairdo and his body looks like it\u0027s a road map. But I did it and I feel victorious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil I hear Ron\u0027s voice yell, \"What the hell is going on here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis roller coaster called life is making me dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy, we need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate when parents think they can sit down and tell you what you\u0027ve been doing wrong while they expect you to sit quiet and nod like a bobblehead figurine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now I\u0027m sitting outside the house petting Mutt. I\u0027m proud of him, he\u0027s a great sheep herder. I can hear Uncle Chime yelling at Snotty inside the house. He didn\u0027t look too happy when Ron explained our little competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know what\u0027s going on with you,\" Ron says, sitting next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe places one of his hands on my forearm. \"Believe it or not, I want you to be happy. You don\u0027t have to shear sheep to prove anything to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug his hand off me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want me to be happy, give me a ticket home right now. I don\u0027t belong here,\" I say. Then I add, \"and I don\u0027t belong with you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-13.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM"}
