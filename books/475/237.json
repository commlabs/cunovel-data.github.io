For by the law he would see God\u0027s holy standard and by the law he would see his own utter helplessness; then he would be glad to learn God\u0027s way of faith. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGod still shuts us up to faith. Our natures, our circumstances, trials, disappointments, all serve to shut us up and keep us in ward till we see that the only way out is God\u0027s way of faith. Moses tried by self-effort, by personal influence, even by violence, to bring about the deliverance of his people. God had to shut him up forty years in the wilderness before he was prepared for God\u0027s work. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePaul and Silas were bidden of God to preach the Gospel in Europe. They landed and proceeded to Philippi. They were flogged, they were shut up in prison, their feet were put fast in the stocks. They were shut up to faith. They trusted God. They sang praises to Him in the darkest hour, and God wrought deliverance and salvation. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJohn was banished to the Isle of Patmos. He was shut up to faith. Had he not been so shut up, he would never have seen such glorious visions of God. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDear reader, are you in some great trouble? Have you had some great disappointment, have you met some sorrow, some unspeakable loss? Are you in a hard place? Cheer up! You are shut up to faith. Take your trouble the right way. Commit it to God. Praise Him that He maketh \"all things work together for good,\"(Rom.8:28) and that \"God worketh for him that waiteth for him.\"(Isa.64:4) There will be blessings, help and revelations of God that will come to you that never could otherwise have come; and many besides yourself will receive great light and blessing because you were shut up to faith.--C. H. P\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Great things are done when men and mountains meet, These are not done by jostling in the street.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e八月二十五日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「但信还未来以先，我们被看守在律法之下，直圈到那将来的信显明出来。」\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e（加三23，直译）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e在英文译本里，「直圈到那….信」这几个字译作Shut up to faith。「Shut up」的意思是关闭；这就是说，我们被关闭在律法之下，自己不会做好，也没有希望做好；在这样完全没有办法，四面的路都关闭起来的光景之下，只有一条路是开着的，这条路就是信。神往昔允许人们被看守在律法之下，为的是要人们知道信的可贵。在律法下面，人们能够看见神圣洁的标准；在律法下面，人们能够看见自己的完全无能；在这样没有办法的时候，知道了神的因信称义的救法，应该多么欢喜快乐呢？ \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e神现在还是常常喜欢将我们关闭起来，只留给我们一条信心的道路。我们的天性、我们的环境、试炼、失望，都是神用来关闭看守我们的东西，要叫我们看见：唯一的出路乃是神所预备的信心的道路。摩西少年的时候，在埃及曾想用自己的努力，个人的势力，甚至武力、暴力，来拯救他的民族，所以神必须将他关闭野外四十年，然后纔用他去做神的工作。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e保罗和西拉往腓立比去宣传福音，受了鞭打，被下在监里，两脚上了木狗。他们四面的出路都关住了，只剩下一条信心的道路。他们靠神。在最黑暗的光景里还祷告、唱诗、赞美神，神就向他们施行拯救。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e约翰被放逐到拔摩海岛。他四面的出路都关住了，只留下一条信心的道路。如果他不经过这样关闭的话，他绝不能见到神荣耀的启示。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e亲爱的读者，你是不是正遭遇了极大的困难呢？是不是正有一件极大的失望临到你呢？这件事情是不是叫你悲哀，叫你遭到说不尽的损失呢？你是不是很难过去呢？不要紧，你四面的出路虽然都已经关住了，却还留着一条信心的道路。好好地负起你的困难来交托神。赞美祂！因为祂使「万事都互相效力，叫爱神的人得益处」（罗八28）。并且「神为等候祂的人行事」（赛六十四4）。你受过试炼以后，神的祝福、帮助、启示，都要加倍地临到你；除你自己以外，还有许多别的人，也都会因着你的试炼得到亮光和祝福。－－C.
