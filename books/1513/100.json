Then a large number of acolytes would be able to join and thus reinstate the glory on the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the nurturing of any talented acolyte will consume a vast amount of time and energy, and not to mention the aptitude of 5th-grade acolytes — where and how would it be easy to find one with such a talent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Abyssal Bone Forest Academy’s heritage had declined drastically during Leylin’s generation. It was likely that at least 10 years would be required to regain their former level of glory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Leylin wasn’t greatly concerned about these issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe once again returned to a thread-like monotonous life — he would cooperate with his professor in his experiments and thus learn from experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, he took advantage of the privileges granted to a level 3 acolyte — he purchased large amounts of magical resources and stored information on advanced subjects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s aptitude in the Magus World was considered average, neither high nor low, but it was rather decent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, he had succeeded in advancing to a level 3 acolyte. In the future, there would be plenty of time for him to breakthrough into an official Magus!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering this point, regardless of a professor or an acolyte, all would regard him as a person of very great importance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever Leylin encounters an official Magus, he would greet them. In return, they would nod their heads in recognition and approval. Also, when acolytes see Leylin from afar, they would immediately greet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Nyssa and the rest, they did not dare to appear in front of Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking of Nyssa, Leylin could not help but feel happy for her. In such a bloodbath, she was actually able to preserve her life and even obtain a few contribution points, which was an extremely difficult thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe overheard that Nyssa had been able to exchange her contribution points for a potion to increase spiritual force and was preparing to breakthrough to level 3 acolyte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope she succeeds! To heal her body, she needs to, at least, become a proper Magus!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin thought of Nyssa’s injuries and was somewhat dismayed. Right now, in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy; there was only himself, Nyssa, and Jayden who hailed from the Chernobyl Islands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese thoughts only passed through Leylin’s mind. Very soon, he concentrated on the book in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book in his hands was extremely thick, the same thickness of two bricks together. However, the paper’s surface was extremely small. This was the style of ancient books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mother Earth laid down on the ground and gave birth to 7 children. They are Anger, Sorrow, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Gluttony, and Fear. Each of her children inherited one of their mother’s power. Mountains will tear themselves apart in front of them, and the seas will part before them….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe book in Leylin’s hands concerned myths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The ancient writing is extremely obscure, in it, many information about Magi is concealed…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s eyes flashed as he commanded, “A.I. Chip! Record!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since Leylin registered under the administrative area and became a potential Magus, he managed to obtain more access within Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of this was to peruse the hidden library section!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, within these books, many information regarding official Magus were erased. At the very most, they were briefly mentioned in passing, with cryptic writings. Normally, people would just gloss over this information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, Leylin with the A.I. Chip obtained much more information from this hidden library section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, the A.I. Chip had recorded almost all information that was beneath the topics of Magi. Right now, Leylin could vouch for himself that most professors in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy could not match his knowledge concerning acolytes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a great foundation buildup for Leylin in the acolyte level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least now he was aware of the mistakes from breaking through to a level 3 acolyte and even tried to correct them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne should not look down on such information. If the mistakes are not corrected, even after Leylin becomes an official Magus, his spiritual force would stall for a long period of time, with no chance of ever breaking through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, Leylin found some content regarding advanced meditation techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to these bits and pieces, together with Roman’s information, Leylin could confirm that the chairman of Abyssal Bone Forest Academy and those leaders of major guilds and magisterium in the south coast used these advanced meditation techniques to break through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence, they were able to achieve their current levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the majority of the Magi in the south coast, as well as many professors in the academies, they did not know of the existence of advanced meditation techniques. They used Grine Water to breakthrough, causing them to remain at the level of rank 1 Magus for their entire life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter looking at all these, Leylin completely sealed the notion of using Grine Water to breakthrough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems like heading towards the Zither Moon Mountain Plains and obtaining the advanced meditation technique that the great Magus Serholm left behind is necessary for future developments!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin closed the book slowly and left the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin had used the A.I. Chip to record most of the information in the hidden library section. In the future, no matter where he was, he could always perform a search with the A.I. Chip. It was equivalent to carrying a large-scale, intelligent library with him at all times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Professor!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin went to Kroft’s lab and bowed to Kroft, who was carrying out an experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Kroft was the same as before, Leylin found that his eyes were somewhat dimmed. It seems that Merlin’s death had slightly impacted this old man of more than 100 years of age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin, my child!” After seeing Leylin, Kroft smiled and he looked to be more focused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Regarding my suggestion from before, have you decided on an answer?” Kroft asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Professor!” Leylin bowed once more. “I appreciate that the Leslie family thinks highly of me, but I wish to try breaking through on my own!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter hearing Leylin’s reply, Kroft’s expression darkened. However, Leylin’s talent in Potioneering was admirable, even to Kroft. After knowing that Merlin died, Leylin had become his best apprentice, so he could not help but advise again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Leslie family is a great one, with Potioneering as their niche. In there, your talents will definitely be displayed to the fullest. Moreover, the Leslie family has sincerity, where the contract conditions are much better than the academy’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin displayed a very keen look, but deep down he had rejected Kroft’s proposition without the slightest hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the bloodbath, Leylin’s position in Kroft’s heart was elevated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, when they spoke, Kroft represented the Leslie family in supporting him and made an offer to Leylin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeslie family was one of the large-scale Magus family in Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, with many Magi supporting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKroft was one of its members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving a long standing tradition and history with Abyssal Bone Forest Academy, the Leslie family also possessed a copy of a rank 1 spell and Grine Water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Kroft suggested was the same contract signed with the academy. The Leslie family would also give a rank 1 spell model and a Grine Water in exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to a contract with the academy, a contract with a family would have fewer restraints. However, this was not in line with Leylin’s interests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how powerful the Leslie family was, would they be able to provide an advanced meditation technique?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at Kroft, who did not have a single high-grade meditation technique, he already knew the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the inheritance of great Magus Serholm, Leylin hoped that he would never have to join a Magi family and put restrictions on himself!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, Leylin was a person who valued freedom. Unless he was in a desperate situation, he would never consider selling himself to be contracted with a family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All these, I know, Professor! But…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin raised his head, his eyes showing an unshakeable resolve and determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I still wish to try on my own! If I were to fail, I promise you, Professor, that I will definitely prioritise and consider the Leslie family!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarious expressions flashed across Kroft’s face. Looking at the most outstanding acolyte he had right now, he suddenly felt a little helpless. “Alright then! You are only 17 now! Youth is precious, it allows you to make mistakes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKroft looked at Leylin and was reminded of his younger self. His eyes revealed that he was recalling a memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, professor!” Even though Kroft was unreasonable, Leylin was somewhat moved. He never wanted harm to befall his apprentices. This trait was rather praiseworthy within Abyssal Bone Forest Academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In that case… How do you plan to overcome this obstacle to becoming an official Magus?” Kroft asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This…” Leylin shook his head, as if in ‘embarrassment’, revealing an apologetic expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard that Professor Dorotte had a piece of remnant information concerning official Magus…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha…” Kroft laughed, “So this was your plan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the south coast, the information to become an official Magus was often controlled by large guilds, but there was always an exception!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-99\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-101\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-100","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
