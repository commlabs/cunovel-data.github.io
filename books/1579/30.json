She\u0027d gambled, foolishly, coming out so early.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe protective gear was meant for late dusk, not now when the sun still had two hours of life in it. I remember what my escort had told me days ago, how the sight and smel s of hepers had driven some staffers to charge out at the Dome in the middle of the day. I\u0027d found it hard to believe back then, but no more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange, I think, looking at the pile of clothes. all I see on the ground is the SunCloak. No sign of her other clothes: shoes, socks, pants. Just the SunCloak. Maybe she was naked underneath the way Beefy was? I head over and kick at the cloak, expecting it to be sodden and sticky with yel ow fl uid and melted skin. But there\u0027s nothing at all . No sign of any yel ow fl uid. Then it hits me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s in the library. Somehow she was able to escape inside in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when I spin around toward the library, I see something that— My mouth drops. My eyes widen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rays of the descending sun saturate the outside of the library— the wal s, the shutters, the brick pathway— in a sea of purple and orange. And standing in the midst of this color is Ashley June. Color radiates off her pale skin, mixing with the orange of her hair, the green of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth is slightly parted, ful and whole. And she is not screaming, not disintegrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stare at each other, speechless, my eyes helplessly agog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches into her mouth, tilts back her head, pul s something out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA set of fake fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe holds them out to me like a peace offering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fi rst thing she asks for when we walk in is water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” I tel her, remembering how parched I was a couple of days ago. “You\u0027ve gone this whole time without water?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t answer but downs a whole bottle of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s answer enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s why I col apsed outside,” she says, eyeing my other bottle of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want more?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but not to drink.” She grabs the bottle. “In case you haven\u0027t noticed— the others certainly have— I\u0027m beginning to smel .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereally bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should wash up inside. Sun\u0027l give you a sunburn, your skin\u0027s so fair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shoots me a look as if to say, Really? I haven\u0027t survived seventeen years by accident, buddy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the back,” I say quickly. “There\u0027s a place with a drain in the fl oor.” She walks around the circulation desk and the fl oor.” She walks around the circulation desk and disappears. Leaving me with my tangled, bewildered, searching thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she comes back ten minutes later, I haven\u0027t moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair is slick wet and her face freshly scrubbed. She looks paler and drained, but her eyes are brighter. “I hope you don\u0027t mind,” she says timidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said I hope you don\u0027t mind. I had to put on your clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own stuff is . . . there\u0027s too much of a smel in them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say, eyes looking down, “it\u0027s okay. all that stuff they gave me are a few sizes too smal . I\u0027ve never worn that outfi t before, it\u0027s yours now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stand at a slant, looking at everything but each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry for using up two bottles of water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s okay. We still have a half bottle left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I say the word we, it\u0027s as though something breaks in her. Her head turns to mine; when I meet her eyes, they\u0027ve wel ed up. She snaps her eyelids shut, and when she opens them again, her eyes have dried. She\u0027s good, she\u0027s practiced; just like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you lived alone?” I ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses. “Yes,” she answers gently, sadly. “For almost as long as I can remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer story, told to me after we sit down, is not unlike mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembers a family: parents, an older brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheerful conversation at home, laughter, feelings of safety once the shutters came down at dawn and the world was locked outside, meals around a table, warm bodies asleep around her. Then she remembers the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was bedridden with a fever and stayed home while her parents and brother hiked to get some fruit. They left ten minutes after dawn. She never saw them again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day in a family, the next day alone. Solitude and loneliness her constant companions, their presence so enervating and cold, like two damp socks worn on a winter day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was ten years ago. She was only seven. At fi rst it was incredibly hard. To live. Not an hour went by that she did not con-sider giving herself up at school. It would be so easy. To succumb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStand in the middle of the soccer fi eld during recess, prick her fi nger, let a droplet of blood seep. Watch them come fl ying at her. The end would be brutal but swift. Death would be an escape from this unbearable loneliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her parents had taught her two things. Ingrained them in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fi rst was survival: not just the basics, but the nuances, the minu-tiae, every conceivable situation she might fi nd herself in. The second was life, the importance of it, the preciousness of it, the duty to persevere and never let it end prematurely. She hated how clinical y they indoctrinated her: by the time they were gone, she had become a reluctant expert at survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer beauty was a curse, especial y as she— and classmates around her— hit puberty. Attention, something she was repeatedly told by her parents to avoid, came her way with the force of a testosterone- fi l ed tidal wave. Boys would write letters to her, stare at her, converse with her awkwardly, throw spitbal s at her, join the same clubs she did. Girls, seeing the social advantages of befriend-ing her, fl ocked around her. Nothing she did to minimize her beauty helped. Clunky, self- cut hair; an abrasive, caustic personality; aloof-ness; feigning disinterest in boys; even outright stupidity. But none of these helped. The attention kept coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, she realized her approach was all wrong. Her defense was too . . . defensive. It didn\u0027t fi t her, and this kind of faux defensive life would eventual y be her undoing. She saw that. And she decided the best defense was offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of tamping down her beauty, she played it up. She threw off the meek, stupid persona and instead exuded confi dence and poise. It was an easy act mostly because it didn\u0027t feel like one. More than anything, it gave her power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe control ed the pieces, and instead of being pushed about by the horses and knights and queens 176 ANDREW FUKUDA about her, she turned them all into pawns. She grew her hair long and in a way that complimented her svelte fi gure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d stare down the boys who gazed at her, grab the social knives meant to backstab her and use them to cut down her competition. She was ruthless until she was needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventual y, it became clear she had to get a boyfriend. As long as she was unattached, the boys would continue clamoring after her like magnet maggots. And too many questions about her would arise if she didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she plucked the varsity quarterback, an obnoxious and surprisingly insecure se nior who played it cool when with her in public but in private boiled like lava. Kil ing him turned out to be easier than she\u0027d thought. For their one- month anniversary (teens can be so sappy), she suggested a picnic at a secluded spot a few hours away from the city limits. He was all over the idea. They brought wine and blankets. Once there, he drank too much— she kept pouring— until he passed out. She tied him to a tree that was, in the late autumn, stripped of leaves and would provide no shade once the sun rose. She left him passed out and walked home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never saw him again. When she went back to the tree the next day, there was only a pile of clothes hanging off limp lines of rope, slightly bleached by the toxicity of melted fl esh. She took the clothes and rope and burned them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs with most “disappearances,” the subject was taboo and spoken of only in hushed whispers. A perfunctory search was conducted and then abandoned after only twelve hours; the matter was fi led away as a DBS (disappearance by sunlight). She pretended to be devastated by this tragedy, her heart cracked by the loss of her “soul mate.” At his funeral, she professed her undying devotion and love to him, promising that her soul was forever bonded with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt achieved everything she hoped it would. Boys largely left her alone; girls sympathized with her tragic loss, and her stock rose even higher. Nobody questioned her lack of a dating life even as the other girls in the Desirables necked, armpitted, and otherwise hooked up at parties. She was the tragic fi gure in need of time and space. Give her a few years, she\u0027d eventual y come around, her friends thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to build the deception. She joined the HiSS (Heper Search Society), a group that operated under the theory that hepers were still at large and had infi ltrated society. The members of the HiSS sought to fl ush out these heper infi ltrators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why put yourself in the midst of the very people most keen to sniff you out?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause, she answers, the HiSS was the one place no one would ever suspect you. Membership in that club was the eye of the storm, where neither suspicion nor accusation would blow your way. And there was an added benefi t: She would be the fi rst to know about another suspected heper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer plan was simple: First confi rm that that person was a heper, then snuff out the suspicion as baseless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns to look at me, her mouth fashioning words and then stopping. “Establish contact,” she fi nal y says. She sits on one end of the sofa, a leg bent under her, half turned toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were good,” I say. “I never suspected. Not for a second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You weren\u0027t so good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You slipped a few times. I\u0027d see emotions breaking out on your face. Or fal ing asleep in class. Granted, it was only for a split second— but the slight head nod of sleep was unmistakable.” Her eyes light up, remembering something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saved your butt more than once. Like in trig class a few nights ago, when you couldn\u0027t read the board. Even last night, here in the library with the Director. Your hands started to tremble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember that.” Then something occurs to me. “Why didn\u0027t you ever approach me? At school. And here. When you had me all fi gured out? Just tel me you knew what I was.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-30.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
