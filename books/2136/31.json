Tammy snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t lie to us, Mom. I read Auntie Louie\u0027s mind. She\u0027s totally freaked out right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my forehead and shook my head. It was, after all, impossible to keep anything away from my kids these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth was, I didn\u0027t know what, exactly, I was keeping away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly that I needed them somewhere safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Tammy to give the phone to her brother and she did. I told Anthony, who was now almost as tall as his sister - his recent growth spurt was alarming, to say the least - that it was his job to protect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on it, Mommy,\" he said. \"If I have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s kind of a butthead, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Butthead or not, she\u0027s still your sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My ugly sister, you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you guys,\" I said, suddenly choked up. God, I even missed their bickering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know, Mommy. You say it all the time. Sheesh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s true,\" I said, drying my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s embarrrrrassing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe so, but you need to hear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed loudly. \"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I need,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed again, and, ever so softly, whispered, \"I guess I love you, too, Mommy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have laughed if the tears didn\u0027t come to my eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe added, \"Don\u0027t let the bad guys get you, Mommy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, Mommy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he hung up...and I wiped the tears from my cheeks, and took a deep breath and set my jaw. I had been clenching my hands so tight that my sharp nails had punctured my palms. I opened my hands and watched the small wounds heal before my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever this motherfucker was, Devil or no Devil, he was not going to hurt my kids, and he sure as hell wasn\u0027t going to keep me from seeing them, again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever the hell he was. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-31.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
