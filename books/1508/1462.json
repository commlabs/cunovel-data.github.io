He clenched his fists together, causing crackling popping sounds to echo in the air. “What? You lot are so weak and yet others can’t mention it?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Interesting! How interesting!” Near the White Chalk Family, a middle-aged man leading their group looked towards Monster Prince Duyu. “If you have such confidence, do you think you can amaze everyone here with your achievements?

The larger the mark one left, the more strokes there were, the deeper the writing was, then the greater the difficulty would be.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo leave behind an extremely deep and profound mark on Precipice Cliff while withstanding the tremendous suppression of the aura there wasn’t simple at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen the martial artists of the White Chalk Family and Blue Sword Faction had tried, they had flown up just a bit more than 10,000 feet and the marks they left behind were very simple; there was no need to mention how deep their carvings were.

In his eyes, these people were nothing more than ants. In the future their achievements would end at the Holy Lord realm, but he himself would be an Empyrean level character.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter stepping below Precipice Cliff, he looked up and lazily said, “Of course I’ll give it a try. The reason I came to Precipice Cliff is to complete a mission. Is there anyone stronger amongst you lot? Is there anyone willing to leave a mark on Precipice Cliff with me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe corner of Monster Prince Duyu’s lips tugged up as he swept his eyes over everyone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Heh, this fool doesn’t know what death or danger are.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTwo people walked forwards.

From the point that Monster Prince Duyu had spoken out to this sudden conflict, Lin Ming hadn’t spoken at all. He had only stood on the sidelines, watching.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let’s begin!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMonster Prince Duyu licked his lips, eagerness in his eyes.

Both of the leapt up, the repulsion force causing the ground to explode beneath them.

At this height, Monster Prince Duyu hadn’t slowed down at all, all the way up to 20,000 feet.

Even if he didn’t leave behind a mark on Precipice Cliff, just reaching this height was as difficult as ascending to heaven. But Monster Prince Duyu clearly had plenty of strength left over. Was he planning to shoot straight to the Emperor Stone?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany martial artists had guessed correctly.

He had reached his limit. If he tried to continue upwards beneath the dual pressure and restless energy within himself then he would likely suffer broken organs and even his meridians would be damaged. However, he continued to release trues essence. Once he stopped it would be impossible for him to leave behind any mark on the Emperor Stone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Monster Prince Descends!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMonster Prince Duyu clawed at the Emperor Stone without any reservations!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter completing his body metamorphosis, his hands had become like dragon claws. Moreover, there was a fierce and savage-looking gauntlet covering his hands. These gauntlets were Monster Prince Duyu’s weapons. In terms of sharpness, it was no worse than a sword or saber.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMonster Prince Duyu had poured all of his remaining true essence into this strike.
