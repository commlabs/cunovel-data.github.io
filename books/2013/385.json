Get rid of some of them, will you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I cannot,’ Corabb replied. ‘I shall need them all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Now that doesn’t surprise me, the way you treat your weapons.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There will be many enemy that need killing, yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That Letherii shield is next to useless,’ Cuttle said. ‘You should know that by now, Corabb.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When it breaks I shall find another.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe so looked forward to the imminent battle. The screams, the shrieks of the dying, the shock of the enemy as it reeled back, repulsed again and again. The marines had earned it, oh yes. The fight they had all been waiting for, outside the very walls of Letheras-and the citizens would line them to watch, with wonder, with astonishment, with awe, as Corabb Bhilan Thenu’alas unleashed such ferocity as to sear the souls of every witness…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHellian was never drinking that stuff again. Imagine, sick, still drunk, thirsty and hallucinating all at once. Almost as bad as that night of the Paralt Festival in Kartool, with all those people wearing giant spider costumes and Hellian, in a screaming frenzy, trying to stamp on all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, she was trudging at the head of her paltry squad in the grainy half-light of dawn, and from the snatches of conversation that penetrated her present state of disrepair she gathered that the Edur were right behind them, like ten thousand giant spiders with fangs that could shoot out and skewer innocent seagulls and terrified women. And even worse, this damned column was marching straight for a giant web eager to ensnare them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, there were the hallucinations. Her corporal splitting in two, for example. One here, one there, both talking at once but not the same thing and not even in the same voice. And what about that doe-eyed fool with the stupid name who was now always hovering close? Scab Breath? Skulldent? Whatever, she had ten years on him easy, maybe more, or that’s how it seemed since he had that smooth baby-skin-Babyskin?-face that made him look, gods, fourteen or so. All breathless with some bizarre story about being a prince and the last of a royal line and saving seeds to plant in perfect soil where cacti don’t grow and now he wanted… wanted what? She couldn’t be sure, but he was triggering all sorts of nasty thoughts in her head, above all an overwhelming desire to corrupt the boy so bad he’d never see straight ever again, just to prove that she wasn’t someone anybody messed with without getting all messed up themselves. So maybe it all came down to power. The power to crush innocence and that was something even a terrified woman could do, couldn’t she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassing through another village and oh, this wasn’t a good sign. It’d been systematically flattened. Every building nothing but rubble. Armies did things like that to remove cover, to eliminate the chance of establishing redoubts and all that sort of thing. No trees beyond, either, just a level stretch of ploughed fields with the hedgerows cut down to stumps and the crops all burnt to blackened stubble an already the morning sun was lancing deadly darts into he skull, forcing her to down a few mouthfuls of her dwindlin supply of Falari rum from the transports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteadying her some, thank Hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer corporal merged back into one, which was a good sign, and he was pointing ahead and talking about something-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What? Wait, Touchy Breath, wha’s that you’re saying?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The rise opposite, Sergeant! See the army waiting for us? See it? Gods above, we’re finished! Thousands! No, worse than thousands-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Be quiet! I can see ‘em well enough-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But you’re looking the wrong way!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s no matter either way, Corporal. I still see ‘em, don’t I? Now stop crowding me and go find Urb-got to keep ‘im close to keep ‘im alive, the clumsy fool.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He won’t come, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Wha’ you talkin’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘bout?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s Skulldeath, you see. He’s announced that he’s given his heart to you-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘His what? Listen, you go an’ tell Hearty Death that he can have his skull back cause I don’t wannit, but I’ll take his cock once we’re done killing all these bassards or maybe even before then if there’s a chance, but in the meantime, drag Urb here because I’m ‘sponsible for ‘im, you see, for letting’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘im kick in that temple door.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sergeant, he won’t-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How come your voice keeps changin’?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-385.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
