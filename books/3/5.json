All through the interminable day at school she was bored stiff. She took care to be extra nice to Joanna during the breaks. On the way home they talked about going camping as soon as the woods were dry enough.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After what seemed an eternity she was once again at the mailbox. First she opened a letter postmarked in Mexico. It was from her father. He wrote about how much he was longing for home and how for the first time he had managed to beat the Chief Officer at chess. Apart from that he had almost finished the pile of books he had brought aboard with him after his winter leave.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then, there it was--a brown envelope with her name on it! Leaving her schoolbag and the rest of the mail in the house, Sophie ran to the den. She pulled out the new typewritten pages and began to read:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e THE MYTHOLOGICAL WORLD PICTURE\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hello there, Sophie! We have a lot to do, so we\u0027ll get started without delay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By philosophy we mean the completely new way of thinking that evolved in Greece about six hundred years before the birth of Christ. Until that time people had found answers to all their questions in various religions. These religious explanations were handed down from generation to generation in the form of myths. A myth is a story about the gods which sets out to explain why life is as it is.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Over the millennia a wild profusion of mythological explanations of philosophical questions spread across the world. The Greek philosophers attempted to prove that these explanations were not to be trusted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In order to understand how the early philosophers thought, we have to understand what it was like to have a mythological picture of the world. We can take some Nordic myths as examples. (There is no need to carry coals to Newcastle.)\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You have probably heard of Thor and his hammer. Before Christianity came to Norway, people believed that Thor rode across the sky in a chariot drawn by two goats. When he swung his hammer it made thunder and lightning. The word \"thunder\" in Norwegian--\"Thor-d0n\"--means Thor\u0027s roar. In Swedish, the word for thunder is \"aska,\" originally \"as-aka,\" which means \"god\u0027s journey\" over the heavens.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When there is thunder and lightning there is also rain, which was vital to the Viking farmers. So Thor was worshipped as the god of fertility.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The mythological explanation for rain was therefore that Thor was swinging his hammer. And when it rained the corn germinated and thrived in the fields.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How the plants of the field could grow and yield crops was not understood. But it was clearly somehow connected with the rain. And since everybody believed that the rain had something to do with Thor, he was one of the most important of the Norse gods.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was another reason why Thor was important, a reason related to the entire world order.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Vikings believed that the inhabited world was an island under constant threat from outside dangers. They called this part of the world Midgard, which means the kingdom in the middle. Within Midgard lay Asgard, the domain of the gods.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Outside Midgard was the kingdom of Utgard, the domain of the treacherous giants, who resorted to all kinds of cunning tricks to try and destroy the world. Evil monsters like these are often referred to as the \"forces of chaos.\" Not only in Norse mythology but in almost all other cultures, people found that there was a precarious balance between the forces of good and evil.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One of the ways in which the giants could destroy Midgard was by abducting Freyja, the goddess of fertility. If they could do this, nothing would grow in the fields and the women would no longer have children. So it was vital to hold these giants in check.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thor was a central figure in this battle with the giants. His hammer could do more than make rain; it was a key weapon in the struggle against the dangerous forces of chaos. It gave him almost unlimited power. For example, he could hurl it at the giants and slay them. And he never had to worry about losing it because it always came back to him, just like a boomerang.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was the mythological explanation for how the balance of nature was maintained and why there was a constant struggle between good and evil. And this was precisely the kind of explanation that the philosophers rejected.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it was not a question of explanations alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mortals could not just sit idly by and wait for the gods to intervene while catastrophes such as drought or plague loomed. They had to act for themselves in the struggle against evil. This they did by performing various religious ceremonies, or rites.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The most significant religious ceremony in Norse times was the offering. Making an offering to a god had the effect of increasing that god\u0027s power. For example, mortals had to make offerings to the gods to give them the strength to conquer the forces of chaos. They could do this by sacrificing an animal to the god. The offering to Thor was usually a goat. Offerings to Odin sometimes took the form of human sacrifices.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The myth that is best known in the Nordic countries comes from the Eddie poem \"The Lay of Thrym.\" It tells how Thor, rising from sleep, finds that his hammer is gone. This makes him so angry that his hands tremble and his beard shakes. Accompanied by his henchman Loki he goes to Freyja to ask if Loki may borrow her wings so that he can fly to Jotunheim, the land of the giants, and find out if they are the ones who have stolen Thor\u0027s hammer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At Jotunheim Loki meets Thrym, the king of the giants, who sure enough begins to boast that he has hidden the hammer seven leagues under the earth. And he adds that the gods will not get the hammer back until Thrym is given Freyja as his bride.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Can you picture it, Sophie? Suddenly the good gods find themselves in the midst of a full-blown hostage incident. The giants have seized the gods\u0027 most vital defensive weapon. This is an utterly unacceptable situation. As long as the giants have Thor\u0027s hammer, they have total control over the world of gods and mortals. In exchange for the hammer they are demanding Freyja. But this is equally unacceptable. If the gods have to give up their goddess of fertility--she who protects all life--the grass will disappear from the fields and all gods and mortals will die. The situation is deadlocked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loki returns to Asgard, so the myth goes, and tells Freyja to put on her wedding attire for she is (alas!) to wed the king of the giants. Freyja is furious, and says people will think she is absolutely man-crazy if she agrees to marry a giant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the god Heimdall has an idea. He suggests that Thor dress up as a bride. With his hair up and two stones under his tunic he will look like a woman. Understandably, Thor is not wildly enthusiastic about the idea, but he finally accepts that this is the only way he will ever get his hammer back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So Thor allows himself to be attired in bridal costume, with Loki as his bridesmaid.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To put it in present-day terms, Thor and Loki are the gods\u0027 \"anti-terrorist squad.\" Disguised as women, their mission is to breach the giants\u0027 stronghold and recapture Thor\u0027s hammer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the gods arrive at Jotunheim, the giants begin to prepare the wedding feast. But during the feast, the bride--Thor, that is--devours an entire ox and eight salmon. He also drinks three barrels of beer. This astonishes Thrym. The true identity of the \"commandos\" is very nearly revealed. But Loki manages to avert the danger by explaining that Freyja has been looking forward to coming to jotunheim so much that she has not eaten for a week.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Thrym lifts the bridal veil to kiss the bride, he is startled to find himself looking into Thor\u0027s burning eyes. Once again Loki saves the situation by explaining that the bride has not slept for a week because she is so excited about the wedding. At this, Thrym commands that the hammer be brought forth and laid in the bride\u0027s lap during the wedding ceremony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thor roars with laughter when he is given the hammer. First he kills Thrym with it, and then he wipes out the giants and all their kin. And thus the gruesome hostage affair has a happy ending. Thor--the Batman or James Bond of the gods--has once again conquered the forces of evil.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So much for the myth itself, Sophie. But what is the real meaning behind it? It wasn\u0027t made up just for entertainment. The myth also tries to explain something. Here is one possible interpretation:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When a drought occurred, people sought an explanation of why there was no rain. Could it be that the giants had stolen Thor\u0027s hammer?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps the myth was an attempt to explain the changing seasons of the year: in the winter Nature dies because Thor\u0027s hammer is in jotunheim. But in the spring he succeeds in winning it back. So the myth tried to give people an explanation for something they could not understand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But a myth was not only an explanation. People also carried out religious ceremonies related to the myths. We can imagine how people\u0027s response to drought or crop failure would be to enact a drama about the events in the myth. Perhaps a man from the village would dress up as a bride--with stones for breasts--in order to steal the hammer back from the giants. By doing this, people were taking some action to make it rain so the crops would grow in their fields.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There are a great many examples from other parts of the world of the way people dramatized their myths of the seasons in order to speed up the processes of nature.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So far we have only taken a brief glimpse at the world of Norse mythology. But there were countless myths about Thor and Odin, Freyr and Frey a, Hoder and Balder and many other gods. Mythologica notions of this kind flourished all over the world until philosophers began to tamper with them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A mythological world picture also existed in Greece when the first philosophy was evolving. The stories of the Greek gods had been handed down from generation to generation for centuries. In Greece the gods were called Zeus and Apollo, Hera and Athene, Dionysos and Ascle-pios, Heracles and Hephaestos, to mention only a few of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Around 700 B.C., much of the Greek mythology was written down by Homer and Hesiod. This created a whole new situation. Now that the myths existed in written form, it was possible to discuss them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The earliest Greek philosophers criticized Homer\u0027s mythology because the gods resembled mortals too much and were just as egoistic and treacherous. For the first time it was said that the myths were nothing but human notions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One exponent of this view was the philosopher Xe-nophanes, who lived from about 570 B.C. Men have created the gods in their own image, he said. They believe the gods were born and have bodies and clothes and language just as we have. Ethiopians believe that the gods are black and flat-nosed, Thracians imagine them to be blue-eyed and fair-haired. If oxen, horses, and lions could draw, they would depict gods that looked like oxen, horses, and lions!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During that period the Greeks founded many city-states, both in Greece itself and in the Greek colonies in Southern Italy and Asia Minor, where all manual work was done by slaves, leaving the citizens free to devote all their time to politics and culture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In these city environments people began to think in a completely new way. Purely on his own behalf, any citizen could question the way society ought to be organized. Individuals could thus also ask philosophical questions without recourse to ancient myths.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We call this the development from a mythological mode of thought to one based on experience and reason. The aim of the early Greek philosophers was to find natural, rather than supernatural, explanations for natural processes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophie left the den and wandered about in the large garden. She tried to forget what she had learned at school, especially in science classes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If she had grown up in this garden without knowing anything at all about nature, how would she feel about the spring?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Would she try to invent some kind of explanation for why it suddenly started to rain one day? Would she work out some fantasy to explain where the snow went and why the sun rose in the morning?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes, she definitely would. She began to make up a story:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Winter held the land in its icy grip because the evil Muriat had imprisoned the beautiful Princess Sikita in a cold prison. But one morning the brave Prince Bravato came and rescued her. Sikita was so happy that she began to dance over the meadows, singing a song she had composed inside the dank prison. The earth and the trees were so moved that all the snow turned into tears. But then the sun came out and dried all the tears away. The birds imitated Sikita\u0027s song, and when the beautiful princess let down her golden tresses, a few locks of her hair fell onto the earth and turned into the lilies of the field ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sophie liked her beautiful story. If she had not known any other explanation for the changing seasons, she felt sure she would have come to believe her own story in the end.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She understood that people had always felt a need to explain the processes of nature. Perhaps they could not live without such explanations. And that they made up all those myths in the time before there was anything called science.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/2013/57364.html","bookId":3,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 1:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 1:18:39 AM"}
