{"id":31625,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"\u0026nbsp;Of all the spots on the world’s surface that I, George Walker, of Friday Street, London, have ever visited, Suez in Egypt, at the head of the Red Sea, is by far the vilest, the most unpleasant, and the least interesting. \u0026nbsp;There are no women there, no water, and no vegetation. \u0026nbsp;It is surrounded, and indeed often filled, by a world of sand. \u0026nbsp;A scorching sun is always overhead; and one is domiciled in a huge cavernous hotel, which seems to have been made purposely destitute of all the comforts of civilised life. \u0026nbsp;Nevertheless, in looking back upon the week of my life which I spent there I always enjoy a certain sort of triumph;—or rather, upon one day of that week, which lends a sort of halo not only to my sojourn at Suez, but to the whole period of my residence in Egypt. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am free to confess that I am not a great man, and that, at any rate in the earlier part of my career, I had a hankering after the homage which is paid to greatness. \u0026nbsp;I would fain have been a popular orator, feeding myself on the incense tendered to me by thousands; or failing that, a man born to power, whom those around him were compelled to respect, and perhaps to fear. \u0026nbsp;I am not ashamed to acknowledge this, and I believe that most of my neighbours in Friday Street would own as much were they as candid and open-hearted as myself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is now some time since I was recommended to pass the first four months of the year in Cairo because I had a sore-throat. \u0026nbsp;The doctor may have been right, but I shall never divest myself of the idea that my partners wished to be rid of me while they made certain changes in the management of the firm. \u0026nbsp;They would not otherwise have shown such interest every time I blew my nose or relieved my huskiness by a slight cough;—they would not have been so intimate with that surgeon from St. Bartholomew’s who dined with them twice at the Albion; nor would they have gone to work directly that my back was turned, and have done those very things which they could not have done had I remained at home. \u0026nbsp;Be that as it may, I was frightened and went to Cairo, and while there I made a trip to Suez for a week.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I was not happy at Cairo, for I knew nobody there, and the people at the hotel were, as I thought, uncivil. \u0026nbsp;It seemed to me as though I were allowed to go in and out merely by sufferance; and yet I paid my bill regularly every week. \u0026nbsp;The house was full of company, but the company was made up of parties of twos and threes, and they all seemed to have their own friends. \u0026nbsp;I did make attempts to overcome that terrible British exclusiveness, that noli me tangere with which an Englishman arms himself; and in which he thinks it necessary to envelop his wife; but it was in vain, and I found myself sitting down to breakfast and dinner, day after day, as much alone as I should do if I called for a chop at a separate table in the Cathedral Coffee-house. \u0026nbsp;And yet at breakfast and dinner I made one of an assemblage of thirty or forty people. \u0026nbsp;That I thought dull.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But as I stood one morning on the steps before the hotel, bethinking myself that my throat was as well as ever I remembered it to be, I was suddenly slapped on the back. \u0026nbsp;Never in my life did I feel a more pleasant sensation, or turn round with more unaffected delight to return a friend’s greeting. \u0026nbsp;It was as though a cup of water had been handed to me in the desert. \u0026nbsp;I knew that a cargo of passengers for Australia had reached Cairo that morning, and were to be passed on to Suez as soon as the railway would take them, and did not therefore expect that the greeting had come from any sojourner in Egypt. \u0026nbsp;I should perhaps have explained that the even tenor of our life at the hotel was disturbed some four times a month by a flight through Cairo of a flock of travellers, who like locusts eat up all that there was eatable at the Inn for the day. \u0026nbsp;They sat down at the same tables with us, never mixing with us, having their separate interests and hopes, and being often, as I thought, somewhat loud and almost selfish in the expression of them. \u0026nbsp;These flocks consisted of passengers passing and repassing by the overland route to and from India and Australia; and had I nothing else to tell, I should delight to describe all that I watched of their habits and manners—the outward bound being so different in their traits from their brethren on their return. \u0026nbsp;But I have to tell of my own triumph at Suez, and must therefore hasten on to say that on turning round quickly with my outstretched hand, I found it clasped by John Robinson.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, Robinson, is this you?” \u0026nbsp;“Holloa, Walker, what are you doing here?” \u0026nbsp;That of course was the style of greeting. \u0026nbsp;Elsewhere I should not have cared much to meet John Robinson, for he was a man who had never done well in the world. \u0026nbsp;He had been in business and connected with a fairly good house in Sise Lane, but he had married early, and things had not exactly gone well with him. \u0026nbsp;I don’t think the house broke, but he did; and so he was driven to take himself and five children off to Australia. \u0026nbsp;Elsewhere I should not have cared to come across him, but I was positively glad to be slapped on the back by anybody on that landing-place in front of Shepheard’s Hotel at Cairo.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I soon learned that Robinson with his wife and children, and indeed with all the rest of the Australian cargo, were to be passed on to Suez that afternoon, and after a while I agreed to accompany their party. \u0026nbsp;I had made up my mind, on coming out from England, that I would see all the wonders of Egypt, and hitherto I had seen nothing. \u0026nbsp;I did ride on one day some fifteen miles on a donkey to see the petrified forest; but the guide, who called himself a dragoman, took me wrong or cheated me in some way. \u0026nbsp;We rode half the day over a stony, sandy plain, seeing nothing, with a terrible wind that filled my mouth with grit, and at last the dragoman got off. \u0026nbsp;“Dere,” said he, picking up a small bit of stone, “Dis is de forest made of stone. \u0026nbsp;Carry that home.” \u0026nbsp;Then we turned round and rode back to Cairo. \u0026nbsp;My chief observation as to the country was this—that whichever way we went, the wind blew into our teeth. \u0026nbsp;The day’s work cost me five-and-twenty shillings, and since that I had not as yet made any other expedition. \u0026nbsp;I was therefore glad of an opportunity of going to Suez, and of making the journey in company with an acquaintance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At that time the railway was open, as far as I remember, nearly half the way from Cairo to Suez. \u0026nbsp;It did not run four or five times a day, as railways do in other countries, but four or five times a month. \u0026nbsp;In fact, it only carried passengers on the arrival of these flocks passing between England and her Eastern possessions. \u0026nbsp;There were trains passing backwards and forwards constantly, as I perceived in walking to and from the station; but, as I learned, they carried nothing but the labourers working on the line, and the water sent into the Desert for their use. \u0026nbsp;It struck me forcibly at the time that I should not have liked to have money in that investment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well; I went with Robinson to Suez. \u0026nbsp;The journey, like everything else in Egypt, was sandy, hot, and unpleasant. \u0026nbsp;The railway carriages were pretty fair, and we had room enough; but even in them the dust was a great nuisance. \u0026nbsp;We travelled about ten miles an hour, and stopped about an hour at every ten miles. \u0026nbsp;This was tedious, but we had cigars with us and a trifle of brandy and water; and in this manner the railway journey wore itself away. \u0026nbsp;In the middle of the night, however, we were moved from the railway carriages into omnibuses, as they were called, and then I was not comfortable. \u0026nbsp;These omnibuses were wooden boxes, placed each upon a pair of wheels, and supposed to be capable of carrying six passengers. \u0026nbsp;I was thrust into one with Robinson, his wife and five children, and immediately began to repent of my good-nature in accompanying them. \u0026nbsp;To each vehicle were attached four horses or mules, and I must acknowledge that as on the railway they went as slow as possible, so now in these conveyances, dragged through the sand, they went as fast as the beasts could be made to gallop. \u0026nbsp;I remember the Fox Tally-ho coach on the Birmingham road when Boyce drove it, but as regards pace the Fox Tally-ho was nothing to these machines in Egypt. \u0026nbsp;On the first going off I was jolted right on to Mrs. R. and her infant; and for a long time that lady thought that the child had been squeezed out of its proper shape; but at last we arrived at Suez, and the baby seemed to me to be all right when it was handed down into the boat at Suez.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Robinsons were allowed time to breakfast at that cavernous hotel—which looked to me like a scheme to save the expense of the passengers’ meal on board the ship—and then they were off. \u0026nbsp;I shook hands with him heartily as I parted with him at the quay, and wished him well through all his troubles. \u0026nbsp;A man who takes a wife and five young children out into a colony, and that with his pockets but indifferently lined, certainly has his troubles before him. \u0026nbsp;So he has at home, no doubt; but, judging for myself, I should always prefer sticking to the old ship as long as there is a bag of biscuits in the locker. \u0026nbsp;Poor Robinson! \u0026nbsp;I have never heard a word of him or his since that day, and sincerely trust that the baby was none the worse for the little accident in the box.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now I had the prospect of a week before me at Suez, and the Robinsons had not been gone half an hour before I began to feel that I should have been better off even at Cairo. \u0026nbsp;I secured a bedroom at the hotel—I might have secured sixty bedrooms had I wanted them—and then went out and stood at the front door, or gate. \u0026nbsp;It is a large house, built round a quadrangle, looking with one front towards the head of the Red Sea, and with the other into and on a sandy, dead-looking, open square. \u0026nbsp;There I stood for ten minutes, and finding that it was too hot to go forth, returned to the long cavernous room in which we had breakfasted. \u0026nbsp;In that long cavernous room I was destined to eat all my meals for the next six days. \u0026nbsp;Now at Cairo I could, at any rate, see my fellow-creatures at their food. \u0026nbsp;So I lit a cigar, and began to wonder whether I could survive the week. \u0026nbsp;It was now clear to me that I had done a very rash thing in coming to Suez with the Robinsons.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Somebody about the place had asked me my name, and I had told it plainly—George Walker. \u0026nbsp;I never was ashamed of my name yet, and never had cause to be. \u0026nbsp;I believe at this day it will go as far in Friday Street as any other. \u0026nbsp;A man may be popular, or he may not. \u0026nbsp;That depends mostly on circumstances which are in themselves trifling. \u0026nbsp;But the value of his name depends on the way in which he is known at his bank. \u0026nbsp;I have never dealt in tea spoons or gravy spoons, but my name will go as far as another name. \u0026nbsp;“George Walker,” I answered, therefore, in a tone of some little authority, to the man who asked me, and who sat inside the gate of the hotel in an old dressing-gown and slippers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That was a melancholy day with me, and twenty times before dinner did I wish myself back at Cairo. \u0026nbsp;I had been travelling all night, and therefore hoped that I might get through some little time in sleeping, but the mosquitoes attacked me the moment I laid myself down. \u0026nbsp;In other places mosquitoes torment you only at night, but at Suez they buzz around you, without ceasing, at all hours. \u0026nbsp;A scorching sun was blazing overhead, and absolutely forbade me to leave the house. \u0026nbsp;I stood for a while in the verandah, looking down at the few small vessels which were moored to the quay, but there was no life in them; not a sail was set, not a boatman or a sailor was to be seen, and the very water looked as though it were hot. \u0026nbsp;I could fancy the glare of the sun was cracking the paint on the gunwales of the boats. \u0026nbsp;I was the only visitor in the house, and during all the long hours of the morning it seemed as though the servants had deserted it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I dined at four; not that I chose that hour, but because no choice was given to me. \u0026nbsp;At the hotels in Egypt one has to dine at an hour fixed by the landlord, and no entreaties will suffice to obtain a meal at any other. \u0026nbsp;So at four I dined, and after dinner was again reduced to despair.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I was sitting in the cavernous chamber almost mad at the prospect of the week before me, when I heard a noise as of various feet in the passage leading from the quadrangle. \u0026nbsp;Was it possible that other human beings were coming into the hotel—Christian human beings at whom I could look, whose voices I could hear, whose words I could understand, and with whom I might possibly associate? \u0026nbsp;I did not move, however, for I was still hot, and I knew that my chances might be better if I did not show myself over eager for companionship at the first moment. \u0026nbsp;The door, however, was soon opened, and I saw that at least in one respect I was destined to be disappointed. \u0026nbsp;The strangers who were entering the room were not Christians—if I might judge by the nature of the garments in which they were clothed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The door had been opened by the man in an old dressing-gown and slippers, whom I had seen sitting inside the gate. \u0026nbsp;He was the Arab porter of the hotel, and as he marshalled the new visitors into the room, I heard him pronounce some sound similar to my own name, and perceived that he pointed me out to the most prominent person of those who then entered the apartment. \u0026nbsp;This was a stout, portly man, dressed from head to foot in Eastern costume of the brightest colours. \u0026nbsp;He wore, not only the red fez cap which everybody wears—even I had accustomed myself to a fez cap—but a turban round it, of which the voluminous folds were snowy white. \u0026nbsp;His face was fat, but not the less grave, and the lower part of it was enveloped in a magnificent beard, which projected round it on all sides, and touched his breast as he walked. \u0026nbsp;It was a grand grizzled beard, and I acknowledged at a moment that it added a singular dignity to the appearance of the stranger. \u0026nbsp;His flowing robe was of bright colours, and the under garment which fitted close round his breast, and then descended, becoming beneath his sash a pair of the loosest pantaloons—I might, perhaps, better describe them as bags—was a rich tawny silk. \u0026nbsp;These loose pantaloons were tied close round his legs, above the ankle, and over a pair of scrupulously white stockings, and on his feet he wore a pair of yellow slippers. \u0026nbsp;It was manifest to me at a glance that the Arab gentleman was got up in his best raiment, and that no expense had been spared on his suit.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And here I cannot but make a remark on the personal bearing of these Arabs. \u0026nbsp;Whether they be Arabs or Turks, or Copts, it is always the same. \u0026nbsp;They are a mean, false, cowardly race, I believe. \u0026nbsp;They will bear blows, and respect the man who gives them. \u0026nbsp;Fear goes further with them than love, and between man and man they understand nothing of forbearance. \u0026nbsp;He who does not exact from them all that he can exact is simply a fool in their estimation, to the extent of that which he loses. \u0026nbsp;In all this, they are immeasurably inferior to us who have had Christian teaching. \u0026nbsp;But in one thing they beat us. \u0026nbsp;They always know how to maintain their personal dignity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Look at my friend and partner Judkins, as he stands with his hands in his trousers pockets at the door of our house in Friday Street. \u0026nbsp;What can be meaner than his appearance? \u0026nbsp;He is a stumpy, short, podgy man; but then so also was my Arab friend at Suez. \u0026nbsp;Judkins is always dressed from head to foot in a decent black cloth suit; his coat is ever a dress coat, and is neither old nor shabby. \u0026nbsp;On his head he carries a shining new silk hat, such as fashion in our metropolis demands. \u0026nbsp;Judkins is rather a dandy than otherwise, piquing himself somewhat on his apparel. \u0026nbsp;And yet how mean is his appearance, as compared with the appearance of that Arab;—how mean also is his gait, how ignoble his step! \u0026nbsp;Judkins could buy that Arab out four times over, and hardly feel the loss; and yet were they to enter a room together, Judkins would know and acknowledge by his look that he was the inferior personage. \u0026nbsp;Not the less, should a personal quarrel arise between them, would Judkins punch the Arab’s head; ay, and reduce him to utter ignominy at his feet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Judkins would break his heart in despair rather than not return a blow; whereas the Arab would put up with any indignity of that sort. \u0026nbsp;Nevertheless Judkins is altogether deficient in personal dignity. \u0026nbsp;I often thought, as the hours hung in Egypt, whether it might not be practicable to introduce an oriental costume in Friday Street.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At this moment, as the Arab gentleman entered the cavernous coffee-room, I felt that I was greatly the inferior personage. \u0026nbsp;He was followed by four or five others, dressed somewhat as himself; though by no means in such magnificent colours, and by one gentleman in a coat and trousers. \u0026nbsp;The gentleman in the coat and trousers came last, and I could see that he was one of the least of the number. \u0026nbsp;As for myself, I felt almost overawed by the dignity of the stout party in the turban, and seeing that he came directly across the room to the place where I was seated, I got upon my legs and made him some sign of Christian obeisance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I am a little man, and not podgy, as is Judkins, and I flatter myself that I showed more deportment, at any rate, than he would have exhibited.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I made, as I have said, some Christian obeisance. \u0026nbsp;I bobbed my head, that is, rubbing my hands together the while, and expressed an opinion that it was a fine day. \u0026nbsp;But if I was civil, as I hope I was, the Arab was much more so. \u0026nbsp;He advanced till he was about six paces from me, then placed his right hand open upon his silken breast,—and inclining forward with his whole body, made to me a bow which Judkins never could accomplish. \u0026nbsp;The turban and the flowing robe might be possible in Friday Street, but of what avail would be the outer garments and mere symbols, if the inner sentiment of personal dignity were wanting? \u0026nbsp;I have often since tried it when alone, but I could never accomplish anything like that bow. \u0026nbsp;The Arab with the flowing robe bowed, and the other Arabs all bowed also; and after that the Christian gentleman with the coat and trousers made a leg. \u0026nbsp;I made a leg also, rubbing my hands again, and added to my former remarks that it was rather hot.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Dat berry true,” said the porter in the dirty dressing-gown, who stood by. \u0026nbsp;I could see at a glance that the manner of that porter towards me was greatly altered, and I began to feel comforted in my wretchedness. \u0026nbsp;Perhaps a Christian from Friday Street, with plenty of money in his pockets, would stand in higher esteem at Suez than at Cairo. \u0026nbsp;If so, that alone would go far to atone for the apparent wretchedness of the place. \u0026nbsp;At Cairo I had not received that attention which had certainly been due to me as the second partner in the flourishing Manchester house of Grimes, Walker, and Judkins.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But now, as my friend with the beard again bowed to me, I felt that this deficiency was to be made up. \u0026nbsp;It was clear, however, that this new acquaintance, though I liked the manner of it, would be attended with considerable inconvenience, for the Arab gentleman commenced an address to me in French. \u0026nbsp;It has always been to me a source of sorrow that my parents did not teach me the French language, and this deficiency on my part has given rise to an incredible amount of supercilious overbearing pretension on the part of Judkins—who after all can hardly do more than translate a correspondent’s letter. \u0026nbsp;I do not believe that he could have understood that Arab’s oration, but at any rate I did not. \u0026nbsp;He went on to the end, however, speaking for some three or four minutes, and then again he bowed. \u0026nbsp;If I could only have learned that bow, I might still have been greater than Judkins with all his French.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2906/80033.html","bookId":1102,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:31:37 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:31:37 AM"}
