He had to succeed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Failure meant death for not only himself, but for all the Spartans . . . every human.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stood at the view screen in the cargo bay and reread the priority Alpha transmission Captain Keyeshad sent down:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alpha priority channel: To Fleet Admiralty from REACH Space Dock Quartermaster AI8575(a.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e k.a.

They’ve breached the perimeter. Fall back! Fall back! If anyone can hear this: the Covenant isgroundside. Massing near the armory . . . they’re—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief copied these files and sent them over his squad’s COM channel. They had a right toknow everything, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was only one reason the Covenant would launch a ground invasion: to take out the planetarydefense generators. If they succeeded, Reach would fall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And there was only one reason why the Covenant wanted the shipCircumference —to plunder its NAVdatabase—and find every human world, including Earth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Keyes appeared on the view screen. He held his pipe in one hand, squeezing it so tight hisknuckles were white. “Master Chief, I believe the Covenant will use a pinpoint Slipspace jump to aposition just off the space dock. They may try to get their troops on the station before the Super MACguns can take out their ships. This will be a difficult mission, Chief. I’m . . . open to suggestions.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We can take care of it,” the Master Chief replied.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Keyes’ eyes widened and he leaned forward in his command chair. “How exactly, MasterChief?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “With all due respect, sir, Spartans are trained to handle difficult missions. I’ll split my squad. Three willboard the space dock and make sure that NAV data does not fall into the Covenant’s hands. Theremainder of the Spartans will go groundside and repel the invasion forces.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Captain Keyes considered this. “No, Master Chief, it’s too risky. We’ve got to make sure the Covenantdoesn’t get that NAV data. We’ll use a nuclear mine, set it close to the docking ring, and detonate it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir, the EMP will burn out the superconductive coils of the orbital guns. And if you use thePillar ofAutumn ’s conventional weapons, the NAV database may still survive. If the Covenant search thewreckage—they may obtain the data.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “True,” Keyes said, and tapped his pipe thoughtfully on his chin. “Very well, Master Chief. We’ll gowith your suggestion. I’ll plot a course over the docking station. Ready your Spartans and prep twodropships. We’ll launch you—” he consulted with Cortana “—in five minutes.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Aye, Captain. We’ll be ready.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good luck,” Captain Keyes said, and snapped off the view screen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Luck. The Master Chief always had been lucky. He’d need luck more than ever this time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned to face the Spartans . . . his Spartans. They stood at attention.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly stepped forward. “Master Chief sir, permission to lead the space op, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Denied,” he said. “I’ll be leading that one.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He appreciated her gesture. The space operation would be ten times more dangerous than the ground op.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Covenant would outnumber them ten to one—or more—but the Spartans were used to taking thefight against numerically superior enemies. They had always won on the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The extraction of theCircumference database, however, would be in vacuum and zero gravity—and theymight have to fight their way past a Covenant warship to reach the objective. Not exactly idealconditions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Linda and James,” he said. “You’re with me. Fred, you’re Red Team Leader. You’ll have tacticalcommand of the ground operation.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir!” Fred shouted. “Yes, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Now make ready,” he said. “We don’t have much time left.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief regretted his unfortunate choice of words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spartans stood a moment. Kelly called out, “Attention!” They snapped to and gave the Master Chiefa crisp salute.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stood straighter and returned their salute. He was intensely proud of them all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Spartans scattered and gathered their gear, racing for the dropship bay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief watched them go.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was the mission the Spartans had been tempered for in mission after mission. It would be theirfinest moment . . . but he knew that it might also be their last moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Chief Mendez had said that a leader would be required to spend the lives of those under his command.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief knew he would lose comrades today—but would their deaths serve a necessarypurpose . . . or would they be wasted?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Either way, they were ready.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e John tapped the thrusters and rotated the Pelican dropship 180 degrees. He pushed the engines to fullpower to brake their forward momentum. ThePillar of Autumn had dropped them while she had beencruising at one-third full speed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They’d need every millimeter of the ten thousand kilometers between them and the docking station toslow down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief had taken the Spartan’s modified Pelican, rigged with explosives. The station wouldbe locked down—every airlock sealed. They’d have to blast their way in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He glanced aft. Linda checked one of the three sniper rifle variants she had brought. James inspected histhruster pack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had picked Linda because no other single Spartan was as efficient at long-range combat. And that’swhat the Master Chief wanted:long -range combat. If it came to hand-to-hand combat in zero gee withhordes of Covenant troopers . . . even his luck wouldn’t hold out too long.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had picked James because James had never quit. Even when his hand had been burned off, he hadshrugged off the shock—at least for a while—and helped them dispatch the Covenant behemoths onSigma Octanus IV. The Master Chief would need that kind of determination on this mission.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He took a long look out the front of the Pelican. Their sister dropship initiated a burn and hurtled towardReach.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelly, Fred, Joshua . . . all of them. Part of him longed to join them in the ground action.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The radar panel blinked a proximity warning; the Pelican was one thousand kilometers from the dockingring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief tapped the thrusters to align the dropship. He squelched the proximity alert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The alert immediately re-sounded. Strange. He reached for the squelch again—then stopped as he sawthe space around the Pelican change. Motes of green light appeared, pinpoints at first, which swelled likebruises on velvet black space. The green smears lengthened, compressed, and distorted the stars.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e —a Slipstream entry point.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Master Chief cut the Pelican’s engines, slowing them for impact.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Covenant frigate materialized a kilometer from the dropship’s nose. Its prow filled their view screen.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/975/29447.html","bookId":266,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:13:10 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:13:10 AM"}
