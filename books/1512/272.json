When Zheng entered the dragon\u0027s body and exploded with it, Kampa and WangXia both shouted. Even Xuan who was always emotionless showed a hint of anxiousness. His fingers were pale from gripping on the books too hard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After the remaining head of the dragon fell to the ground, Xuan drove the Sky Stick over and yelled. \"WangXia, check the exploded parts of the dragon. Kampa, shoot down the annoying jets!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa aimed his EMP rifle high at the jets. The bullets penetrated the two nearest jets and they exploded before reaching the ground. He was raging and using this as a vent for his anger. The EMP rifle sprayed on and exploded several more jets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WangXia rushed to the shattered pieces of the dragon\u0027s body. Yet, all there was were piles of broken flesh from the blast. How could he even find a trace of human from the piles? It seemed like Zheng was really dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan fell to a silence at the scene. They couldn\u0027t stay in this place for long since the rest of the fleet was sailing close. If they didn\u0027t leave now, they weren\u0027t ever going to leave. Xuan was about to step on the Sky Stick when he noticed the dragon\u0027s head was still in one piece.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said to Kampa. \"Shoot the dragon\u0027s head!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa fired at it without delay but a translucent barrier appeared. It looked so thin and was about to completely fade away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan yelled. \"WangXia, dig into the head with a knife. If this is a true dragon, there should be a dragonshard in its head. I suspect that\u0027s what gave it the immunity to firearms!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As a soldier, following orders had became an instinct for WangXia. He took out a knife and ran over to the head without thinking. The dragon\u0027s blood was at least 50C, but he went all the way in.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Half a minute later, WangXia came back out as he coughed. He yelled. \"You two come over here! Shit. Come bathe in the dragon\u0027s blood! I received notification that my cell vitality, reaction speed, muscle density, and immunization strength increased by 100 points each. Those blood entered through my skin and made my whole body itch.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan and Kampa was surprised then they both ran over. Xuan handed the two books to WangXia and said in a serious tone. \"Keep it safe. We need these two items to revive Zheng!\" Then he jumped into the dragon\u0027s eye.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa fired at the sky for a few more before entering. They came out panting after a short while.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa laughed out. \"Damn, we actually bathed in dragon blood!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan frowned. \"It\u0027s unfortunate. If Zheng is still here, the ring or dimensional bag can carry the blood. If this is like the dragons in legends, its flesh, bones, and whole body are a treasure.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WangXia took out a irregular shaped jade from the pocket. The jade was about the size of half his palm, glowing in a soft white color. Xuan received it and immediately heard a notification.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Obtained magical item dragonshard. Allows user to defend against long range high tech weapons by filling it with energy. Can sense energy fluctuation. Glows hot when it senses energy waves that are life threatening to the user. Accepts qi, blood energy, psyche force, magic, Nen, Xian energy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan said the notification out and surprised both Kampa and WangXia. However, they didn\u0027t have the time to ponder and followed Xuan onto the Sky Stick.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Sky Stick lifted up at its fastest speed. At the same time, they saw a dozen helicopters flying at them. Xuan glanced at the helicopters and said to Kampa. \"Give me fire support. Shoot down all the missiles. And hold on tight!\" He sped up the Sky Stick.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Sky Stick was slower than the jets but those jets couldn\u0027t get close due to the EMP rifle. Any jet that came close was shot down, even the missiles got shot down. Furthermore, the Sky Stick could fly under water. After they flew under water for several times, the jets lost their location and had to return to the carrier. Though that carrier might not even be able to let them land anymore.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The three of them were in a silence for quite some time until Kampa shouted in a rage. \"F*ck. Say something, Xuan! The newbies aren\u0027t part of our team but what about Zheng? I won\u0027t acknowledge you as the leader. He\u0027s the only one that I can accept! F*ck. I won\u0027t ever let go of the guilt if we don\u0027t revive someone that died for the team!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan replied calmly. \"Is there something to debate? We are definitely going to revive him. Team China isn\u0027t a team without him. Why do you think he gave us the books before he went? This is his only hope in coming back. God had notified us of a rank C reward and 4000 points. So each of us has gotten a rank B reward and 6000 points total. If we finish the third bonus mission, there\u0027s a high chance we can revive him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WangXia muttered. \"Didn\u0027t he say to give the third bonus mission to Gando? If you do this...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan replied coldly. \"That\u0027s mere naive mercy. If we completed this mission without casualty, then it wouldn\u0027t matter to give him the last mission, since he has some talents and can become a member of the team. However, do you think I will consider such mercy after Zheng\u0027s death? Our highest priority is to revive him before the next movie. Which means I must obtain 2500 more points and a rank D reward.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kampa asked. \"What is the cost to reviving a person?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan said. \"If the revival takes place in God\u0027s dimension, then it\u0027s the double of all the points and rewards he had received. This isn\u0027t possible since he had obtained too much. But the cost can be split among us three this way. Yet, for Zheng, we have to go to the altar in The Mummy\u0027s world. It costs a rank B reward and 8000 points to revive there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To open up that world, we will also need to use a rank D reward. Going from Cairo to the altar and back will take ten days if we consider the chance of accidents. I currently have 6000 points and a rank B reward so I must get 2500 more points and a rank D reward because I can\u0027t be certain if God allows us to split the cost outside the dimension. If we can\u0027t then one of us have to pay the cost alone.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xuan stopped here and bit his finger. Then he continued calmly. \"It doesn\u0027t matter if the newbies die. They haven\u0027t finished any movies so they cost nothing but their chance of revival to revive. The newbies can only be erased at this point. I will complete the third bonus mission!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both;\"\u003e \n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-12-chapter-8-04\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-13-chapter-1-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-13-chapter-1-01","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
