Seems like your family still has some friends left because it’s been taken care of, as they say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can’t tell anyone where you’re going and you’ll have to change your name. I’m thinking we’ll call you Lucas Williams. How about that? Do you like it? It has a nice ring, doesn’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have enough money for us to live a decent life. You could apply to the college and who knows? Or you can get a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll explain everything if you come. I hope you will come. I love you. Please get on the train. Just come. Trust me. Please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Girlfriend Formerly Known As Erin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run back into the kitchen and say, “What is this? Is this for real?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a chance to get out of here and start fresh,” Dad says. “Free and clear of your family history. It’s a chance at life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did this note come from?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t ask questions,” Pop says. “This is the real deal. A true chance. No strings attached.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do we know it’s not a trap?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A trap? You’ve been watching too many movies,” Pop says. “If they wanted to hurt you, they’d come to the house and hurt you. They wouldn’t buy you a train ticket and hurt you in New Hampshire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you have to do to make this happen?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” Dad says. “Except promise silence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not stupid,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad and Pop look at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s just say,” Pop says, “some of the older guys still feel bad about what happened to you when you were a kid, but they respected the fact that we kept our mouths shut when the cops came asking questions all those years ago. There are rules, but we’re not all monsters. Most guys do what they can when they can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The train leaves in two hours, so you have to make your decision now,” Dad says. “If you go, you can’t come back to Bellmont. Ever. And you’ll have to be careful about contacting us. They’ll explain the rules to you and you’ll have no choice but to obey every one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Those are the terms. We don’t get to ask why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember what Russ said about not being able to know why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit at the table opposite Pop and Dad and notice that their physical similarities are striking. I wonder if they’re thinking I look like a younger version of them. Three generations of McManuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I’m going away on mob money?” I say quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going away,” Pop says. “You’re not going to be taken care of for life. You’re just getting a ticket out of here and a chance to start over someplace better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about it and wonder about ethics. Do I really want to accept mob money, even if it’s only a little to help me relocate? Could I live with myself? After all they’ve done to my family, am I owed this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if I don’t go?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad shrugs. “Then you go to community college and live in Bellmont for another two years, minimum. And maybe you lose your best friend forever. This is most likely a one-shot chance here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will Rod be up there? Mr. and Mrs. Quinn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t know,” Pop says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI absolutely want to see Erin. But I don’t know about the rest. How can I choose between the two men who raised me—the only family I have—and the girl who’s been at my side since elementary school? It’s easy to choose between Bellmont and anywhere else, because I don’t want to end up alone rotting away in a row home drinking myself to death. I definitely want out of this town, but I don’t want to leave Pop and Dad behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think I should do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey look at their hands. Their eyes are welling up. They’ve already decided what I should do, which is why they gave me the envelope. But the final choice is mine alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s Russ,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell him anything,” Dad says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cross the living room, pinching myself to make sure I’m not dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I open the door, Russ peers through the screen and says, “What’s up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not going to school today,” I say. “Not gonna walk in graduation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? You sick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to lie to Russ, especially since I know this might be the last time I ever speak with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on, man?” he says. “You all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about what I can say to make him understand, and when I have it, I smile. “I just got a ticket to Hogwarts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Might be taking a train ride to a magical place that’s much better than here. Don’t tell any Muggles, okay? But I want you to know I’ll be all right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuss squints through the screen for a moment before he returns my smile and says, “She finally contacted you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can neither confirm nor deny that statement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no idea what’s going on, but I feel like I should hug you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can do that.” I step outside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuss and I hug. A real hug. Four arms. Big squeeze to say all the things we can’t or maybe won’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not going to ever see you again, am I?” Russ says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dunno.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be good to yourself, Finley. I wish you a beautiful life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish you a beautiful life too—many clear starry nights, and a few collegiate basketball records,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuss looks into my eyes the way he did when he first came to Bellmont—like he’s communicating with me—then smiles sadly and walks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch him stride down the street and he throws a few sky punches, which I take as a sign of approval, like he’s happy for me, so I return to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You going to get on the train?” Dad says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m scared to leave my family. It’s hard for me to think of being anywhere but Bellmont. Then I remember the night I spent with Russ in the country, how there are other places in the world, better places, and I say, “I’d really like to see Erin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePop nods once and then looks out the window. I’m surprised when he closes his eyes, fingers Grandmom’s rosary beads, and starts to mouth words. I’ve never seen Pop pray before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad and I go upstairs and pack up my belongings, which aren’t much. I stuff clothes and jackets and shoes into a duffel bag. Peel a few stars off the ceiling and slip those in too. I grab my framed picture of Mom and Dad and me, from back in the day, and then I find my basketball in the garage, because maybe Erin will want to shoot around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePop and Dad drive me to Thirtieth Street Station in Philadelphia, and on the way there they explain that a man will meet me in New Hampshire and that I am to ask no questions—none whatsoever. He will drive me to Erin, but he won’t say anything to me at all. I’ll know who he is, because he’ll call me Lucas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This seems crazy,” I say. “I’m a little freaked out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be fine,” Dad says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve already been through the worst part of your life,” Pop says. “Go be with Erin. She’s a good woman who loves you—the key to your happiness. Trust me. I know, because your grandmother was an even better woman. I would do anything to be with her now. Anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe park outside of a huge white building. Cars, taxis, and people are everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finley,” Pop says, just before I get out of the car. I turn around and am surprised to see the old man trembling. “I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay, Pop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your grandmother would have wanted you to have this.” Pop pulls her rosary beads over his head and then extends his arm toward me so that the black crucifix is dangling right in front of my face. “Maybe it will bring you luck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t take that.” I don’t even know what the rosary means, which prayers go with which beads, and they’ve been around Pop’s neck or fist ever since my grandmother died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will take it, Finley. Put it around your neck, under your shirt. If you only wear it one day in your life, let it be today. And then pass it down to your children when the time comes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the necklace on and open the back car door to give Pop a hug. His cheek is wet when it brushes against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad carries my bag and basketball. I follow him into the building, through what seems to be a food court, and into a beautiful room with a high ceiling and great columns. It reminds me a little of the Franklin Institute, where I saw that IMAX movie about stars and repairing the Hubble Space Telescope. I remember how Boy21 freaked out and left when he saw the space shuttle. How I wanted to follow him but wasn’t allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad and I check the departure times on a board that changes by flipping numbers and making this ticking noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s your train,” Dad says, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk to the right staircase and I get in line with my ticket and Erin’s letter in my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really feel like I’m going to Hogwarts,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s Hogwarts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind.” I suddenly wish I’d told Dad about Harry Potter, but this isn’t the time. Maybe I’ll send him a copy in the mail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry I wasn’t able to give you a better childhood, Finley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad’s eyelids are trembling now too, and in front of all these strangers. I really hope he doesn’t cry. I won’t be able to get on the train if he cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad,” I say, but nothing else comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whenever you get to missing us—if you do—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will definitely—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Think about your old man collecting tolls at three in the morning and your legless pop drinking beer all day, wearing a diaper. Go get yourself a better life. Do whatever it takes to make a good life for you and Erin. Irish people have been leaving their homes in search of better lives for many, many years. We’re very good at it. So go make the Irish proud.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hug Dad and start to feel the finality of what’s happening. I start to feel the tears coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then the line starts moving and it’s time to board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Erin will let you know the best way to contact us, but don’t worry about us, okay?” Dad says. “Be a good man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Love you, Dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We love you too.” Dad sticks his hand in my pocket, but before I can check to see what he put in there he’s handing me my bag and basketball, the ticket man is asking to see my ticket, and then I’m halfway down the stairs, looking over my shoulder at Dad, who is crying now and waving good-bye from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe platform is full of hot sticky air, and I’m surprised that my train is air-conditioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter seeing other people do it, I shove my bag into the space above my seat, and then sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart’s pounding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve never been on a train before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if I’ll meet friends during the ride, like Harry Potter did. I start to look around, but all I see are tired and grumpy-looking adults. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/boy21/page-27.html","bookId":2713,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:48 AM"}
