Look at this place.\" I le gestured around him to the dozens of trailers that filled the streets, the crews, the barricades blocking hordes of fans. \"He got them to fly me in from California. And when he wraps here, he\u0027s going to New Zealand to start the new Peter Jackson. He\u0027s on top of the world,\" Tom said with only the slightest glint of jealousy in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever before had good news made Julia feel so terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what brings you by?\" Tom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m in town for meetings with my editor,\" she lied. \"Then I\u0027m catching a plane to London. I\u0027ll be on tour in Europe for a few weeks.\" She was shamelessly scanning the street, looking for Lance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Tom said. \"He\u0027s in with Tiffany, but I can get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tiffany?\" she questioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Female lead. Nice girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Julia said, and tried with every ounce of resolve in her body not to crumble into dust and blow away. \"Are they ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom looked at her, then he nodded and said, \"Yeah, I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" That\u0027s terrible. \"That\u0027s great.\" \"Why don\u0027t you let me go get him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" she said, waving off the suggestion. \"I\u0027ve got to catch a plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure?\" Tom asked, unconvinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia smiled and said, \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanna leave a message?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about what she\u0027d say. But of the thousands of words she\u0027d written in her lifetime, she couldn\u0027t imagine stringing a half dozen together to say what she wanted him to hear. She could just say \"Hi\" like an old friend stopping in out of the blue and disappearing just as quickly. She could take a chance, say the words that had brought her running through traffic and airport security. Or she could say good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually ...\" She began digging in her bag. \"I just need to give him something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can do.\" Tom nodded and crossed his arms, waiting for his assignment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dug into her purse and removed her deck of cards. \"Can you give him these, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom looked at the ragged deck and seemed to wonder what kind of freak would return something you can buy brand-new for a buck twenty-eight at any corner store. \"Any message?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia shrugged, fighting tears. \"Just tell him he broke me of the habit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Tom said, taking the cards without trying to disguise his confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked away quickly, certain any more words would betray her. She focused on planting one foot in front of the other as she walked down the Manhattan sidewalk, surrounded by lights and cameras and action, as somewhere in her mind, the soundtrack of her life began to play, and the credits rolled on her romance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dodged the busy crews with their bright lights and long cables. They worked all around her, setting the scene, getting ready to make a perfect movie ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia always knew it was phony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, no one goes home with the fairy tale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWAY #101: Accept the hand you\u0027re dealt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue peace comes from accepting what you are—a self-sufficient entity, a deserving individual who is much more than just half of a whole. Sometimes happiness depends on understanding that even a losing hand of solitaire can be a great \u0026nbsp;way to pass the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—from 707 Ways to Cheat at Solitaire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It\u0027s good,\" Abby said without taking her eyes off the manuscript. \"Really, it\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few things Julia had picked up from being around professional critics, and one of them was that when a person feels the need to pay a minor compliment twice, they\u0027re probably hiding a major criticism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia knew she had it coming. She wanted to blame some of the manuscript\u0027s shortcomings on the tight schedule, the challenge of promoting and doing research at the same time, the fact that European stores didn\u0027t carry her favorite brand of pen. But those were just excuses. Julia knew too well where the blame belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a marketable book,\" Abby went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But . . .\" Julia prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jules, I\u0027m a fan.\" Abby leaned her small body onto the top of her oversized and impossibly tidy desk. She waved her hand, gesturing to the multimillion-dollar corporation around her. \"Everyone here knows it. I\u0027ve loved everything you\u0027ve ever published.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what you think, Julia thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even those sexy bodice-rippers you wrote way back when,\" Abby added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia nearly lost her lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t think I knew about those, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia could do nothing but be honest. \"No, I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reason I know is because I happen to be a very big fish in a not-so-big pond. They were good. I agree that they don\u0027t exactly \u0027go\u0027 with your nonfiction career, but they\u0027re nothing to be ashamed of. Books like that bought my house in the Hamptons.\" Abby shifted in her seat. \"I\u0027m getting off track. What I\u0027m trying to say is that I know you, kiddo. I know how you think and, more importantly, I know how you write. This\"—she tapped the manuscript with her glasses—\"is good. But it isn\u0027t you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s just a draft,\" Julia hurried to say. \"I\u0027ve still got to polish. You won\u0027t even recognize it in a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby shook her head. \"It won\u0027t change until you change. I don\u0027t know what this Lance Collins business did to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it shook your confidence, opened your eyes to something? I don\u0027t know. What I do know is that your first books were fresh. They were fun. But this sounds like work. I don\u0027t want to hurt your feelings—it really is good—but it isn\u0027t the work of a believer. Do you see what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia nodded, understanding perfectly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby went on. \"I could publish this tomorrow and it would debut at number one, and we\u0027d both make a load of money. Or we could sit on it until you get your voice back, and then we\u0027ll publish something that we both know is an actual Julia James book. Makes no difference to me. You make the call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia couldn\u0027t imagine how this woman could have risen to a position of power in a carpool, much less an entire industry. But, she supposed, there is an inherent strength in kindness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are we going to do?\" Abby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia thought about it. \"I\u0027m going to go home and hang up a picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby leaned back in her chair. \"I don\u0027t know what the hell you\u0027re talking about,\" she said, then kicked her feet up onto her desk. \"But let me know how it works out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you don\u0027t want me to meet you?\" Nina asked as Julia adjusted the grip she had on her cellular phone and looked around the terminal of the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"I think I\u0027ll rent a car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous! I haven\u0027t seen you in weeks. Come on,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll pick you up. We can go to Hideaway and get a pizza, then go to your ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really, Nina,\" Julia said, feeling a little guilty, but not so guilty that she was willing to let Nina derail the plan she\u0027d already gotten her heart set on. \"I\u0027m looking forward to driving. I\u0027ve been chauffeured and flown around for weeks now. I want to drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you can drive my car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a little time alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia, you\u0027ve been alone for a solid month and for thirty-four years before that. Don\u0027t you think you\u0027ve had enough alone time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia thought about it, then said, \"I need a little more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the rental car, heading home, her headlights sliced through the black, and it occurred to Julia that she didn\u0027t need them. She could feel her way, taste it, hear it. All she had to do was follow the flow of the land and the sound of water. It had been a long time since Julia had been homesick, not since she was living in New York, she guessed. Not since before the first book got published and she became famous for being the woman who wasn\u0027t waiting for someone to join her at the table. It took another trip to New York and a stranger sitting down beside her at Stella\u0027s to convince Julia James that, sometimes, the strength lies in the waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVeronica White was going to come out of retirement. During the past three weeks, Julia had realized something: she killed the Veronica in herself, then only the Ro-Ro would survive. Once she\u0027d figured that out, the rest became easy. In the flight from Dallas, she\u0027d pulled out a notebook and felt Veronica\u0027s words fly from her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her suitcase, she had a dozen home decor magazines and a list of ideas she\u0027d picked up in Paris. She\u0027d given Nina a blood oath that she was serious about the renovation. She couldn\u0027t wait to say good-bye to the leaky faucets and cracking walls that had framed the last three years of her life. It was time to start making permanent changes to the house, to everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drove down the gravel road in the darkness, ready to begin her grown-up life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headlights swept over the house, and she thought, Home sweet home, as she parked the car and popped the trunk. She lugged her suitcases onto the porch and struggled with the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen, at last, the door was open, she started inside but stopped short. Someone had fixed the door leading into the study. There was a fresh coat of paint on the wall. Have Nina and the contractors started? she wondered. But then she saw that new lights had been installed in the ceiling above the fireplace, and they were shining down, accenting her grandmother\u0027s painting, which hung, perfectly centered, above the mantle. She crept closer, wondering who had arranged that surprise. She studied the painting through t he lights\u0027 glow. Its brushstrokes, the way the oil caught the light. She stepped closer and heard the familiar creak of the floorboards, but another noise as well, something she knew but couldn\u0027t pinpoint, something . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, cards shuffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia turned to see Lance sitting at the dining-room table. He cut the cards, then looked at her. With a sly smirk, he said, \"I think it\u0027s time you learn how to play gin.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cheating-at-solitaire-cheating-at-solitaire-1/page-30.html","bookId":2751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:56 PM"}
