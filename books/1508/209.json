Especially the deep blue Thunder Lizard; it’s power was equal to a half-step Houtian realm martial artist.

They stood at the edge of the cliff, mouths dripping with unbridled fury as they roared at the cliff bottom. The Thunder Lizards could not fly. Let alone the peak Houtian realm Blue Thunder Lizard, even a Xiantian realm Thunder Lizard could not fly. They could only do so if they awakened the true potential in their bloodline, becoming an avatar of a Thunder Flood Dragon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSeveral of the Thunder Lizards were unwilling to let things go, constantly shooting blue lightning off the cliff. But by now, Lin Ming had already turned into a small spot in the distance. Besides the lightning attacks of two dark Blue Thunder Lizards, everything else missed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe speed of the lightning was too quick.

With just a few breaths of time, Lin Ming was already 1000 feet from the bottom.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming clenched his teeth and ignored the injuries he had taken. Lin Ming fiercely moved his true essence and spread his arms outwards. An invisible force generated under Lin Ming’s body as his falling speed suddenly decreased.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter a few moments, Lin Ming’s speed had come to a complete standstill. He took a spare set of clothes out of his spatial ring and quickly put it on. With a wave of his hand, he landed on a rock, sliding down towards the bottom of the cliff.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming then held onto a large tree that was at the bottom of the cliff, gasping for breath. Although he hadn’t been in any intense fights, just resisting the firestorm a while ago had consumed most of the true essence reserves in his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs he recalled the azure colored true essence that contained a hint of eternally immortal breath, Lin Ming was secretly startled.

He forcefully suppressed the churning blood in him, and turned to run down the mountain. He wanted to immediately leave Thundercrash mountain in one go. If he ran 180 miles and changed directions a few times and then, hide in a bunch of tall grass, he didn’t believe that the Thunder Flood Dragon could still find him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThinking of the harvest he had in his spatial ring, Lin Ming’s thoughts heated up with delight.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese were the thunder-attribute treasures that the Thunder Flood Dragon had saved up for 10,000 years!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd yet, he had picked them like peaches. If the Thunder Flood Dragon discovered this, he was afraid that it would probably swallow him alive just to vent its anger.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith the aid of the concept of wind, Lin Ming was able to quickly descend the mountain. Because he was already far away from the Thunder Flood Dragon, he didn’t need to be discrete. He launched his movement technique and leapt several hundred feet into the air; this ability was similar to flight.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter he passed the snow mountain region, he reached the mountainside.

The lightning attacks from the Thunder Lizard weren’t much, but the flames from the Vermillion Bird continued to grow. Although it had been overwhelmed before by the azure true essence, now it had suddenly resurged, like a wildfire that met a spring breeze.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf he had the support of the Flame Essence, Lin Ming wouldn’t be too alarmed. But, the rogue fires in his body had already left the Flame Essence.
