What did you think? You think she was never gonna get tired of the constant, hardcore sexathons you had on board. She told me about them. Women coming on board to cum. She hates you for never picking her, and your obsession with me has only provoked it. I guarantee James got to her, she’s the weak link.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked sickened, “You are better at this, than I am giving you credit for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed at him, “No, you were blinded by the tight piece of ass, who you could pay to cook and clean and not have to spoon in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t laugh. He looked like he might actually be sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Sixteen – Blood debt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe boarded the plane and, instantly, I felt sick. Roxy smiled and waved. Luce, Coop, and Jack were in the dark, but they were still cautious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The pilot said he didn’t know where we were going?” Roxy said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario smiled at her softly, “No. I wanted to keep it our secret.” He walked past her to the pilot, who I had yet to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brief look of confusion crossed her face, as she went to the back of the plane. I liked her. I hated that she had betrayed a man she suspected of doing horrid things. She knew he was bad and, no doubt, feared quitting. Then James had come along and threatened her, using his government ties to bribe her into working with him. I can only assume it was how it happened, but I was willing gamble on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnically, she had made the right choice, the just choice. But my kids were part of the things that prevented me from helping her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let her go to the back of the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took my seat, my usual seat, and waited for us to take off, and for the shit to hit the fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce gave me a grave look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winked subtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve hadn’t come. Servario had put him to work elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just Roxy, the mystery pilot, and us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped paying attention to anything and everything. I had a sickening guilt twisting inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sacrificing another person for my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop was staring at me when I looked up. He mouthed, “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twitched a no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t as good at mouthing things as he and Servario were. I could still read lips as fast as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop mouthed again, “You want me to make you feel better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came over and sat in the pod next to me, Servario’s usual spot. I wondered if Servario would care if Coop was sitting there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop leaned in, “You have to let it slide. Just think, she made her bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my lips together and then whispered, “I can’t. I have a terrible feeling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and went to the front of the plane. He came back a minute later with a tray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed when Coop put it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI licked my wrist and held it out. He shook the salt on mine and then his and poured the shots. He poured four instead of two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded at Jack and Luce. They were sitting beside each other up front, but both got up and made their way to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah.” Luce laughed and licked her wrist. Jack shook his head, “I’m not good at this one. Tequila makes me throw up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce shook her head, “What is your deal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack hesitated and licked his wrist. Coop salted and passed out the shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his up, “To our families, wherever they are. May they be safe, wherever they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack added, “And may they never know about how close the world comes to ending or what we really do for a living.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted, “Cheers to that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe clanked, licked, drank and sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack walked away, with his glass and a sour face. Luce laughed, “I’ll go make sure he’s okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at them walking back to their seats and gave Coop a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me like I was insane, “Duh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? I didn’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop shook his head, whispering, “That dress made everyone see her differently. Jack may never be the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and whispered, “I seriously thought she was gay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a look, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “She seems like one of the boys….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario interrupted my sentence, “You used to be like that.” I glanced up at Servario standing next to me. I hadn’t even noticed him coming back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squinted, “I was not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario folded his arms across his chest, “You were. You were the sharpest shooter, and had to be the fastest runner, and could drink everyone under the table. You were.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop laughed, “I heard the same reports.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him, blushing, “I must have forgotten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop smirked, “The best agents are ‘one of the boys’. They fit in; first rule of being an agent, F.I.F.O. It means Fit In or Fuck Off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand out for another shot. I looked up at Servario, “What if it isn’t her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a look and walked to the back of the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took off but Roxy never came back, neither did Servario.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop poured me a third shot. I couldn’t stop my eyes from darting to the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank the shot smoothly, fighting the shudder I wanted to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy belly rumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop laughed, “I’m starving too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over at him, “How are we going to clean this all up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “This mess is huge. I don’t even know. Right now we’re riding with enemy number one. Me, Luce and Jack all went off the reservation, so we’re as guilty as you now. They’ll find a way to pin this on us too. Being with Servario is only making it easier for them to do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and sighed, “I know, and yet, I have the feeling that he is the only person we can actually trust.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened one eye when he didn’t say anything. He looked stricken, “I agree,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the strangest of reasons, Coop’s words didn’t make me feel better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eye again and let the comfy pod take me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up with a start. I looked around the plane, Luce and Jack were leaned up against each other. Coop was sound asleep next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must have been the thing that woke me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unbuckled and walked to the back of the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop, we shouldn’t be doing this here,” Roxy said, in between ragged breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach clenched, “Oh God,” I whispered to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was fucking Roxy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was betraying me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze and prepared myself for what I was about to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I want to see it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t, it didn’t feel the same as before. The conversations we’d had since then, changed everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut had they? Had I fallen for his smooth lines and sexy ways?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moaned again, “Oh my God, Gustavo… please!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached for the curtain to the dressing room and ripped it back fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hands were tied to the roof with blood trails running down them. Her face was beaten. Servario’s hands were cut from hitting her. He looked back with a savage expression, “Get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head and fought the motherly urge to dive in front of the blow he gave her, with the back of his hand. She cried out again, shaking her head and sniffling. “Please, Evie, help me. Please. I swear, whatever you think is missing or whatever, I didn’t do it. I wouldn’t do that to you, Gustavo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario shoved me back and closed the curtain. The look on his face was scarier than anything I had ever seen. His eyes were completely black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cried out moments later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped, stepping away from it. My back pressed against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was innocent. I was wrong. I had a terrible feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sunk to the floor, shaking and forcing myself to listen to each strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could beat a woman that badly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed in a long series of shrieks and bleats like a sheep. Whatever he was doing, was bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“FUCK YOU!” she screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear him speaking in low, hushed tones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“EVIEEEEEEE! EVIE, SAVE ME!” she screamed and sobbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know I was shaking, until I felt the still of Coop against me. He wrapped around me, holding me tight to him. Instead of stopping the madness, he carried me to a row of seats and sat, holding me like a child. I was cradled against his chest. But even the distance couldn’t stop the screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to help her. I was wrong. I was wrong. Please,” I pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop shook his head, “You didn’t do this, Evie. If he suspects her, then we have to let it play out. We need to know who we’re against. Without her, we’ve got nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt tears streaming down my cheeks, “What if she’s innocent?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, “There is no magic pill to determine that. Torture is the best way. You’ve been trained, you know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crawled off of him and sat in the chair next to him, “I haven’t been part of this world for a long time. And technically, I was never part of anything like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screaming never died down for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt started to dull in my mind though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe flew for a long time before Servario came out. He had blood spatter all over him. He sat next to Coop and I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have a list of names and a location for James.” Servario’s voice was distant and disturbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him, “Is she… dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “No. I’m not done with her. He stared forward at the wall in front of us with the huge, blank, flat-screen TV on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop was the one to talk first, “Sorry man, that’s rough having to do that to a girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario clenched his jaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down and waited to get off the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe touched down in the dark again. It felt like we were always in the dark. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-37.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
