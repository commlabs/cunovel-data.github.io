Handing all my problems over to him wasn’t what this relationship was about. “What about the movers?” I asked, not sure where to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re coming to pack your things and move them to Jax’s place in Sea Breeze for now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t stay at Jax’s place,” I said, thinking about his mother showing back up again. There was a good chance my momma would scratch her eyes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re only staying tonight. We leave for New York in the morning, and your mother’s surgery is scheduled for the next day, with the best surgeon money can buy. Her recovery and chemo will also be held there, and you’re staying in the penthouse we stayed in when we were there together. It’s reserved for Jax when he needs it. He’s already got it booked for you and your mother. When she’s ready, her things will be waiting for her in a two-bedroom gulf-front condo at the Turquoise Place. Complete with maid service.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jason, you can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can and I’m going to. I told you I was taking care of you. Let me do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Buying my momma a condo is going a little overboard,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have an ulterior motive,” he said, bending his head so he could press a kiss to my neck. “If your momma is happy and secure, I can convince you to move in with me. I’ve got my own apartment in Boston and no roommates. I don’t want to leave you for entire weeks at a time, and if I have you with me, I can focus on actually passing my classes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis all sounded too perfect. “What happens when you get tired of me or you realize I’m not cut out for your future?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll never get tired of you. In fact, the more I’m around you the crazier I get about you. And what future of mine are you not cut out for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t raised to be a politician’s wife like Johanna,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason chuckled and took a nip at my earlobe. “Thank God, because I’m not letting a politician near my woman. Can’t trust the bastards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head so he had to look at me instead of kissing my ear. “I’m talking about you,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. “Oh, right. More of my mother’s talk, I assume. Well, let me assure you that I don’t intend to ever be a politician. Not interested in it and never will be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t want to be a politician. I wasn’t hindering his career. “Then my history as a stripper won’t hurt you in the future?” I asked, hating to point out an obvious concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and ran his thumb over my bottom lip. “Stop worrying, Jess. The only thing that can hurt my future is if you don’t agree to move in with me, because I can’t concentrate without you near me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted this. All of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this for real?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the apartment opened. “I’m starving, and he said he was gonna feed me. Go get your clothes on and deal with the fact that you got that fairy tale you wanted,” Momma said with a wink, and turned to walk back inside, then stopped and laughed before looking back at me. “Guess in the end it was Logan after all. And all this time I assumed it would be Jess who won Rory in the end. Huh. I was wrong. I’ll be damned. I need to go rewatch that last season and see where I missed it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she closed the door behind her, I turned back to Jason. His frown was directed at me. “Who is Logan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered my mouth to muffle the laugh I couldn’t hold back and shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason’s frown wavered. He couldn’t figure out why I thought this was so funny, which only made me laugh harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Logan, Jess. Who is Logan?” he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to control my laughter and wiped the tears from my eyes. “He is Rory Gilmore’s wealthy boyfriend,” I managed to get out over another giggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rory who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gilmore. My mother thinks all life’s problems can be solved via Gilmore Girls,” I said, and his confused expression was still there. “You do know what Gilmore Girls is, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A television show. It ran for, like, seven seasons,” I explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason looked back at the apartment door Momma had walked into. “I’m so confused.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just laughed again and pressed a kiss to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJASON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess stood in my bedroom at Jax’s beach house, looking out the window and smiling. I walked into the room and wrapped my arm around her. She loved me, and she trusted me to take care of her. I followed her gaze outside and saw her mother in a skimpy bikini lying out at the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She might be enjoying herself just a little too much,” Jess said, the amusement in her voice clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see where you got those excellent genes,” I replied, and a small elbow jabbed me in the stomach. “Ow,” I said, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t go checking my momma out. I know she still looks good in a bikini,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s hot for her age. That’s all I’m saying. You by far have the more rocking body,” I assured her, turning her around in my arms. “And I can’t seem to stop touching it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess looked up at me through her lashes. “You’ve been holding me. Not touching me,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to stare at me with that sexy pout, then stuck her tongue out and let it run over her bottom lip. “Sit down, Jason,” she said, and shoved me back until the backs of my legs hit the chair behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turn on your music,” she said, handing me my iPhone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” I managed to ask as she bent forward and ran her hands up my thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Turn on the music. Something sexy,” she said, standing back up so that her cleavage was right under my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t take my eyes off her. I was afraid I would miss something. I glanced down until I found Nelly and clicked “Hot in Herre,” then sent it to the speakers in my room before dropping my phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess grinned wickedly at my song choice and started moving her hips in ways that should be illegal as she slowly began removing her clothing. I wanted to help her and get her naked fast, but her eyes stayed locked on me as she danced, making it hard for me to move. I was fascinated. Nothing had ever been this sexy. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear myself panting as each piece of clothing fell to the ground forgotten. When she wiggled out of her panties, I started to reach for her, but she held up her hand and shook her finger. “No, no,” she said, and kicked open my legs. She moved between them and grabbed the back of the chair and began giving me a lap dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You get to touch,” she whispered in my ear as her hard nipples brushed against my chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Does that make me special?” I asked, playing along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very, very special,” she said, pressing a kiss to my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good, because I don’t think I’m gonna last through the entire song,” I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then don’t,” she said, grinning at me and biting her bottom lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached up and cupped her face with my hands. “Give me that lip,” I said, pulling it into my mouth and enjoying the plumpness of it before tasting her. She sank down onto my lap and gave up all pretense of dancing when she wrapped her arms around my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had never expected to fall in love, but then, I’d never imagined anyone like Jess. She was one beautiful contradiction. The idea of letting someone else own my heart wasn’t appealing. It sounded weak and foolish. Something meant for the words of a song. I was wrong. When I thought about my future now, Jess was all that I could see, and that was all I needed. I couldn’t ask for more. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/misbehaving-sea-breeze-6/page-36.html","bookId":1990,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:43 AM"}
