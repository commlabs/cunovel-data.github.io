And yes, there is such a thing as stupid questions. That was one of them. Of course I’m going to be there with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips spread into a wide, beautiful smile. “I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cocky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Confident.” I kissed her softly. “I love you, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to wrap her arms around me, but I moved away, climbing over the side of the bed. “Hey!” She frowned. “Get back here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope. We got stuff to do.” I took her hands, hauling her off the bed. “And if you start feeling me up, we aren’t going to get anything done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on her face was bemused. “What are we doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bent, picking her up over my shoulder, and then pivoted toward the door. “We got some tickets to book.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTexas was ungodly hot. Like the circles of hell kind of hot. Even in the shaded interior of the rental car with cool air blasting from the vents, the heat seeped in from every tiny crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t believe that I was actually in Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze drifted from the marble fountain to the monstrous-sized house. Avery hadn’t been joking when she said her parents were rich. They were like the 1 percent. Hell, maybe even the half of a percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning back in the driver’s seat, I blew out a long breath. “Fuck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortcake was inside that place, with a mom that made Anthony Bates mommy look stable and loving. And I was out here, waiting in the car, half tempted to dive into the fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d been in there for at least ten minutes and she hadn’t wanted me to go inside with her. Probably because she knew I’d lose my shit with a quickness. When she had opened up to me that day, she really hadn’t gone into a lot about her parents with the exception of how they had responded to what had happened to her, but over the last couple of weeks she’d told me about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what I did know, I didn’t like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the fifteen-minute mark, I couldn’t sit any longer. I climbed out of the car and stepped into the sweltering heat. Sliding my cap around, I pulled the brim down to shield the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked around the rented sedan, eyeing the entrance to the house. The marble columns were a nice touch. As I turned, gazing out over the manicured landscape that went as far as I could see, there wasn’t a single person moving about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was empty, and in spite of the body-breaking temps, it was cold. I couldn’t picture Shortcake growing up in this kind of atmosphere or figure out how she’d come out as warm and loving as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shirt was already beginning to stick to my shoulders as I returned to the fountain. Closing my eyes, I willed my legs not to turn around and bust up into that house. I knew Shortcake needed to do this on her own, but I hated that she was facing them without me by her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuck out my hand, letting the warm water trickle across my open palm. What would her parents think if I took a dip? I was half tempted. I was also five seconds away from barging into the house when I heard a door shut behind me. Turning, I saw Avery heading down the wide stone stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was smiling broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t been expecting that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension seeped out of my shoulders as I jogged around the car, catching her in the middle of the circular driveway. “How’d it go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah . . .” She rose onto the tips of her sandaled feet, slanted her head and kissed me. “It went as expected.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held on to her hips, my fingers tightening as a surge of lust and love and a thousand other complicated emotions roared through me. “Want to tell me about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Over dinner?” She started to move away, but I captured her hand, holding her in place. “I’m going to take you to Chuy’s—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Avery?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteel poured down my spine at the sound of her name and I tightened my hold on her hand. She turned as my gaze narrowed on the tall man walking down the front stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark brown hair was gray at the temples and he didn’t look a day over fifty. He was dressed as if he were heading out to the golf club, pants pressed and polo shirt tucked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he says something ignorant, I cannot promise I will not lay him out right here, right now,” I warned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed my hand. “Hopefully that won’t become an issue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just saying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father stopped in front of us, his eyes—identical to Shortcake’s—looked from his daughter to where our hands were joined together. I dared him to say one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Cameron Hamilton,” she said, clearing her throat. “Cam, this is my father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince it would be rude to give him the middle finger or punch him in the face, I extended my free hand. “Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook my hand. “Nice to meet you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s up, Dad?” she asked when I didn’t return the polite greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Morgansten dragged his eyes from me, and his gaze landed on his daughter for maybe a fraction of a second before flicking away. I could see the age on him now, settling in the creases around his eyes and mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis chest rose with a deep breath and then said, “You know what I’ve missed most of all? I miss watching you dance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortcake was handling everything better than I thought she would, which meant I hadn’t given her enough credit. The girl was stronger than any of us realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver dinner she told me how everything had gone down, and I was angry and disappointed for her when it came to how she was received by her so-called mother, but Avery had done what she had come here to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it seemed her father expressed at least some amount of remorse or distress. The dancing comment . . . I got what it meant. There were so many things that Avery lost out on, and due to their own ignorance, so had her parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still wanted to see Molly tomorrow, and no matter what I tried over dinner to change her mind, she was determined and I was going to support her the best I could. But to be honest, I wanted nothing more than to get her back home and away from all of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we returned to the hotel room that evening, Shortcake immediately disappeared into the bathroom to take a quick shower. I watched her retreating form with an arched brow. She had been acting weird since the end of the dinner, in a hurry to get back here. I had no idea what she was up to, but I forced myself to lie down instead of joining her in the shower, which was something I wanted to do really, really badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI discovered the remote control and was still trying to figure out what channel was what when steam rolled out from the opened bathroom door about twenty minutes later. I looked up and the air halted in my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood in the doorway, her hair a dark red, clinging to her shoulders. She wore only a white towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, speechless as my gaze swept over her, starting at the tips of her painted toes and ending at her flushed cheeks. My skin tightened as she walked to where I sat, her fingers curling around the knotted towel between her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes. “Avery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe placed a hand on my shoulder and climbed up, like she had done the evening on the couch, straddling me. “Cam?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small grin split my lips; it was all I could manage as I clutched her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you up to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.” She paused. “Everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze dipped to the knot. “Those are two opposite things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” She pressed down on my erection, sending a bolt of red-hot pleasure through me. “Kiss me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t give me a chance to respond, which was fine by me. Her lips brushed over mine, a sweet sweeping of her lips. My hold on her hips tightened when she parted my lips with her tongue. The kiss went on until I was aching for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, I was always aching for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Touch me,” she whispered. “Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho in the hell was I to deny her? I ran my hands under the hem of the towel, gliding them over her thighs, coming close to the center of her heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now,” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed at her bold demand, but I wouldn’t be rushed. I brushed the back of my hand over her dampness, smiling when she moaned. “What do you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a sound of frustration. “I want you to touch me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBringing my fingers close to where she wanted me, I retreated quickly. “I am touching you, sweetheart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes flashed. “You know what I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please.” She pressed her forehead to mine. “Please touch me, Cam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned back, brushing our lips together. “Well, when you say it like that, I think I get what you mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finally,” she groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed again and then nipped at her chin. Her body jerked when I cupped her between the thighs. “Like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I kissed the center of her throat, I slipped a finger into her wetness. “And this?” My voice was gruff, heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer back arched. “Uh-huh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping an arm around her so she didn’t tumble backward, I pressed down on her clit. Her body tensed in the most amazing way. “What about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hips tipped forward. “Oh, yeah. Definitely that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely that?” I pumped my finger in and out of her slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery moaned, and I could listen to a chorus of them all day, but then she reached between us and unraveled the knot. The towel slipped away from her, fluttering to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand stilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart jumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cock hardened and throbbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosy breasts thrust up, cheeks flushed, and legs spread wide over mine. . . . Dammit, she was . . . she was stunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my other hand over her breast, fixated when the tip puckered. “Fuck, Avery . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe placed her hand over mine. “Don’t stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t planning on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not what I meant.” Reaching with her other hand, she found the zipper on my jeans. “I want you, Cam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have me.” I moved to her other breast. “You so fucking have me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery smiled as she wrapped her hand around my wrist, pulling my hand away from her heat. “I really want you.” She unzipped my pants, her fingers brushing me, and I shuddered. “Don’t you want me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More than you know.” I groaned as she palmed me. “Avery . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand disappeared, and I didn’t know if I should be grateful or if I should start cussing. But then she tugged my shirt up, over my head. “I want this, Cam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her words sunk in through the red haze fogging my thoughts, I inhaled deeply. “Are you sure, Avery? Because if you’re not, we don’t have—” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust-in-me-wait-for-you-0/page-38.html","bookId":2002,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:30 PM"}
