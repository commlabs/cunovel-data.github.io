We could do it in the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean the assignment,\" Trevor said, raising an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you going to admit that you are avoiding me because you\u0027re hot for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When hell freezes over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should know about hell-you live there. How about you step up to the plate and finish the job?\" Trevor challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought for a moment. I was slightly taken with the idea of having my owngoth fashion magazine like Becky and I had discussed, but I couldn\u0027t possibly share that with Trevor. I\u0027d only be ridiculed. Instead I said, \"Okay, Soccer Boy. Figure out a career for me. Something that will make me money so I can be self-reliant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor opened his notebook. I could see several typed pages of his essay were already complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with a man taking care of you?\" he asked.\"Someone rich.And powerful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already have that.\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And blond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like dark hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And popular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did have me on that. Neither Alexander nor I were popular.But Trevor Mitchell? He could have been voted prom king in the first grade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t fame important to you?\" he asked, inching closer.\"Everyone knowing your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they already do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not for the right reasons,\" he said with a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not interested in being famous. I\u0027m interested in being me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor shook his head and jotted a few notes down in his notebook. \"So where did we leave off? Do your parents want you to follow in their footsteps? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Is this over yet?\" I whined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you like to do on a rainy day?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you like to do on a sunny day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doyou think of yourself as creative?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t?\" he asked, surprised. \"With the way you dress and make yourself up? I think you\u0027ve always been creative. Like a clown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to take you down now? Or do it in front of the class?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down. What is your favorite outfit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm.My corset prom dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you close your eyes, who do you dream about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you had one guy in school to kiss, who would that be?\" he asked, leaning toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t on the sheet. None of these questions are, bonehead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Trevor, sometimes it was difficult to keep straight who was kidding who.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just making sure you were paying attention.Fve finished the interview portion. Now I can just write the essay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So- we don\u0027t have to meet again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve finished my part,\" he said coyly, and gave me the completed interview sheet. \"Now it\u0027s time to finish your questions about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor\u0027s interview sheet was blank. I quickly jotted down some answers to the questions and handed it to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t get an A for handwriting,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor and I rose and dusted the dirt off our jeans. \"Our next date will be in front of class,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help but feel a twinge of kindness toward him, as he had inadvertently helped Alexander remain in the Mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m off to meet my father,\" he said as he got into hisCamaro . \"Did you hear? My dad might buy the Mansion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped dead in my tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHegrinned a wicked grin. \"I was waiting to tell you until after I got my interview portion completed... We were talking about the Mansion at dinner last night and how word around town is no one will buy it because it\u0027s a hideous money pit. My dad said that the land upon which it sits is valuable property in its own right. It will be cheaper to hire a wrecking ball and bulldozer. Just thought you\u0027d want to know. It\u0027ll make a great strip mall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was floored. I had no idea my own plan would turn against me. And of course, Trevor was just the person to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No- you can\u0027t buy it!\" I said,my body filled with rage. \"You can\u0027t buy it-and you can\u0027t tear it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I can\u0027t, Monster Girl. But my dad can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor\u0027s father owned half the town ofDullsville . I wouldn\u0027t ever want Benson Hill to fall into that half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell my dad to save a few bricks when he tears it down. You can have them as a souvenir. I won\u0027t charge you very much, since they\u0027re worthless,\" he said, and rolled up his window and sped off. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-25.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
