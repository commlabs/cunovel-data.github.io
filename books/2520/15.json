Deep and rich and ragged, as if my name had been pushed through a meat grinder. Why was that so smexy? And how was the voice I heard now the same one I’d heard in my visions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me?” I managed to squeak out. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid question. I knew why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored me, thank God, saying to Kat, “Let go of Frosty’s leash. You’re choking the life out of him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed to tiny slits, a sure sign of her aggression. “He deserves to choke. He didn’t keep Little Frost in his pants this summer.” The words snapped like a whip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He did,” Cole snapped back with unwavering confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did,” he said, calm now despite her growing fervor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head would have zinged back and forth as if I were watching a tennis match, but Cole hadn’t taken his eyes off me and I didn’t have the strength to pull away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not, not, not!” she shouted with a stomp of her foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he looked at her, releasing me from the force field of that otherworldly gaze. “What are we, five?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six.” Kat anchored her hands on her hips. “So tell me this. Do you know Frosty remained faithful to me because you were with him every minute of every day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t think so. Ali?” she said, and I knew what she was asking. Did I want her to stay with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine,” I said, still squeaking. Come on and grow that pair of lady balls Kat \u0026nbsp;thinks you already have. There’s still time to bring home the victory on \u0026nbsp;this one. I’d lived through hell on earth. This should be nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole returned his attention to me, expectant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine,” I repeated, for my benefit rather than Kat’s. At least I’d sounded halfway normal. I would get this meeting over with, get my questions answered, and boom, everything would go back to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just remember what I told you.” Off she skipped, leaving me alone with Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had she told me? That he was dangerous—check. That he still hung out with his ex—check. That he liked to body slam and throat smash—double check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have Mrs. Heldermon next,” he said, a statement not a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Surprise filled me, and not just because he hadn’t cussed, as I’d previously imagined. “How did you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe massaged the back of his neck, just like he’d done when he’d talked with Mackenzie. Please tell me that wasn’t a sign of irritation. “My class is in the same building. Yesterday I saw you go into the room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, I’d never seen him—and I’d looked. Oh, how I’d looked. Either my powers of observation were lacking, or his ability to camouflage himself was incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kicked into motion. Everyone who spotted us did a double take. Friends were nudged and heads were quickly turned in our direction. It was like we were on a screen playing the newest reality show—Survivor: Asher High—and they were our trusted viewers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we were out of eavesdropping range, Cole said, “Whatever you’re doing to me each morning—” a hint of anger bloomed in his tone “—you need to stop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze whisked up to his face so fast I almost gave myself whiplash. “Whatever I’m doing to you? How about what you’re doing to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What am I doing to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike I was really going to mention my craziness without confirmation of his. “You tell me.” Because really, he could be talking about something totally different. Maybe he wanted me to stop eye-stalking him, as I’d first assumed. Maybe he wanted me to stop conversing with his friends, even when they cornered me like a rabid animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kept walking, neither of us saying anything else. I wanted to wait him out, but I lacked the willpower and ultimately cracked. “So…who did you fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only a beat of hesitation before he responded, “No one you’d know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnnnd more silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO-kay. He’d arranged this little meeting, had asked me two questions and now had nothing to say to me. That was a…relief. Yes, a relief and not a huge disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll too soon—uh, I mean, a torturous eternity later—we reached my classroom and stopped. “Thanks for the escort, but let’s not do this again sometime,” I muttered. Forget answers. I could live without them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stretched his arm in front of me, flattening his palm against the door frame, preventing my escape. “I’m sorry about Mackenzie,” he said, and some of his animosity had drained. “She won’t bother you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that was something at least. “I wasn’t worried,” I replied honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips quirked at the corners, as if he were fighting a smile. “You should be worried. She can be a… Mean. Very mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had he stopped himself from calling her? A ~bleep~? (Kat would have been so proud. I couldn’t even cuss in my mind.) “I’m still not worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sorta smile stretched wider. “Have you ever been in a fight?” With his free hand, he pinched a lock of my hair and rubbed the strands together. “Because you look like something out of a fairy tale.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The wicked witch?” I couldn’t help but ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please. The princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, had he just given me a compliment? Couldn’t have. There’d been something sharp in his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed two kids standing off to the side, wanting into the classroom but not wanting to squeeze between Cole and me to get there. I wrapped my fingers around Cole’s wrist and lowered his arm. The kids bypassed us, but I didn’t return to my place. I was flush against Cole, could feel his heart pounding and couldn’t bring myself to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I have been in a fight,” I said, recalling what he’d asked me. With my dad, during training.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole’s head tilted to the side, that violet gaze intense. “A fistfight?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh. I’d noticed his eyes. I was well and truly trapped now. \u0026nbsp;So pretty. “Is there any other kind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Many kinds. So who’d you fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one you’d know,” I said, mimicking his answer. If I told him the truth, he’d think my dad had let me win or worse, that I was a major witch for fighting my own father. And I’d have no defense!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quirking at the corner of his mouth started up again. I amused him, I guess, and had no idea why. Well, he confused me. Why warn me about his ex’s cruel streak? Why try to comfort me? Why do nothing else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied his face, searching for answers, finding none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” My attention lowered to his mouth. Up close like this, the split in his lower lip revealed a fresh bead of blood. I bet he could have taken my dad and still had the energy to turn the two visions I’d had into a reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I asked if your last name is Bell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis newest topic switch threw me, but I quickly adapted without dying of embarrassment for losing myself to such silly thoughts. “Yes. Bell. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your dad was Phillip Bell. Your mom was Miranda Bradley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas, he’d said. Not is. He knew. I swallowed my sudden urge to scream, gritting out, “You’re right, but how did you know that?” I’d never even mentioned their names to Kat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dad went to school with them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone else had known them, might mourn their loss. How odd to discover that the people I’d lived with for most of my existence had had a life before me, without me. On some level, I’d realized that, of course I had, but hearing the truth was a different matter entirely. “Your dad went to school here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hard nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had about a thousand more questions now. Had our parents hung out together? Been friends? Enemies? Had his dad said anything about mine? How had his dad known about me—had Cole mentioned me to him? I didn’t ask a single one, though. Asking would have invited him to ask questions of his own, and I wasn’t ready to talk about what had happened over the summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dad wants to know—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks for the heads-up about your girlfriend,” I interjected in a rush, making it clear our parents weren’t up for discussion. I wasn’t sure of my reaction, and I wasn’t going to risk it. “We should probably say goodbye now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knowing pause before he gave another stiff nod. “Fine. But just so you know, Mackenzie isn’t my girlfriend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t say anything else, and I had no idea how to reply, so I strode into the classroom. Gold star for me—I didn’t cast a final glance over my shoulder. I think he watched me, though, because I felt two white-hot pings in my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made it all the way to last block without any problems and forced myself to listen to the final lecture of the day, this one about equations and how to properly decipher them with minimal brain spasms—without allowing thoughts of Cole Holland to invade. Go me. Finally, blessedly, the bell rang—and I was quite sad to realize I wasn’t any smarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat, who’d saved me a seat and wiggled her eyebrows at me every time I’d glanced in her direction, grabbed me before I could escape and demanded to know every word that had been uttered between Cole and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe self-imposed CH embargo was over, I guess, and I was kinda glad. I needed advice. I relayed the conversation verbatim and her excitement drained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I don’t know how they judge cool versus lame at Carver Suck It Academy—oh, and did I mention that we kicked your butt last year in both football and basketball?—but here at Asher we consider that seriously lame.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/alice-in-zombieland-white-rabbit-chronicles-1/page-15.html","bookId":2520,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM"}
