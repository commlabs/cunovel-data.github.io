{"id":43252,"no":58,"title":"CHAPTER LVIII.","content":"As Ida paused for a moment, wondering what course would be best to pursue, she concluded that her only course would be to return to the house for the money.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She had scarcely turned, before a piercing cry sounded through the grounds, coming from the direction of the brook.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ida, terrified, stood for a moment rooted to the spot. She tried to fly, but if her life had depended upon it, she could not have stirred hand or foot.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She distinctly heard the sound of voices. Still, all power to fly seemed to have left her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What could it be? Had some of the servants discovered Royal Ainsley\u0027s presence?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [242]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She tried to think, but she was powerless. Every sound seemed confusing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Guided by the light, Nora had dashed quickly down toward the brook. But ere she could reach the figure pacing up and down so impatiently, she was seized from behind by a pair of strong arms, a white angry face bent over her, and a voice, which she instantly recognized as her master\u0027s, cried harshly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me understand what this means!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The girl was too frightened to speak.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is why you would not come to the ball, is it?\" he cried, excitedly, dragging her toward the spot where her lover stood. \"Come, you and I will confront the lover whom you stayed away from the ball to meet here!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Royal Ainsley took in the situation at once. He recognized Eugene\u0027s voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He has discovered Ida Mallard\u0027s appointment with me in some way,\" he thought. And the knowledge terrified him, coward as he was.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned and beat a hasty retreat, dodging directly into the arms of old Joe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ha! I\u0027ve caught you this time!\" cried the old servitor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With an oath, Royal Ainsley flung Joe from him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Out of my way!\" he cried, fiercely, \"or I\u0027ll kill you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The voice, as well as the words, startled old Joe, and threw him entirely off his guard for an instant. In that instant a heavy blow was dealt him which caused him to loosen his hold on the intruder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then Royal Ainsley sped like a deer through the grounds, every foot of which he knew well, and was quickly lost to sight in the darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [243]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After that first sharp cry, Nora regained something of her natural bravado.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In less time than it takes to tell it, her master had dragged her toward the house and under the full light of the swinging lamp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, master!\" she cried, gaining her breath at last \"It\u0027s I, Nora, the maid!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eugene Mallard\u0027s tightly clinched hands fell from her; he stared aghast at the girl.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You, Nora!\" he cried, in the greatest amazement, with a world of relief and thankfulness blended in his voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pray for—forgive me, Mr. Mallard,\" sobbed the girl. \"I—I did not do any intentional wrong. I was only going down to the old south gate to meet my lover, sir. I—I did not think for a moment that any one would mind. My lady did not need me for an hour or more. Oh, please forgive me if my action has displeased you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was your lover that you were going to meet?\" repeated Eugene Mallard, as if to satisfy himself that he had heard aright.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He drew back and looked at Nora with fixed intentness, the color that had left his face surging back to it again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Eugene Mallard now walked to his library, and flung himself down to think over the situation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He felt grateful beyond words that matters were no worse. He was ashamed of the thought that for a moment had found lodgment in his brain against the wife whom he had wedded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then it came to him—his love for Ida, whom he knew now that he worshipped with all the passionate love of his heart. How different it was from the love he had borne Hildegarde Cramer!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [244]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He wondered that he had been so blind as not to have noticed his love for her sooner. He could scarcely wait until the day dawned, that he might go to her and tell her of the great love for her that was consuming his soul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He said to himself that it was only her innate modesty that caused her to hold aloof from him of late, and to make her hesitate about giving him her answer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked shudderingly backward over the past for the last time. Yes, he would urge her to give him his answer on the morrow. It never once occurred to him but that her answer would be \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1691/49830.html","bookId":1156,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM"}
