She heard only the rush of the nearby stream, her own moaning, Paul\u0027s harsh gasps as he thrust into her. The first she heard of the man was his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks to me like fornication in a public park area.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart slammed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her left eye, she glimpsed the man\u0027s vague shape crouching beside her in the moonlight, less than a yard away. She looked up at Paul. His eyes were wide with alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can\u0027t be happening, Jean told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt totally helpless and exposed. Not that the guy could see anything. Just Paul\u0027s bare butt. He couldn\u0027t see that Jean\u0027s blouse was open, her bra bunched around her neck, her skirt rucked up past her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know it\u0027s against the law?\" the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul took his tongue out of Jean\u0027s mouth. He turned his head toward the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean could feel his heart drumming, his penis shrinking inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention poor taste,\" the man added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t mean any harm,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd started to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean jammed her shoes against his buttocks, tightened her arms around his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if some childrenhad wandered by?\" the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re sorry,\" Jean told him, keeping her head straight up, not daring to look at the man again, instead staring at Paul. \"We\u0027ll leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiss goodbye, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeemed like a weird request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Paul obeyed. He pressed his mouth gently against Jean\u0027s lips, and she wondered how she could manage to cover herself because it was quite obvious that, as soon as the kiss was over, Paul would have to climb off her. And there she\u0027d be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, she knew it was a shotgun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t seen a shotgun, but she\u0027d only given the man that single, quick glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul was giving her the goodbye kiss and she was wondering about the best way to keep the man from seeing her when suddenly it didn\u0027t matter because the world blew up. Paul\u0027s eyes exploded out of their sockets and dropped onto hereyes. She jerked her head sideways to get away from them. Jerked it the wrong way. Saw the clotted wetness on the moonlit trunk of a nearby tree, saw his ear cling to the bark for a moment, then fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul\u0027s head dropped heavily onto the side of her face. A torrent of blood blinded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul\u0027s weight tumbled off. The man stomped her belly. He scooped her up, swung her over his shoulder, and started to run. She wheezed, trying to breathe. His foot had smashed her air out and now his shoulder kept ramming into her. She felt as if she were drowning. Only a dim corner of her mind seemed to work, and she wished it would blink out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter total darkness, better no awareness at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stopped running. He bent over, and Jean flopped backward. She slammed something. Beside her was a windshield plated with moonlight. She\u0027d been dumped across the hood of a car. Her legs dangled over the car\u0027s front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to lift her head. Couldn\u0027t. So she lay there, struggling to suck in air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been away?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean felt as if she had missed a chance to save herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned over, clutched both sides of her open blouse, and yanked her into a sitting position. He snapped a handcuff around her right wrist, passed the other bracelet beneath her knee, and cuffed her left hand. Then he lifted her off the hood. He swung her into the car\u0027s passenger seat and slammed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the windshield, Jean saw him rush past the front of the car. She drove her knee up. It bumped her chin, but she managed to slip the handcuff chain down her calf and under the sole of her running shoe. She grabbed the door handle. She levered it up and threw her shoulder against the door and started to tumble out, but her head jerked back with searing pain as if the hair were being torn from her scalp. Her head twisted. Her cheekbone struck the steering wheel. A hand clasped the top of her head. Another clutched her chin. And he rammed the side of her face again and again on the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she opened her eyes, her head was on the man\u0027s lap. She felt his hand kneading her breast. The car was moving fast. From the engine noise and the hiss of the tires on the pavement, she guessed they were on the Interstate. The highway lights cast a faint, silvery glow on the man\u0027s face. He looked down at her and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police artist sketch didn\u0027t have him quite right. It had the crewcut right, and the weird crazy eyes, but his nose was a little larger, his lips a lot thicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean started to lift her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lie still,\" he warned. \"Move a muscle, I\u0027ll pound your brains out.\" He laughed. \"How about your boyfriend\u0027s brains? Did you see how they hit that tree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pinched her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gritted her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked you a question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about his eyes? I\u0027ve never seen anything like that. Just goes to show what a twelve-gauge can do to a fellow. You know, I\u0027ve never killed a guybefore. Just sweet young things like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came as no surprise, no shock. She\u0027d seen him murder Paul, and he planned to murder her too - the same as he\u0027d murdered the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he doesn\u0027t kill them all, she thought. Only one body had been found. Everyone talked as if the Reaper had killed the other six, but really they were only missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he takes them someplace and keeps them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he just now said he kills sweet young things: Plural. He killed them all. But maybe not. Maybe he just wants to keep me and fool with me and not kill me and I\u0027ll figure a way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you taking me?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A nice, private place in the hills where nobody will hear you scream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words made a chill crawl over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oooh, goosebumps. I like that.\" His hand glided over her skin like a cold breeze. Jean was tempted to grab his hand and bite it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she did that, he would hurt her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027ll be a world of hurt later, she thought. He plans to make me scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was later. Maybe she could get away from him before it came to that. The best thing, for now, was to give him no trouble. Don\u0027t fight him. Act docile. Then maybe he\u0027ll let his guard down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know who I am?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Reaper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good. And I know who you are, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows me? How could he? Maybe followed me around on campus, asked someone my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re Number Eight,\" he said. \"Just think about that. You\u0027re going to be famous. You\u0027ll be in all the newspapers, they\u0027ll talk about you on television, you\u0027ll even end up being a chapter in a book someday. Have you read any books like that? They\u0027ll have a nice little biography of you, quotes from your parents and friends. The bittersweet story of your brief but passionate relationship with that guy. What was his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul. He\u0027ll get a good write-up, himself, since he\u0027s the first guy to die at the hands of the Reaper. Of course, they\u0027ll realize that he was incidental. You were the intended victim, Paul simply an unlucky jerk who got in the way. He got lucky, then he got unlucky. Good one, huh? Maybe I\u0027ll write the book myself. He got off and got offed. Or did he? Which came first? Did he go out with a bang?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you shut up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t want to,\" he said, and raked a path up her belly with a single fingernail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean cringed. Air hissed in through her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be nice to me,\" he said. \"After all, I\u0027m the one making you famous. Of course, some of the notoriety may be a trifle embarrassing for you. That book I was telling you about, it\u0027ll have a whole lot about today. Your final hours. Who was the last person to see you alive. And of course, it won\u0027t neglect the fornication in the park. People read that, a lot of them are going to think you were asking for it. I suppose I\u0027d have to agree with them. Didn\u0027t you know any better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadknown better. \"What about the Reaper?\" she\u0027d asked when the movie let out and Paul suggested the park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll have to find his owngal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it. I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s such a great idea. Why don\u0027t we go to my place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. So your demented roommate can listen through the wall and make noises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told her not to do that anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, let\u0027s go to the park. It\u0027s a neat night. We can find a place by the stream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" She squeezed his hand. \"I\u0027d like to, Paul, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit. Everybody\u0027s got Reaperitis. For godsake, he\u0027s in Portland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s only a half hour drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Forget it. Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked half a block, Paul silent and scowling, before Jean slipped a hand into the rear pocket of his pants and said, \"Hey, pal, how\u0027s about a stroll in the park?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you know any better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand smacked her bare skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you ignore me. I ask you a question, you answer. Got it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car slowed. The Reaper\u0027s left hand eased the steering wheel over and Jean felt the car slip sideways. It tipped upward a bit, pressing her cheek against his belt buckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn off-ramp, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car stopped, then made a sharp turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold tremor swept through Jean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re getting there, she thought. Wherever he\u0027s taking me, we\u0027re getting there. Oh, Jesus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought it couldn\u0027t happen to you,\" he said. \"Am I right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What, then? You were just too horny to care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paul would\u0027ve kept on pouting.\" Her voice was high, shaky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of those. I hate those sniveling, whiny pouters. Take me, for instance - I never pout. That\u0027s for the losers. I never lose, so I\u0027ve got no reason to pout. I make otherpeople lose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowed the car, turned it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate pouters, too,\" Jean said, trying to keep her voice steady. \"They stink. They don\u0027t deserve to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at her. His face was a vague blur. There were no more streetlights, Jean realized. Nothing but moonlight, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet you and I are a lot alike,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think so, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never told anyone this before, but... I guess it\u0027s safe to tell you. I killed a girl once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t believe me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. It was just two years ago. I was going with this guy, Jim Smith, and... I really loved him. We got engaged. And then all of a sudden he started going with this bitch, Mary Jones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smith and Jones, huh?\" He chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t help it if they had stupid names,\" she said, and wished she\u0027d taken an extra second to think up names that sounded real, damn it. \"Anyway, he spent less and less time with me, and I knew he was seeing Mary. So one night I snuck into her room in the sorority and smothered her with a pillow. Killed her. And I enjoyed it. I laughed when she died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patted Jean\u0027s belly. \"I guess we are two of a kind. Maybe you\u0027d like to throw in with me. I can see some advantages to an arrangement like that. You could lure the pretty young things into my car, help me subdue them. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought that she might start to cry. His offer was just what she had wanted to hear - and he knew it. He knew it, all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she went along, just in case. \"I think I\u0027d like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That makes it an even fifty percent,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front of the car tipped upward. Again, Jean\u0027s cheek pressed his belt buckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the fourth to try that maneuver. Hey, forget about killing me, I\u0027m just your type, let\u0027s be partners. Four out of eight. You\u0027re only the second to confess a prior murder, though. The other one said she pushed her kid sister out of the tree house. I sure do pick \u0027em. Two murderers. What are the chances of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coincidence,\" Jean muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis right hand continued to fondle her. His left hand kept jogging the steering wheel from side to side as he maneuvered up the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could reach up and grab the wheel and maybe make them crash. But the car didn\u0027t seem to be moving very fast. At this speed, the crash might not hurt him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s hear the one about your rich father,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Come on, don\u0027t ruin the score. You\u0027ll make it a hundred percent if you\u0027ve got a rich father who\u0027ll pay me heaps of money to take you back to him unscathed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to try for the crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the car stopped. He swung the steering wheel way over and started ahead slowly. The car bumped and rocked. Its tires crunched dirt. Leafy branches whispered and squeaked against its sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re almost there,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost time to go into your begging routine. Most of them start about now. Sometimes they hold off till we get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t beg, Jean thought. I\u0027ll run for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped the car and turned off the engine. He didn\u0027t take the key from the ignition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, honey. Sit up slowly and open the door. I\u0027ll be right behind you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up and turned toward the door. As she levered the handle, he clutched the collar of her blouse. He held onto it while she climbed out. Then he was standing, still gripping her collar, knuckles shoving at the back of her neck to guide her around the door. The door slammed shut. They passed the front of the car and moved toward a clearing in the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clearing was milky with moonlight. In the center, near a pale dead tree, was a ring of rocks that someone had stacked up to enclose a campfire. A pile of twigs and broken branches stood near the fire ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reaper steered Jean toward the dead tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw wood already piled inside the wall of rocks, ready for a match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she felt a quick glimmer of hope. Someonehad laid the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Heprobably did it. He was up here earlier, preparing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw a rectangular box at the foot of the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA toolbox?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to whimper. She tried to stop walking, but he shoved her forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh please, please, no! Spare me! I\u0027ll do anything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you,\" Jean said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like your guts,\" he said. \"In a little while, we may take a good look at them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned her around and backed her against the tree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to take off one of the cuffs, now,\" he explained. He took a key from the pocket of his pants and held it in front of her face. \"You won\u0027t try to take advantage of the moment, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t think so.\" He shot a knee up into her belly. His forearm caught her under the chin, forcing her back as she started to double. Her legs gave out. She slid down the trunk, the barkless wood snagging her blouse and scraping her skin. A knob of root pounded her rump. She started to tumble forward, but he was there in front of her upthrust knees, blocking her fall. She slumped back against the trunk, wheezing, feeling the cuff go away from her right wrist, knowing this was it, this was the big moment she\u0027d been waiting for, her one and only chance to make her break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t move. She was hurting and dazed and breathless. And even if she hadn\u0027t been disabled by the blow, her position made struggle pointless. She was folded, back tight against the tree, legs mashing her breasts, arms stretched out over her knees, toes pinned to the ground by his boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she had lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrange, though. It didn\u0027t seem to matter much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean felt as if she were outside herself, observing. It was someone else being grabbed under the armpits, someone else being lifted. She was watching a movie and the heroine was being prepared for torture. The girl\u0027s arms were being raised overhead. The loose cuff was being passed over the top of a limb. Then, it was snapped around the girl\u0027s right hand. The Reaper lifted her off her feet and carried her out away from the trunk. Then he let go. The limb was low enough so she didn\u0027t need to stand on tiptoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man walked away from his captive. He crouched on the other side of the ring of rocks and struck a match. Flames climbed the tented sticks. They wrapped thick, broken branches. Pale smoke drifted up. He stood and returned to the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little light on the subject,\" he said to her. His voice sounded as faint as the snapping of the fire behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is okay, she thought. It\u0027s not me. It\u0027s someone else - a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt stopped being a stranger, very fast, when she saw the knife in the Reaper\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood rigid and stared at the dark blade. She tried to hold her breath, but couldn\u0027t stop panting. Her heart felt like a hammer trying to smash its way out of her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she gasped. \"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I knew you\u0027d get around to begging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never did anything to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re about to do something forme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knife moved in. She felt its cool blade on her skin, but it didn\u0027t hurt. It didn\u0027t cut. Not Jean. It cut her clothes instead - the straps of her bra, the sleeves of her blouse, the waistband of her skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the clothes to the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and dropped them onto the flames. \"You won\u0027t need them. You\u0027ll be staying right here. Here in the mess hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the distance, a coyote howled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my friend. We\u0027ve got an arrangement. I leave a meal for him and his forest friends, and they do the cleanup for me. None of this \u0027shallow grave\u0027 nonsense. I just leave you here, tomorrow you\u0027ll be gone. They\u0027ll come like the good, hungry troops they are, and leave the area neat and tidy for next time. No fuss, no bother. And you, sweet thing, will be spared the embarrassment of returning to campus bare-ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquatting beside the fire, he opened the toolbox. He took out pliers and a screwdriver. He set the pliers on the flat top of a rock. He picked up the screwdriver. Its shank was black even before he held it over the fire. Jean saw the flames curl around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she cried out, \"Please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Please!\" he mimicked. Smiling, he rolled the screwdriver in his hand. \"Think it\u0027s done yet?\" He shook his head. \"Give it a few more minutes. No need to rush. Are you savoring the anticipation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bastard!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that any way to talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"HELP!\" she shouted. \"HELP! PLEASE, HELP ME!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s going to hear you but the coyotes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" You can\u0027t do this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I can. Done it plenty of times before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please! I\u0027ll do anything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know just what you\u0027ll do. Scream, twitch, cry, kick, beg, drool... bleed. Not necessarily in that order, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up. Pliers in one hand, screwdriver in the other, he walked slowly toward Jean. Wisps of pale smoke rose off the shank of the screwdriver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped in front of her. \"Now where oh where shall we begin? So many choice areas to choose from.\" He raised the screwdriver toward her left eye. Jean jerked her head aside. The tip moved closer. She shut her eye. Felt heat against its lid. But the heat faded. \"No. I\u0027ll save that for later. After all, half the fun for youwill be watching.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrieked and flinched rigid as something seared her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reaper laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked down. He had simply touched her with the nose of the pliers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Power of suggestion,\" he said. \"Now, let\u0027s see how you like some realpain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly he moved the screwdriver toward her left breast. Jean tried to jerk away, but the handcuffs stopped her. She kicked out. He twisted away. As the edge of her shoe glanced off his hip, he stroked her thigh with the screwdriver. She squealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Don\u0027t do that again, honey, or I might get mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSobbing, she watched him inch the screwdriver toward her breast again. \"No. Don\u0027t. Pleeease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rock struck the side of the Reaper\u0027s head. It knocked his head sideways, bounced off, scraped Jean\u0027s armpit, and fell. He stood there for a moment, then dropped to his knees and slumped forward, face pressing against Jean\u0027s groin. She twisted away, and he flopped beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed down at him, hardly able to believe he was actually sprawled there. Maybe she\u0027d passed out and this was no more than a wild fantasy. She was dreaming and pretty soon she would come to with a burst of pain and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she thought. It can\u0027t be a dream. Please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dim corner of her mind whispered, I knew I\u0027d get out of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked for the rock thrower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd spotted a dim shape standing beside a tree on the far side of the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got him!\" she shouted. \"Thank God, you got him! Great throw!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shape didn\u0027t move, didn\u0027t call back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Jean cried out. \"Don\u0027t leave! He\u0027ll come to and kill me! Please! I\u0027m cuffed here! He\u0027s got the key in his pocket. You\u0027ve gotta unlock the cuffs for me. Please!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure, as indistinct in the darkness as the bushes and trees near its sides, turned again and stepped forward. It limped toward the glow of the fire. From the shape, Jean guessed that her savior was a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers began to appear across the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne stepped out from behind a tree. Another rose behind a clump of bushes. Jean glimpsed movement over to the right, looked and saw a fourth woman. She heard a growl behind her, twisted around, and gasped at the sight of someone crawling toward her. Toward the Reaper, she hoped. The top of this one\u0027s head was black and hairless in the shimmering firelight. As if she\u0027d been scalped? The flesh had been stripped from one side of her back, and Jean glimpsed pale curving ribs before she whirled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow there were fivein front of her, closing in and near enough to the fire so she could see them clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd disconnected again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCame out of herself, became an observer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rock thrower had a black pit where her left eye should\u0027ve been. The girl cuffed beneath the tree was amazed that a one-eyed girl had been able to throw a rock with such fine aim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was even more amazing, since she was obviously dead. Ropes of guts hung from her belly, swaying between her legs like an Indian\u0027s loincloth. Little but bone remained of her right leg below the knee - the work of the Reaper\u0027s woodland troops?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can she walk?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s a good one, the girl thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can anyof them walk?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne, who must\u0027ve been up here a very long time, was managing to shamble along just fine, though both her legs were little more than bare bones. The troops had really feasted on her. One arm was missing entirely. The other arm was bone, and gone from the elbow down. Where she still had flesh, it looked black and lumpy. Some of her torso was intact, but mostly hollowed out. The right-hand side of her rib cage had been broken open. The ribs on the left were still there, and a shriveled lung was visible through the bars. Her face had no eyes, no nose, no lips. She looked as if she might be grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl beneath the tree grinned back at her, but she didn\u0027t seem to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course not, dope. How can she see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can she walk?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the others still had eyes. They were wide open and glazed. She had a very peculiar stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo eyelids, that\u0027s the trouble. The Reaper must\u0027ve cut them off. Her breasts, too. Round, pulpy black disks on her chest where they should\u0027ve been. Except for a huge gap in her right flank, she didn\u0027t look as if she\u0027d been maimed by the troops. She still had most of her skin. But it looked shiny and slick with a coating of white slime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl beside her didn\u0027t seem to have any skin at all. Had she been peeled? She was black all over except for the whites of her eyes and teeth - and hundreds of white things as if she had been showered with rice. But the rice moved. The rice was alive. Maggots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last of the five girls approaching from the front was also black. She didn\u0027t look peeled, she looked burnt. Her body was a crust of char, cracked and leaking fluids that shimmered in the firelight. She bore only a rough resemblance to a human being. She might have been shaped out of mud by a dim-witted child who gave her no fingers or toes or breasts, who couldn\u0027t manage a nose or ears, and poked fingers into the mud to make her eyes. Her crust made papery, crackling sounds as she shuffled past the fire, and pieces flaked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA motley crew, thought the girl cuffed to the limb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered if any of them would have enough sense to find the key and unlock the handcuffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doubted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, they didn\u0027t seem to be aware of her presence at all. They were limping and hobbling straight toward the Reaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhose shriek now shattered whatever fragile force had allowed Jean to stay outside the cuffed stranger. She tried to keep her distance. Couldn\u0027t. Was sucked back inside the naked, suspended girl. Felt a sudden rush of horror and revulsion... and hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever else they might be, they were the victims of the Reaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePayback time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still shrieking, and Jean looked down at him. He was on his hands and knees. The scalped girl, also on her knees and facing him, had his head caught between her hands. She was biting the top of his head. Jean heard a wet ripping sound as the girl tore off a patch of hair and flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flopped and skidded backward, dragged by the rock thrower and the one with the slimy skin. Each had him by a foot. The scalped girl started to crawl after him, then grunted and stopped and tried to pick up the pliers. Her right hand had no fingers. She pawed at the pliers, whimpering with frustration, then sighed when she succeeded in picking up the tool using the thumb and two remaining fingers of her other hand. Quickly, she crawled along trying to catch up to her prize. She scurried past Jean. One of her buttocks was gone, eaten away to the bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gained on the screaming Reaper, reached out and clamped the pliers to the ridge of his ear and ripped out a chunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway between Jean and the fire, the girls released his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll six went at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bucked and twisted and writhed, but they turned him onto his back. While some held him down, others tore at his clothes. Others tore at him. The scalped one took the pliers to his right eyelid and tore it off. The burnt one snatched up a hand and opened her lipless black mouth and began to chew his fingers off. While this went on, the armless girl capered like a madcap skeleton, her trapped lung bouncing inside her ribcage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon the Reaper\u0027s shirt was in shreds. His pants and boxer shorts were bunched around his cowboy boots. The scalped girl had ripped his other eyelid off, and now was stretching his upper lip as he squealed. The rock thrower, kneeling beside him, clawed at his belly as if trying to get to his guts. Slime-skin bit off one of his nipples, chewed it, and swallowed. The girl who must\u0027ve been skinned alive knelt beside his head, scraping maggots off her belly and stuffing them by the handful into his mouth. No longer shrieking, he choked and wheezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dancing skeleton dropped to her bare kneecaps, bent over him, and clamped her teeth on his penis. She pulled, stretching it, gnawing. He stopped choking and let out a shrill scream that felt like ice picks sliding into Jean\u0027s ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scalped girl tore his lip off. She gave the pliers a snap, and watched the lip fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean watched it too. Then felt its soft plop against her thigh. It stuck to her skin like a leech. She gagged. She stomped her foot on the ground, trying to shake it off. It kept clinging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s just a lip, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she was throwing up. She leaned forward as far as she could, trying not to vomit on herself. A small part of her mind was amused. She\u0027d been looking at hideous, mutilated corpses, such horrors as she had never seen before, not even in her nightmares. And she had watched the corpses do unspeakable things to the Reaper. With all that, she hadn\u0027t tossed her cookies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lip sticks to my leg, and I\u0027m barfing my guts out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least she was missing herself. Most of it was hitting the ground in front of her shoes, though a little was splashing up and spraying her shins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the heaving subsided. She gasped for air and blinked tears out of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd saw the scalped girl staring at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others kept working on the Reaper. He wasn\u0027t screaming anymore, just gasping and whimpering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scalped girl stabbed the pliers down. They crashed through the Reaper\u0027s upper teeth. She rammed them deep into his mouth and partway down his throat, left them there, and started to crawl toward Jean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him,\" she whispered. \" He\u0027sthe one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jean thought, maybe she wants to help me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you get the key? For the handcuffs? It\u0027s in his pants pocket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl didn\u0027t seem to hear. She stopped at the puddle of vomit and lowered her face into it. Jean heard lapping sounds, and gagged. The girl raised her head, stared up at Jean, licked her dripping lips, then crawled forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpened her mouth wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrist!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean smashed her knee up into the girl\u0027s forehead. The head snapped back. The girl tumbled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill spread through Jean. Her skin prickled with goosebumps. Her heart began to slam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt won\u0027t stop with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m next!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scalped girl, whose torso was an empty husk, rolled over and started to push herself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean leaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught the tree limb with both hands, kicked toward the trunk but couldn\u0027t come close to reaching it. Her body swept down and backward. As she started forward again, she pumped her legs high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicked and swung, making herself a pendulum that strained higher with each sweep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer legs hooked over the barkless, dead limb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew herself up against its underside and hugged it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwisting her head sideways, she saw the scalped girl crawling toward her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean had never seen her stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she can\u0027t stand up, I\u0027m okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the otherscould stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still busy with the Reaper. Digging into him. Biting. Ripping off flesh with their teeth. He choked around the pliers and made high squeaky noises. As Jean watched, the charred girl crouched over the fire and put both hands into the flames. When she straightened up, she had a blazing stick trapped between the fingerless flaps of her hands. She lumbered back to the group, crouched, and set the Reaper\u0027s pants on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pants, pulled down until they were stopped by his boot tops, wrapped him just below the knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn seconds they were ablaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reaper started screaming again. He squirmed and kicked. Jean was surprised he had that much life left in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll have to go through the ashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I live that long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean began to shinny out along the limb. It scraped her thighs and arms, but she kept moving, kept inching her way along. The limb sagged slightly. It groaned. She scooted farther, farther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeard a faint crackling sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen was stopped by a bone white branch that blocked her left arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" she gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thrust herself forward and rammed her arm against the branch. The impact shook it just a bit. A few twigs near the far end of it clattered and fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe branch looked three inches thick where it joined the main limb. A little higher up, it seemed thin enough for her to break easily - but she couldn\u0027t reach that far, not with her wrists joined by the short chain of the handcuffs. The branch barred her way like the arm and hand of a skeleton pleased to keep her treed until its companions finished with the Reaper and came for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clamped it between her teeth, bit down hard on the dry wood, gnashed on it. Her teeth barely seemed to dent it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her head. Spat dirt and grit from her mouth. Turned her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Reaper was no longer moving or making any sounds. Pale smoke drifted up from the black area where his pants had been burning. The charred girl who had set them ablaze now held his severed arm over the campfire. The slimy, breastless girl was pulling a boot onto one of her feet. The skinned girl, kneeling by the Reaper\u0027s head, had removed the pliers from his mouth. At first Jean thought she was pinching herself with them. That wasn\u0027t it, though. One at a time, she was squashing the maggots that squirmed on her belly. The rock thrower\u0027s head was buried in the Reaper\u0027s open torso. She reared up, coils of intestine drooping from her mouth. The rotted and armless girl lay flat between the black remains of the Reaper\u0027s legs, tearing at the cavity where his genitals used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he was apparently dead, his victims all still seemed contented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStraining to look down past her shoulder, Jean saw the scalped girl directly below. On her knees. Reaching up, pawing the air with the remains of her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe can\u0027t get me, Jean told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they\u0027re done with the Reaper, they\u0027ll see that bitch down there and then they\u0027ll see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she\u0027djust go away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGET OUT OF HERE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean wanted to shout it, didn\u0027t dare. Could just see the others turning their heads toward the sound of her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could just kill her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood luck on that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGotta do something!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean clamped the limb hard with her hands. She gritted her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t try it, she thought. You won\u0027t even hurt her. You\u0027ll be down where she can get at you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe a good kick in the head\u0027ll discourage her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFat chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean released the limb with her legs. She felt a breeze wash over her sweaty skin as she dropped. She thrashed her feet like a drowning woman hoping to kick to the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heel of her shoe struck something. She hoped it was the bitch\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was swinging upward and saw her. Turning on her knees and reaching high, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean kicked hard as she swept down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe toe of her shoe caught the bitch in the throat, lifted her off her knees and knocked her sprawling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGot her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean dangled by her hands, swaying slowly back and forth. She bucked and tried to fling her legs up to catch the limb. Missed. Lost her hold and cried out as the steel edges of the bracelets cut into her wrists. Her feet touched the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scalped girl rolled over and crawled toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean leaped. She grabbed the limb. She pulled herself up to it and drove her knees high but not fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl\u0027s arms wrapped her ankles, clutched them. She pulled at Jean, stretching her, dragging her down, reaching higher, climbingher. Jean twisted and squirmed but couldn\u0027t shake the girl off. Her arms strained. Her grip on the limb started to slip. She squealed as teeth ripped into her thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a krrrack!, the limb burst apart midway between Jean and the trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped straight down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling, she shoved the limb sideways. It hammered her shoulder as she landed, knees first, on the girl. The weight drove Jean forward, smashed her down. Though the girl no longer hugged her legs, she felt the head beneath her thigh shake from side to side. She writhed and bucked under the limb. The teeth kept their savage bite on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen hadtheir chunk of flesh and lost their grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClutching the limb, Jean bore it down, her shoulder a fulcrum. She felt the wood rise off her back and rump. Its splintered end pressed into the ground four or five feet in front of her head. Bracing herself on the limb, she scurried forward, knees pounding at the girl beneath her. The girl growled. Hands gripped Jean\u0027s calves. But not tightly. Not with the missing fingers. Teeth snapped at her, scraping the skin above her right knee. Jean jerked her leg back and shot it forward. The girl\u0027s teeth crashed shut. Then Jean was off her, rising on the crutch of the broken limb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up straight, hugging the upright limb, lifting its broken end off the ground and staggering forward a few steps to get herself out of the girl\u0027s reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd saw the others coming. All but the rotted skeletal girl who had no arms and still lay sprawled between the Reaper\u0027s legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Jean shouted. \"Leave me alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey lurched toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe charred one held the Reaper\u0027s severed arm like a club. The breastless girl with runny skin wore both his boots. Her arms were raised, already reaching for Jean though she was still a few yards away. The rock thrower had found a rock. The skinned girl aswarm with maggots picked at herself with the pliers as she shambled closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NO!\" Jean yelled again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ducked, grabbed the limb low, hugged it to her side and whirled as the branchy top of it swept down in front of her. It dropped from its height slashing sideways, its bony fingers of wood clattering and bursting into twigs as it crashed through the cadavers. Three of them were knocked off their feet. A fourth, the charred one, lurched backward to escape the blow, stepped into the Reaper\u0027s torso, and stumbled. Jean didn\u0027t see whether she went down, because the weight of the limb was hurling her around in a full circle. A branch struck the face of the scalped girl crawling toward her, popped, and flew off. Then the crawling girl was behind Jean again and the others were still down. All except the rock thrower. She\u0027d been missed, first time around. Out of range. Now her arm was cocked back, ready to hurl a small block of stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean, spinning, released the limb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts barkless wood scraped her side and belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt flew from her like a mammoth, tined lance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFree of its pull, Jean twirled. The rock flicked her ear. She fell to her knees. Facing the crawler. Who scurried toward her moaning as if she already knew she had lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving both fists against the ground, Jean pushed herself up. She took two quick steps toward the crawler and kicked her in the face. Then she staggered backward. Whirled around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rock thrower was down, arms batting through the maze of dead branches above her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were starting to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean ran through them, cuffed hands high, twisting and dodging as they scurried for her, lurched at her, grabbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they were behind her. All but the Reaper and the armless thing sprawled between his legs, chewing on him. Gotta get the handcuff key, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharging toward them, she realized the cuffs didn\u0027t matter. They couldn\u0027t stop her from driving. The car key was in the ignition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaped the Reaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd staggered to a stop on the other side of his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasping, she bent over and lifted a rock from the ring around the fire. Though its heat scorched her hands, she raised it overhead. She turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corpses were coming, crawling and limping closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they weren\u0027t that close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"HERE\u0027S ONE FOR NUMBER EIGHT!\" she shouted, and smashed the rock down onto the remains of the Reaper\u0027s face. It struck with a wet, crunching sound. It didn\u0027t roll off. It stayed on his face as if it had made a nest for itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean stomped on it once, pounding it in farther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she swung around. She leaped the fire and dashed through the clearing toward the waiting car. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/book-of-the-dead/page-2.html","bookId":2562,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:58:45 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:58:45 AM"}
