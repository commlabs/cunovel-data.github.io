I am cold for other reasons. I am cold for desperation.\" She made a complicated gesture. \"Until now, I have been able to hold off actions against me, but now, everything is different. It doesn\u0027t matter that Belisarius is my sponsor and that Drosos is my lover; the time will come when that will not stop the Censor from acting overtly against me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Surely it won\u0027t come to that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It already has. You were here and you saw what was done. It is practice for what is to come. I will have to visit Belisarius soon and find a way to gain permission to leave.\" Or, she added to herself, she would have to arrange to leave everything behind and flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can understand why you think this might be the way things might go, but I assure you that we are more orderly, more civilized than that. You have seen the barbarians attack Roma, and it\u0027s understandable that you confuse them with us.\" Chrysanthos looked toward the door. \"Your majordomo—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiklos was standing in the door. \"We\u0027ve restored some order in the kitchen and the evening meal is being served. The slaves are upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am upset,\" Olivia declared. \"Thank you,\" she said with less feeling. \"I will need to talk to them in the morning, when it is less immediate in our minds. Tell them, will you? I will speak with them tomorrow at midmorning.\" She almost grinned at Niklos. \"Find out what they\u0027re saying among themselves that they would not want to tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Niklos answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I needn\u0027t have asked,\" Olivia agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChrysanthos took advantage of this interruption to make a departing reverence. \"You have much to attend to. I will report to Belisarius and I will tell him what you have told me, and you may be certain that it will be held in the greatest confidence. Your gift is as generous as it is unnecessary.\" He started into the vestibule, Niklos coming after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Captain,\" Niklos said as he opened the door for Chrysanthos. \"Do you know where Drosos is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frown appeared between Chrysanthos\u0027 brows. \"Not today. He has often disappeared for hours at a time. I thought he might be here, but if that were the case, there would have been no reason to send for Belisarius, would there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has not been here for three days. I\u0027m concerned for him. My mistress is worried. If you find him, tell him what has been going on here and ask him to come soon. It would mean much to Olivia.\" Niklos paused. \"Tell him that…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" asked Chrysanthos when Niklos did not go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him that he has nothing to fear from Olivia.\" He held the door open and made a proper reverence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would Drosos fear Olivia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiklos opened his hands, palms up, to show his innocence in the matter. \"He has claimed that he does. I don\u0027t know if that is serious or only his teasing, but—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I see,\" said Chrysanthos. \"I will tell him, and I hope for his sake as well as the sake of your mistress that he does come soon. She is a woman of formidable control, but I think that she is more distraught than is apparent.\" He stepped out into the twilight street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Niklos closed the door, he turned to see Olivia standing in the door of the reception room. \"You\u0027re eavesdropping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As is everyone else in this house, it would seem.\" She came toward him. \"I want to rail at them. I want to call down plagues and curses on them and their offspring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you won\u0027t,\" Niklos said with confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No; not yet.\" She indicated the ikonostasis. \"At least not yet. Another time—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiklos looked around. \"Do you intend that there be a formal complaint?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I didn\u0027t, it would look more suspicious than anything else I could say or do. I will go to Belisarius myself tomorrow, and find out how he advises me to handle this. Chrysanthos has been very helpful—I did not mean to imply that he wasn\u0027t—but I will have to speak with Belisarius privately before I know what is best to do.\" She began to walk restlessly and aimlessly around the vestibule. \"If I can discover what the reason is, then there might be a way to combat all the lies and innuendos, but as it is—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About leaving?\" Niklos asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She stopped and turned back toward him. \"You are always such a sensible man, Niklos, and there are times I wonder how you deal with me.\" Her expression grew distant. \"The clothes I mentioned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buy three more horses. Make sure they are swift but ordinary looking. Saddle horses, mind, not chariot horses. If we are to leave here on… short notice, we will need saddle horses as well as chariot horses.\" This last was for the benefit of anyone who might be listening, and Niklos caught her gesture that indicated her intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three horses. Very well.\" He cocked his head. \"Do you anticipate needing to leave soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but anticipation means little in such circumstances. I will have to find a way to judge when it is best to act.\" She shook her head. \"There was a time when I would have thrown it all away and simply headed out of trouble without a second thought. But that, my friend, would be folly. If you leave a place under suspicion, you must live with that suspicion for a very long time, and there\u0027s no telling when it might—\" She stopped. \"We had trouble enough in Carthago Nova. I would prefer not to have such problems again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t argue,\" said Niklos with feeling. \"But who would have thought that smug little bureaucrat would travel so far, or remember so clearly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Precisely,\" Olivia agreed. \"And I do not want to spend another twenty-five years in Pictavi or some other equally dreadful place posing as a sybil and living in a cave. That taught me a lesson I do not need to learn twice.\" She attempted to make light of this. \"And you would not have to spend a quarter of a century pretending to be a mute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spare me that,\" he said with feeling. \"Horses. Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia gave a warning gesture toward the doors. \"Not now, not until I have spoken with my sponsor. In the meantime, I will want to have a word or two with Zejhil. Find her and send her to me, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the benefit of anyone who might be watching, Niklos made a deep reverence. \"Immediately, great lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved him away, but did not leave the vestibule at once herself; she stared at the door and wondered, as she had wondered often in the last three days, where Drosos was and what he was doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eText of a letter from Olivia to Sanct\u0027 Germain, written in Latin code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my dearest, oldest friend who ought to be in Trapezus now, Olivia sends her fond greetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am sending this to your house in Trapezus in the hope that you will have returned there, or that if you have not, your servants will know where you are to be found and will send this along to you. You have been traveling more in these last several years, which is inconvenient for both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it appears that I will be doing the same thing. For some reason I have not yet discovered, I have aroused suspicions here in Constantinople and from the way things are going, I will have to leave soon or face consequences that would be unpleasant. What a simple word that is—unpleasant—when I am trying to say that I fear for my life; the life you returned to me when Vespasianus wore the purple. Was it really almost five hundred years ago? You will have to forgive me if I find that hard to believe. Five hundred years seems so long, looking at the numbers, yet how swiftly those years have gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have not yet determined where I will go when I leave here, but leave here I must. I hate abandoning my house and goods; I have already left so much behind in Roma that I know I will never see again. And leaving my friends—although there are precious few of them—is more difficult than I can tell you. No, that\u0027s not true, is it? You, of all people, know how hard it is to leave friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAssuming I have time enough for adequate preparation, I think I will try to move toward the edges of the Empire, or to go to those parts that are Coptic. The Copts are not as eager to question the faith of everyone around them as these damned Orthodox Christians are. Of course the Orthodox regard the Copts as heretics, which might account for some of this; so long as I have the opportunity to live and move about without constant surveillance, I will be—satisfied?—content?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiklos is making several sets of arrangements for our departure, some of them more obvious than others. He is a treasure, and when I think of him, I think also of your Rogerian, since they are the same sort. Is it their method of restoration that creates such loyalty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I have established myself at wherever-I-am-going, I will send you word, and I trust you will write to me from time to time. Your letters are always so welcome, so consoling. There are times they are sad, as well, for they remind me of how you brought me into your life. There are times I miss those years, and your love, so intently that my bones hurt with it. Yes, yes, do not say that it is past and that the bond continues unbroken. I know that, and I cherish it, but that does not rid me of the longing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-71.html","bookId":2509,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:25 PM"}
