Rising in front, looming larger than I\u0027ve ever seen them, the eastern mountains, snow- capped at the peak; to my left and right, nothing but the barren plains, the horizon bereft of any movement. I look down at the horse. Is it possible it\u0027s been taking me for a ride all this time? Perhaps it has no idea where it\u0027s been maniacal y running, and I\u0027ve mistaken the glint of insanity for the shine of sagacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if overhearing my thoughts, it suddenly cocks its head, turning its left ear toward me. Then it points its muzzle into the air, sniffi ng. The wind is gusting about us now, kicking up sand. I see the horse\u0027s whis kers fl uttering in the crosswinds. It nickers, and just like that, we\u0027re off again. I barely have time to jump off the seat and grab the reins before we\u0027re fl ying across the plains, in a more southerly direction this time. In a much more southerly direction, as in a ninety- degree turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0027m really questioning if this horse knows what it\u0027s doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not running with conviction anymore, and every so often it\u0027l slow down to a trot, muzzle in the air. Then, changing direction, it will charge off again. Maybe it\u0027s the wind that has really picked up, blowing every which way: one second blowing easterly, then shifting north, before heading south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat might explain why the horse is having a tough time fol owing the scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fi rst time I see the black dot in the sky, I mistake it for a distant fl ock of vultures. Then it grows in size and darkness, and I realize that it\u0027s a dark cloud growing like an inkblot. A tide of clouds fol ows it, black as the horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWind lashes at me; the pages of the journal whip to and fro, almost dog- eared by the sheer force and fi ckle direction of the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah!” I yel , snapping the reins. The horse understands; it pounds its legs harder, as if my growing panic has somehow been absorbed into its body. Drifts of sand blow across the plains with astonishing speed, yel ow brown apparitions spiraling swiftly across the land.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore intensely than ever, I search the plains, hoping to fi nd movement in the diminishing light. But there is nothing. It doesn\u0027t seem to matter how far we ride into the Vast, the blank slate of land is never- changing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep going, boy!” I shout. But it grows more frustrated, de- railing, its breathing labored, its gal op less fl uid. It slows to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jump off the bench, grab the clothes. This time, it\u0027s even less re-ceptive, pushing the clothes out of my hands with its muzzle. It stomps its hind hooves into the compacted earth, frustrated. The skies darken. Before too long, the clouds wil cover the sun and the land will be plunged into darkness. It\u0027l be even more diffi cult to spot the hepers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027ve got to keep tryin—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse lifts its head. A sudden movement; it\u0027s caught something. Its nostrils, strings of saliva hanging across them, are like dark eyes suddenly seeing. The horse lurches forward. Just in time, I grab a rail and swing back into the carriage, the heper clothes dropping to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that the horse needs them anymore. It gal ops hard and straight, not a doubt left in its direction. Resolve and straight, not a doubt left in its direction. Resolve and urgency thump in the pounding of its hooves, as if to make up for lost time, as if knowing thickening bands threaten to darken the skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, I see them. A tiny line of dots, like ants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Over there, horsey! Over there!” But its needs no encouragement or direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we reach the hepers, they\u0027ve clumped together defensively. I slow the horse, then get off some distance away. I don\u0027t want to come on them too hard or fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey look worn and fatigued, and their faces are lined with angst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they speak, it is to one another, not to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you we should have checked the stable. A carriage would have helped, oh, I don\u0027t know, maybe about six hours ago,” Epap says snidely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did,” Sissy says. “While you were busy gathering up al your precious drawings. The stable was locked. Like it always is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wel , he found a horse and carriage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are all staring at me now, Epap and Sissy with suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach of them is carry ing a heavy knapsack, sheathed knives and spears tied to the side, water bottles slung over their shoulders. And attaché cases, fi ve in all . Dust and sand cake their hair and faces and clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must come with me,” I say. My voice is high- pitched with the deceit that lies in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stare wordlessly at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now,” I urge. “There\u0027s little time to waste.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpap steps forward. “Where?” he says, his voice barbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back. Back to the Dome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpap\u0027s mouth drops, then curls into a sneer. “This letter,” he says, reaching into his back pocket, “we got it through the Umbilical this morning. It says that the Dome\u0027s malfunctioned. The light sensor\u0027s damaged. The Dome won\u0027t close at dusk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So they told you about a shelter. Gave you a map and told you to make haste. That it\u0027s about six hours away.” I pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What if I tel you that\u0027s all a lie? The Dome\u0027s not broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no sanctuary.” It\u0027s easy to speak with conviction— everything I\u0027ve said so far is true. And they sense it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic fl oods their eyes, tightens their shoulders. I see little Ben look with worry into the distance. No shelter in sight, although by now they should be on top of it. They all know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSissy, who\u0027s been quiet up until now, speaks. “Why are they doing this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get in the carriage. I can tel you as we ride back. But we have to hurry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m not getting into that carriage— which might very wel become a coffi n— until you tel us what\u0027s going on,” Epap snarls at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I tel them. all about the Heper Hunt. Why they\u0027ve been given weapons. The reason there\u0027s been so much activity over the past few days at the Institute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bol ocks,” Epap says. “Would you listen to the nonsense this guy\u0027s spewing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSissy, staring intently at me, says, “Go on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to go back to the Dome. It\u0027s not broken.” And now begins the lie. “You\u0027l be safe there. We get there before sundown, the wal s will come up. Imagine the surprise on their faces when they rush out for the Heper Hunt and you\u0027re all right there roast-ing marshmal ows, safely cocooned inside the Dome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpap spins around at the others, looks at Sissy. “We can\u0027t believe him. If he\u0027s lying and we go back, then we\u0027re dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun goes down, the Dome doesn\u0027t come up, we\u0027re toast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if I\u0027m tel ing the truth, and you don\u0027t go back, then you\u0027re dead out here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can\u0027t trust him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you think your parents died?” I explode. “It wasn\u0027t on a fruit expedition. It was the Heper Hunt, they were sent out to be hunted! Just like you\u0027re being sent out right now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan\u0027t you see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsn\u0027t it obvious? The very same thing is happening again. A letter sending you out into the Vast, out of the safety of the Dome. How can you be so gul ible?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSissy\u0027s face is torn with confl ict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sissy, don\u0027t listen to him!” Epap cries. “He could have told us about this supposed Heper Hunt yesterday, but he didn\u0027t, did he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy should we believe anything he\u0027s told us? I bet he\u0027s not even the Scientist\u0027s replacement!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the mention of the Scientist, an idea springs into my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait here.” I run back to the carriage and fetch the journal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This journal was written by the Scientist. It\u0027s all about the Heper Hunt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow you tel me if I\u0027m lying.” I hand the journal to Sissy, who turns it over in her hands, shoots me a suspicious look, then opens to the fi rst page. The others huddle around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are quiet as they read, their bodies tensing as the minutes go by. Sissy\u0027s expression turns from horror to disbelief to anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now do you believe me?” I ask softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them speaks. Final y, David steps forward. “I don\u0027t know who to believe: you or this letter. But according to the map on the letter, the shelter is within reach; and now that we have a carriage, we\u0027l be able to cover a lot more distance quickly. If we can\u0027t fi nd it, then we\u0027l head back to the Dome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That map\u0027s a crock. There is no shelter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt darkens, suddenly. I spin around, look at the sun. A thin cloud, like intestinal entrails, drags across it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C\u0027mon, let\u0027s go!” I say, my voice rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Epap says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at my map, then! In the journal. There\u0027s no sanctuary in there. It\u0027s got every fl ora and fauna and stone and rock, but doesn\u0027t it strike you as odd that he\u0027d miss something as obvious as a shelter? You go if you want, I\u0027m done arguing with you, that shelter is nothing more than a mirage.” It\u0027s a total bluff— I need them to return with me— but I\u0027m out of options at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSissy lifts her head from the journal map. “We do what David said. Go look for the sanctuary, then head back if we can\u0027t fi nd it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat way—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There\u0027s no time!” I exclaim. “We have to make haste right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you see those clouds? It\u0027s going to be as black as night within the hour. And you don\u0027t need me to spel out what that means.” I\u0027m not bluffi ng here. Ominous bands of dark clouds are racing across the sky, threatening to pul darkness down prematurely, hours before dusk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shut up!” shouts Epap, his face red with fury. “You have no say here!” He steps toward me, his bony arms stiff and crooked at the elbows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take it easy,” I caution him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he keeps coming. “We don\u0027t even need you.” He fl ashes a look back at the hepers, waves his arm beckoningly to them. “C\u0027mon, let\u0027s just take the carriage for ourselves.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-43.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
