How did you sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had some crazy dreams.\" \"So did I.\" Diane hesitated. \"Kelly-when you got off the elevator at the hotel, just as I started to knock at the door of the penthouse-do you think that was a coincidence?\" \"Of course. And lucky for both of us that-\" Kelly looked at Diane\u0027s face. \"What do you mean?\" Diane said carefully, \"We\u0027ve been very lucky so far. I mean, very lucky. It\u0027s as though-as though someone, or something, is helping us, guiding us.\" Kelly\u0027s eyes were fastened on her. \"You mean-like a guardian angel?\" \"Yes.\" Kelly said patiently, \"Diane, I know that you believe in those things, but I don\u0027t. I know I don\u0027t have an angel on my shoulder.\" Diane said, \"You just don\u0027t see it yet.\" Kelly rolled her eyes. \"Right.\" \"Let\u0027s get some breakfast,\" Diane suggested. \"It\u0027s safe here. I think we\u0027re out of danger.\" Kelly grunted. \"If you think we\u0027re out of danger, you don\u0027t know anything about boardinghouse breakfasts. Let\u0027s get dressed and eat out. I think I saw a diner at the corner.\" \"All right. I have to make a call.\" Diane walked over to the telephone and called a number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn operator came on. \"KIG.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to speak to Betty Barker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a moment, please.\" Tanner had seen the blue light and was listening in on the conference line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Barker is not at her desk. Can I take a message?\" \"Oh. No, thanks.\" Tanner frowned. Too quick to put out a trace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDIANE TURNED TO Kelly. \"Betty Barker is still working at KIG, so we\u0027ll just have to find a way to get to her.\" \"Maybe her home number is listed in the telephone directory.\" Diane said, \"It could be, and the line could be tapped.\" She picked up the directory next to the telephone and skimmed to the letter she was looking for. \"She is listed.\" Diane dialed a number, listened, and slowly replaced the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly walked over to her. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" It took Diane a moment to answer. \"Her phone has been disconnected.\" Kelly took a deep breath. \"I think I want a shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAS KELLY FINISHED her shower and started to leave the bathroom, she realized that she had left towels on the floor. She hesitated a moment, then picked them up and put them neatly on the rack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked into the bedroom. \"All yours.\" Diane nodded absently. \"Thanks.\" The first thing Diane noticed when she walked into the bathroom was that all the used towels had been placed back on the rack. Diane smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped into the shower and let the warm water soothe her. She remembered how she used to shower with Richard, and how good their bodies felt touching each other?Never again. But the memories would always be there. Always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE WERE THE flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re beautiful, darling. Thank you. What are we celebrating?\" \"Saint Swithin\u0027s Day.\" And more flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Washington Crossing the Delaware Day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"National Parakeet Day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celery Lovers\u0027 Day.\" When the note with the roses said \"Leaping Lizards\u0027 Day,\" Diane had laughed and said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart, lizards don\u0027t leap.\" And Richard had put his head in his hands and said, \"Damn it! I was misinformed.\" And he loved to write love poems to her. When Diane was getting dressed, she would find one in her shoes, or in a bra, or in a jacket?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was the time he had come home from work and she was standing inside the door, completely naked, except for a pair of high-heeled shoes. And she had said, \"Darling, do you like these shoes?\" And his clothes had dropped to the floor and dinner was delayed. TheyKelly\u0027s voice called out, \"Are we going to have breakfast or dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY WERE WALKING to the restaurant. The day was cool and clear, and the sky was a translucent blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blue skies,\" Diane said. \"A good omen.\" Kelly bit her lip to keep from laughing. Somehow, Diane\u0027s superstitions seemed endearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few doors from the diner, Diane and Kelly passed a small boutique. They looked at each other, grinned, and walked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA saleslady approached them. \"May I help you?\" Kelly said enthusiastically, \"Yes.\" Diane warned, \"Let\u0027s take it easy. Remember what happened the last time.\" \"Right. No spree.\" The two of them went through the store, picking out a modest number of necessities. They left their old clothes in the dressing room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want to take these?\" the saleslady asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane smiled. \"No. Give them to Goodwill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eON THE CORNER was a convenience store. \"Look,\" Kelly said, \"disposable cell phones.\" Kelly and Diane went inside and purchased two of them, each equipped with a thousand prepaid minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly said, \"Let\u0027s exchange phone numbers again.\" Diane smiled. \"Right.\" It only took a few seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn their way out, as Diane was paying the cashier, she looked into her purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really beginning to run out of cash.\" \"So am I,\" Kelly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We may have to start using our credit cards,\" Diane said. \"Not until we find the magic rabbit hole.\" \"What?\" \"Never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN THEY WERE seated at a table in the diner, the waitress asked, \"What can I get you, ladies?\" Kelly turned to Diane. \"You first.\" \"I\u0027m going to have some orange juice, bacon and eggs, and toast and coffee.\" The waitress turned to Kelly. \"And you, miss?\" \"Half a grapefruit.\" \"That\u0027s it?\" Diane asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t live on half a grapefruit.\" \"Habit. I\u0027ve been on a strict diet for years. Some models eat Kleenex to curb their appetites.\" \"Seriously?\" \"Seriously. But it doesn\u0027t matter anymore. I\u0027m never going to model again.\" Diane studied her a moment. \"Why not?\" \"It\u0027s not important now. Mark taught me what\u0027s really important, and-\" She stopped, fighting tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you could have met him.\" \"So do I. But, Kelly, you have to start your life again.\" Kelly said, \"What about you? Are you going to start painting again?\u0027 There was a long silence. \"I tried?No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN KELLY AND Diane had finished their breakfasts and were starting out the door, Kelly noticed that the morning newspapers were being put into the news racks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane started to walk on when Kelly said, \"Wait a minute.\" She turned back and picked up one of the newspapers. \"Look!\" The story was an article at the top of the front page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKingsley International Group is holding a memorial service to honor all their employees whose recent deaths have been the cause of much speculation. The tribute will take place at KIG headquarters, in Manhattan, on Monday, at 11:15 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s tomorrow.\" Kelly looked at Diane for a moment. \"Why do you think they\u0027re doing this?\" \"I think they\u0027re setting a trap for us.\" Kelly nodded. \"So do I. Does Kingsley believe we would be stupid enough to fall for-?\" Kelly looked at Diane\u0027s expression and said with dismay, \"We\u0027re going?\" Diane nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to. I\u0027m sure Betty Barker will be there. I must talk to her.\" \"I don\u0027t want to be picky, but how do you expect to get out of there alive?\" \"I\u0027ll think of a way.\" She looked at Kelly and smiled. \"Trust me.\" Kelly shook her head. \"There\u0027s nothing that makes me more nervous than hearing someone say \u0027Trust me.\u0027\" She thought for a moment, and her face lit up. \"I have an idea. I know how to handle this.\" \"What\u0027s your idea?\" It s a surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane looked at Kelly, worried. \"You really think you can get us out of there?\" \"Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN THEY RETURNED to the boardinghouse, Kelly made a telephone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both slept badly that night. Kelly was lying in bed, worrying. If my plan fails, we\u0027re both going to die. As she was falling asleep, she seemed to see Tanner Kingsley\u0027s face looking down on her. He was grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane was praying, her eyes tightly closed. Darling, this may be the last time I speak to you. I\u0027m not sure whether to say good-bye or hello. Tomorrow, Kelly and I are going to KIG, to your memorial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think our chances of getting away are very good, but I have to go, to try to help you. I just wanted to tell you once more, before it may be too late, that I love you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoodnight, my dearest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-32.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
