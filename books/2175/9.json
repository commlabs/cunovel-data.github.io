Dervish doesn\u0027t understand why I was so scared. He doesn\u0027t know that I saw him with the deer, that I suspect he\u0027s a werewolf, that I\u0027m wondering if I can buy silver bullets on eBay. I doubt he\u0027d be laughing if he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house to myself. Dervish\u0027s early morning runs usually last forty-five minutes to an hour. Enough time for a quick scouting mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurry down the stairs to the wine cellar. Pause with my hand on the door. In horror movies, monsters always lurk in the basement. But this isn\u0027t a movie. I mustn\u0027t succumb to fictional fears -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not when I have very real fears to contend with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreeping down the steps. Leave the door open. Checking my watch - seven minutes since Dervish left. I\u0027ll allow myself half an hour, not a second more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause at the bottom of the steps. Dark and cool. I shuffle forward and an overhead light winks on. Studying the rows of wine racks. I turn full circle. My heart beats erratically. My legs feel like they belong to an elephant - heavyyyyy. The axe in my left hand looks tiny and ineffective in the glaring light of the cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stalk the nearest aisle, studying the floor - stone slabs, different shapes, tightly cemented together. I pause occasionally, crouch and rap a slab with the base of my axe, listening for echoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone. Solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeft at the end. Exploring a second aisle, then a third, a fourth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo strange-looking slabs. No echoes anywhere I rap. The joining cement between the slabs unbroken. No trace of a hidden door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack where I started. Twenty of the thirty minutes have elapsed. Sweating like a pig who can smell burning charcoal. I\u0027m beginning to think I could be wrong about the cellar. Perhaps the hidden entrance is in one of the ground floor rooms. But I won\u0027t give up yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scout the rim of the room, concentrating on the walls, running my fingers over the rough, dry stone, searching for cracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wine rack - ceiling-high, maybe three metres long - covers one section of the wall. My hopes rise - this could be blocking a secret passage!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but when I lift out a couple of bottles, all I see behind is more stone wall. I remove a few more bottles from various places but nothing out of the ordinary is revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo minutes left. This is a waste. I\u0027ll focus on the rooms above. Perhaps the passageway is hidden behind one of Dervish\u0027s many bookcases. I\u0027ll start in the main hall and work my way...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought dies unfinished. As I\u0027m rising to leave, I spot a dark smudge on the floor. Stooping closer, I move my head out of the way of the light and squint for a better view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a semi-circular stain, pale, easily missed. Unmistakably a footprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough there aren\u0027t many footprints in the cellar - Dervish keeps it really clean - this isn\u0027t the first I\u0027ve discovered. What sets this one apart from the others is that it faces away from the wine rack, and the mark of the heel is hidden beneath the bottles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGotcha!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching TV. Nervous. Waiting for Dervish to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to examine the wine rack. Once I\u0027d noted the print, I came straight up and carefully closed the door behind me. Dervish returned a few minutes later, but I was safe in my room by then, and had splashed my face with cold water to take away the bright red flush I\u0027d worked up in the cellar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish has spent most of the day since then in his study, as he often does, reading, making phone calls, surfing the Net. Time\u0027s dragged for me. I have only one burning desire - to get back down the cellar. Not being able to is driving me crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been keeping a close watch on the front door - don\u0027t want Dervish slipping out unnoticed. I even leave the toilet door open when I\u0027m in there, so I\u0027ll hear him if he comes down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, no joy. But I\u0027m patient. He has to leave eventually. He can\u0027t stay cooped up here forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight falls. Dervish still hasn\u0027t ventured outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver a late dinner, I ask casually if he has any plans for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought I might hit the pub again,\" he says, grinning sheepishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you meeting Meera?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, maybe not. With the unfathomable Meera Flame, who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the sudden great attraction about drinking in the Vale?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pretty new barmaid,\" he laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s her name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pause. Then, quickly, \"Lucy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting anywhere with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s slowly warming to my charms,\" he chuckles. \"I\u0027ll give it another few nights. If she hasn\u0027t bitten by then, I\u0027ll cut my losses, maybe take you and Bill-E out to see a film.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes it sound very casual, but I know what he\u0027s really doing - giving himself an excuse to stay out after dark for the next few nights, until the full moon has come and passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDervish leaves at 21:48 precisely. He sticks his head in my room as he\u0027s going and laughingly tells me not to wait up. I smile weakly in reply and say nothing about the fact that he hasn\u0027t changed his clothes, slipped on a nice pair of shoes, combed his hair or sprayed under his arms with deodorant - all the things he would have done if he\u0027d truly been going out on the pull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy uncle has a lot to learn about the art of espionage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the cellar door. Hesitant. I\u0027d rather do this by daylight. Going down this late at night, not knowing how long Dervish will be away or when to expect him back, is far from ideal. I consider waiting until morning, when he goes for his daily jog and I have a guaranteed three-quarters of an hour to play with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027ve had almost no sleep these last two nights. I\u0027m exhausted. I might snore through my alarm in the morning and wake late, the opportunity missed. I don\u0027t dare wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep breath. Tight grip on my axe. Descent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall on either side of the rack is solid, but when I remove one of the bottles, reach in and rap on the \u0027bricks\u0027 behind, there\u0027s a dull echo. Grunting, I grab hold of the edge of the rack and pull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0027t budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exert more pressure - same result. Try the other side - no go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping back. Analysing the problem. Look closer at the wooden rack. There\u0027s a thin divide down the middle. I grab sections of the rack on either side of the divide and try prying them apart. They give slightly - a few millimetres - then hold firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrute force isn\u0027t the answer. I\u0027m convinced the divide is the key. I just have to figure out how to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudying the rack. My fingers creep to the top of one of the bottles. Idly twirl it left and right while my brain\u0027s ticking over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m taking a step to the left, to check the sides of the rack again, when I stop and gaze down at my fingers. I half-pull the bottle out, then push it back in. Smiling, I grab, twist and pull the bottle above, then the one beside it. All are loose, but I\u0027m sure, if I go through every bottle on the rack, I\u0027ll find one that isn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMethodical. Start from the bottom left, even though I suspect the device will be situated higher, towards the middle. Checking each bottle in turn, twisting it, tugging it out, placing it back in its original position. I\u0027m leaving fingerprints all over the place - should have worn gloves - but I\u0027ll worry about that later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the way across to the right. Up a row. Then all the way across to the left. Up and across. Up and across. Up and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGetting higher. Minutes ticking away. I quicken my pace, anxious to make progress. Pull too hard on one bottle. It comes flying out and drops to the floor. I collapse after it and catch it just before it hits and smashes into a hundred pieces. Place it back on the rack with shaking fingers. Work at a steady, cautious pace after that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePast the midway mark. Four rows from the top, on the right. My hopes fading. Trying to think of some other way to part the racks. Half-tempted to take my axe to the wood and chop through. I know that\u0027s crazy, but I\u0027m so wound up, I might just -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventh bottle from the right. I twist but it doesn\u0027t move. Everything stops. My breath catches. Step up close to the bottle and examine it. No different to any of the others, except it\u0027s jammed tight into place. I give it a harder shake, to make sure it isn\u0027t simply stuck. No movement at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try pulling the bottle out - it doesn\u0027t give.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudying it again, frowning. My eyes focus on the cork. I grin. Put the tip of my right index finger to the face of the cork. Push gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cork sinks into the bottle. A loud click. The two halves of the wine rack slide apart, revealing a dark corridor angling gently downwards. I do a quick mental geographical check - it leads in the direction of the sheds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI act before fear has a chance to deter me. Step forward. Cross the threshold. Advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve taken no more than eight or nine steps when the wine rack closes behind me with a soft slishing sound. I\u0027m plunged into total darkness. My heart leaps. My hands strike out to touch the walls on either side, just so I have the feel of something real. Split-seconds away from complete panic when...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...lights flicker on overhead. Weak, dull lights, but enough to illuminate the tight, cramped corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart settles. My eyes devour the light. I smile feebly to myself. Turn and retrace my steps. Examining the back of the wine rack, thinking about how I\u0027m going to get out later. A button in the wall to my left. I press it. The lights flick off and the rack slides open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step through to the wine cellar, wait for the rack to close, then open it again and return to the corridor. This time I keep on walking when the rack closes and I\u0027m plunged into temporary darkness. Moments later, when the lights flicker on, I glance up at them wryly and spare them a carefree half-wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrubbs Grady - Mr. Cool!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corridor runs straight and evens out after twenty metres or so. Narrow but high. Moss grows along the walls and ceiling. The floor\u0027s lined with a thin layer of gravel. By the moss, I reckon this tunnel must be decades old, if not centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnel ends at a thick, dark wooden door, with a large gold ring for a handle. I press my ear to the door but can hear nothing through it. If Dervish is in the room beyond, it\u0027ll be impossible to surprise him. I\u0027ll just have to cross my fingers and hope for the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take hold of the huge gold ring. Tug firmly. The door creaks open. I enter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large room, at least the size of the wine cellar. Sturdy wooden beams support the ceiling. Burning torches set in the walls - no electrical lights. A foul stench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave the door open as I step into the room and study my surroundings. A steel cage dominates the room, set close to the wall on my right. Almost the height of the ceiling, thin bars set close together, bolted to the floor in all four corners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the cage - the deer. Still bound and struggling weakly. Lying in a pool of its own waste. Which explains the smell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvancing, giving the cage a wide berth. There are three small tables in this subterranean room. Legs carved to resemble human forms. Surfaces overflowing with books. A chess set half hangs off of one of them. Pens. Writing pads. Candles waiting to be lit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRopes and chains in one corner. No weapons. I thought there\u0027d be axes and swords, like inside the house, but there isn\u0027t even a stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chest - treasure! I snap it open in a rush, treasure-lust momentarily getting the better of my other senses. Is this Lord Sheftree\u0027s legendary hoard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitter disappointment - the chest\u0027s filled with old books and rolled-up parchment. I scrape the paper aside and explore the bottom of the chest, in search of even a single gold nugget or coin, but come up empty-handed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircling the room. Get close to the cage this time. Note a bowl set in the floor - for water, I assume. A door with two locks, neither currently bolted. No hatch for pushing food through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI consider dragging out the deer and setting it free, but that would reveal my having been here. I don\u0027t want Dervish knowing I\u0027m wise to this set-up. Not sure what he\u0027d do to me if he found out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExamining the tables. On two of them the books are layered with dust, the candles have never been used, and the chairs are shoved in tight. On the other there are less books, a few are open, the two large candles on the table are both half burnt down, and the chair\u0027s been pulled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focus on the third table. Walk around it twice without touching it. Wary of magic spells and what might happen if I disturb anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish Bill-E was here. I should have phoned him and cooked up some story to get him to stay the night. But I didn\u0027t want to drag him into this until I was sure - which I\u0027m still not. So far I\u0027ve seen nothing to suggest that Dervish is a werewolf, or that he uses this cell for anything more sinister than holding captured deer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to take a chance with the spells. I pull the chair back a bit more, then sit and cautiously lay my hands on top of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light\u0027s poor here. There are matches on the table but I daren\u0027t light a candle - Dervish might smell it when he returns, or notice that it\u0027s burnt down more than when he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI study one of the open books but I can\u0027t make sense of the words. If it\u0027s in English, it\u0027s protected by reading spells, like the books in Dervish\u0027s study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flick forward a few pages, keeping a finger on the page it was originally opened to. No pictures, though there are a few mathematical or magical diagrams. I turn the pages back and pick up one of the other books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wolf\u0027s bared jaws flash at me! I gasp - raise my hands to protect myself - almost topple out of my chair -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen laugh hysterically as I realise it\u0027s just the cover of a book under the one I picked up. I need to get a grip. Freaking out over a picture - seriously uncool!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaying the upper book aside, I open the one with the picture of a wolf on it. The words in this are also indecipherable, but there are many pictures and drawings - most of creatures which are half-human, half-wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI study the photos and illustrations in troubled silence. The paintings are wilder - men with perfectly normal upper halves, but the lower body of a wolf; women with ordinary bodies and twisted wolfen heads; babies covered in hair, with ripped lips and jagged fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the photos are more disturbing, even though they\u0027re less grisly than the paintings. Most simply depict malformed humans, with lots of hair, distorted faces, sharp teeth and slit eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason they\u0027re so unsettling - they\u0027re real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paintings could be the work of an artist\u0027s vivid imagination, but the photos are genuine. Of course I\u0027m aware that it\u0027s a simple matter in this day and age to forge photographs and warp reality, but I don\u0027t think these are the result of some lab developer\u0027s sick sense of humour. This book has the look and feel of an ancient tome - though some of the snaps are in colour, the colours are dull and splotchy, like in very old photos. I don\u0027t think the people who put this together had the technical know-how to produce digitally enhanced images.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creatures in the book don\u0027t look familiar, though I study their faces at length. If there are Gradys or Garadexes in there, I don\u0027t recognise them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing the book, I pick up another lying to the right. This one\u0027s modern. Glossy photos, mostly of dead human-wolf beasts, showing them cut open, their insides scooped out. I can\u0027t read it, but I know what it is - an autopsy manual. Somebody\u0027s undertaken a study of these wolfen humans and published their findings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin shakily as I imagine what would happen if I went into a library and asked if they had any books on werewolf autopsies!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I lay the autopsy book aside, my eyes fall on a thin volume. Loose sheets, held together by a wrinkled brown leather folder. Opening it, I find myself staring into the red eyes of the demon master - Lord Loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers freeze. My throat pinches shut. It\u0027s not the picture Dervish showed me when he came to visit me in the institute. This one\u0027s more detailed. It shows only the demon\u0027s head. With terrified fascination I study the folds of lumpy red skin, its bald crown, small mouth, sharp grey teeth. Its eyes are especially strange - as I noted before, it seems to have only a dark red iris and pupil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling, I start to turn the drawing over, to check on the other papers in the folder -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;then stop dead at a terrible whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello... Grubitssssssssssch...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon\u0027s voice! I release the paper and stare at the painted face - which, impossibly, nightmarishly - stares back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Release me,\" the demon on the page whispers, its thin lips moving ever so slightly, its eyes narrowing fractionally. \"I hunger for... your pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe painting grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scream, slam the folder shut, and race sobbing for safety, imagining the demon master breathing down my neck every frantic step of the way. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-9.html","bookId":2175,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:41:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:41:32 PM"}
