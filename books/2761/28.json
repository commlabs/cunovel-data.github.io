If that day ever comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith each day that passes, I grow more and more afraid that it never will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find Jacey exactly where I figured she’d be. Soaking in the sun by the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand in the doorway, watching her for a minute before I go out and wake her up. She’s got a magnificent body, stretched out like a cat, basking in the warmth. I have to smile about that, and as I do, she opens her eyes and looks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” she greets me sleepily. “How was your day? I didn’t figure you’d be home until late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. It fucking sucked. Amy Ashby was being her normal bitchy, entitled self, and I’d counted the minutes until the day was over. I went so far as to call Tally on the way home and tear him a new ass, telling him that I’d never work with Amy again. And he’d calmly reminded me that the public loves seeing us together… that it makes me money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it does, so I shut up and finished driving home in silence. But I did have a revelation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I crested the hill to my drive I realized that I’d been looking forward to seeing Jacey. That the anticipation of seeing her was the reason that my day dragged by so slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a startling thought, but now that I’m here, staring down at her, it doesn’t seem so startling. Being with her feels right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s a startling thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was just a day,” I tell her. “How was yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, it was good. I snooped through all your stuff and swam all day. So it was just a day, too.” She stares at me and there is something in her eyes, something I can’t name, but then it’s gone and she grins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have much for you to snoop through,” I tell her, rolling my eyes. “I hate knickknack shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got that right,” she tells me with a yawn, sitting up to stretch. “This house seems almost like a hotel. There’s nothing interesting here, except for the art on the walls. But thank you for having lunch sent over to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No problem,” I answer, pulling her to her feet. Her hand is warm and moist in mine, her touch electric. I drop her fingers as soon as she’s standing. “I don’t want to hang around the house tonight. Are you up for a surprise?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods immediately. “I love surprises. What should I wear?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shorts and a T-shirt are fine,” I answer. “And comfortable shoes. We’re going to be gone for hours, so I hope you had a nice nap.” I smirk, but she doesn’t even flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awesome.” She grins as she dashes inside. “I was bored.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit down on the veranda, staring at the water, pleasantly surprised by her reaction. Most women would’ve wheedled and moaned, wanting to know where we were going. But not Jacey. She likes the thrill of a surprise, I guess. And she must trust me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of that slams into my gut and I push the guilty feelings away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t trust me with real-life stuff. She trusts me in a vague way, like she trusts that I’m not a psychopath who would take her somewhere and rape her or leave her for dead. That’s a big difference from trusting me in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what I tell myself, anyway. But by the time the chartered helicopter lands on the front lawn and we board, Jacey’s eyes are excited and amused… and they tell me more about her than I really want to know. She does trust me… with more than I’m comfortable with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore it because that’s the only thing I can do. Instead, I focus on buckling up and signing the flight agreement for the pilot. When I turn back to Jacey, we’re taking off, and she is practically bouncing up and down like a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never been in a helicopter before,” she tells me radiantly. “This is amazing. Where are we going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll have to wait and see,” I tell her with a grin. “You said you liked surprises.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I do.” She nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe helicopter shudders a bit, then wobbles as the pilot gains control of the weight balance on board. Jacey’s eyes light up and she stares downward as we fly higher and higher, lifting up and away from Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chats for a while, but I can barely hold my eyes open. I’m tired from getting up so early to be on set, and comfortable in the afternoon sun that’s shining in on my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I know it, Jacey is shaking me and squealing like a kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my god. It’s the Grand Canyon. I can’t believe you brought me here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my eyes to find that I’ve been asleep for over two hours and that the Grand Canyon is spread beneath us, majestic and dry and red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you ever been here?” I ask Jacey as I stretch, but I already know the answer to that. She shakes her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I actually haven’t been many places.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought the Grand Canyon was a staple on family vacation lists,” I mention as I stare out the window. Jacey sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably. But my family wasn’t normal. And I didn’t go on very many family vacations. I didn’t go on any after my parents got divorced.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck. Like the asshole I am, I’d forgotten about her shitty childhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I tell her quickly. “I forgot about that. Well, I’m glad that I get to be the first to show you this place. I know I’m weird… it’s dry and desolate, but to me, it’s one of the most beautiful things in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey presses her face to the glass, staring down as we fly across the cavernous gap of the canyon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for bringing me,” she tells me, and she sounds almost shy. “What the hell?” she exclaims as the helicopter starts its descent. “Are we landing in the canyon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle at the wonder in her voice. “I thought you might be hungry,” I explain. “The pilot is going to drop us off for a couple of hours so we can have a picnic and explore a bit, then he’ll be back to pick us up at sundown. Is that okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy shit.” Jacey shakes her head. “I didn’t even know that was possible. Of course it’s okay. It’s amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reaches over and grabs my hand, holding it as the pilot settles the big bird on a flat plane of the canyon. I’m not sure if she’s nervous because of the landing, but just in case, I don’t pull away. It shudders, then comes to a stop. The pilot gets out, then helps us out, cautioning us to duck our heads. I let Jacey hold my hand until I have to shake the pilot’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll see you in a couple of hours,” I tell him. He nods, climbs back inside, and Jacey and I are alone with a picnic basket and a blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he flies away, the wind blows our hair away from our faces, stirring the dust around us. Jacey spins in a circle, trying to see everywhere at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe how gorgeous this place is,” she exclaims. “It’s so… desolate, like you said, but it’s so vibrant and beautiful. It’s like… it’s so tough, yet such beautiful things still grow from it. It’s like a metaphor for life. There’s beauty even in the roughest parts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think?” I raise an eyebrow as I set our stuff down, staring at the few dots of green that grace the red and dusty horizon. “Are you always so deep?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey looks at me, thoughtful and quiet, with a strange expression. “I don’t know. It’s just what this place brings to mind. It reminds me almost of the human spirit. We’re too tough to be kept down, no matter what.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, now you’re scaring me,” I tell her, and I shoot her a dubious look. “You’re getting really deep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No deeper than you were last night,” she tosses back as she spreads the blanket and opens the basket. “And this place sort of demands it, you know? It makes me feel so small.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are small, in the scheme of things,” I answer as I settle next to her. She sifts through the basket, pulling out tiny sandwiches, gourmet olives, and wine, and then she looks up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now this is a picnic,” she announces, pulling out the wine and glasses. “When you do something, you do it right, Dominic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s true. I do. But I don’t answer. Instead, I pop the cork on the wine, pouring us each a glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hands me a turkey sandwich and takes a drink of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you arrange this?” she asks curiously as she takes a bite. “It’s awesome, but it’s so out of the blue. What made you do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t fucking know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chew my sandwich, swallow, then take another bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know,” I actually admit, surprising myself. “I thought you might like it. And we’re supposed to be hanging out. We didn’t say that all of our ‘hanging out’ had to be sexual. We just said we want to have fun. And this is fun for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey smiles, satisfied with my answer. “It’s fun for me, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finish our meal in silence, but words aren’t really necessary. We’re surrounded by one of the Seven Wonders of the World. A conversation would mar the experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we’re putting our trash back into the basket, Jacey’s fingers brush mine and she turns to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see you, you know,” she says quietly. “I know you’re different than what you want people to think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause, staring into her dark eyes. “Oh, really? And you gathered that from a trip to the Grand Canyon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to sound sarcastic, to sound flippant, but the sharpness dies on my tongue, because there’s something in her eyes that tells me that she does see into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head. “No. Not from this trip. But from a lot of little things that you don’t want me to see. You know what Jake told me before I left yesterday? That someone miraculously paid Joe’s back taxes. He has no idea who, but the amount was huge… thousands of dollars. And there’s only one person I know who has that kind of money and might help Joe out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI freeze, refusing to look away from her. “Oh, really? That was nice of someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacey rolls her eyes. “Yeah, it was nice of someone. Why do you pretend to be such an asshole, Dominic? When I know that you aren’t, not really. You just like to pretend that you are. You’re good at pretending.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab her hand, intent on squashing her delusion about me right now… and on getting that soft look out of her eyes once and for all. Every time I see it, every time I see how soft she gets when she thinks she sees something good in me, it twists my guts up and spits them out. Because she’s wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jacey, I’m not good. I’m the opposite of good. Have you ever wondered if people are monsters inside, down where no one can see? Because I don’t have to wonder. I know that I am. Did I pay Joe’s taxes? Yeah, I did. I’ve already got a bunch of time invested in community service with him and I don’t want to have to go somewhere else. Period. I’m not a good guy, Jacey. I’m not the person that you’d like to believe. Please know that. Don’t make the mistake of romanticizing me.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/before-we-fall-beautifully-broken-3/page-28.html","bookId":2761,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:30 PM"}
