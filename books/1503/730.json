was going on?\u0026nbsp;Wasn’t she unable to use any techniques?\u0026nbsp;Just as Zhou Weiqing was feeling rather puzzled, the Tenebrous energy around her suddenly retracted.\u0026nbsp;When Zhou Weiqing saw her body, he couldn’t help but let out a startled cry: “Transformation?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u0026nbsp;Dreamwake was now completely different from earlier.\u0026nbsp;All of her clothes had vanished, and replacing them was a dense layer of black reptilian scales.\u0026nbsp;The scales actually looked quite similar to her Legendary Set.\u0026nbsp;The strangest thing was, her eyes had become a devilish, blood-red color.\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing felt as though he was staring into the eyes of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn enormous pair of wings had already spread out behind Dreamwake.\u0026nbsp;Her entire body was filled with a sense of both beauty and power.\u0026nbsp;She seemed to have become much taller, and her face was now covered with a mask that completely hid her features.\u0026nbsp;All he could see was her devilish, blood-red eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne final arrow landed, and Dreamwake didn’t even move to dodge.\u0026nbsp;Clank!\u0026nbsp;The scales on her body were able to easily deflect the power of Zhou Weiqing’s arrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bastard.\u0026nbsp;There’s no way I’m going to spare you today.”\u0026nbsp;Even Dreamwake’s voice seemed to have grown colder than before.\u0026nbsp;She suddenly flashed forwards, moving twice as fast as she previously did as she instantly swooped over to Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;Her two hands had already transformed into draconic claws as well, and they tore at his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation was one of Dreamwake’s greatest secrets.\u0026nbsp;Not even the Grand Elders had such a powerful ability as this.\u0026nbsp;The Tenebrous Dragon Transformation doubled her speed and strength while quadrupling her defensive power.\u0026nbsp;This was a supremely powerful transformation technique.\u0026nbsp;Although she was currently unable to use any of her Stored Skills, this didn’t mean she was unable to use the power of her bloodline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing was completely dumbfounded.\u0026nbsp;He punched out with twin fists, seeking to block Dreamwake’s claws, but the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation gave her power that was beyond what he could possibly withstand.\u0026nbsp;A loud explosion rang out, followed by Zhou Weiqing being knocked backwards as though he had been shot out of a cannon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreamwake’s wings flapped hard, allowing her to speed up once again as she launched a rainstorm of powerful attacks while chasing after Zhou Weiqing, causing him to let out a series of miserable howls.\u0026nbsp;Thankfully, Dreamwake wasn’t actually trying to kill him and she was holding back slightly.\u0026nbsp;Although she made Zhou Weiqing feel agony, it wasn’t enough to injure him too badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you seriously trying to kill me?!”\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing said angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who told you to be so shameless and lecherous!\u0026nbsp;Yes, I’m going to kill you!”\u0026nbsp;Dreamwake replied, her icy voice echoing nonstop while she continued to launch attacks without any slowdown at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine, then I’ll go all-out as well!\u0026nbsp;Do you really think you are the only one with a transformation?!”\u0026nbsp;A tremendously cold aura suddenly burst out from Zhou Weiqing’s body as well, and all of a sudden he once more launched twin punches against Dreamwake’s claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud explosion rang out once more… and this time, it was Dreamwake who was sent flying backwards.\u0026nbsp;Dreamwake felt as though an utterly enormous surge of power had just slammed into her, sending her backwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow did he suddenly become so powerful?\u0026nbsp;My seal should still be active\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026nbsp;A heartbeat later, Dreamwake saw that Zhou Weiqing had changed as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s clothes had been torn to ribbons, and his body seemed to have actually swelled in size.\u0026nbsp;A dazzling yet evil aura emanated from his body as the tiger tattoos began to pulse through his body as though they were alive.\u0026nbsp;On his forehead, the symbol for ‘King’ appeared, emanating an aura of dominance.\u0026nbsp;His eyes had become red, while a pair of enormous wings spread out behind his back.\u0026nbsp;His entire body emanated a dense gray aura of energy.\u0026nbsp;He slowly lifted up his right leg, which had actually transformed into the shape of a hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat’s this?\u0026nbsp;He can transform as well?\u003c/em\u003e Dreamwake could vaguely make out the translucent image of a great tiger appearing behind Zhou Weiqing’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Demonic Change State!\u0026nbsp;That’s right.\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing used the Demonic Change State, not the Dragon-Tiger Transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation, he was able to tell that within her veins flowed the blood of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Bloodline.\u0026nbsp;He himself, however, definitely was not going to casually reveal his own draconic lineage, because his lineage stemmed from the Dragon Emperor Bloodline of Hui Yao.\u0026nbsp;The Dragon Emperor Bloodline didn’t belong to this continent; it belonged to the Boundless Mainland.\u0026nbsp;The Tenebrous Demon Dragon had mentioned this before.\u0026nbsp;If he displayed the Dragon Emperor Bloodline, wouldn’t that be the same as telling everything that he wasn’t from the Xuantian Continent?\u0026nbsp;And so, his only choice was to use the Demonic Change State.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to the power of his Saint Energy, it wasn’t too hard for Zhou Weiqing to separate his transformation to use the Demonic Change State once more.\u0026nbsp;This transformation focused on providing him with strength, allowing him to increase his power fourfold.\u0026nbsp;His defenses would also be enhanced, but it wouldn’t be by as much as the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation provided.\u0026nbsp;But of course, his Ice Cold Perception wasn’t something the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation could provide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the whole, it looked as though the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation was slightly stronger than the Demonic Change State… but even so, its appearance gave Dreamwake quite the shock.\u0026nbsp;The way in which she looked at Zhou Weiqing instantly changed as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing made Dreamwake feel as though she was staring at an enormous treasury.\u0026nbsp;There was an endless number of secrets she could ‘excavate’ from him, and those treasures all whispered of tremendous power or genius talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What transformation is this?”\u0026nbsp;Dreamwake stared at Zhou Weiqing, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing chuckled. “Have you forgotten that I possess the Demonic Attribute? This is a first-generation Demonic Attribute at that. This transformation is naturally the Demonic Change State, a Controllable Demonic Change State. Ever heard of it? Do you perhaps feel tremendous awe towards me now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreamwake smirked, but she had to admit that Zhou Weiqing had stunned her immensely.\u0026nbsp;“Do you really think your Demonic Change State can withstand my Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither side hesitated.\u0026nbsp;At exactly the same moment, pillars of dark-golden light shot out into the air.\u0026nbsp;Apparently, their various seals had been exhausted at the same time, and so they didn’t hesitate at all in releasing their Consolidated Equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth were dressed in dark-gold Legendary Sets and had used their respective transformations.\u0026nbsp;As far as Dreamwake could tell, both had unleashed the maximum amount of power they had access to.\u0026nbsp;As soon as they donned their Consolidated Equipment, they simultaneously shot out at tremendous speed to charge at each other.\u0026nbsp;They didn’t didn’t choose to use any techniques and instead chose to simply clash against each other in a furious head-long collision, neither having the advantage over the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zhou Weiqing, you are very strong.\u0026nbsp;A bit stronger than I had imagined.”\u0026nbsp;Dreamwake panted slightly as she stared intently at Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth had used up an enormous amount of Heavenly Energy.\u0026nbsp;Even though Dreamwake had a nearly inexhaustible supply of energy, Zhou Weiqing had unleashed one strange attack after another.\u0026nbsp;After he had used the Demonic Change State, his power had increased fourfold… and that was after his equipment strengthened him by sixty-four times!\u0026nbsp;Although she was able to rely on her innate flexibility and agility to dodge, his attacks were still tremendously dangerous to her.\u0026nbsp;And so, in their latest clash she had used up far, far more Heavenly Energy than Zhou Weiqing had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis strength was simply incredible.\u0026nbsp;She only had access to the six-Jeweled cultivation stage, while she had to deal with the strength of a Heavenly King.\u0026nbsp;How was she supposed to fight him?\u0026nbsp;The only way she could win was if Zhou Weiqing’s Heavenly Energy was depleted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing chortled.\u0026nbsp;“I could say the same about you!\u0026nbsp;You are limiting the strength of your Heavenly Energy, after all.\u0026nbsp;Dreamwake, why don’t we just call it a day and count this as a draw?\u0026nbsp;We’ll just treat it as a sparring match.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreamwake let out a cold snort.\u0026nbsp;“In your dreams.\u0026nbsp;Do you think you won?”\u0026nbsp;As she spoke, she slowly lifted her draconic claws up high, then sent an awesome burst of Heavenly Energy out from her body.\u0026nbsp;It remained at the six-Jeweled level, but for some reason it seemed to be a bit different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing could vaguely sense that her body seemed to have grown a bit larger… or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the Legendary Set she wore had actually fused together with her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat type of ability is this?\u003c/em\u003e Zhou Weiqing stared, wide-eyed. He had never before seen anyone who had the power to fuse their transformations with their Consolidated Equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreamwake stared at him coldly.\u0026nbsp;“This is the second form of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation, the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form.\u0026nbsp;Feel proud.\u0026nbsp;I won’t lose.\u0026nbsp;Now that I’ve used the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form, all my attributes and powers have been doubled.\u0026nbsp;In this state, even if I merely use the six-Jeweled cultivation level, I can hold off even a Heavenly King powerhouse for a time. You might be very strong, but you are still nothing before my Tenebruous Demon Dragon’s True Form.\u0026nbsp;The Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form grants me the power of the Tenebrous Demon Dragon for a brief time.\u0026nbsp;Of course, I’ll merely be a six-Jeweled Tenebrous Demon Dragon… but that will be more than enough to deal with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she spoke, she quickly transformed to unleash a dense miasma of darkness energy from her body.\u0026nbsp;She had actually transformed into an enormous dragon, except in a miniaturized form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he hadn’t seen this with his very own eyes, he would never have believed this.\u0026nbsp;Although he also had a second form of his Dragon-Tiger Transformation, ‘Like Dragon Equivalent Tiger’, it only transformed a part of his body.\u0026nbsp;There was no way it could result in something like Dreamwake had just done, transforming into an actual dragon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuantian Palace had just become an even more mysterious place in Zhou Weiqing’s eyes.\u0026nbsp;How many marvelous techniques did this mighty Saint Land possess?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t wait any longer.\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing didn’t want to wait, and he didn’t want to let his opponent maul and dominate him.\u0026nbsp;Dreamwake probably hadn’t called him out simply to test him; there had to be another reason behind it.\u0026nbsp;If he lost, not only would she look down upon him, he’d probably suffer a severe injury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed light flashed through his eyes.\u0026nbsp;Before Dreamwake had fully completed her Tenebrous Demon Dragon Transformation, Zhou Weiqing made his move.\u0026nbsp;He instantly pounced towards her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDreamwake stared at him, a disdainful look in her eyes. She snorted, “It’s useless. While I am transforming into the Tenebrous Demon Dragon’s True Form, I’m in a completely invulnerable state. The only way to break it is if your cultivation level surpasses that of my original level, which means you have to at least be a Heavenly Emperor. Otherwise, there’s no way you can stop my, my… hey, w-what are you doing?!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-247-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-248-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-247-03","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
