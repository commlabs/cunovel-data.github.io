Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not\" (Luke 22:31, 32).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOur faith is the center of the target at which God doth shoot when He tries us; and if any other grace shall escape untried, certainly faith shall not. There is no way of piercing faith to its very marrow like the sticking of the arrow of desertion into it; this finds it out whether it be of the immortals or no. Strip it of its armor of conscious enjoyment, and suffer the terrors of the Lord to set themselves in array against it; and that is faith indeed which can escape unhurt from the midst of the attack. Faith must be tried, and seeming desertion is the furnace, heated seven times, into which it might be thrust. Blest the man who can endure the ordeal!--C. H. Spurgeon\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePaul said, \"I have kept the faith,\"(2 Timothy.4:7) but he lost his head! They cut that off, but it didn\u0027t touch his faith. He rejoiced in three things--this great Apostle to the Gentiles; he had \"fought a good fight,\" he had \"finished his course,\" he had \"kept the faith.\" What did all the rest amount to? St. Paul won the race; he gained the prize, and he has not only the admiration of earth today, but the admiration of Heaven. Why do we not act as if it paid to lose all to win Christ? Why are we not loyal to truth as he was? Ah, we haven\u0027t his arithmetic. He counted differently from us; we count the things gain that he counted loss. We must have his faith, and keep it if we would wear the same crown. --Selected \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e九月二十二日\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「主又说……撒但想要得着你们，好筛你们，像筛麦子一样。但我巳经为你祈求，叫你不至于失了信心。」（路廿二31~32）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e神试验我们的时候，把我们的信心当作射击的箭靶；如果，别的可以免去试验的话，信心是定规免不了试验的。信心最大的试炼乃是被世人遗弃。许多时候神把我们喜乐的甲冑剥去，让我们遭遇一些恐惧战兢的经历，要看我们的信心在试炼中受不受到伤损。眞实的信心能丝毫受不到伤损。－－司布眞\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e保罗说：「所信的道我已经守住了。」（提后四7）虽然他的头没有守住。人们虽能把他的头斩去，却不能把他的信心斩去。这位外邦人的大使徒自以为乐的有三件事━「那美好的仗我已经打过了。当跑的路我已经跑尽了。所信的道我已经守住了。」其余的一切算甚么呢？他获得了胜利；他赢得了奖赏；他不但在地上得到钦仰，并且在天上得到称赞。为甚么我们不能像他那样将万事当作有损的，为要得着基督呢？为甚么我们不能像他那样忠于眞理呢？啊，这是因为我们没有他的算学。他和我们算得不同；我们算为得着的，他算作有损的。但是如果我们要像他那样得戴冠冕，就必须有他那样的信心，并且像他那样守住信心。－－选\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5413.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:48:57 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:48:57 AM"}
