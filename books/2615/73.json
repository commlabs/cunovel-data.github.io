I felt his silent plea for me to side with him and plunge my daggers into Ilinca. Instead of obeying, I dropped them to the ground and curtsied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is ours. Not yours. We protect her. You had your talk. I see by your ‘discussion’ with her that you see what we see. A powerful vampire that is an asset to any vampire court,” Gavril said, slowly walking around Vlad. “A pity you have lost her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently taking my arm, Ilinca guided me to the ballroom. Covered in blood, wounded but healing, I lifted my chin in triumph. Vlad had failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened at her beckoning. We stepped through and heard gasps. I instantly found Ignatius and saw the horror in his eyes. Laura let out a gasp, her hands clasped over her mouth. To reassure them, I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad swept past me. He did not say a word, but grabbed hold of Cneajna’s arm. She cried out as he dragged her behind him, but went willingly. She cast one more hateful look over her shoulder, then was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He will be escorted from our domain,” Ilinca assured me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded slightly, unsure if I was free to go or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlinca kissed my cheek, her hand gently pressing the dagger back into my hand. “Go home, dear Lady Glynis. Rest. Be restored. Return in a fortnight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLounging on his throne, Gavril inclined his head. “Good evening, fair warrior.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I wanted to rush into their arms, I forced myself to walk in a lady-like manner to Ignatius and Laura. My progeny flung her arms around me as Ignatius pressed a loving kiss to my brow. Our gazes met and an understanding passed between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are my love,” I said to him. “Even my Master cannot quench my love for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is of no consequence for now.” Ignatius kissed my lips, his love warming me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad was vanquished and I was free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura sobbed into my neck as Ignatius guided us through the door and out into the cold, wintery night. A carriage awaited us. Adem and his guards were shocked to see me, but Ignatius simply shook his head and they visibly relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the carriage, Katya and Magda let out gasps of delight. Katya flung open the door for us and Ignatius lifted me inside. I was surprised to see both women had pistols at their sides. Magda hastily hid something in a bag and by the repulsion I felt I suspected it was holy relics. Laura sat between Katya and Magda and Ignatius held me in his arms as we took the seat across from them. Adem surprised me by sliding into the carriage and closing the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is a relief to see you alive and well,” Adem said, touching my hand. “We were prepared to fight for you. We have been awaiting Ignatius’s signal to storm inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were going to rescue me?” I was surprised, yet touched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage lurched into motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda leaned over and kissed my hand. “Adem and Ignatius were going to leave us behind, but we insisted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was going to shoot them with my pistol,” Katya informed me proudly with her little smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura pulled up her skirt to reveal a sheath. She patted the hilt of the dagger. “I was going to fight, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucked into Ignatius’s arms, I felt a wave of gratitude and love fill me. “You are truly wonderful friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now the House of Wright,” Ignatius pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Magda gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdem shook his head, chuckling. “Truly? We feared that Glynis would die tonight and instead she is granted her own vampire house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he stroked my hair and held me tight, Ignatius explained all that had occurred. By the end of the tale, Adem was laughing and Magda was beaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we’re no longer Draculas, but Wrights,” Laura said proudly. “I am Laura of the House of Wright.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what is my title?” Katya asked excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katya, Servant of the House of Wright,” Ignatius informed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all? That’s not very fancy.” Katya pouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking her hand, Laura kissed her cheek. “How about Katya, Servant of Laura of the House of Wright.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatya pondered this, her fingers tracing over her throat provocatively. “Perhaps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Considering that you were willing to give your life for Laura, I’m sure we can give you a nice title. Perhaps...” I thought for a moment…“Lady in Waiting to Lady Laura of the House of Wright.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That I like!” Katya declared with gleeful delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda shook her head, partially annoyed. “I say we send her back to her father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, shush, you.” Katya scowled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura bestowed a look of affection upon Katya that bothered me just a little bit. “I will not allow it. She will stay with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurrowing my face into Ignatius’s neck, I clung to him as I listened to Katya and Magda bicker at one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 35\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Lady Glynis Wright\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecember 7, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dosza Palace\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust Before Dawn...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are home at last. No one disturbed our journey through the streets of Buda and we are now safely ensconced within the Dosza Palace. This is now the home to me and my vampire house. It pleases me to no end. I have achieved a victory I had not expected and I am grateful to those who would have fought for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I am happy to be home, I am still disquieted by my interaction with Vlad. The moment when I almost lost my very essence to his power still frightens me. I can never allow myself to become the woman he desires me to be. Despite my initial joy at my victory, I am now struggling with my emotions as I consider what transpired between me and Vlad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaze at the man I love and I worry that he thinks less of me...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you forgive me?” I dared to ask Ignatius as I set my journal and pen aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were downcast as he slowly rubbed my feet. At my question, his gaze lifted to my face. “There is nothing to forgive,” he answered gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I almost lost myself when he bit me.” I swallowed, my disgrace making my face flush. I averted my eyes in shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His blood is in your veins.” Ignatius reached out to touch my hand. “There is nothing to forgive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dared to look at him and saw the sincerity in his eyes. I let out a harsh cry, tears unexpectedly filling my eyes. “I am disgraced and fouled by him. The...bond...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnatius moved to sit by me on the bed. His fingers gently stroked my cheek and neck. “Be calm, Glynis. Our nature works against us. Torments us. Our blood ties to those who created us are dangerous and cruel at times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I laid with him once of my own free will. I was so alone. So...tormented. It is the only peace I have ever found with him. But tonight I just felt sullied when I felt my darkness call to him.” I couldn’t bear to gaze upon Ignatius’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And when you are with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Joy,” I answered easily. “Love. Peace. Happiness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing my face to his, my beloved Ignatius kissed me. It was a soft, chaste kiss. “There is nothing to forgive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe lay down together, facing one another. I drew up my knees and curled up on the pillows. His fingers brushed my hair as he smiled at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you be so kind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is easy with you.” Ignatius replied, smiling. “You bring out all that is best in me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile drew out my own. “And you do the same for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come here,” he whispered, drawing me close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid into the shelter of his arms and he wrapped himself around me. My face buried in his throat, my hands resting against his chest, I felt safe and loved. I sobbed softly as his tenderness began to scour away the taint of Vlad’s touch. He made no move other than to hold me, listening to me cry as his fingers trailed through my curls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was I who rose up to kiss him. Ignatius kissed me lightly, his hands cupping my face. I deepened the kiss, tasting his tongue and lips. My fingers trembled as I began to undress him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you certain?” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I want to be cleansed by your touch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding his fingers into my hair, he kissed me passionately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he entered me, his lips and tongue upon my breasts, I closed my eyes and felt only my love for him. I wrapped my legs tighter around him, pulling him deep, experiencing the exquisite sensation of his manhood full and hard inside of me. My hands traced down his back, feeling the strength of his muscles as well as his long silky black hair under my palms. This was the man I loved, and I relished his touch and his body. When he at last filled me, I let out a soft gasp of pleasure as he kissed my throat, my cheeks and my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTangled together in the aftermath of our lovemaking, I knew that all was perfect between us and all fear and pain was banished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 36\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Journal of Lady Glynis Wright\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecember 24, 1820\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dosza Palace\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristmas is here! Though we are practically buried under snow, the house is full of light and warmth. Ignatius ventured into the blizzard and returned with a pine tree for us to decorate. We made a fine evening of popping corn and stringing it on thread. Katya and Laura brought up apples from the cellar and tucked them into the branches. Though we had no gifts to set under the tree, we still had a joyous time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-73.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
