You are protected, yes. Indeed. From all who would harm you-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Harm him?’ Tomad shouted, wheeling on the Chancellor. ‘He is our son!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Assuredly not you, Tomad Sengar. Nor you, Uruth. Perhaps the protection necessary around a ruler might seem to you a wall, but-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We would speak to him!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘From you,’ Rhulad said in a dreadful rasp, ‘I would hear nothing. Your words are naught but lies. You both lie to me, as Hannan Mosag lies, as every one of my fellow Tiste Edur lies. Do you imagine I cannot smell the stench of your fear? Your hatred? No, I will hear neither of you. However, you shall hear me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor slowly leaned back in his throne, his eyes hard. ‘Our kin will be set free. This I command. They will be set free. For you, my dear parents, it seems a lesson is required. You left them to rot in darkness. In the ships. In the trench-pits. From these egregious acts, I can only assume that you do not possess any comprehension of the horror of such ordeals. Therefore it is my judgement that you must taste something of what you inflicted upon our kin. You will both spend two months interred in the dungeon crypts of the Fifth Wing. You will live in darkness, fed once a day through chutes in the ceilings of your cells. You will have no-one but each other with whom to speak. You will be shackled. In darkness-do you understand, Uruth? True darkness. No shadows for you to manipulate, no power to whisper in your ear. In that time, I suggest you both think long of what Guest Gift means to a Tiste Edur, of honouring our kin no matter how far they have fallen. Of what it truly means to liberate.’ Rhulad waved his free hand. ‘Send them away, Chancellor. I am made ill by their betrayal of our own kin.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Errant, very nearly as stunned as were Tomad and Uruth, missed whatever gesture Triban Gnol used to summon forth the Letherii guards. They appeared quickly, as if conjured from thin air, and closed round Tomad and Uruth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLetherii hands, iron-scaled and implacable, closed about Tiste Edur arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Errant knew that the end had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSamar Dev’s hope of ending things before they began did not last long. She was still four strides from Karsa Orlong when he reached Icarium and Taralack Veed. The Toblakai had approached from the side, almost behind the Jhag-who had turned to contemplate the canal’s murky waters\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– and she watched as the huge warrior reached out one hand, grasped Icarium by an upper arm, and swung him round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaralack Veed lunged to break that grip and his head was snapped by a punch that seemed almost casual. The Gral collapsed onto the pavestones and did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium was staring down at the hand clutching his left arm, his expression vaguely perturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Karsa!’ Samar Dev shouted, as heads turned and citizens\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– those who had witnessed Taralack Veed’s fate-moved away. ‘If you’ve killed the Gral-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He is nothing,’ Karsa said in a growl, his eyes fixed on Icarium. ‘Your last minder, Jhag, was far more formidable. Now you stand here with no-one to attack me from behind.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Karsa, he is unarmed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But I am not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium was still studying that battered hand gripping his arm-the red weals of scarring left by shackles encircling the thick wrist, the dots and dashes of old tattoos-as if the Jhag was unable to comprehend its function. Then he glanced over at Samar Dev, and his face brightened in a warm smile. ‘Ah, witch. Both Taxilian and Varat Taun have spoken highly of you. Would that we had met earlier\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– although I have seen you from across the compound-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She is not your problem,’ Karsa said. ‘I am your problem.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium slowly turned and met the Toblakai’s eyes. ‘You are Karsa Orlong, who does not understand what it means to spar. How many comrades have you crippled?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They are not comrades. Nor are you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What about me?’ Samar Dev demanded. ‘Am I not a comrade of yours, Karsa?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled. ‘What of it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Icarium is unarmed. If you kill him here you will not face the Emperor. No, you will find yourself in chains. At least until your head gets lopped off.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have told you before, witch. Chains do not hold me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You want to face the Emperor, don’t you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And if this one kills him first?’ Karsa demanded, giving the arm a shake that clearly startled Icarium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is that the problem?’ Samar Dev asked. And is that why you’re crippling other champions? Not that any will play with you any more, you brainless bully. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-243.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
