It\u0027s out of the question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right then. Was there anything else you wanted to mention…or do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ever call him Willie again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell he wasn\u0027t going to change his mind. \"I won\u0027t,\" she promised before blurting out, \"Do you know you haven\u0027t kissed me once since you\u0027ve been back? I cannot help but wonder if you\u0027ve even thought of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t thought about much else, but he wasn\u0027t about to admit it. \"We haven\u0027t been alone. Remind me tonight, and I\u0027ll kiss you then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t realize he was teasing her. \"I\u0027ll probably forget,\" she assured him. \"It really doesn\u0027t matter to me one way or another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it does. Watch where you\u0027re going. Some of the holes haven\u0027t been filled yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of holes…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to hear a word about a chapel. Not now, not ever. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you\u0027re being very stubborn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew he was still a little upset about her plan to hide the keep behind a church. Still, he hadn\u0027t told her she couldn\u0027t, giving her hope that by tomorrow he would be more willing to listen to reason. Surely by then, she would have come up with a better explanation than the blunt truth. Admitting she believed the front of his home was downright ugly would only hurt his feelings, and for that reason, she would have to think of something else to tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved on to a far more important matter. \"When we go upstairs tonight, I need to have a serious talk with you. I have something extremely important to tell you,\" she whispered. \"You aren\u0027t going to like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would rather wait until tonight. I just wanted to prepare you in advance,\" she added. \"My news will surely break your heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter wasn\u0027t quite the reaction she anticipated. \"It\u0027s a serious matter,\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I assure you, no matter how serious the news is, my heart\u0027s going to stay intact. Why don\u0027t you tell me now and be done with it? You sound as though you\u0027re dreading it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am dreading it. I\u0027m still going to wait until tonight to tell you, however. You\u0027re about to see your surprise, and I don\u0027t want to ruin your happiness with bad news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly wished she hadn\u0027t tried to prepare him, because now her stomach felt as though it were tied in knots. How could she not be upset? She was going to start a war between two brothers, God forgive her, but she didn\u0027t really have any other choice, did she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had asked Father Sinclair that very question during confession, and while he had firmly agreed she must tell her husband when he came home, he also felt she should tell his soldiers right away. It had taken her a long time to convince the priest how important it was that Connor hear before anyone else. Father finally gave in after she promised him she would remain cautious and avoid ever being alone with Raen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest assured her he was going to come back tomorrow to find out how Connor had reacted. She suspected his real motive was to make certain she was all right, and by then, she fully expected to be able to inform him that Raen had already been banished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor pulled her back to the present by telling her to pay attention to where she was walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brocca\u0027s husband is waiting to find out if you want one of his hound\u0027s pups or not,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would he want to give me a pup?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all he has to give.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a gift, Brenna. You\u0027ve shown his wife kindness and he wishes to repay you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How thoughtful of him,\" she replied. \"Would you mind having a hound inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I\u0027ll tell him you\u0027ll be happy to have the pup then. Try not to lose him, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For heaven\u0027s sake,\" she muttered. \"You\u0027re really doing your best to put me in a bad mood, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t bother to answer her. He surprised her when he pulled her close to his side and put his arms around her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t disappointed it\u0027s a hound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a curious glance. \"No, of course not. Why would you think I would be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was filled with laughter when he answered her. \"It isn\u0027t a piglet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do remember meeting me,\" she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door for her before explaining. \"Of course, I remember. I also remember holding you in my arms. You weighed less than my plaid. I think you were about Grace\u0027s age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I was much older.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You smelled like the piglet you had rolled up in your skirts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t have. I had just had a bath. My sister told me so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were trying to tell me what to do even when you were a baby. I really should have known then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was having difficulty paying attention to the conversation, for his eyes were filled with such warmth, she really couldn\u0027t think about anything else. Lord, he was handsome. \"Known what?\" she asked him in a breathless whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you were going to be trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought that was about the nicest thing he had ever said to her, and it wasn\u0027t until she had let out a loud sigh in appreciation and told him thank you that she realized he hadn\u0027t given her a compliment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t laugh at her. In fact, he pulled her into his arms, leaned down, and whispered, \"You\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know he was going to kiss her until he was doing exactly that. She felt as though she was being crushed against his hard chest, so powerful and fierce was his grip, yet his mouth was surprisingly gentle against hers. His tongue thrust inside to deepen the kiss, arousing a response she didn\u0027t expect or understand until it had ended and he was pulling back away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was suddenly different. She wanted to hold on to him for the rest of her life, and while she wanted to believe it was only because she was so relieved to have him home again to deal with Raen, she knew there was another reason as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in love with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe realization didn\u0027t make her happy. It made her miserable. How had she managed to make such a foolish mistake? He didn\u0027t love her; he just put up with her, that was all, so that he could have heirs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her closely, frowning with concern over the tears he saw in her eyes. \"Mind telling me why you\u0027re crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happened too soon,\" she stammered out. \"I knew better, Connor, honestly I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna, what are you talking about? What happened too soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally came to her senses. She wasn\u0027t about to admit she loved him and thought she\u0027d rather stand na*ed in front of a church full of strangers than admit her mistake. Being vulnerable was bad enough, boasting of it would be horrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t understand if she tried to explain it to him anyway. She doubted he could ever love her. So caught up was he in the past, he simply didn\u0027t have room in his heart for anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you answer me?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I missed you,\" she blurted out. \"I didn\u0027t want to, but I did anyway. You were gone a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answer seemed to satisfy him. He kissed her once again, briefly yet with just as much passion, and then followed her inside and up the stairs to the main floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While you were away, I gathered all the bits and pieces of information from the older men and women here and was finally able to put it all together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you put together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your past,\" she answered. \"I know what happened to your father. I just wanted to tell you I understand why the ruins are still standing. You intend to keep them there until you\u0027ve gained justice in your father\u0027s name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have explained if you\u0027d asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I will ask you my questions in future. Don\u0027t frown, Connor. I want you to be in a good mood when you see my surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe braced himself for what he was about to see, gave her an abrupt nod to let her know he would try to be pleased, and then said, \"Quinlan assures me you haven\u0027t done anything . damaging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damaging? For heaven\u0027s sake, why would you think such a thing?\" she asked before she remembered his reaction to the holes in his courtyard. \"I plan to cover the mess made outside,\" she explained then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After the soldiers put the posts down inside to brace the structure I thought to have constructed, and I…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warning was there in his eyes and in his voice. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We aren\u0027t going to talk about it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not. Smile, Connor. This is your homecoming. Besides, Euphemia may be inside, and I won\u0027t have her thinking we aren\u0027t happily wed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter surprised her. \"Why does it matter what she thinks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he be so dense? \"I must make her like me because she\u0027s your stepmother. You did tell me to honor her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, or maybe I told you I would. It doesn\u0027t matter. She deserves our respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor pulled the door open and waited for her to go ahead of him. She didn\u0027t budge. \"I have one favor to ask you. Tonight, when we sit at the table together…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" he prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed while she blurted out the instruction to him. \"Please look at me often, and don\u0027t frown at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTry to hang on my every word, all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, she didn\u0027t require an answer, for she hurried on ahead into the entrance. A crowd of soldiers waiting for their laird bowed to her as soon as they saw her. She greeted each one by name, which surprised and pleased her husband, until he realized he was already looking at her and smiling and surely appeared to be hanging on her every word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brenna, wait for me in the hall while I settle a few matters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bowed to him for the benefit of his followers and hurried inside. Her thought was to stand in front of the hearth so that she could see his immediate reaction to her additions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was halfway across the chamber before she realized everything was all wrong. She stared in disbelief, for the chamber was once again as stark and forboding as when she\u0027d first seen it. Even the rushes were missing from the floors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat in heaven\u0027s name had happened? Where was the lovely cloth she\u0027d worked so hard to finish before Connor returned?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi\u0027lady?\" Netta whispered from the archway leading to the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna gave the entrance a quick glance, saw that Connor was still fully occupied listening to the petitions of his soldiers, and then hurried over to the servant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened, Netta? Where are all the cushions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady Euphemia had a fit when she sat down on one. She declared it was far too uncomfortable for anyone to suffer, and after trying out each one, she ordered them removed at once. She told me to burn them, mi\u0027lady, so you wouldn\u0027t be embarrassed in front of your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cloth… what about the cloth we put on the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetta shook her head. \" \u0027Twas an accident,\" she whispered. \"At least that is what Lady Euphemia told me. She insisted on having wine with her nooning meal. The color\u0027s red, if you\u0027ll remember, mi\u0027lady, but she misjudged her reach for her goblet and she spilled it everywhere. She insisted the goblet knocked the pitcher over. Oh, mi\u0027lady, it\u0027s ruined now. I know you stayed up half of every night our laird was away so you could finish the stitches, and it looked so lovely too, mi\u0027lady. Why, even Quinlan remarked that it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to hide her own disappointment, she patted Netta and tried to console her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accidents will happen,\" she said. \"I hadn\u0027t realized the cushions were uncomfortable, though. I tried them all and thought they were… all right, but if Lady Euphemia…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said they were lumpy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Well, then, I will try to do better next time. What about the rushes? They were all right, weren\u0027t they? And they certainly gave the room a pleasing scent. So did the flowers,\" she added. \"They\u0027re gone too, aren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady Euphemia also thought the rushes were nice, but she tripped as she tried to walk to the table and almost fell to the floor. She explained her eyesight isn\u0027t what it used to be and bid me to remove the rushes as soon as possible. She was certain you would understand, mi\u0027lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The flowers she admitted she didn\u0027t like at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she explain why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said they reminded her of death because mourners always carry them to the graves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna\u0027s shoulders slumped. What must Euphemia think of her now? \"It was thoughtless of me to put flowers on the mantle. I wasn\u0027t thinking, Netta. I never once considered she would have such a reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must find a way to make up for my mistake,\" she added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi\u0027lady, you couldn\u0027t have known. The chair Lothar gave you has been sent back to him. I wish now he hadn\u0027t spent half the day rubbing a shine in the wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why was it sent back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lady Euphemia confessed she was afraid to sit in it because it was so wobbly. I tried to assure her it was perfectly sound, but I couldn\u0027t sway her. She seemed to be terrified of falling. I think it\u0027s because she\u0027s getting on in years and knows her bones won\u0027t heal if she breaks one. I couldn\u0027t help but wonder if she worried about such things when she was younger. No one\u0027s bones heal well, young or old,\" she added with a nod to let her mistress know she spoke with authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Age must make her more cautious, and we must respect that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s one last thing. I hate to mention it now, after the disappointment you\u0027ve suffered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna was afraid to find out what else Euphemia had found unsatisfactory, but forced herself to ask anyway. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked me if there was anything else you meant to add to the chamber. I mentioned that you were working on a banner to hang on the wall. I boasted about how fine it was,\" she thought to add. \"Lady Euphemia wanted to see it, of course. She seemed pleased when I told her how clever you were with your needle and thread, and how you\u0027d labored over your task such long hours.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-39.html","bookId":1845,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:47 PM"}
