Fred Palakon calls at 7:00. I\u0027ve been in my room since the women\u0027s spa closed at 5, mulling over the prospect of roaming the entire ship to look for whoever it was who called herself Marina Gibson, ultimately discarding that prospect because the photo from last night\u0027s dinner was slid under my door in a manila envelope stamped with the QE2 imprimatur. The photo didn\u0027t come out too well, the main reason being that the Wallaces aren\u0027t in it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-114.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
