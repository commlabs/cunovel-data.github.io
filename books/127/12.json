That is correct.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. And that by the mere prediction thereof, you hope to bring it about, andto have then an army of a hundred thousand available.\n\u003cbr\u003e A. In\u0026nbsp; the first place, that is not so. And\u0026nbsp; if it were, investigation willshow\u0026nbsp; you that barely\u0026nbsp; ten thousand are\u0026nbsp; men of\u0026nbsp; military age, and\u0026nbsp; none ofthese has training in arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q.

Obviously.\u0026nbsp; This courtroom may explode in the next\u0026nbsp; few hours, or it maynot.\u0026nbsp; If it\u0026nbsp; did, the\u0026nbsp; future would\u0026nbsp; undoubtedly be\u0026nbsp; changed in\u0026nbsp; some minorrespects.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. You\u0026nbsp; quibble, Dr. Seldon. Can\u0026nbsp; the overall history of\u0026nbsp; the human race bechanged?\n\u003cbr\u003e A. Yes.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. Easily?\n\u003cbr\u003e A. No. With great difficulty.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. Why?\n\u003cbr\u003e A.\u0026nbsp; The psychohistoric\u0026nbsp; trend of\u0026nbsp; a planet-full\u0026nbsp; of people contains\u0026nbsp; a hugeinertia. To\u0026nbsp; be changed it must be met\u0026nbsp; with something possessing a similarinertia.\u0026nbsp; Either as\u0026nbsp; many people\u0026nbsp; must be\u0026nbsp; concerned, or\u0026nbsp; if the\u0026nbsp; number ofpeople be\u0026nbsp; relatively small, enormous\u0026nbsp; time for change must\u0026nbsp; be allowed. Doyou understand?\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. I think I\u0026nbsp; do. Trantor need not be ruined, if a great many people decideto act so that it will not.\n\u003cbr\u003e A. That is right.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. As many as a hundred thousand people?\n\u003cbr\u003e A. No, sir. That is far too few.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. You are sure?\n\u003cbr\u003e A. Consider that Trantor\u0026nbsp; has a population of over forty billions. Considerfurther that the trend leading to ruin does not belong to Trantor alone butto the Empire as a whole and the Empire contains nearly a quintillion humanbeings.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. I\u0026nbsp; see. Then perhaps a hundred thousand people\u0026nbsp; can change the trend, ifthey\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; their\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; descendants\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; labor\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; for\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; three\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; hundred\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; years.\n\u003cbr\u003e A.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; I\u0027m\u0026nbsp; afraid\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; not.\u0026nbsp; Three\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; hundred\u0026nbsp; years\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; is\u0026nbsp; too\u0026nbsp; short\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; a\u0026nbsp; time.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. Ah! In that case, Dr. Seldon, we are left with this deduction to be madefrom your statements. You\u0026nbsp; have gathered one hundred thousand people withinthe confines of your\u0026nbsp; project. These are insufficient to change the historyof Trantor within three\u0026nbsp; hundred years. In other words, they cannot preventthe destruction of Trantor no matter what they do.\n\u003cbr\u003e A. You are unfortunately correct.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. And on the other hand, your hundred thousand are intended for no illegalpurpose.\n\u003cbr\u003e A. Exactly.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. (slowly\u0026nbsp; and with\u0026nbsp; satisfaction) In that\u0026nbsp; case, Dr. Seldon? Now attend,sir, most\u0026nbsp; carefully, for we want a considered\u0026nbsp; answer. What is the purposeof your hundred thousand?\n\u003cbr\u003e The Advocate\u0027s\u0026nbsp; voice had\u0026nbsp; grown strident. He\u0026nbsp; had sprung his\u0026nbsp; trap; backedSeldon into a comer; driven him astutely from any possibility of answering.\n\u003cbr\u003e There was\u0026nbsp; a rising buzz of\u0026nbsp; conversation at that which\u0026nbsp; swept the ranks ofthe peers\u0026nbsp; in the audience and invaded even\u0026nbsp; the row of Commissioners. Theyswayed\u0026nbsp; toward\u0026nbsp; one another\u0026nbsp; in\u0026nbsp; their\u0026nbsp; scarlet and\u0026nbsp; gold,\u0026nbsp; only the\u0026nbsp; Chiefremaining uncorrupted.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hari\u0026nbsp; Seldon\u0026nbsp; remained unmoved.\u0026nbsp; He\u0026nbsp; waited\u0026nbsp; for the\u0026nbsp; babble to\u0026nbsp; evaporate.\n\u003cbr\u003e A. To minimize the effects of that destruction.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. And exactly what do you mean by that?\n\u003cbr\u003e A. The\u0026nbsp; explanation is simple. The coming destruction\u0026nbsp; of Trantor is not anevent in\u0026nbsp; itself, isolated in the\u0026nbsp; scheme of human development.\u0026nbsp; It will bethe climax to an intricate drama which was begun centuries ago and which isaccelerating in\u0026nbsp; pace continuously.\u0026nbsp; I refer, gentlemen,\u0026nbsp; to the developingdecline and fall of the Galactic Empire.\n\u003cbr\u003e The buzz now became\u0026nbsp; a dull roar. The Advocate, unheeded, was yelling, \"Youare openly declaring that? and stopped because the cries of \"Treason\" fromthe audience\u0026nbsp; showed that\u0026nbsp; the point had\u0026nbsp; been made without\u0026nbsp; any hammering.\n\u003cbr\u003e Slowly, the\u0026nbsp; Chief Commissioner raised his gavel once\u0026nbsp; and let it drop. Thesound was that of a mellow gong. When the reverberations ceased, the gabbleof\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; audience\u0026nbsp; also\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; did.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Advocate\u0026nbsp; took\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; a\u0026nbsp; deep\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; breath.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q.

I\u0026nbsp; do not say now\u0026nbsp; that we can prevent\u0026nbsp; the fall. But it\u0026nbsp; is not yet toolate\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; shorten\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; interregnum\u0026nbsp; which\u0026nbsp; will follow.\u0026nbsp; It\u0026nbsp; is\u0026nbsp; possible,gentlemen, to reduce the\u0026nbsp; duration of anarchy to a single millennium, if mygroup is\u0026nbsp; allowed to act now.\u0026nbsp; We are at a\u0026nbsp; delicate moment in history. Thehuge, onrushing\u0026nbsp; mass of events must\u0026nbsp; be deflected just a\u0026nbsp; little, ?just alittle\u0026nbsp; ?It cannot\u0026nbsp; be much, but\u0026nbsp; it may\u0026nbsp; be enough to\u0026nbsp; remove twenty-ninethousand years of misery from human history.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. How do you propose to do this?\n\u003cbr\u003e A. By saving the\u0026nbsp; knowledge of the race. The sum of human knowing is beyondany one\u0026nbsp; man; any thousand men. With the\u0026nbsp; destruction of our social fabric,science will be broken into a million pieces. Individuals will know much ofexceedingly tiny facets of what there is to know. They will be helpless anduseless by\u0026nbsp; themselves. The bits\u0026nbsp; of lore, meaningless, will\u0026nbsp; not be passedon. They\u0026nbsp; will be\u0026nbsp; lost through the\u0026nbsp; generations. But, if we\u0026nbsp; now prepare agiant summary\u0026nbsp; of all knowledge, it will\u0026nbsp; never be lost. Coming generationswill build\u0026nbsp; on it, and will\u0026nbsp; not have to rediscover\u0026nbsp; it for themselves. Onemillennium will do the work of thirty thousand.\n\u003cbr\u003e Q. All thisA. All\u0026nbsp; my project; my thirty\u0026nbsp; thousand men with their\u0026nbsp; wives and children,are devoting themselves to\u0026nbsp; the preparation of an \"Encyclopedia Galactica.\"They will\u0026nbsp; not complete it in their lifetimes. I will\u0026nbsp; not even live to seeit fairly\u0026nbsp; begun. But\u0026nbsp; by the time\u0026nbsp; Trantor falls, it will\u0026nbsp; be complete andcopies will exist in every major library in the Galaxy.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Chief\u0026nbsp; Commissioner\u0027s gavel rose\u0026nbsp; and fell. Hari Seldon\u0026nbsp; left the standand quietly took his seat next to Gaal.\n\u003cbr\u003e He smiled and said, \"How did you like the show?\"Gaal said, \"You stole it. But what will happen now?\"\"They\u0027ll adjourn the trial and try to come to a private agreement with me.\"\"How do you know?\"Seldon\u0026nbsp; said,\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ll be\u0026nbsp; honest.\u0026nbsp; I don\u0027t\u0026nbsp; know.\u0026nbsp; It depends\u0026nbsp; on the\u0026nbsp; ChiefCommissioner.
