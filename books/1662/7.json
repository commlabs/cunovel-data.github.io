Making friends with his sister, asking way too many questions, almost getting myself killed…twice. Plus discovering their big secret, and all the times I’d ended up with a trace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned as I slid out of my car and slammed the door behind me. No wonder Daemon had been such a douche canoe those months. I was trouble. So was he, but still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate for bio and out of breath, I raced down the nearly empty hall, praying that I’d be safely in my seat before Mr. Garrison strolled in. As I reached for the heavy door, it swung open with a powerful rush and slammed against the wall. The noise echoed down the corridor, drawing the attention of a handful of other late students.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood drained from my face, inch by inch, as I heard the startled gasp from behind me and knew I was busted. A million thoughts ran through my numb brain and none of them was worth a damn. Closing my eyes, fear settled like sour milk in my stomach. What was wrong me? Something was—something was really bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These damn drafty hallways,” Mr. Garrison said, clearing his throat. “They’ll give you a heart attack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes snapped open. He straightened his tie while he clenched his brown suitcase tightly in his right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to speak and agree. Agreeing would be a good thing. Yes, damn drafty hallways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing came. I just stood there like a damn fish. Gaping and gaping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Garrison’s blue eyes narrowed, and his scowl deepened until I thought it would leave a permanent mark on his face. “Miss Swartz, shouldn’t you be in class?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sorry,” I managed to croak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then please, don’t just stand there.” He spread his arms and ushered me inside. “And that is a tardy. Your second.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsure of how I earned my first tardy, I shuffled into class, trying to ignore the giggles from the other students who’d apparently heard my ass getting chewed out. My cheeks flooded with color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Skank,” Kimmy said from behind her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral more giggles erupted from her side of the class, but before I could say anything, Lesa shot the blonde a look. “That’s real funny coming from you,” she said. “You are the same cheerleader who forgot to wear her undies during the pep rally last year, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKimmy’s face turned blood red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Class,” Mr. Garrison said, eyes narrowing. “That’s enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassing Lesa a grateful smile, I took my seat next to Blake and yanked out my textbook while Mr. Garrison began reading off the attendance, making small swipes with his favorite red pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe skipped my name. I was sure it was on purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake nudged me with his elbow. “Are you doing okay over there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. There was no way I was going to let him think that Kimmy was the reason my face had gone albino white. And besides, Kimmy calling me a skank probably had something to do with Simon, which wasn’t even worth my anger right now. “Yeah, I’m perfect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, but it looked forced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Garrison flipped off the lights and launched into a stimulating lecture on tree sap. Forgetting about the boy beside me, I started replaying the door incident over and over again in my head. Had Mr. Garrison really believed it had been a draft? And if he didn’t, what was stopping him from contacting the DOD and handing me over?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnease squirmed in my belly. Was I going to end up like Bethany?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarissa was waiting for me by my locker after biology. “Can I just go home?” I asked as I switched my textbooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. “Having a bad day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could say that.” I thought about elaborating for a second, but what could I tell her? “I was running late this morning. You know how that just screws your day up from there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe headed down the hall, chatting about the party on Friday and what we were going to wear. I really hadn’t put much thought into it, figuring I’d just wear jeans and a shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone is dressing up,” she explained, “since we don’t get a lot of reasons to actually wear something nice around here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We just had homecoming.” I groaned, knowing I didn’t have anything dressy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarissa launched into the routine conversation about what colleges I was going to apply to. She was hoping I would send an application into WVU. Most of the students were applying there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Katy, you really need to start applying,” she insisted as she grabbed a plate of what appeared to be Salisbury steak. “You’re going to run out of time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, I hear it from my mom every day. I will when I decide where I want to go.” Problem was I had no idea where I wanted to go or what I wanted to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have forever,” she said, quick to remind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee was already at our table, and I launched into my own tirade the moment I sat down. “So I can’t wear jeans to the party? I have to wear a dress?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?” Dee blinked and looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carissa told me I had to wear a dress on Friday night. I didn’t really plan for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee picked up her fork and pushed the food around on her plate. “You should wear a dress. We get to be pretty princesses for the night and dress up for the party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not six.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesa snorted and repeated, “Pretty princesses?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, pretty princesses. You can borrow one of my dresses. I have enough.” Dee poked at her green beans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was not right with her. She wasn’t eating and was now suggesting I could wear one of her dresses. “Dee, I don’t think I’d fit in one of your dresses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned her angelic face to mine, lips turned down at the corners. “I have plenty of dresses you can wear. Don’t be silly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at her, dumbfounded. “If I wore one of your dresses, I’d look like a tightly packaged sausage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee’s gaze darted over my shoulders, and whatever she was going to say died on her lips. Her eyes widened and face paled. I was afraid to turn around, half expecting to find a set of DOD officers strolling through our school cafeteria in black suits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture in my brain was equally hilarious and frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly twisted in my seat, preparing myself to be thrown on the floor and handcuffed, or whatever it was they did. It took me a moment to find what Dee was utterly transfixed by, and when I did, I was confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Adam Thompson—the nice twin as I liked to refer to him and he was Dee’s… friend? Boyfriend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” I asked, swiveling around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze darted to me. “Can we talk later?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, it wasn’t something she could say in front of the others. I nodded and glanced behind me. Adam was getting food, but I noticed someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake stood by the doors to the cafeteria, scanning the crowds for someone. His gaze found our table and his hazel eyes settled on me. He smiled, flashing a set of ultra-white teeth, and waved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a little wave back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s that?” Dee asked, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His name is Blake Saunders,” Lesa said, eyeing her lunch. She poked it with her fork as if she expected it to jump off her plate and run away. “He’s a new kid in our biology class. I found out he’s living with his aunt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you go through his personal files or something?” I asked, amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesa snorted. “I overheard him talking to Whitney Samuels. She was giving him the third degree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think he’s coming over here.” Dee turned to me, her expression unreadable. “He’s cute, Katy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. He was very cute. Blake reminded me of a surfer, and that was hot. And he was human. Bonus points there. “He’s nice, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice is good,” Carissa said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice was great, but…I glanced at the table in the back. Daemon wasn’t sitting with us today. He seemed to be in a heated discussion with Andrew. There was also no Ash. Strange. My eyes bounced back to Daemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at that exact moment. The smirk on his face faded. A muscle in his jaw popped. He looked…pissed. Whoa. What’d I do now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee kicked me under the table, and I twisted back around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding beside me was Blake. A nervous smile was on his face as his eyes flickered over the table. “Hey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” I said. “Want to sit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, he took the empty seat beside me. “Everyone is still staring at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, it should fade in a month or so,” I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” Lesa chirped. “I’m Lesa with an e, and this is Carissa and Dee. We’re Katy’s cool friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake laughed. “Nice to meet you. You’re in bio, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesa nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So where are you from?” asked Dee, her voice surprisingly tight. Last time I’d heard that tone was when Ash had shown up at the diner with Daemon before school started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Santa Monica.” After another round of aahs, he grinned. “My uncle was getting tired of the city, so he wanted to get as far away from it as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, this is as far as you can get.” Lesa grimaced after taking a bite of her food. “I bet lunch was better in Santa Monica.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, it’s also questionable there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So how are you adjusting to your classes?” Carissa folded her hands on the table, as if she were going to do an interview for the school newspaper. All she needed was a pen and paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. It’s a much smaller school than my old one, so I’ve been able to find my way around easily. The people are nicer here, except for the whole staring thing. How about you?” He turned to me. “Since you’re still technically new?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh no, I hand over new-kid status completely to you. But it’s pretty cool around here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not much happens, though,” Lesa added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation moved easily. Blake was super friendly. He answered every one of our questions and was quick to laugh. Turned out he had gym with Lesa and art with Carissa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery so often, he’d glance at me and smile, revealing a set of straight white teeth. It had nothing on Daemon’s smile—whenever he decided to grace our world with its presence—but it was nice. And it was also drawing the attention of the other girls. Their eyes kept darting back and forth between us. My cheeks were growing hotter by the second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re having a party Friday night.” Lesa flashed me a quick grin. “You’re more than welcome to come. Dee’s parents are letting us have it at their house while they’re away this weekend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee stiffened with the fork halfway to her mouth. She didn’t say anything, but I could tell she wasn’t happy with the invite. What was her deal? Half the school appeared to be invited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That sounds cool.” Blake glanced at me. “You’re going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, twisting the lid on my water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She doesn’t have a date,” Lesa added with a sly look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth gaped. Real smooth move there. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/onyx-lux-2/page-7.html","bookId":1662,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:02 PM"}
