Huey wasn\u0027t here, and the junkies working the cemetery weren\u0027t coming tonight. He\u0027d had such high hopes. Catch one person involved, and they might begin to unravel the whole mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to get himself to think logically. Fact: An undercover FBI agent was dead. The cops knew he\u0027d been onto something, but no one knew what. He\u0027d been working the clubs. He\u0027d met Nikki and Andy in Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s, and then Andy had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exact way. But Andy had once been a junkie, so her death could have been an accident, even though Nikki was certain it had been murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFact: Andy was appearing to Nikki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFact: Tom Garfield was doing the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFact: There was a purse snatcher at work in New Orleans. Tom Garfield\u0027s ghost had been witnessed before at least two of the attackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo where was the key?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s? With one of the tour guides?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor that matter, where was the elusive Max Dupuis, who owned the tour company?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow he had to talk to the other woman who had seen the dead FBI agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly his introspection was interrupted as something slammed against his thigh. His eyes flew open, and he looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not afraid of ghosts. I\u0027m not afraid of ghosts. I\u0027m not afraid of ghosts,\" Nikki chanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had thought she was fine with the idea of seeing ghosts. That she had become accustomed to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat it was much better to believe in ghosts and her own ability to communicate with them than to believe she was out of her mind and involved with someone who was just as nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was involved. Deeply. He\u0027d barely come into her life, and suddenly…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood God, it wasn\u0027t that serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it was. She\u0027d never felt anything like being with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery light in the apartment was on, so there was nothing to fear from the shadows, because there weren\u0027t any shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had actually considered going back to bed when Brent had first left. But the mind played tricks. It teased and tormented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she wasn\u0027t going back to bed. She had no intention of waking from a deep sleep to find Andy was staring at her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stayed downstairs, turned on the flat-screen television in the living room, making sure she was tuned to a sitcom, and nothing about forensics, cold cases, haunted America, haunted Europe or even historical tragedy. With the television blaring, she put me water on for tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent wouldn\u0027t be gone that long. He had said so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe teakettle began to whistle. She forced herself to hum loudly as she made the tea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCup in hand, she returned to the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an old episode of Cheers on, and she quickly found herself laughing. She just had to keep her mind off…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t think. Don\u0027t allow fear to slip in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was fine. She would be just fine until Brent got back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a prickling sense of unease wash over her, as if it had crept in slowly at first, taking her unaware. The teacup began to rattle in her hands. A deluge of dread began to sweep through her, and with her peripheral vision, she could see…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, and her scream lodged in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huey,\" Brent said, shaking his head. The old ghost had given him one good fright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Injun boy, you\u0027re late,\" Huey told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Sorry. It was a really busy day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuey shook his head, grinning. \"Don\u0027t matter none. It wasn\u0027t one of those nights. Told ya, I don\u0027t rightly know when they is and when they isn\u0027t gonna be here. But we\u0027re watching the place, the lot of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuey grinned broadly. \"You noticed nothin\u0027. I crept up on you like as if you was one of them usual fools.\" Huey\u0027s grin deepened then faded. \"Hey, Injun boy, it\u0027s one thing if I creep up on you, but don\u0027t you be so easy when you\u0027re in here again late at night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent rose, dusting his hands on his pants. \"I promise. You taught me a good lesson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go home, boy,\" Huey said. \"They ain\u0027t coming tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. But I\u0027ll be back. And I won\u0027t be so late,\" Brent promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he headed for the easiest place to jump out, he hesitated, turning back. \"Hey, Huey, have you had any purse snatchers in here lately?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Purse snatchers?\" Huey said. \"Boy, them are drug runners in here now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. But that doesn\u0027t mean a purse snatcher couldn\u0027t come in here, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuey shook his head. \"Haven\u0027t seen any such thing lately. Maybe out on the streets, but in here… no. There\u0027s always suspicious folks around, some of \u0027em I could swear I see walking around the streets, just like you and me, and them thinking they\u0027re all different, masquerading when they pull off their shit in the cemetery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Brent demanded. \"You have a description for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some cops are good and some ain\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Massey? Joulette?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I know something, I\u0027ll be telling you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huey—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I got something, I\u0027ll tell you. Right now… just a feeling in my bones. Or… well, hell, where I used to have bones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Thanks, Huey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You be back here, you hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet, Huey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent started back the way that he had come along the streets, where people still wandered, just not as thickly as they did during the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA saxophone played a sad lament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA drum beat out the rhythm of a rock tune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the corner, the girl still played her flute, the tune plaintive and beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started down Nikki\u0027s street. And stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was suddenly certain that he had been followed. He turned around slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were discarded flyers for the contenders in the day\u0027s political debate strewn on the ground. Cleanup crews hadn\u0027t gotten around to picking them up yet. The wind picked up a piece of paper, and cast it back down again. A group of giggling young women went by, talking about the next club they were heading to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one seemed to be following him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut New Orleans was full of shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started walking again, senses heightened. Had he heard footsteps? Real footsteps, set down by the living?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the sound again. The footsteps had been real. He spun around. No one there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls had moved on. He was well past the flute player. A middle-aged couple, arm in arm, was coming toward him. They smiled and wished him a pleasant evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wished them the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been followed. He was sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked back in the same direction he\u0027d come from, cut over a block and kept walking. He listened, waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one was behind him now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnease filled him. He had been almost back to Nikki\u0027s. Now she was there alone. He quickly turned and headed back toward her place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he reached the old house, he saw that all her lights were on. He quickly opened the gate and hurried to her door. Without bothering with the key, he slammed on the door, hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nikki! Nikki, it\u0027s me. Brent. I\u0027m back. Let me in!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment there was nothing. He felt fear cloud his heart. Then the door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a sigh of relief when Nikki opened the door. She was in the long flannel robe she had donned before he had left. She stared at him in silence. She was pale, and her eyes seemed far too wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nikki?\" he said, worried, and he grabbed her shoulders, ready to push past her, determined to meet whatever might have threatened her from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched his face then, quickly. \"I\u0027m all right,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, what… ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught his hand, clasping it warmly in her own, then taking the time to close and lock the door behind him before she started for the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a beautiful young woman, or the essence of a young woman, seated on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark and lovely, she stared at him like a frightened doe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand flew to her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to rise, started to fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, Andy, don\u0027t go. Please don\u0027t go,\" Nikki said. \"I want to introduce the two of you properly. Brent, this is Andy, Andrea Ciello. Andy, this is Brent, and there\u0027s no reason to be afraid of him. I\u0027ve been telling you all about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrent\u0027s heart thundered. He stepped forward, offering his hand. He felt the touch of mist. The slightest sensation as Andy offered her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped fading and managed a grin for Brent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you do—wow, Nikki. He\u0027s something,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be afraid of me,\" he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well… \" Nikki said, \"We could all sit down, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should leave,\" Andy said quickly, giving them a subtly knowing look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you dare leave,\" Nikki said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please… you have to tell us what happened,\" Brent said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy let out a sigh. \"No, you have to tell me what happened,\" she said firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was evident that she intended to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to believe me,\" Andy told Brent. \"I was a junkie, but I\u0027m not a junkie now. I was a junkie. Well, I\u0027m not anything now, am I?\" she murmured bitterly. \"But I was clean when I was killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikki couldn\u0027t believe that she was sitting in her living room, in the dead of night—no pun intended, she told herself—listening to Andy\u0027s ghost try to explain herself to Brent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was cold, she realized. Ice cold with Andy here. Had she noticed that before?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking the streets, feeling ghosts, getting a sense of the past… no, she had never realized before that it got icy cold in a room with a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt as if she were dreaming, playing a part in some kind of theater of the absurd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, she was proud of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy had appeared again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-37.html","bookId":2268,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
