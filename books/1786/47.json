Something about the way he glanced at his wife caused her cheeks to flush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmused, Leo smoothed over the moment by saying, \"Mr. Hunt, I would like to introduce Dr. Harrow, the physician who helped my sister to recover her health.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pleasure, sir,\" Dr. Harrow said, and shook Hunt\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likewise,\" Hunt replied cordially, returning the shake. But he gave the doctor an odd, speculative look. \"You are the Harrow who runs the clinic in France?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you reside there still?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, although I try to visit friends and family in Great Britain as often as my schedule allows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe I am acquainted with the family of your late wife,\" Hunt murmured, staring hard at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a quick double blink, Harrow responded with a regretful smile, \"The Lanhams. Estimable people. I haven\u0027t seen them for years. The memories, you understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Hunt said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin was puzzled by the long, awkward pause that followed, and the sense of discord that emanated from the two men. She glanced at her family, and Mrs. Hunt, who clearly didn\u0027t comprehend, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Mr. Hunt,\" Mrs. Hunt said brightly, \"are we going to shock everyone by dancing together? They\u0027re going to play a waltz quite soon-and you know you are my favorite partner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunt\u0027s attention was immediately distracted by the flirtatious note in his wife\u0027s voice. He grinned at her. \"Anything for you, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarrow caught Win\u0027s gaze with his own. \"I haven\u0027t waltzed in far too long,\" he said. \"Might you save a place for me on your dance card?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your name is already there,\" she replied, and placed a light hand on his proffered arm. They followed the Hunts to the drawing room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy and Beatrix were already being approached by prospective partners, while Cam closed his gloved fingers over Amelia\u0027s. \"I\u0027ll be damned if Hunt\u0027s the only one who\u0027s allowed to be shocking. Come dance with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid we won\u0027t shock anyone at all,\" she said, accompanying him without hesitation. \"People already assume we don\u0027t know any better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo watched the procession into the drawing room with narrowed eyes. \"I wonder,\" he said to Merripen, \"what Hunt knows about Harrow? Do you know him well enough to ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Merripen said. \"But even if I didn\u0027t, I wouldn\u0027t leave this place until I made him tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made Leo chuckle. \"You may be the only one in this entire mansion who would dare try to \u0027make\u0027 Simon Hunt do anything. He\u0027s a bloody big bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So am I,\" came Merripen\u0027s grim reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a lovely ball, or would have been, if Merripen had behaved like a reasonable human being. He watched Win constantly, hardly bothering to be discreet about it. While she stood in one group or another and he conversed with a group of men that included Mr. Hunt, Merripen\u0027s gaze never strayed far from Win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least three times Win was approached by various men with whom she had engaged to dance, and each time Merripen appeared at her side and glowered at the would-be dance partner until he slunk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerripen was frightening off suitors right and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Miss Marks was unable to deter him. The governess had told Merripen most firmly that his chaper-onage was unnecessary, as she had the situation well in hand. But he had replied obstinately that if she were to act as chaperon, she had better do a better job of keeping undesirable men away from her charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think you\u0027re doing?\" Win whispered to Merripen furiously, as he sent off yet another abashed gentleman. \"I wanted to dance with him! I had promised him I would!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to dance with scum like him,\" Merripen muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin shook her head in bewilderment. \"He\u0027s a viscount from a respected family. What could you possibly object to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a friend of Leo\u0027s. That\u0027s reason enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin glared up at Merripen. She struggled to retain a grasp on her composure. She had always found it so easy to conceal her emotions beneath a serene facade, but lately she was finding that more and more difficult. All her feelings were lurking too close to the surface. \"If you are trying to ruin my evening,\" she told him, \"you\u0027re doing a splendid job of it. I want to dance, and you\u0027re scaring away everyone who approaches me. Leave me alone.\" She turned her back to him, and sighed with relief as Julian Harrow came to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Hathaway,\" he said, \"will you do me the honor-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said before he could even finish the sentence. Taking his arm, she let him lead her into the mass of swirling, waltzing couples. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw Merripen staring after her, and she sent him a threatening look. He returned it with a scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Win walked away, she felt the pressure of a frustrated laugh in her throat. She swallowed it back, thinking that Kev Merripen was the most infuriating man alive. He was a dog in the manger, refusing to have a relationship with her and yet not allowing her to be with anyone else. And knowing his capacity for endurance, it would probably go on for years. Forever. She couldn\u0027t live like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Winnifred,\" Julian Harrow said, his gray eyes concerned. \"This is far too lovely a night for you to be distressed. What were you arguing about?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-47.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM"}
