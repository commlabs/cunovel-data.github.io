In addition, if he relied on his two great Ancestral Symbols, he would even be able to fight on par with those peak experts who have passed one Reincarnation Tribulation.

Then, he stared viciously at the Seventh Seat King, who was standing in the sky. After which, his body shot forward before he directly approached the Seventh Seat King and threw a punch. Immediately, eight thousand purple-gold dragon light tattoos danced.

At this moment, black blood was also dripping off the latter’s hands. Together with the smile on his face, he looked somewhat gloomy.
