{"id":13766,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER III WHITE BLACKMAIL","content":"\"What time is it?\"\u0026nbsp; It\u0027s running out, thought Rearden-but he answered, \"I don\u0027t know, Not yet midnight,\" and remembering his wrist watch, added, \"Twenty of.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m going to take a train home,\" said Lillian.\u0026nbsp; He heard the sentence, but it had to wait its turn to enter the crowded passages to his consciousness. He stood looking absently at the living room of his suite, a few minutes\u0027 elevator ride away from the party. In a moment, he answered automatically, \"At this hour?\"\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s still early. There are plenty of trains running.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re welcome to stay here, of course.\"\u0026nbsp; \"No, I think I prefer to go home.\" He did not argue. \"What about you, Henry? Do you intend going home tonight?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No.\" He added, \"I have business appointments here tomorrow.\"\u0026nbsp; \"As you wish.\"\u0026nbsp; She shrugged her evening wrap off her shoulders, caught it on her arm and started toward the door of his bedroom, but stopped.\u0026nbsp; \"I hate Francisco d\u0027Anconia,\" she said tensely. \"Why did he have to come to that party? And didn\u0027t he know enough to keep his mouth shut, at least till tomorrow morning?\" He did not answer. \"It\u0027s monstrous-what he\u0027s allowed to happen to his company. Of course, he\u0027s nothing but a rotten playboy-still, a fortune of that size is a responsibility, there\u0027s a limit to the negligence a man can permit himself!\" He glanced at her face: it was oddly tense, the features sharpened, making her look older. \"He owed a certain duty to his stockholders, didn\u0027t he?. . . Didn\u0027t he, Henry?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Do you mind if we don\u0027t discuss it?\"\u0026nbsp; She made a tightening, sidewise movement with her lips, the equivalent of a shrug, and walked into the bedroom.\u0026nbsp; He stood at the window, looking down at the streaming roofs of automobiles, letting his eyes rest on something while his faculty of sight was disconnected. His mind was still focused on the crowd in the ballroom downstairs and on two figures in that crowd. But as his living room remained on the edge of his vision, so the sense of some action he had to perform remained on the edge of his consciousness. He grasped it for a moment-it was the fact that he had to remove his evening clothes-but farther beyond the edge there was the feeling of reluctance to undress in the presence of a strange woman in his bedroom, and he forgot it again in the next moment.\u0026nbsp; Lillian came out, as trimly groomed as she had arrived, the beige traveling suit outlining her figure with efficient tightness, the hat tilted over half a head of hair set in waves. She carried her suitcase, swinging it a little, as if in demonstration of her ability to carry it.\u0026nbsp; He reached over mechanically and took the suitcase out of her hand.\u0026nbsp; \"What are you doing?\" she asked.\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m going to take you to the station.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Like this? You haven\u0027t changed your clothes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You don\u0027t have to escort me. I\u0027m quite able to find my own way. If you have business appointments tomorrow, you\u0027d better go to bed.\"\u0026nbsp; He did not answer, but walked to the door, held it open for her and followed her to the elevator.\u0026nbsp; They remained silent when they rode in a taxicab to the station. At such moments as he remembered her presence, he noticed that she sat efficiently straight, almost flaunting the perfection of her poise; she seemed alertly awake and contented, as if she were starting out on a purposeful journey of early morning.\u0026nbsp; The cab stopped at the entrance to the Taggart Terminal. The bright lights flooding the great glass doorway transformed the lateness of the hour into a sense of active, timeless security. Lillian jumped lightly out of the cab, saying, \"No, no, you don\u0027t have to get out, drive on back. Will you be home for dinner tomorrow-or next month?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ll telephone you,\" he said.\u0026nbsp; She waved her gloved hand at him and disappeared into the lights of the entrance. As the cab started forward, he gave the driver the address of Dagny\u0027s apartment.\u0026nbsp; The apartment was dark when he entered, but the door to her bedroom was half-open and he heard her voice saying, \"Hello, Hank.\"\u0026nbsp; He walked in, asking, \"Were you asleep?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No.\"\u0026nbsp; He switched on the light. She lay in bed, her head propped by the pillow, her hair falling smoothly to her shoulders, as if she had not moved for a long time; but her face was untroubled. She looked like a schoolgirl, with the tailored collar of a pale blue nightgown lying severely high at the base of her throat; the nightgown\u0027s front was a deliberate contrast to the severity, a spread of pale blue embroidery that looked luxuriously adult and feminine.\u0026nbsp; He sat down on the edge of the bed-and she smiled, noticing that the stern formality of his full dress clothes made his action so simply, naturally intimate. He smiled in answer. He had come, prepared to reject the forgiveness she had granted him at the party, as one rejects a favor from too generous an adversary. Instead, he reached out suddenly and moved his hand over her forehead, down the line of her hair, in a gesture of protective tenderness, in the sudden feeling of how delicately childlike she was, this adversary who had borne the constant challenge of his strength, but who should have had his protection.\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re carrying so much,\" he said, \"and it\u0027s I who make it harder for you . . .\"\u0026nbsp; \"No, Hank, you don\u0027t and you know it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I know that you have the strength not to let it hurt you, but it\u0027s a strength I have no right to call upon. Yet I do, and I have no solution, no atonement to offer. I can only admit that I know it and that there\u0027s no way I can ask you to forgive me.\"\u0026nbsp; \"There\u0027s nothing to forgive.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I had no right to bring her into your presence.\"\u0026nbsp; \"It did not hurt me. Only . . .\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes?\"\u0026nbsp; \". . . only seeing the way you suffered . . . was hard to see.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t think that suffering makes up for anything, but whatever I felt, I didn\u0027t suffer enough, if there\u0027s one thing I loathe, it\u0027s to speak of my own suffering-that should be no one\u0027s concern but mine. But if you want to know, since you know it already-yes, it was hell for me. And I wish it were worse. At least, I\u0027m not letting myself get away with it.\"\u0026nbsp; He said it sternly, without emotion, as an impersonal verdict upon himself. She smiled, in amused sadness, she took his hand and pressed it to her lips, and shook her head in rejection of the verdict, holding her face hidden against his hand.\u0026nbsp; \"What do you mean?\" he asked softly.\u0026nbsp; \"Nothing . . .\" Then she raised her head and said firmly, \"Hank, I knew you were married. I knew what I was doing. I chose to do it. There\u0027s nothing that you owe me, no duty that you have to consider.\"\u0026nbsp; He shook his head slowly, in protest.\u0026nbsp; \"Hank, I want nothing from you except what you wish to give me. Do you remember that you called me a trader once? I want you to come to me seeking nothing but your own enjoyment. So long as you wish to remain married, whatever your reason, I have no right to resent it. My way of trading is to know that the joy you give me is paid for by the joy you get from me-not by your suffering or mine. I don\u0027t accept sacrifices and I don\u0027t make them. If you asked me for more than you meant to me, I would refuse. If you asked me to give up the railroad, I\u0027d leave you. If ever the pleasure of one has to be bought by the pain of the other, there better be no trade at all. A trade by which one gains and the other loses is a fraud. You don\u0027t do it in business, Hank. Don\u0027t do it in your own life.\"\u0026nbsp; Like a dim sound track under her words, he was hearing the words said to him by Lillian; he was seeing the distance between the two, the difference in what they sought from him and from life.\u0026nbsp; \"Dagny, what do you think of my marriage?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I have no right to think of it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You must have wondered about it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I did . . . before I came to Ellis Wyatt\u0027s house. Not since.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027ve never asked me a question about it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"And won\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; He was silent for a moment, then said, looking straight at her, underscoring his first rejection of the privacy she had always granted him, \"There\u0027s one thing I want you to know: I have not touched her since . . . Ellis Wyatt\u0027s house.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m glad.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Did you think I could?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ve never permitted myself to wonder about that.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Dagny, do you mean that if I had, you . . . you\u0027d accept that, too?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You wouldn\u0027t hate it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027d hate it more than I can tell you. But if that were your choice, I would accept it. I want you, Hank.\"\u0026nbsp; He took her hand and raised it to his lips, she felt the moment\u0027s struggle in his body, in the sudden movement with which he came down, half-collapsing, and let his mouth cling to her shoulder. Then he pulled her forward, he pulled the length of her body in the pale blue nightgown to lie stretched across his knees, he held it with an unsmiling violence, as if in hatred for her words and as if they were the words he had most wanted to hear.\u0026nbsp; He bent his face down to hers and she heard the question that had come again and again in the nights of the year behind them, always torn out of him involuntarily, always as a sudden break that betrayed his constant, secret torture: \"Who was your first man?\"\u0026nbsp; She strained back, trying to draw away from him, but he held her.\u0026nbsp; \"No, Hank,\" she said, her face hard.\u0026nbsp; The brief, taut movement of his lips was a smile. \"I know that you won\u0027t answer it, but I won\u0027t stop asking-because that is what I\u0027ll never accept.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Ask yourself why you won\u0027t accept it.\"\u0026nbsp; He answered, his hand moving slowly from her breasts to her knees, as if stressing his ownership and hating it, \"Because . . . the things you\u0027ve permitted me to do . . . I didn\u0027t think you could, not ever, not even for me . . . but to find that you did, and more: that you had permitted another man, had wanted him to, had-\"\u0026nbsp; \"Do you understand what you\u0027re saying? That you\u0027ve never accepted my wanting you, either-you\u0027ve never accepted that I should want you, just as I should have wanted him, once.\"\u0026nbsp; He said, his voice low, \"That\u0027s true.\"\u0026nbsp; She tore herself away from him with a brusque, twisting movement, she stood up, but she stood looking down at him with a faint smile, and she said softly, \"Do you know your only real guilt? With the greatest capacity for it, you\u0027ve never learned to enjoy yourself. You\u0027ve always rejected your own pleasure too easily. You\u0027ve been willing to bear too much.\"\u0026nbsp; \"He said that, too.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Who?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Francisco d\u0027Anconia.\"\u0026nbsp; He wondered why he had the impression that the name shocked her and that she answered an instant too late, \"He said that to you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"We were talking about quite a different subject.\"\u0026nbsp; In a moment, she said calmly, \"I saw you talking to him. Which one of you was insulting the other, this time?\"\u0026nbsp; \"We weren\u0027t. Dagny, what do you think of him?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I think that he\u0027s done it intentionally-that smash-up we\u0027re in for, tomorrow.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I know he has. Still, what do you think of him as a person?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t know. I ought to think that he\u0027s the most depraved person I\u0027ve ever met.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You ought to? But you don\u0027t?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No. I can\u0027t quite make myself feel certain of it.\"\u0026nbsp; He smiled. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s strange about him. I know that he\u0027s a liar, a loafer, a cheap playboy, the most viciously irresponsible waste of a human being I ever imagined possible. Yet, when I look at him, I feel that if ever there was a man to whom I would entrust my life, he\u0027s the one.\"\u0026nbsp; She gasped. \"Hank, are you saying that you like him?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m saying that I didn\u0027t know what it meant, to like a man, I didn\u0027t know how much I missed it-until I met him,\"\u0026nbsp; \"Good God, Hank, you\u0027ve fallen for him!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes-I think I have.\" He smiled. \"Why does it frighten you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Because . . . because I think he\u0027s going to hurt you in some terrible way . . . and the more you see in him, the harder it will be to bear . . . and it will take you a long time to get over it, if ever. . . .I feel that I ought to warn you against him, but I can\u0027t-because I\u0027m certain of nothing about him, not even whether he\u0027s the greatest or the lowest man on earth.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027m certain of nothing about him-except that I like him.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But think of what he\u0027s done. It\u0027s not Jim and Boyle that he\u0027s hurt, it\u0027s you and me and Ken Danagger and the rest of us, because Jim\u0027s gang will merely take it out on us-and it\u0027s going to be another disaster, like the Wyatt fire.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes . . . yes, like the Wyatt fire. But, you know, I don\u0027t think I care too much about that. What\u0027s one more disaster? Everything\u0027s going anyway, it\u0027s only a question of a little faster or a little slower, all that\u0027s left for us ahead is to keep the ship afloat as long as we can and then go down with it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Is that his excuse for himself? Is that what he\u0027s made you feel?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No. Oh no! That\u0027s the feeling I lose when I speak to him. The strange thing is what he does make me feel.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Hope.\"\u0026nbsp; She nodded, in helpless wonder, knowing that she had felt it, too.\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t know why,\" he said. \"But I look at people and they seem to be made of nothing but pain. He\u0027s not. You\u0027re not. That terrible hopelessness that\u0027s all around us, I lose it only in his presence. And here.\u0026nbsp; Nowhere else.\"\u0026nbsp; She came back to him and slipped down to sit at his feet, pressing her face to his knees. \"Hank, we still have so much ahead of us . . .\u0026nbsp; and so much right now. . . . \"\u0026nbsp; He looked at the shape of pale blue silk huddled against the black of his clothes-he bent down to her-he said, his voice low, \"Dagny . . .\u0026nbsp; the things I said to you that morning in Ellis Wyatt\u0027s house . . . I think I was lying to myself.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I know it.\"\u0026nbsp; Through a gray drizzle of rain, the calendar above the roofs said: September 3, and a clock on another tower said: 10:40, as Rearden rode back to the Wayne-Falkland Hotel. The cab\u0027s radio was spitting out shrilly the sounds of a panic-tinged voice announcing the crash of d\u0027Anconia Copper.\u0026nbsp; Rearden leaned wearily against the seat: the disaster seemed to be no more than a stale news story read long ago. He felt nothing, except an uncomfortable sense of impropriety at finding himself out in the morning streets, dressed in evening clothes. He felt no desire to return from the world he had left to the world he saw drizzling past the windows of the taxi.\u0026nbsp; He turned the key in the door of his hotel suite, hoping to get back to a desk as fast as possible and have to see nothing around him.\u0026nbsp; They hit his consciousness together: the breakfast table-the door to his bedroom., open upon the sight of a bed that had been slept in-and Lillian\u0027s voice saying, \"Good morning, Henry.\"\u0026nbsp; She sat in an armchair, wearing the suit she had worn yesterday, without the jacket or hat; her white blouse looked smugly crisp. There were remnants of a breakfast on the table. She was smoking a cigarette, with the air and pose of a long, patient vigil.\u0026nbsp; As he stood still, she took the time to cross her legs and settle down more comfortably, then asked, \"Aren\u0027t you going to say anything, Henry?\"\u0026nbsp; He stood like a man in military uniform at some official proceedings where emotions could not be permitted to exist. \"It is for you to speak.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Aren\u0027t you going to try to justify yourself?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Aren\u0027t you going to start begging my forgiveness?\"\u0026nbsp; \"There is no reason why you should forgive me. There is nothing for me to add. You know the truth. Now it is up to you.\"\u0026nbsp; She chuckled, stretching, rubbing her shoulder blades against the chair\u0027s back. \"Didn\u0027t you expect to be caught, sooner or later?\" she asked. \"If a man like you stays pure as a monk for over a year, didn\u0027t you think that I might begin to suspect the reason? It\u0027s funny, though, that that famous brain of yours didn\u0027t prevent you from getting caught as simply as this.\" She waved at the room, at the breakfast table. \"I felt certain that you weren\u0027t going to return here, last night. And it wasn\u0027t difficult or expensive at all to find out from a hotel employee, this morning, that you haven\u0027t spent a night in these rooms in the past year.\"\u0026nbsp; He said nothing.\u0026nbsp; \"The man of stainless steel!\" She laughed. \"The man of achievement and honor who\u0027s so much better than the rest of us! Does she dance in the chorus or is she a manicurist in an exclusive barber shop patronized by millionaires?\"\u0026nbsp; He remained silent.\u0026nbsp; \"Who is she, Henry?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I won\u0027t answer that.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I want to know.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re not going to.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s ridiculous, your playing the part of a gentleman who\u0027s protecting the lady\u0027s name-or of any sort of gentleman, from now on? Who is she?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I said I won\u0027t answer.\"\u0026nbsp; She shrugged. \"I suppose it makes no difference. There\u0027s only one standard type for the one standard purpose. I\u0027ve always known that under that ascetic look of yours you were a plain, crude sensualist who sought nothing from a woman except an animal satisfaction which I pride myself on not\u0026nbsp; having given you. I knew that your vaunted sense of honor would collapse some day and you would be drawn to the lowest, cheapest type of female, just like any other cheating husband.\"\u0026nbsp; She chuckled. \"That great admirer of yours, Miss Dagny Taggart, was furious at me for the mere hint of a suggestion that her hero wasn\u0027t as pure as his stainless, non-corrosive rail. And she was naive enough to imagine that I could suspect her of being the type men find attractive for a relationship in which what they seek is most notoriously not brains. I knew your real nature and inclinations. Didn\u0027t I?\" He said nothing. \"Do you know what I think of you now?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You have the right to condemn me in any way you wish.\"\u0026nbsp; She laughed. \"The great man who was so contemptuous-in business-of weaklings who trimmed corners or fell by the wayside, because they couldn\u0027t match his strength of character and steadfastness of purpose! How do you feel about it now?\"\u0026nbsp; \"My feelings need not concern you. You have the right to decide what you wish me to do. I will agree to any demand you make, except one: don\u0027t ask me to give it up.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t ask you to give it up! I wouldn\u0027t expect you to change your nature. This is your true level-under all that self-made grandeur of a knight of industry who rose by sheer genius from the ore mine gutters to finger bowls and white tie! It fits you well, that white tie, to come home in at eleven o\u0027clock in the morning! You never rose out of the ore mines, that\u0027s where you belong-all of you self-made princes of the cash register-in the corner saloon on Saturday night, with the traveling salesmen and the dance-hall girls!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Do you wish to divorce me?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh, wouldn\u0027t you like that! Wouldn\u0027t that be a smart trade to pull! Don\u0027t you suppose I know that you\u0027ve wanted to divorce me since the first month of our marriage?\"\u0026nbsp; \"If that is what you thought, why did you stay with me?\"\u0026nbsp; She answered severely, \"It\u0027s a question you have lost the right to ask.\"\u0026nbsp; \"That\u0027s true,\" he said, thinking that only one conceivable reason, her love for him, could justify her answer.\u0026nbsp; \"No, I\u0027m not going to divorce you. Do you suppose that I will allow your romance with a floozie to deprive me of my home, my name, my social position? I shall preserve such pieces of my life as I can, whatever does not rest on so shoddy a foundation as your fidelity. Make no mistake about it: I shall never give you a divorce. Whether you like it or not, you\u0027re married and you\u0027ll stay married.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I will, if that is what you wish.\"\u0026nbsp; \"And furthermore, I will not consider-incidentally, why don\u0027t you sit down?\"\u0026nbsp; He remained standing. \"Please say what you have to say.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I will not consider any unofficial divorce, such as a separation. You may continue your love idyll in the subways and basements where it belongs, but in the eyes of the world I will expect you to remember that I am Mrs. Henry Rearden. You have always proclaimed such an exaggerated devotion to honesty-now let me see you be condemned to the life of the hypocrite that you really are. I will expect you to maintain your residence at the home which is officially yours, but will now be mine.\"\u0026nbsp; \"If you wish.\"\u0026nbsp; She leaned back loosely, in a manner of untidy relaxation, her legs spread apart, her arms resting in two strict parallels on the arms of the chair-like a judge who could permit himself to be sloppy.\u0026nbsp; \"Divorce?\" she said, chuckling coldly. \"Did you think you\u0027d get off as easily as that? Did you think you\u0027d get by at the price of a few of your millions tossed off as alimony? You\u0027re so used to purchasing whatever you wish by the simple means of your dollars, that you cannot conceive of things that are non-commercial, non-negotiable, non-subject to any kind of trade. You\u0027re unable to believe that there may exist a person who feels no concern for money. You cannot imagine what that means. Well, I think you\u0027re going to learn. Oh yes, of course you\u0027ll agree to any demand I make, from now on. I want you to sit in that office of which you\u0027re so proud, in those precious mills of yours, and play the hero who works eighteen hours a day, the giant of industry who keeps the whole country going, the genius who is above the common herd of whining, lying, chiseling humanity. Then I want you to come home and face the only person who knows you for what you really are, who knows the actual value of your word, of your honor, of your integrity, of your vaunted self-esteem. I want you to face, in your own home, the one person who despises you and has the right to do so. I want you to look at me whenever you build another furnace, or pour another record breaking load of steel, or hear applause and admiration, whenever you feel proud of yourself, whenever you feel clean, whenever you feel drunk on the sense of your own greatness. I want you to look at me whenever you hear of some act of depravity, or feel anger at human corruption, or feel contempt for someone\u0027s knavery, or are the victim of a new governmental extortion-to look and to know that you\u0027re no better, that you\u0027re superior to no one, that there\u0027s nothing you have the right to condemn. I want you to look at me and to learn the fate of the man who tried to build a tower to the sky, or the man who wanted to reach the sun on wings made of wax-or you, the man who wanted to hold himself as perfect!\"\u0026nbsp; Somewhere outside of him and apart, as if he were reading it in a brain not his own, he observed the thought that there was some flaw in the scheme of the punishment she wanted him to bear, something wrong by its own terms, aside from its propriety or justice, some practical miscalculation that would demolish it all if discovered. He did not attempt to discover it. The thought went by as a moment\u0027s notation, made in cold curiosity, to be brought back in some distant future. There was nothing within him now with which to feel interest or to respond.\u0026nbsp; His own brain was numb with the effort to hold the last of his sense of justice against so overwhelming a tide of revulsion that it swamped Lillian out of human form, past all his pleas to himself that he had no right to feel it. If she was loathsome, he thought, it was he who had brought her to it; this was her way of taking pain-no one could prescribe the form of a human being\u0027s attempt to bear suffering-no one could blame-above all, not he, who had caused it. But he saw no evidence of pain in her manner. Then perhaps the ugliness was the only means she could summon to hide it, he thought. Then he thought of nothing except of withstanding the revulsion, for the length of the next moment and of the next.\u0026nbsp; When she stopped speaking, he asked, \"Have you finished?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes, I believe so.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Then you had better take the train home now.\"\u0026nbsp; When he undertook the motions necessary to remove his evening clothes, he discovered that his muscles felt as if he were at the end of a long day of physical labor. His starched shirt was limp with sweat.\u0026nbsp; There was neither thought nor feeling left in him, nothing but a sense that merged the remnants of both, the sense of congratulation upon the greatest victory he had ever demanded of himself: that Lillian had walked out of the hotel suite alive.\u0026nbsp; Entering Rearden\u0027s office, Dr. Floyd Ferris wore the expression of a man so certain of the success of his quest that he could afford a benevolent smile. He spoke with a smooth, cheerful assurance; Rearden had the impression that it was the assurance of a cardsharp who has spent a prodigious effort in memorizing every possible variation of the pattern, and is now safe in the knowledge that every card in the deck is marked.\u0026nbsp; \"Well, Mr. Rearden,\" he said, by way of greeting, \"I didn\u0027t know that even a hardened hound of public functions and shaker of famous hands, like myself, could still get a thrill out of meeting an eminent man, but that\u0027s what I feel right now, believe it or not.\"\u0026nbsp; \"How do you do,\" said Rearden.\u0026nbsp; Dr. Ferris sat down and made a few remarks about the colors of the leaves in the month of October, as he had observed them by the roadside on his long drive from Washington, undertaken specifically for the purpose of meeting Mr. Rearden in person. Rearden said nothing. Dr. Ferris looked out the window and commented on the inspiring sight of the Rearden mills which, he said, were one of the most valuable productive enterprises in the country.\u0026nbsp; \"That is not what you thought of my product a year and a half ago,\" said Rearden.\u0026nbsp; Dr. Ferris gave a brief frown, as if a dot of the pattern had slipped and almost cost him the game, then chuckled, as if he had recaptured it. \"That was a year and a half ago, Mr. Rearden,\" he said easily.\u0026nbsp; \"Times change, and people change with the times-the wise ones do. Wisdom lies in knowing when to remember and when to forget. Consistency is not a habit of mind which it is wise to practice or to expect of the human race.\"\u0026nbsp; He then proceeded to discourse upon the foolishness of consistency in a world where nothing was absolute except the principle of compromise. He talked earnestly, but in a casual manner, as if they both understood that this was not the main subject of their interview; yet, oddly, he spoke not in the tone of a foreword, but in the tone of a postscript, as if the main subject had been settled long ago.\u0026nbsp; Rearden waited for the first \"Don\u0027t you think so?\" and answered, \"Please state the urgent matter for which you requested this appointment.\"\u0026nbsp; Dr. Ferris looked astonished and blank for a moment, then said brightly, as if remembering an unimportant subject which could be disposed of without effort, \"Oh, that? That was in regard to the dates of delivery of Rearden Metal to the State Science Institute. We should like to have five thousand tons by the first of December, and then we\u0027ll be quite agreeable to waiting for the balance of the order until after the first of the year.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden sat looking at him silently for a long time; each passing moment had the effect of making the gay intonations of Dr. Ferris\u0027 voice, still hanging in the air of the room, seem more foolish. When Dr. Ferris had begun to dread that he would not answer at all, Rearden answered, \"Hasn\u0027t the traffic cop with the leather leggings, whom you sent here, given you a report on his conversation with me?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why, yes, Mr. Rearden, but-\"\u0026nbsp; \"What else do you want to hear?\"\u0026nbsp; \"But that was five months ago, Mr. Rearden. A certain event has taken place since, which makes me quite sure that you have changed your mind and that you will make no trouble for us at all, just as we will make no trouble for you.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What event?\"\u0026nbsp; \"An event of which you have far greater knowledge than I-but, you see, I do have knowledge of it, even though you would much prefer me to have none.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What event?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Since it is your secret, Mr. Rearden, why not let it remain a secret? Who doesn\u0027t have secrets nowadays? For instance, Project X is a secret. You realize, of course, that we could obtain your Metal simply by having it purchased in smaller quantities by various government offices who would then transfer it to us-and you would not be able to prevent it. But this would necessitate our letting a lot of lousy bureaucrats\"-Dr. Ferris smiled with disarming frankness-\"oh yes, we are as unpopular with one another as we are with you private citizens-it would necessitate our letting a lot of other bureaucrats in on the secret of Project X, which would be highly undesirable at this time. And so would any newspaper publicity about the Project-if we put you on trial for refusal to comply with a government order. But if you had to stand trial on another, much more serious charge, where Project X and the State Science Institute were not involved, and where you could not raise any issue of principle or arouse any public sympathy-why, that would not inconvenience us at all, but it would cost you more than you would care to contemplate. Therefore, the only practical thing for you to do is to help us keep our secret and get us to help you keep yours-and, as I\u0027m sure you realize, we are fully able to keep any of the bureaucrats safely off your trail for as long as we wish.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What event, what secret and what trail?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh, come, Mr. Rearden, don\u0027t be childish! The four thousand tons of Rearden Metal which you delivered to Ken Danagger, of course.\" said Dr. Ferris lightly.\u0026nbsp; Rearden did not answer.\u0026nbsp; \"Issues of. principle are such a nuisance,\" said Dr. Ferris, smiling, \"and such a waste of time for all concerned. Now would you care to be a martyr for an issue of principle, only in circumstances where nobody will know that that\u0027s what you are-nobody but you and me-where you won\u0027t get a chance to breathe a word about the issue or the principle-where you won\u0027t be a hero, the creator of a spectacular new metal, making a stand against enemies whose actions might appear somewhat shabby in the eyes of the public-where you won\u0027t be a hero, but a common criminal, a greedy industrialist who\u0027s cheated the law for a plain motive of profit, a racketeer of the black market who\u0027s broken the national regulations designed to protect the public welfare-a hero without glory and without public, who\u0027ll accomplish no more than about half a column of newsprint somewhere on page five-now would you still care to be that kind of martyr? Because that\u0027s just what the issue amounts to now: either you let us have the Metal or you go to jail for ten years and take your friend Danagger along, too.\"\u0026nbsp; As a biologist, Dr. Ferris had always been fascinated by the theory that animals had the capacity to smell fear; he had tried to develop a similar capacity in himself. Watching Rearden, he concluded that the man had long since decided to give in-because he caught no trace of any fear.\u0026nbsp; \"Who was your informer?\" asked Rearden.\u0026nbsp; \"One of your friends, Mr. Rearden. The owner of a copper mine in Arizona, who reported to us that you had purchased an extra amount of copper last month, above the regular tonnage required for the monthly quota of Rearden Metal which the law permits you to produce. Copper is one of the ingredients of Rearden Metal, isn\u0027t it? That was all the information we needed. The rest was easy to trace. You mustn\u0027t blame that mine owner too much. The copper producers, as you know, are being squeezed so badly right now that the man had to offer something of value in order to obtain a favor, an \u0027emergency need\u0027 ruling which suspended a few of the directives in his case and gave him a little breathing spell. The person to whom he traded his information knew where it would have the highest value, so he traded it to me, in return for certain favors he needed. So all the necessary evidence, as well as the next ten years of your life, are now in my possession-and I am offering you a trade. I\u0027m sure you won\u0027t object, since trade is your specialty. The form may be a little different from what it was in your youth-but you\u0027re a smart trader, you\u0027ve always known how to take advantage of changing conditions, and these are the conditions of our day, so it should not be difficult for you to see where your interests lie and to act accordingly.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden said calmly, \"In my youth, this was called blackmail.\"\u0026nbsp; Dr. Ferris grinned. \"That\u0027s what it is, Mr. Rearden. We\u0027ve entered a much more realistic age.\"\u0026nbsp; But there was a peculiar difference, thought Rearden, between the manner of a plain blackmailer and that of Dr. Ferris. A blackmailer would show signs of gloating over his victim\u0027s sin and of acknowledging its evil, he would suggest a threat to the victim and a sense of danger to them both. Dr. Ferris conveyed none of it. His manner was that of dealing with the normal and the natural, it suggested a sense of safety, it held no tone of condemnation, but a hint of comradeship, a comradeship based-for both of them-on self-contempt. The sudden feeling that made Rearden lean forward in a posture of eager attentiveness, was the feeling that he was about to discover another step along his half glimpsed trail.\u0026nbsp; Seeing Rearden\u0027s look of interest, Dr. Ferris smiled and congratulated himself on having caught the right key. The game was clear to him now, the markings of the pattern were falling in the right order; some men, thought Dr. Ferris, would do anything so long as it was left unnamed, but this man wanted frankness, this was the tough realist he had expected to find.\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re a practical man, Mr. Rearden,\" said Dr. Ferris amiably. \"I can\u0027t understand why you should want to stay behind the times. Why don\u0027t you adjust yourself and play it right? You\u0027re smarter than most of them. You\u0027re a valuable person, we\u0027ve wanted you for a long time, and when I heard that you were trying to string along with Jim Taggart, I knew you could be had. Don\u0027t bother with Jim Taggart, he\u0027s nothing, he\u0027s just flea-bait. Get into the big game. We can use you and you can use us. Want us to step on Orren Boyle for you? He\u0027s given you an awful beating, want us to trim him down a little? It can be done. Or want us to keep Ken Danagger in line? Look how impractical you\u0027ve been about that. I know why you sold him the Metal-it\u0027s because you need him to get coal from. So you take a chance on going to jail and paying huge fines, just to keep on the good side of Ken Danagger. Do you call that good business? Now, make a deal with us and just let Mr. Danagger understand that if he doesn\u0027t toe the line, he\u0027ll go to jail, but you won\u0027t, because you\u0027ve got friends he hasn\u0027t got-and you\u0027ll never have to worry about your coal supply from then on. Now that\u0027s the modern way of doing business. Ask yourself which way is more practical. And whatever anyone\u0027s said about you, nobody\u0027s ever denied that you\u0027re a great businessman and a hard-headed realist.\"\u0026nbsp; \"That\u0027s what I am,\" said Rearden.\u0026nbsp; \"That\u0027s what I thought,\" said Dr. Ferris. \"You rose to riches in an age when most men were going bankrupt, you\u0027ve always managed to blast obstacles, to keep your mills going and to make money-that\u0027s your reputation-so you wouldn\u0027t want to be impractical now, would you? What for? What do you care, so long as you make money? Leave the theories to people like Bertram Scudder and the ideals to people like Balph Eubank-and be yourself. Come down to earth. You\u0027re not the man who\u0027d let sentiment interfere with business.\"\u0026nbsp; \"No,\" said Rearden slowly, \"I wouldn\u0027t. Not any kind of sentiment.\"\u0026nbsp; Dr. Ferris smiled. \"Don\u0027t you suppose we knew it?\" he said, his tone suggesting that he was letting his patent-leather hair down to impress a fellow criminal by a display of superior cunning. \"We\u0027ve waited a long time to get something on you. You honest men are such a problem and such a headache. But we knew you\u0027d slip sooner or later-and this is just what we wanted.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You seem to be pleased about it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t I have good reason to be?\"\u0026nbsp; \"But, after all, I did break one of your laws.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Well, what do you think they\u0027re for?\"\u0026nbsp; Dr. Ferris did not notice the sudden look on Rearden\u0027s face, the look of a man hit by the first vision of that which he had sought to see.\u0026nbsp; Dr. Ferris was past the stage of seeing; he was intent upon delivering the last blows to an animal caught in a trap.\u0026nbsp; \"Did you really think that we want those laws to be observed?\" said Dr. Ferris. \"We want them broken. You\u0027d better get it straight that it\u0027s not a bunch of boy scouts you\u0027re up against-then you\u0027ll know that this is not the age for beautiful gestures. We\u0027re after power and we mean it. You fellows were pikers, but we know the real trick, and you\u0027d better get wise to it. There\u0027s no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren\u0027t enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What\u0027s there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted-and you create a nation of law-breakers-and then you cash in on guilt. Now that\u0027s the system, Mr. Rearden, that\u0027s the game, and once you understand it, you\u0027ll be much easier to deal with.\"\u0026nbsp; Watching Dr. Ferris watch him, Rearden saw the sudden twitch of anxiety, the look that precedes panic, as if a clean card had fallen on the table from a deck Dr. Ferris had never seen before.\u0026nbsp; What Dr. Ferris was seeing in Rearden\u0027s face was the look of luminous serenity that comes from the sudden answer to an old, dark problem, a look of relaxation and eagerness together; there was a youthful clarity in Rearden\u0027s eyes and the faintest touch of contempt in the line of his mouth. Whatever this meant-and Dr. Ferris could not decipher it -he was certain of one thing: the face held no sign of guilt.\u0026nbsp; \"There\u0027s a flaw in your system, Dr. Ferris,\" Rearden said quietly, almost lightly, \"a practical flaw which you will discover when you put me on trial for selling four thousand tons of Rearden Metal to Ken Danagger.\"\u0026nbsp; It took twenty seconds-Rearden could feel them moving past slowly-at the end of which Dr. Ferris became convinced that he had heard Rearden\u0027s final decision.\u0026nbsp; \"Do you think we\u0027re bluffing?\" snapped Dr. Ferris; his voice suddenly had the quality of the animals he had spent so much time studying: it sounded as if he were baring his teeth.\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Rearden. \"I don\u0027t care, one way or the other.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Are you going to be as impractical as that?\"\u0026nbsp; \"The evaluation of an action as \u0027practical,\u0027 Dr. Ferris, depends on what it is that one wishes to practice.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Haven\u0027t you always placed your self-interest above all else?\"\u0026nbsp; \"That is what I am doing right now.\"\u0026nbsp; \"If you think we\u0027ll let you get away with a-\"\u0026nbsp; \"You will now please get out of here.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Whom do you think you\u0027re fooling?\" Dr. Ferris\u0027 voice had risen close to the edge of a scream. \"The day of the barons of industry is done! You\u0027ve got the goods, but we\u0027ve got the goods on you, and you\u0027re going to play it our way or you\u0027ll-\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden had pressed a button; Miss Ives entered the office.\u0026nbsp; \"Dr. Ferris has become confused and has lost his way, Miss Ives,\" said Rearden. \"Will you escort him out please?\" He turned to Ferris.\u0026nbsp; \"Miss Ives is a woman, she weighs about a hundred pounds, and she has no practical qualifications at all, only a superlative intellectual efficiency. She would never do for a bouncer in a saloon, only in an impractical place, such as a factory.\"\u0026nbsp; Miss Ives looked as if she was performing a duty of no greater emotional significance than taking dictation about a list of shipping invoices. Standing straight in a disciplined manner of icy formality, she held the door open, let Dr. Ferris cross the room, then walked out first; Dr. Ferris followed.\u0026nbsp; She came back a few minutes later, laughing in uncontrollable exultation.\u0026nbsp; \"Mr. Rearden,\" she asked, laughing at her fear for him, at their danger, at everything but the triumph of the moment, \"what is it you\u0027re doing?\"\u0026nbsp; He sat in a pose he had never permitted himself before, a pose he had resented as the most vulgar symbol of the businessman-he sat leaning back in his chair, with his feet on his desk-and it seemed to her that the posture had an air of peculiar nobility, that it was not the pose of a stuffy executive, but of a young crusader.\u0026nbsp; \"I think I\u0027m discovering a new continent, Owen,\" he answered cheerfully. \"A continent that should have been discovered along with America, but wasn\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I have to speak of it to you\" said Eddie Willers, looking at the worker across the table. \"I don\u0027t know why it helps me, but it does-just to know that you\u0027re hearing me.\"\u0026nbsp; It was late and the lights of the underground cafeteria were low, but Eddie Willers could see the worker\u0027s eyes looking at him intently.\u0026nbsp; \"I feel as if . . . as if there\u0027s no people and no human language left,\" said Eddie Willers. \"I feel that if I were to scream in the middle of the streets, there would be no one to hear it. . . . No, that\u0027s not quite what I feel, it\u0027s this: I feel that someone is screaming in the middle of the streets, but people are passing by and no sound can reach them -and it\u0027s not Hank Rearden or Ken Danagger or I who\u0027s screaming, and yet it seems as if it\u0027s all three of us. . . . Don\u0027t you see that somebody should have risen to defend them, but nobody has or will? Rearden and Danagger were indicted this morning-for an illegal sale of Rearden Metal. They\u0027ll go on trial next month. I was there, in the courtroom in Philadelphia, when they read the indictment. Rearden was very calm-I kept feeling that he was smiling, but he wasn\u0027t. Danagger was worse than calm. He didn\u0027t say a word, he just stood there, as if the room were empty. . . . The newspapers are saying that both of them should be thrown in jail. . . . No . . . no, I\u0027m not shaking, I\u0027m all right, I\u0027ll be all right in a moment. . . . That\u0027s why I haven\u0027t said a word to her, I was afraid I\u0027d explode and I didn\u0027t want to make it harder for her, I know how she feels. . . . Oh yes, she spoke to me about it, and she didn\u0027t shake, but it was worse-you know, the kind of rigidity when a person acts as if she didn\u0027t feel anything at all, and . . . Listen, did I ever tell you that I like you? I like you very much-for the way you look right now. You hear us.\u0026nbsp; “You understand . . . What did she say? It was strange: it\u0027s not Hank Rearden that she\u0027s afraid for, it\u0027s Ken Danagger. She said that Rearden will have the strength to take it, but Danagger won\u0027t. Not that he\u0027ll lack the strength, but he\u0027ll refuse to take it. She . . . she feels certain that Ken Danagger will be the next one to go. To go like Ellis Wyatt and all those others. To give up and vanish . . . Why?\u0026nbsp; “Well, she thinks that there\u0027s something like a shift of stress involved-economic and personal stress. As soon as all the weight of the moment shifts to the shoulders of some one man-he\u0027s the one who vanishes, like a pillar slashed off. A year ago, nothing worse could have happened to \u0027the country than to lose Ellis Wyatt. He\u0027s the one we lost.\u0026nbsp; “Since then, she says, it\u0027s been as if the center of gravity were swinging wildly-like in a sinking cargo ship out of control-shifting from industry to industry, from man to man. When we lose one, another becomes that much more desperately needed-and he\u0027s the one we lose next. Well, what could be a greater disaster now than to have the country\u0027s coal supply left in the hands of men like Boyle or Larkin?\u0026nbsp; “And there\u0027s no one left in the coal industry who amounts to much, except Ken Danagger. So she says that she feels almost as if he\u0027s a marked man, as if he\u0027s hit by a spotlight right now, waiting to be cut down. . . . What are you laughing at? It might sound preposterous, but I think it\u0027s true. . . . What? . . . Oh yes, you bet she\u0027s a smart woman! . . . And then there\u0027s another thing involved, she says. A man has to come to a certain mental stage-not anger or despair, but something much, much more than both-before he can be cut down.\u0026nbsp; “She can\u0027t tell what it is, but she knew, long before the fire, that Ellis Wyatt had reached that stage and something would happen to him. When she saw Ken Danagger in the courtroom today, she said that he was ready for the destroyer. . . . Yes, that\u0027s the words she used: he was ready for the destroyer. You see, she doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s happening by chance or accident. She thinks there\u0027s a system behind it, an intention, a man. There\u0027s a destroyer loose in the country, who\u0027s cutting down the buttresses one after another to let the structure collapse upon our heads. Some ruthless creature moved by some inconceivable purpose . . . She says that she won\u0027t let him get Ken Danagger. She keeps repeating that she must stop Danagger-she wants to speak to him, to beg, to plead, to revive whatever it is that he\u0027s\u0026nbsp; losing, to arm him against the destroyer, before the destroyer comes. She\u0027s desperately anxious to reach Danagger first. He has refused to see anyone. He\u0027s gone back to Pittsburgh, to his mines. But she got him on the phone, late today, and she\u0027s made an appointment to see him tomorrow afternoon. . . . Yes, she\u0027ll go to Pittsburgh tomorrow. . . . Yes, she\u0027s afraid for Danagger, terribly afraid. . . . No. She knows nothing about the destroyer. She has no clue to his identity, no evidence of his existence-except the trail of destruction. But she feels certain that he exists. . . . No, she cannot guess his purpose. She says that nothing on earth could justify him. There are times when she feels that she\u0027d like to find him more than any other man in the world, more than the inventor of the motor. She says that if she found the destroyer, she\u0027d shoot him on sight-she\u0027d be willing to give her life if she could take his first and by her own hand . . . because he\u0027s the most evil creature that\u0027s ever existed, the man who\u0027s draining the brains of the world.\u0026nbsp; “. . . I guess it\u0027s getting to be too much for her, at times-even for her. I don\u0027t think she allows herself to know how tired she is. The other morning, I came to work very early and I found her asleep on the couch in her office, with the light still burning on her desk. She\u0027d been there all night. I just stood and looked at her. I wouldn\u0027t have awakened her if the whole goddamn railroad collapsed. . . . When she was asleep? Why, she looked like a young girl. She looked as if she felt certain that she would awaken in a world where no one would harm her, as if she had nothing to hide or to fear. That\u0027s what was terrible-that guiltless purity of her face, with her body twisted by exhaustion, still lying there as she had collapsed. She looked-say, why should you ask me what she looks like when she\u0027s asleep? . . .Yes, you\u0027re right, why do I talk about it? I shouldn\u0027t. I don\u0027t know what made me think of it. . . . Don\u0027t pay any attention to me. I\u0027ll be all right tomorrow. I guess it\u0027s just that I\u0027m sort of shell-shocked by that courtroom. I keep thinking: if men like Rearden and Danagger are to be sent to jail, then what kind of world are we working in and what for? Isn\u0027t there any justice left on earth? I was foolish enough to say that to a reporter when we were leaving the courtroom-and he just laughed and said, \u0027Who is John Galt?\u0027 . . . Tell me, what\u0027s happening to us? Isn\u0027t there a single man of justice left? Isn\u0027t there anyone to defend them? Oh, do you hear me? Isn\u0027t there anyone to defend them?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Mr. Danagger will be free in a moment, Miss Taggart. He has a visitor in his office. Will you excuse it, please?\" said the secretary.\u0026nbsp; Through the two hours of her flight to Pittsburgh, Dagny had been tensely unable to justify her anxiety or to dismiss it; there was no reason to count minutes, yet she had felt a blind desire to hurry. The anxiety vanished when she entered the anteroom of Ken Danagger\u0027s office: she had reached him, nothing had happened to prevent it, she felt safety, confidence and an enormous sense of relief.\u0026nbsp; The words of the secretary demolished it. You\u0027re becoming a coward-thought Dagny., feeling a causeless jolt of dread at the words, out of all proportion to their meaning.\u0026nbsp; \"I am so sorry, Miss Taggart.\" She heard the secretary\u0027s respectful, solicitous voice and realized that she had stood there without answering. \"Mr. Danagger will be with you in just a moment. Won\u0027t you sit down?\" The voice conveyed an anxious concern over the impropriety of keeping her waiting.\u0026nbsp; Dagny smiled. \"Oh, that\u0027s quite all right.\"\u0026nbsp; She sat down in a wooden armchair, facing the secretary\u0027s railing.\u0026nbsp; She reached for a cigarette and stopped, wondering whether she would have time to finish it, hoping that she would not, then lighted it brusquely.\u0026nbsp; It was an old-fashioned frame building, this headquarters of the great Danagger Coal Company. Somewhere in the hills beyond the window were the pits where Ken Danagger had once worked as a miner. He had never moved his office away from the coal fields.\u0026nbsp; She could see the mine entrances cut into the hillsides, small frames of metal girders, that led to an immense underground kingdom. They seemed precariously modest, lost in the violent orange and red of the hills. . . . Under a harsh blue sky, in the sunlight of late October, the sea of leaves looked like a sea of fire . . . like waves rolling to swallow the fragile posts of the mine doorways. She shuddered and looked away: she thought of the flaming leaves spread over the hills of Wisconsin, on the road to Starnesville.\u0026nbsp; She noticed that there was only a stub left of the cigarette between her fingers. She lighted another.\u0026nbsp; When she glanced at the clock on the wall of the anteroom, she caught the secretary glancing at it at the same time. Her appointment was for three o\u0027clock; the white dial said: 3:12.\u0026nbsp; \"Please forgive it, Miss Taggart,\" said the secretary, \"Mr. Danagger will be through, any moment now, Mr. Danagger is extremely punctual about his appointments. Please believe me that this is unprecedented.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I know it.\" She knew that Ken Danagger was as rigidly exact about his schedule as a railroad timetable and that he had been known to cancel an interview if a caller permitted himself to arrive five minutes late.\u0026nbsp; The secretary was an elderly spinster with a forbidding manner: a manner of even-toned courtesy impervious to any shock, just as her spotless white blouse was impervious to an atmosphere filled with coal dust. Dagny thought it strange that a hardened, well-trained woman of this type should appear to be nervous: she volunteered no conversation, she sat still, bent over some pages of paper on her desk. Half of Dagny\u0027s cigarette had gone in smoke, while the woman still sat looking at the same page.\u0026nbsp; When she raised her head to glance at the clock, the dial said: 3:30.\u0026nbsp; \"I know that this is inexcusable, Miss Taggart.\" The note of apprehension was obvious in her voice now. \"I am unable to understand it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Would you mind telling Mr. Danagger that I\u0027m here?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I can\u0027t!\" It was almost a cry; she saw Dagny\u0027s astonished glance and felt obliged to explain: \"Mr. Danagger called me, on the interoffice communicator, and told me that he was not to be interrupted under any circumstances or for any reason whatever.\"\u0026nbsp; \"When did he do that?\"\u0026nbsp; The moment\u0027s pause was like a small air cushion for the answer: \"Two hours ago.\"\u0026nbsp; Dagny looked at the closed door of Danagger\u0027s office. She could hear the sound of a voice beyond the door, but so faintly that she could not tell whether it was the voice of one man or the conversation of two; she could not distinguish the words or the emotional quality of the tone: it was only a low, even progression of sounds that seemed normal and did not convey the pitch of raised voices.\u0026nbsp; \"How long has Mr. Danagger been in conference?\" she asked.\u0026nbsp; \"Since one o\u0027clock,\" said the secretary grimly, then added in apology, \"It was an unscheduled caller, or Mr. Danagger would never have permitted this to happen.\"\u0026nbsp; The door was not locked, thought Dagny; she felt an unreasoning desire to tear it open and walk in-it was only a few wooden boards with a brass knob, it would require only a small muscular contraction of her arm-but she looked away, knowing that the power of a civilized order and of Ken Danagger\u0027s right was more impregnable a barrier than any lock.\u0026nbsp; She found herself staring at the stubs of her cigarettes in the ashtray stand beside her, and wondered why it gave her a sharper feeling of apprehension. Then she realized that she was thinking of Hugh Akston: she had written to him, at his diner in Wyoming, asking him to tell her where he had obtained the cigarette with the dollar sign; her letter had come back, with a postal inscription to inform her that he had moved away, leaving no forwarding address.\u0026nbsp; She told herself angrily that this had no connection with the present moment and that she had to control her nerves. But her hand jerked to press the button of the ashtray and make the cigarette stubs vanish inside the stand.\u0026nbsp; As she looked up, her eyes met the glance of the secretary watching her. \"I am sorry, Miss Taggart. I don\u0027t know what to do about it.\"\u0026nbsp; It was an openly desperate plea. \"I don\u0027t dare interrupt.\"\u0026nbsp; Dagny asked slowly, as a demand, in defiance of office etiquette, \"Who is with Mr. Danagger?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t know, Miss Taggart. I have never seen the gentleman before.\" She noticed the sudden, fixed stillness of Dagny\u0027s eyes and added, \"I think it\u0027s a childhood friend of Mr. Danagger.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh!\" said Dagny, relieved.\u0026nbsp; \"He came in unannounced and asked to see Mr. Danagger and said that this was an appointment which Mr. Danagger had made with him forty years ago.\"\u0026nbsp; \"How old is Mr. Danagger?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Fifty-two,\" said the secretary. She added reflectively, in the tone of a casual remark, \"Mr. Danagger started working at the age of twelve.\"\u0026nbsp; After another silence, she added, \"The strange thing is that the visitor does not look as if he\u0027s even forty years old. He seems to be a man in his thirties.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Did he give his name?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What does he look like?\"\u0026nbsp; The secretary smiled with sudden animation, as if she were about to utter an enthusiastic compliment, but the smile vanished abruptly.\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t know,\" she answered uneasily. \"He\u0027s hard to describe. He has a strange face.\"\u0026nbsp; They had been silent for a long time, and the hands of the dial were approaching 3:50 when the buzzer rang on the secretary\u0027s desk-the bell from Danagger\u0027s office, the signal of permission to enter.\u0026nbsp; They both leaped to their feet, and the secretary rushed forward, smiling with relief, hastening to open the door.\u0026nbsp; As she entered Danagger\u0027s office, Dagny saw the private exit door closing after the caller who had preceded her. She heard the knock of the door against the jamb and the faint tinkle of the glass panel.\u0026nbsp; She saw the man who had left, by his reflection on Ken Danagger\u0027s face. It was not the face she had seen in the courtroom, it was not the face she had known for years as a countenance of unchanging, unfeeling rigidity-it was a face which a young man of twenty should hope for, but could not achieve, a face from which every sign of strain had been wiped out, so that the lined cheeks, the creased forehead, the graying hair-like elements rearranged by a new theme-were made to form a composition of hope, eagerness and guiltless serenity: the theme was deliverance.\u0026nbsp; He did not rise when she entered-he looked as if he had not quite returned to the reality of the moment and had forgotten the proper routine-but he smiled at her with such simple benevolence that she found herself smiling in answer. She caught herself thinking that this was the way every human being should greet another-and she lost her anxiety, feeling suddenly certain that all was well and that nothing to be feared could exist.\u0026nbsp; \"How do you do, Miss Taggart,\" he said. \"Forgive me, I think that I have kept you waiting. Please sit down.\" He pointed to the chair in front of his desk.\u0026nbsp; \"I didn\u0027t mind waiting,\" she said. \"I\u0027m grateful that you gave me this appointment. I was extremely anxious to speak to you on a matter of urgent importance.\"\u0026nbsp; He leaned forward across the desk, with a look of attentive concentration, as he always did at the mention of an important business matter, but she was not speaking to the man she knew, this was a stranger, and she stopped, uncertain about the arguments she had been prepared to use.\u0026nbsp; He looked at her in silence, and then he said, \"Miss Taggart, this is such a beautiful day-probably the last, this year. There\u0027s a thing I\u0027ve always wanted to do, but never had time for it. Let\u0027s go back to New York together and take one of those excursion boat trips around the island of Manhattan. Let\u0027s take a last look at the greatest city in the world.\"\u0026nbsp; She sat still, trying to hold her eyes fixed in order to stop the office from swaying. This was the Ken Danagger who had never had a personal friend, had never married, had never attended a play or a movie, had never permitted anyone the impertinence of taking his time for any concern but business.\u0026nbsp; \"Mr. Danagger, I came here to speak to you about a matter of crucial importance to the future of your business and mine. I came to speak to you about your indictment.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh, that? Don\u0027t worry about that. It doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m going to retire.\"\u0026nbsp; She sat still, feeling nothing, wondering numbly whether this was how it felt to hear a death sentence one had dreaded, but had never quite believed possible.\u0026nbsp; Her first movement was a sudden jerk of her head toward the exit door; she asked, her voice low, her mouth distorted by hatred, \"Who was he?\"\u0026nbsp; Danagger laughed. \"If you\u0027ve guessed that much, you should have guessed that it\u0027s a question I won\u0027t answer.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh God, Ken Danagger!\" she moaned; his words made her realize that the barrier of hopelessness, of silence, of unanswered questions was already erected between them; the hatred had been only a thin wire that had held her for a moment and she broke with its breaking.\u0026nbsp; \"Oh God!\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re wrong, kid,\" he said gently. \"I know how you feel, but you\u0027re wrong,\" then added more formally, as if remembering the proper manner, as if still trying to balance himself between two kinds of reality, \"I\u0027m sorry, Miss Taggart, that you had to come here so soon after.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I came too late,\" she said. \"That\u0027s what I came here to prevent. I knew it would happen.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I felt certain that he\u0027d get you next, whoever he is.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You did? That\u0027s funny. I didn\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I wanted to warn you, to . . . to arm you against him.\"\u0026nbsp; He smiled. \"Take my word for it, Miss Taggart, so that you won\u0027t torture yourself with regrets about the timing; that could not have been done.\"\u0026nbsp; She felt that with every passing minute he was moving away into some great distance where she would not be able to reach him, but there was still some thin bridge left between them and she had to hurry.\u0026nbsp; She leaned forward, she said very quietly, the intensity of emotion taking form in the exaggerated steadiness of her voice, \"Do you remember what you thought and felt, what you were, three hours ago? Do you remember what your mines meant to you? Do you remember Taggart Transcontinental or Rearden Steel? In the name of that, will you answer me? Will you help me to understand?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I will answer whatever I may.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You have decided to retire? To give up your business?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Does it mean nothing to you now?\"\u0026nbsp; \"It means more to me now than it ever did before.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But you\u0027re going to abandon it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why?\"\u0026nbsp; \"That, I won\u0027t answer.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You, who loved your work, who respected nothing but work, who despised every kind of aimlessness, passivity and renunciation-have you renounced the kind of life you loved?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No. I have just discovered how much I do love it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But you intend to exist without work or purpose?\"\u0026nbsp; \"What makes you think that?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Are you going into the coal-mining business somewhere else?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No, not into the coal-mining business.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Then what are you going to do?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I haven\u0027t decided that yet.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Where are you going?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I won\u0027t answer.\"\u0026nbsp; She gave herself a moment\u0027s pause, to gather her strength, to tell herself; Don\u0027t feel, don\u0027t show him that you feel anything, don\u0027t let it cloud and break the bridge-then she said, in the same quiet, even voice, \"Do you realize what your retirement will do to Hank Rearden, to me, to all the rest of us, whoever is left?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes. I realize it more fully than you do at present.\"\u0026nbsp; \"And it means nothing to you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"It means more than you will care to believe.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Then why are you deserting us?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You will not believe it and I will not explain, but I am not deserting you.\"\u0026nbsp; \"We\u0027re being left to carry a greater burden, and you\u0027re indifferent to the knowledge that you\u0027ll see us destroyed by the looters.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t be too sure of that.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Of which? Your indifference or our destruction?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Of either.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But you know, you knew it this morning, that it\u0027s a battle to the death, and it\u0027s we-you were one of us-against the looters.\"\u0026nbsp; \"If I answer that I know it, but you don\u0027t-you\u0027ll think that I attach no meaning to my words. So take it as you wish, but that is my answer.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Will you tell me the meaning?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No. It\u0027s for you to discover.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re willing to give up the world to the looters. We aren\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t be too sure of either.\"\u0026nbsp; She remained helplessly silent. The strangeness of his manner was its simplicity; he spoke as if he were being completely natural and-in the midst of unanswered questions and of a tragic mystery-he conveyed the impression that there were no secrets any longer, and no mystery need ever have existed.\u0026nbsp; But as she watched him, she saw the first break in his joyous calm: she saw him struggling against some thought; he hesitated, then said, with effort, \"About Hank Rearden . . . Will you do me a favor?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Of course.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Will you tell him that I . . . You see, I\u0027ve never cared for people, yet he was always the man I respected, but I didn\u0027t know until today that what I felt was,. . . that he was the only man I ever loved. . . .Just tell him this and that I wish I could-no, I guess that\u0027s all I can tell him. . . . He\u0027ll probably damn me for leaving . . . still, maybe he won\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I\u0027ll tell him.\"\u0026nbsp; Hearing the dulled, hidden sound of pain in his voice, she felt so close to him that it seemed impossible he would deliver the blow he was delivering-and she made one last effort.\u0026nbsp; \"Mr. Danagger, if I were to plead on my knees, if I were to find some sort of words that I haven\u0027t found-would there be . . . is there a chance to stop you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"There isn\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; After a moment, she asked tonelessly, \"When are you quitting?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Tonight.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What will you do with\"-she pointed at the hills beyond the window-\"the Danagger Coal Company? To whom are you leaving it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t know-or care. To nobody or everybody. To whoever wants to take it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re not going to dispose of it or appoint a successor?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No. What for?\"\u0026nbsp; \"To leave it in good hands. Couldn\u0027t you at least name an heir of your own choice?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I haven\u0027t any choice. It doesn\u0027t make any difference to me. Want me to leave it all to you?\" He reached for a sheet of paper. \"I\u0027ll write a letter naming you sole heiress right now, if you want me to.\"\u0026nbsp; She shook her head in an involuntary recoil of horror. \"I\u0027m not a looter!\"\u0026nbsp; He chuckled, pushing the paper aside. \"You see? You gave the right answer, whether you knew it or not. Don\u0027t worry about Danagger Coal. It won\u0027t make any difference, whether I appoint the best successor in the world, or the worst, or none. No matter who takes it over now, whether men or weeds, it won\u0027t make any difference.\"\u0026nbsp; \"But to walk off and abandon . . . just abandon . . . an industrial enterprise, as if we were in the age of landless nomads or of savages wandering in the jungle!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Aren\u0027t we?\" He was smiling at her, half in mockery, half in compassion. \"Why should I leave a deed or a will? I don\u0027t want to help the looters to pretend that private property still exists. I am complying with the system which they have established. They do not need me, they say, they only need my coal. Let them take it.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Then you\u0027re accepting their system?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Am I?\"\u0026nbsp; She moaned, looking at the exit door, \"What has he done to you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"He told me that I had the right to exist.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I didn\u0027t believe it possible that in three hours one could make a man turn against fifty-two years of his life!\"\u0026nbsp; \"If that\u0027s what you trunk he\u0027s done, or if you think that he\u0027s told me some inconceivable revelation, then I can see how bewildering it would appear to you. But that\u0027s not what he\u0027s done. He merely named what I had lived by, what every man lives by-at and to the extent of such time as he doesn\u0027t spend destroying himself.\"\u0026nbsp; She knew that questions were futile and that there was nothing she could say to him.\u0026nbsp; He looked at her bowed head and said gently, \"You\u0027re a brave person, Miss Taggart. I know what you\u0027re doing right now and what it\u0027s costing you. Don\u0027t torture yourself. Let me go.\"\u0026nbsp; She rose to her feet. She was about to speak-but suddenly he saw her stare down, leap forward and seize the ashtray that stood on the edge of the desk.\u0026nbsp; The ashtray contained a cigarette butt stamped with the sign of the dollar.\u0026nbsp; \"What\u0027s the matter, Miss Taggart?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Did he . . . did he smoke this?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Who?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Your caller-did he smoke this cigarette?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why, I don\u0027t know . . . I guess so . . . yes, I think I did see him smoking a cigarette once . . . let me see . . . no, that\u0027s not my brand, so it must be his.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Were there any other visitors in this office today?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No. But why, Miss Taggart? What\u0027s the matter?\"\u0026nbsp; \"May I take this?\"\u0026nbsp; \"What? The cigarette butt?\" He stared at her in bewilderment.\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why, sure-but what for?\"\u0026nbsp; She was looking down at the butt in the palm of her hand as if it were a jewel. \"I don\u0027t know . . . I don\u0027t know what good it will do me, except that it\u0027s a clue to\"-she smiled bitterly-\"to a secret of my own.\"\u0026nbsp; She stood, reluctant to leave, looking at Ken Danagger in the manner of a last look at one departing for the realm of no return.\u0026nbsp; He guessed it, smiled and extended his hand. \"I won\u0027t say goodbye,\" he said, \"because I\u0027ll see you again in the not too distant future.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Oh,\" she said eagerly, holding his hand clasped across the desk, \"are you going to return?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No. You\u0027re going to join me.\"\u0026nbsp; There was only a faint red breath above the structures in the darkness, as if the mills were asleep but alive, with the even breathing of the furnaces and the distant heartbeats of the conveyor belts to show it.\u0026nbsp; Rearden stood at the window of his office, his hand pressed to the pane; in the perspective of distance, his hand covered half a mile of structures, as if he were trying to hold them.\u0026nbsp; He was looking at a long wall of vertical strips, which was the battery of coke ovens. A narrow door slid open with a brief gasp of flame, and a sheet of red-glowing coke came sliding out smoothly, like a slice of bread from the side of a giant toaster. It held still for an instant, then an angular crack shot through the slice and it crumbled into a gondola waiting on the rails below.\u0026nbsp; Danagger coal, he thought. These were the only words in his mind.\u0026nbsp; The rest was a feeling of loneliness, so vast that even its own pain seemed swallowed in an enormous void.\u0026nbsp; Yesterday, Dagny had told him the story of her futile attempt and given him Danagger\u0027s message. This morning, he had heard the news that Danagger had disappeared. Through his sleepless night, then through the taut concentration on the duties of the day, his answer to the message had kept beating in his mind, the answer he would never have a chance to utter.\u0026nbsp; \"The only man I ever loved.\" It came from Ken Danagger, who had never expressed anything more personal than \"Look here, Rearden.\"\u0026nbsp; He thought: Why had we let it go? Why had we both been condemned -in the hours away from our desks-to an exile among dreary strangers who had made us give up all desire for rest, for friendship, for the sound of human voices? Could I now reclaim a single hour spent listening to my brother Philip and give it to Ken Danagger? Who made it our duty to accept, as the only reward for our work, the gray torture of pretending love for those who roused us to nothing but contempt?\u0026nbsp; We who were able to melt rock and metal for our purpose, why had we never sought that which we wanted from men?\u0026nbsp; He tried to choke the words in his mind, knowing that it was useless to think of them now. But the words were there and they were like words addressed to the dead: No, I don\u0027t damn you for leaving-if that is the question and the pain which you took away with you. Why didn\u0027t you give me a chance to tell you . . . what? that I approve?\u0026nbsp; . . . no, but that I can neither blame you nor follow you.\u0026nbsp; Closing his eyes, he permitted himself to experience for a moment the immense relief he would feel if he, too, were to walk off, abandoning everything. Under the shock of his loss, he felt a thin thread of envy. Why didn\u0027t they come for me, too, whoever they are, and give me that irresistible reason which would make me go? But in the next moment, his shudder of anger told him that he would murder the man who\u0027d attempt to approach him, he would murder before he could hear the words of the secret that would take him away from his mills.\u0026nbsp; It was late, his staff had gone, but he dreaded the road to his house and the emptiness of the evening ahead. He felt as if the enemy who had wiped out Ken Danagger, were waiting for him in the darkness beyond the glow of the mills. He was not invulnerable any longer, but whatever it was, he thought, wherever it came from, he was safe from it here, as in a circle of fires drawn about him to ward off evil.\u0026nbsp; He looked at the glittering white splashes on the dark windows of a structure in the distance; they were like motionless ripples of sunlight on water. It was the reflection of the neon sign that burned on the roof of the building above his head, saying: Rearden Steel. He thought of the night when he had wished to light a sign above his past, saying: Rearden Life. Why had he wished it? For whose eyes to see?\u0026nbsp; He thought-in bitter astonishment and for the first time-that the joyous pride he had once felt, had come from his respect for men, for the value of their admiration and their judgment. He did not feel it any longer. There were no men, he thought, to whose sight he could wish to offer that sign.\u0026nbsp; He turned brusquely away from the window. He seized his overcoat with the harsh sweep of a gesture intended to jolt him back into the discipline of action. He slammed the two folds of the overcoat about his body, he jerked the belt tight, then hastened to turn off the lights with rapid snaps of his hand on his way out of the office.\u0026nbsp; He threw the door open-and stopped. A single lamp was burning in a corner of the dimmed anteroom. The man who sat on the edge of a desk, in a pose of casual, patient waiting, was Francisco d\u0027Anconia.\u0026nbsp; Rearden stood still and caught a brief instant when Francisco, not moving, looked at him with the hint of an amused smile that was like a wink between conspirators at a secret they both understood, but would not acknowledge. It was only an instant, almost too brief to grasp, because it seemed to him that Francisco rose at once at his entrance, with a movement of courteous deference. The movement suggested a strict formality, the denial of any attempt at presumption-but it stressed the intimacy of the fact that he uttered no word of greeting or explanation.\u0026nbsp; Rearden asked, his voice hard, \"What are you doing here?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I thought that you would want to see me tonight, Mr. Rearden.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why?\"\u0026nbsp; \"For the same reason that has kept you so late in your office. You were not working.\"\u0026nbsp; \"How long have you been sitting here?\"\u0026nbsp; \"An hour or two.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why didn\u0027t you knock at my door?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Would you have allowed me to come in?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re late in asking that question.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Shall I leave, Mr. Rearden?\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden pointed to the door of his office. \"Come in.\"\u0026nbsp; Turning the lights on in the office, moving with unhurried control, Rearden thought that he must not allow himself to feel anything, but felt the color of life returning to him in the tensely quiet eagerness of an emotion which he would not identify. What he told himself consciously was: Be careful.\u0026nbsp; He sat down on the edge of his desk, crossed his arms, looked at Francisco, who remained standing respectfully before him, and asked with the cold hint of a smile, \"Why did you come here?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You don\u0027t want me to answer, Mr. Rearden. You wouldn\u0027t admit to me or to yourself how desperately lonely you are tonight. If you don\u0027t question me, you won\u0027t feel obliged to deny it. Just accept what you do know, anyway: that I know it.\"\u0026nbsp; Taut like a string pulled by anger against the impertinence at one end and by admiration for the frankness at the other, Rearden answered, \"I\u0027ll admit it, if you wish. What should it matter to me, that you know it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"That I know and care, Mr. Rearden. I\u0027m the only man around you who does.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why should you care? And why should I need your help tonight?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Because it\u0027s not easy to have to damn the man who meant most to you.\"\u0026nbsp; \"I wouldn\u0027t damn you if you\u0027d only stay away from me.\"\u0026nbsp; Francisco\u0027s eyes widened a little, then he grinned and said, \"I was speaking of Mr. Danagger.\"\u0026nbsp; For an instant, Rearden looked as if he wanted to slap his own face, then he laughed softly and said, \"All right. Sit down.\"\u0026nbsp; He waited to see what advantage Francisco would take of it now, but Francisco obeyed him in silence, with a smile that had an oddly boyish quality: a look of triumph and gratitude, together.\u0026nbsp; \"I don\u0027t damn Ken Danagger,\" said Rearden.\u0026nbsp; \"You don\u0027t?\" The two words seemed to fall with a singular emphasis; they were pronounced very quietly, almost cautiously, with no remnant of a smile on Francisco\u0027s face.\u0026nbsp; \"No. I don\u0027t try to prescribe how much a man should have to bear. If he broke, it\u0027s not for me to judge him.\"\u0026nbsp; \"If he broke . . . ?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Well, didn\u0027t he?\"\u0026nbsp; Francisco leaned back; his smile returned, but it was not a happy smile. \"What will his disappearance do to you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I will just have to work a little harder.\"\u0026nbsp; Francisco looked at a steel bridge traced in black strokes against red steam beyond the window, and said, pointing, \"Every one of those girders has a limit to the load it can carry. What\u0027s yours?\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden laughed. \"Is that what you\u0027re afraid of? Is that why you came here? Were you afraid I\u0027d break? Did you want to save me, as Dagny Taggart wanted to save Ken Danagger? She tried to reach him in time, but couldn\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; \"She did? I didn\u0027t know it. Miss Taggart and I disagree about many things.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not going to vanish. Let them all give up and stop working. I won\u0027t. I don\u0027t know my limit and don\u0027t care. All I have to know is that I can\u0027t be stopped.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Any man can be stopped, Mr. Rearden.\"\u0026nbsp; \"How?\"\u0026nbsp; \"It\u0027s only a matter of knowing man\u0027s motive power.\"\u0026nbsp; \"What is it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You ought to know, Mr. Rearden. You\u0027re one of the last moral men left to the world.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden chuckled in bitter amusement. \"I\u0027ve been called just about everything but that. And you\u0027re wrong. You have no idea how wrong.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Are you sure?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I ought to know. Moral? What on earth made you say it?\"\u0026nbsp; Francisco pointed to the mills beyond the window. \"This.\"\u0026nbsp; For a long moment, Rearden looked at him without moving, then asked only, \"What do you mean?\"\u0026nbsp; \"If you want to see an abstract principle, such as moral action, in material form-there it is. Look at it, Mr. Rearden. Every girder of it, every pipe, wire and valve was put there by a choice in answer to the question: right or wrong? You had to choose right and you had to choose the best within your knowledge-the best for your purpose, which was to make steel-and then move on and extend the knowledge, and do better, and still better, with your purpose as your standard of value. You had to act on your own judgment, you had to have the capacity to judge, the courage to stand on the verdict of your mind, and the purest, the most ruthless consecration to the rule of doing right, of doing the best, the utmost best possible to you. Nothing could have made you act against your judgment, and you would have rejected as wrong-as evil-any man who attempted to tell you that the best way to heat a furnace was to fill it with ice. Millions of men, an entire nation, were not able to deter you from producing Rearden Metal-because you had the knowledge of its superlative value and the power which such knowledge gives. But what I wonder about, Mr. Rearden, is why you live by one code of principles when you deal with nature and by another when you deal with men?\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden\u0027s eyes were fixed on him so intently that the question came slowly, as if the effort to pronounce it were a distraction: \"What do you mean?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why don\u0027t you hold to the purpose of your life as clearly and rigidly as you hold to the purpose of your mills?\"\u0026nbsp; \"What do you mean?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You have judged every brick within this place by its value to the goal of making steel. Have you been as strict about the goal which your work and your steel are serving? What do you wish to achieve by giving your life to the making of steel? By what standard of value do you judge your days? For instance, why did you spend ten years of exacting effort to produce Rearden Metal?\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden looked away, the slight, slumping movement of his shoulders like a sigh of release and disappointment. \"If you have to ask that, then you wouldn\u0027t understand.\"\u0026nbsp; \"If I told you that I understand it, but you don\u0027t-would you throw me out of here?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I should have thrown you out of here anyway-so go ahead, tell me what you mean.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Are you proud of the rail of the John Galt Line?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Because it\u0027s the best rail ever made.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why did you make it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"In order to make money.\"\u0026nbsp; \"There were many easier ways to make money. Why did you choose the hardest?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You said it in your speech at Taggart\u0027s wedding: in order to exchange my best effort for the best effort of others.\"\u0026nbsp; \"If that was your purpose, have you achieved it?\"\u0026nbsp; A beat of time vanished in a heavy drop of silence. \"No,\" said Rearden.\u0026nbsp; \"Have you made any money?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No.\"\u0026nbsp; \"When you strain your energy to its utmost in order to produce the best, do you expect to be rewarded for it or punished?\" Rearden did not answer. \"By every standard of decency, of honor, of justice known to you-are you convinced that you should have been rewarded for it?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes,\" said Rearden, his voice low.\u0026nbsp; \"Then if you were punished, instead-what sort of code have you accepted?\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden did not answer.\u0026nbsp; \"It is generally assumed,\" said Francisco, \"that living in a human society makes one\u0027s life much easier and safer than if one were left alone to struggle against nature on a desert island. Now wherever there is a man who needs or uses metal in any way--Rearden Metal has made his life easier for him. Has it made yours easier for you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No,\" said Rearden, his voice low.\u0026nbsp; \"Has it left your life as it was before you produced the Metal?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No-\" said Rearden, the word breaking off as if he had cut short the thought that followed.\u0026nbsp; Francisco\u0027s voice lashed at him suddenly, as a command: \"Say it!\"\u0026nbsp; \"It has made it harder,\" said Rearden tonelessly.\u0026nbsp; \"When you felt proud of the rail of the John Galt Line,\" said Francisco, the measured rhythm of his voice giving a ruthless clarity to his words, \"what sort of men did you think of? Did you want to see that Line used by your equals-by giants of productive energy, such as Ellis Wyatt, whom it would help to reach higher and still higher achievements of their own?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes,\" said Rearden eagerly.\u0026nbsp; \"Did you want to see it used by men who could not equal the power of your mind, but who would equal your moral integrity-men such as Eddie Willers-who could never invent your Metal, but who would do their best, work as hard as you did, live by their own effort, and-riding on your rail-give a moment\u0027s silent thanks to the man who gave them more than they could give him?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Yes,\" said Rearden gently.\u0026nbsp; \"Did you want to see it used by whining rotters who never rouse themselves to any effort, who do not possess the ability of a filing clerk, but demand the income of a company president, who drift from failure to failure and expect you to pay their bills, who hold their wishing as an equivalent of your work and their need as a higher claim to reward than your effort, who demand that you serve them, who demand that it be the aim of your life to serve them, who demand that your strength be the voiceless, rightless, unpaid, unrewarded slave of their impotence, who proclaim that you are born to serfdom by reason of your genius, while they are born to rule by the grace of incompetence, that yours is only to give, but theirs only to take, that yours is to produce, but theirs to consume, that you are not to be paid, neither in matter nor in spirit, neither by wealth nor by recognition nor by respect nor by gratitude-so that they would ride on your rail and sneer at you and curse you, since they owe you nothing, not even the effort of taking off their hats which you paid for? Would this be what you wanted? Would you feel proud of it?\"\u0026nbsp; \u0027I\u0027d blast that rail first,\" said Rearden, his lips white.\u0026nbsp; \u0027Then why don\u0027t you do it, Mr. Rearden? Of the three kinds of men I described-which men are being destroyed and which are using your Line today?\"\u0026nbsp; They heard the distant metal heartbeats of the mills through the long thread of silence.\u0026nbsp; \"What I described last,\" said Francisco, \"is any man who proclaims his right to a single penny of another man\u0027s effort.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden did not answer; he was looking at the reflection of a neon sign on dark windows in the distance.\u0026nbsp; \"You take pride in setting no limit to your endurance, Mr. Rearden, because you think that you are doing right. What if you aren\u0027t? What if you\u0027re placing your virtue in the service of evil and letting it become a tool for the destruction of everything you love, respect and admire? Why don\u0027t you uphold your own code of values among men as you do among iron smelters? You who won\u0027t allow one per cent of impurity into an alloy of metal-what have you allowed into your moral code?\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden sat very still; the words in his mind were like the beat of steps down the trail he had been seeking; the words were: the sanction of the victim.\u0026nbsp; \"You, who would not submit to the hardships of nature, but set out to conquer it and placed it in the service of your joy and your comfort-to what have you submitted at the hands of men? You, who know from your work that one bears punishment only for being wrong -what have you been willing to bear and for what reason? All your life, you have heard yourself denounced, not for your faults, but for your greatest virtues. You have been hated, not for your mistakes, but for your achievements. You have been scorned for all those qualities of character which are your highest pride. You have been called selfish for the courage of acting on your own judgment and bearing sole responsibility for your own life. You have been called arrogant for your independent mind. You have been called cruel for your unyielding integrity. You have been called anti-social for the vision that made you venture upon undiscovered roads. You have been called ruthless for the strength and self-discipline of your drive to your purpose. You have been called greedy for the magnificence of your power to create wealth. You, who\u0027ve expended an inconceivable flow of energy, have been called a parasite. You, who\u0027ve created abundance where there had been nothing but wastelands and helpless, starving men before you, have been called a robber. You, who\u0027ve kept them all alive, have been called an exploiter. You, the purest and most moral man among them, have been sneered at as a \u0027vulgar materialist.\u0027 Have you stopped to ask them: by what right?-by what code?-by what standard? No, you have borne it all and kept silent. You bowed to their code and you never upheld your own. You knew what exacting morality was needed to produce a single metal nail, but you let them brand you as immoral.\u0026nbsp; You knew that man needs the strictest code of values to deal with nature, but you thought that you needed no such code to deal with men. You left the deadliest weapon in the hands of your enemies, a weapon you never suspected or understood. Their moral code is their weapon. Ask yourself how deeply and in how many terrible ways you have accepted it. Ask yourself what it is that a code of moral values does to a man\u0027s life, and why he can\u0027t exist without it, and what happens to him if he accepts the wrong standard, by which the evil is the good. Shall I tell you why you\u0027re drawn to me, even though you think you ought to damn me? It\u0027s because I\u0027m the first man who has given you what the whole world owes you and what you should have demanded of all men before you dealt with them: a moral sanction.\"\u0026nbsp; Rearden whirled to him, then remained still, with a stillness like a gasp. Francisco leaned forward, as if he were reaching the landing of a dangerous flight, and his eyes were steady, but their glance seemed to tremble with intensity.\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re guilty of a great sin, Mr. Rearden, much guiltier than they tell you, but not in the way they preach. The worst guilt is to accept an undeserved guilt-and that is what you have been doing all your life.\u0026nbsp; “You have been paying blackmail, not for your vices, but for your virtues. You have been willing to carry the load of an unearned punishment-and toilet it grow the heavier the greater the virtues you practiced. But your virtues were those which keep men alive. Your own moral code-the one you lived by, but never stated, acknowledged or defended-was the code that preserves man\u0027s existence. If you were punished for it, what was the nature of those who punished you?\u0026nbsp; “Yours was the code of life. What, then, is theirs? What standard of value lies at its root? What is its ultimate purpose? Do you think that what you\u0027re facing is merely a conspiracy to seize your wealth? You, who know the source of wealth, should know it\u0027s much more and much worse than that. Did you ask me to name man\u0027s motive power? Man\u0027s motive power is his moral code. Ask yourself where their code is leading you and what it offers you as your final goal. A viler evil than to murder a man, is to sell him suicide as an act of virtue. A viler evil than to throw a man into a sacrificial furnace, is to demand that he leap in, of his own will, and that he build the furnace, besides. By their own statement, it is they who need you and have nothing to offer you in return. By their own statement, you must support them because they cannot survive without you. Consider the obscenity of offering their impotence and their need-their need of you-as a justification for your torture. Are you willing to accept it? Do you care to purchase-at the price of your great endurance, at the price of your agony-the satisfaction of the needs of your own destroyers?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No!\"\u0026nbsp; \"Mr. Rearden,\" said Francisco, his voice solemnly calm, \"if you saw Atlas, the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw that he stood, blood running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms trembling but still trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his strength, and the greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his shoulders-what would you tell him to do?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I . . . don\u0027t know. What . . . could he do? What would you tell him?\"\u0026nbsp; \"To shrug.\"\u0026nbsp; The clatter of the metal came in a flow of irregular sounds without discernible rhythm, not like the action of a mechanism, but as if some conscious impulse were behind every sudden, tearing rise that went up and crashed, scattering into the faint moan of gears. The glass of the windows tinkled once in a while.\u0026nbsp; Francisco\u0027s eyes were watching Rearden as if he were examining the course of bullets on a battered target. The course was hard to trace: the gaunt figure on the edge of the desk was erect, the cold blue eyes showed nothing but the intensity of a glance fixed upon a great distance, only the inflexible mouth betrayed a line drawn by pain.\u0026nbsp; \"Go on,\" said Rearden with effort, \"continue. You haven\u0027t finished, have you?\"\u0026nbsp; \"I have barely begun.\" Francisco\u0027s voice was hard.\u0026nbsp; \"What . . . are you driving at?\"\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027ll know it before I\u0027m through. But first, I want you to answer a question: if you understand the nature of your burden, how can you . . .\"\u0026nbsp; The scream of an alarm siren shattered the space beyond the window and shot like a rocket in a long, thin line to the sky. It held for an instant, then fell, then went on in rising, falling spirals of sound, as if fighting for breath against terror to scream louder. It was the shriek of agony, the call for help, the voice of the mills as of a wounded body crying to hold its soul.\u0026nbsp; Rearden thought that he leaped for the door the instant the scream hit his consciousness, but he saw that he was an instant late, because Francisco had preceded him. Flung by the blast of the same response as his own, Francisco was flying down the hall, pressing the button of the elevator and, not waiting, racing on down the stairs. Rearden followed him and, watching the dial of the elevator on the stair landings, they met it halfway down the height of the building. Before the steel cage had ceased\u0026nbsp; trembling at the sill of the ground floor, Francisco was out, racing to meet the sound of the call for help. Rearden had thought himself a good runner, but he could not keep up with the swift figure streaking off through stretches of red glare and darkness, the figure of a useless playboy he had hated himself for admiring.\u0026nbsp; The stream, gushing from a hole low on the side of a blast furnace, did not have the red glow of fire, but the white radiance of sunlight. It poured along the ground, branching off at random in sudden streaks; it cut through a dank fog of steam with a bright suggestion of morning. It was liquid iron, and what the scream of the alarm proclaimed was a break-out.\u0026nbsp; The charge of the furnace had been hung up and, breaking, had blown the tap-hole open. The furnace foreman lay knocked unconscious, the white flow spurted, slowly tearing the hole wider, and men were struggling with sand, hose and fire clay to stop the glowing streaks that spread in a heavy, gliding motion, eating everything on their way into jets of acrid smoke.\u0026nbsp; In the few moments which Rearden needed to grasp the sight and nature of the disaster, he saw a man\u0027s figure rising suddenly at the foot of the furnace, a figure outlined by the red glare almost as if it stood in the path of the torrent, he saw the swing of a white shirt sleeved arm that rose and flung a black object into the source of the spurting metal. It was Francisco d\u0027Anconia, and his action belonged to an art which Rearden had not believed any man to be trained to perform any longer.\u0026nbsp; Years before, Rearden had worked in an obscure steel plant in Minnesota, where it had been his job, after a blast furnace was tapped, to close the hole by hand-by throwing bullets of fire clay to dam the flow of the metal. It was a dangerous job that had taken many lives; it had been abolished years earlier by the invention of the hydraulic gun; but there had been struggling, failing mills which, on their way down, had attempted to use the outworn equipment and methods of a distant past. Rearden had done the job; but in the years since, he had met no other man able to do it. In the midst of shooting jets of live steam, in the face of a crumbling blast furnace, he was now seeing the tall, slim figure of the playboy performing the task with the skill of an expert.\u0026nbsp; It took an instant for Rearden to tear off his coat, seize a pair of goggles from the first man in sight and join Francisco at the mouth of the furnace. There was no time to speak, to feel or to wonder. Francisco glanced at him once-and what Rearden saw was a smudged face, black goggles and a wide grin.\u0026nbsp; They stood on a slippery bank of baked mud, at the edge of the white stream, with the raging hole under their feet, flinging clay into the glare where the twisting tongues that looked like gas were boiling metal. Rearden\u0027s consciousness became a progression of bending, raising the weight, aiming and sending it down and, before it had reached its unseen destination, bending for the next one again, a consciousness drawn tight upon watching the aim of his arm, to save the furnace, and the precarious posture of his feet, to save himself. He was aware of nothing else-except that the sum of it was the exultant feeling of action, of his own capacity, of his body\u0027s precision, of its response to his will. And with no time to know it, but knowing it, seizing it with his senses past the censorship of his mind, he was seeing a black silhouette with red rays shooting from behind its shoulders, its elbows, its angular curves, the red rays circling through steam like the long needles of spotlights, following the movements of a swift, expert, confident being whom he had never seen before except in evening clothes under the lights of ballrooms.\u0026nbsp; There was no time to form words, to think, to explain, but he knew that this was the real Francisco d\u0027Anconia, this was what he had seen from the first and loved-the word did not shock him, because there was no word in his mind, there was only a joyous feeling that seemed like a flow of energy added to his own.\u0026nbsp; To the rhythm of his body, with the scorching heat on his face and the winter night on his shoulder blades, he was seeing suddenly that this was the simple essence of his universe: the instantaneous\u0026nbsp; refusal to submit to disaster, the irresistible drive to fight it, the triumphant feeling of his own ability to win. He was certain that Francisco felt it, too, that he had been moved by the same impulse, that it was right to feel it, right for both of them to be what they were-he caught glimpses of a sweat-streaked face intent upon action, and it was the most joyous face he had ever seen.\u0026nbsp; The furnace stood above them, a black bulk wrapped in coils of tubes and steam; she seemed to pant, shooting red gasps that hung on the air above the mills-and they fought not to let her bleed to death.\u0026nbsp; Sparks hung about their feet and burst in sudden sheafs out of the metal, dying unnoticed against their clothes, against the skin of their hands. The stream was coming slower, in broken spurts through the dam rising beyond their sight.\u0026nbsp; It happened so fast that Rearden knew it fully only after it was over.\u0026nbsp; He knew that there were two moments: the first was when he saw the violent swing of Francisco\u0027s body in a forward thrust that sent the bullet to continue the line in space, then he saw the sudden, unrhythmic jerk backward that did not succeed, the convulsive beating against a forward pull, the extended arms of the silhouette losing its balance, he thought that a leap across the distance between them on the slippery, crumbling ridge would mean the death of both of them-and the second moment was when he landed at Francisco\u0027s side, held him in his arms, hung swaying together between space and ridge, over the white pit, then gained his footing and pulled him back, and, for an instant, still held the length of Francisco\u0027s body against the length of his own, as he would have held the body of an only son. His love, his terror, his relief were in a single sentence: \"Be careful, you goddamn fool!\"\u0026nbsp; Francisco reached for a chunk of clay and went on.\u0026nbsp; When the job was done and the gap was closed, Rearden noticed that there was a twisting pain in the muscles of his arms and legs, that his body had no strength left to move-yet that he felt as if he were entering his office in the morning, eager for ten new problems to solve.\u0026nbsp; He looked at Francisco and noticed for the first time that their clothes had blade-ringed holes, that their hands were bleeding, that there was a patch of skin torn on Francisco\u0027s temple and a red thread winding down his cheekbone. Francisco pushed the goggles back off his eyes and grinned at him: it was a smile of morning.\u0026nbsp; A young man with a look of chronic hurt and impertinence together, rushed up to him, crying, \"I couldn\u0027t help it, Mr. Rearden!\" and launched into a speech of explanation. Rearden turned his back on him without a word. It was the assistant in charge of the pressure gauge of the furnace, a young man out of college.\u0026nbsp; Somewhere on the outer edge of Rearden\u0027s consciousness, there was the thought that accidents of this nature were happening more frequently now, caused by the kind of ore he was using, but he had to use whatever ore he could find. There was the thought that his old workers had always been able to avert disaster; any of them would have seen the indications of a hang-up and known how to prevent it; but there were not many of them left, and he had to employ whatever men he could find. Through the swirling coils of steam around him, he observed that it was the older men who had rushed from all over the mills to fight the break-out and now stood in line, being given first aid by the medical staff. He wondered what was happening to the young men of the country. But the wonder was swallowed by the sight of the college boy\u0027s face, which he could not bear to see, by a wave of contempt, by the wordless thought that if this was the enemy, there was nothing to fear. All these things came to him and vanished in the outer darkness; the sight blotting them out was Francisco d\u0027Anconia, He saw Francisco giving orders to the men around him. They did not know who he was or where he came from, but they listened: they knew he was a man who knew his job. Francisco broke off in the middle of a sentence, seeing Rearden approach and listen, and said, laughing, \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" Rearden said, \"Go right ahead. It\u0027s all correct, so far.\"\u0026nbsp; They said nothing to each other when they walked together through the darkness, on their way back to the office. Rearden felt an exultant laughter swelling within him, he felt that he wanted, in his turn, to wink at Francisco like a fellow conspirator who had learned a secret Francisco would not acknowledge. He glanced at his face once in a while, but Francisco would not look at him.\u0026nbsp; After a while, Francisco said, \"You saved my life.\" The ‘thank you’ was in the way he said it.\u0026nbsp; Rearden chuckled. \"You saved my furnace.\"\u0026nbsp; They went on in silence. Rearden felt himself growing lighter with every step. Raising his face to the cold air, he saw the peaceful darkness bf the sky and a single star above a smokestack with the vertical lettering: Rearden Steel. He felt how glad he was to be alive.\u0026nbsp; He did not expect the change he saw in Francisco\u0027s face when he looked at it in the light of his office. The things he had seen by the glare of the furnace were gone. He had expected a look of triumph, of mockery at all the insults Francisco had heard from him, a look demanding the apology he was joyously eager to offer. Instead, he saw a face made lifeless by an odd dejection.\u0026nbsp; \"Are you hurt?\"\u0026nbsp; \"No . . . no, not at all.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Come here,\" ordered Rearden, opening the door of his bathroom.\u0026nbsp; . \"Look at yourself.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Never mind. You come here.\"\u0026nbsp; For the first time, Rearden felt that he was the older man; he felt the pleasure of taking Francisco in charge; he felt a confident, amused, paternal protectiveness. He washed the grime off Francisco\u0027s face, he put disinfectants and adhesive bandages on his temple, his hands, his scorched elbows. Francisco obeyed him in silence.\u0026nbsp; Rearden asked, in the tone of the most eloquent salute he could offer, \"Where did you learn to work like that?\"\u0026nbsp; Francisco shrugged. \"I was brought up around smelters of every kind,\" he answered indifferently.\u0026nbsp; Rearden could not decipher the expression of his face: it was only a look of peculiar stillness, as if his eyes were fixed on some secret vision of his own that drew his mouth into a line of desolate, bitter, hurting self-mockery.\u0026nbsp; They did not speak until they were back in the office.\u0026nbsp; \"You know,\" said Rearden, \"everything you said here was true. But that was only part of the story. The other part is what we\u0027ve done tonight. Don\u0027t you see? We\u0027re able to act. They\u0027re not. So it\u0027s we who\u0027ll win in the long run, no matter what they do to us.\"\u0026nbsp; Francisco did not answer, \"Listen,\" said Rearden, \"I know what\u0027s been the trouble with you. You\u0027ve never cared to do a real day\u0027s work in your life. I thought you were conceited enough, but I see that you have no idea of what you\u0027ve got in you. Forget that fortune of yours for a while and come to work for me. I\u0027ll start you as furnace foreman any time. You don\u0027t know what it will do for you. In a few years, you\u0027ll be ready to appreciate and to run d\u0027Anconia Copper.\"\u0026nbsp; He expected a burst of laughter and he was prepared to argue; instead, he saw Francisco shaking his head slowly, as if he could not trust his voice, as if he feared that were he to speak, he would accept.\u0026nbsp; In a moment, he said, \"Mr. Rearden . . . I think I would give the rest of my life for one year as your furnace foreman. But I can\u0027t.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Why not?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Don\u0027t ask me. It\u0027s . . . a personal matter.\"\u0026nbsp; The vision of Francisco in Rearden\u0027s mind, which he had resented and found irresistibly attractive, had been the figure of a man radiantly incapable of suffering. What he saw now in Francisco\u0027s eyes was the look of a quiet, tightly controlled, patiently borne torture.\u0026nbsp; Francisco reached silently for his overcoat.\u0026nbsp; \"You\u0027re not leaving, are you?\" asked Rearden, \"Yes.\"\u0026nbsp; \"Aren\u0027t you going to finish what you had to tell me?\"\u0026nbsp; \"Not tonight.\"\u0026nbsp; \"You wanted me to answer a question. What was it?\"\u0026nbsp; Francisco shook his head.\u0026nbsp; \"You started asking me how can I . . . How can I-what?\"\u0026nbsp; Francisco\u0027s smile was like a moan of pain, the only moan he would permit himself. \"I won\u0027t ask it, Mr. Rearden. I know it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1551/46034.html","bookId":1296,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:40:52 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:40:52 AM"}
