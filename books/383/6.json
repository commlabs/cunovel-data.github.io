DICK RECEIVES TWO VALUABLE PRESENTS.","content":"\u0026nbsp;At the end of the last chapter we left Dick standing on the steps of Mr. Rockwell\u0027s residence in Madison Avenue. He had rung the bell and was waiting to have his summons answered. To say that Dick expected to enjoy his visit would not be strictly true.
