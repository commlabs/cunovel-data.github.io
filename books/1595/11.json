Instead he gave him what he wanted and began to set up steady strokes, each angled so that it brushed over the place inside him that gave him so much pleasure. He was so tight that Taz was still afraid he’d hurt him, but his lover was making little whimpering sounds and his cock, when Taz wrapped his hand around it, thrust up strongly into his grasp, hard and rigid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaz undulated his body over his nobyo’s, pushing in and going deeper to make this bonding strong and solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re mine, Nobyo. Say it. Tell me no one else will ever have this body.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lycan thrashed his head on the pillows and gave him a needy little sound, but he was stubborn. Taz pulled all the way out—just the tip of his cock poised at his entrance and heard his nobyo gasp. He thrust his hips upward for more, but Taz held himself up out of his reach. “Say it, Lycan. Say you belong to me. Only me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at Taz resentfully and finally seemed to sag—his whole body going limp. “I-I’m yours. Yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say you belong to me. Say it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I belong to you! Only you.” He shouted the words almost angrily, his whole body blushing a delightful pink color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaz smiled down at him. “Yes, darling. That’s right. And I’ll never let you go—never let you leave me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thrust back down into him and pushed in hard, pounding against him. The muscles wrapped around Taz’s prick were squeezing him tightly. Taz moved his hand harder and faster, catching the same rhythm. It was then he felt his boy’s body clench and tighten. He cried out Taz’s name and came hard, the white spunk hitting his own stomach. Taz squeezed him harder, milking him for every drop. He managed a few more thrusts before he was coming too. He arched his back as his cum shot into his nobyo, injecting him and filling him up with the semen that would ensure their bonding. His nobyo felt it because he opened his eyes wide and cried out, not in pain but in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis boy had been claimed—well and truly claimed and the wolf had been tamed, made to lie down and roll over on his back while the tiger spunk left its mark inside his nobyo’s body. “Mine,” Taz exulted as he kept pounding into him, long after the Lycan wolf had given up and fled, leaving only his sweet nobyo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle was about to go out of his mind with boredom. After several days with him, Taz had left to go back to work, leaving Kyle with too much time on his hands. He’d tried reading, exercising, even lying on the bed staring up at the ceiling, and he was still slowly but surely going out of his mind. Taz seemed to want to keep him as much in the dark as he possibly could about what he did for the Tygerian government, but Kyle had gleaned enough information to know that he was a pretty big deal. That morning a special transport had arrived to take him to wherever he was going, and as Kyle watched out the window, the driver had seemed very deferential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe transport had some kind of official Tygerian symbol on the side as well. Taz had been wearing a pair of dark trousers and a longish red coat, buttoned all the way up and reaching almost to his knees. The material looked rich and expensive, and Kyle thought he looked really handsome, his face solemn and businesslike. To look at him, you’d never know he kept Kyle up half the night fucking him in positions Kyle hadn’t previously thought possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to watch out the window, Kyle had to first pull a chair over and climb up on it, because the windows in this house at least were some ten feet high on the walls and seemed to be designed to let in light, but not expose any views. As a result, the rooms seemed claustrophobic to Kyle and little better than a luxurious prison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Taz left that morning, Kyle had mostly rested and tried to regain his strength. The drugs were mostly out of his system by now, but they’d taken their toll, leaving him feeling drained and weak. The first few days, when Taz hadn’t been making love to him, Kyle had done little else besides eat and sleep. There was no doubt in Kyle’s mind that the bonding Taz spoke of had taken place, because he never wanted Taz to be away from him. The bond was already intense, even before they made love, but now it seemed overpowering and simply took his breath away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis morning, however, with his strength almost back to normal, and Taz leaving to go back to work, Kyle needed something to do or he’d soon be climbing the walls. He was even feeling some separation anxiety, which he firmly told himself was ridiculous. He refused to succumb to this thing—he’d fight to keep his own identity and not lose himself to this bonding. His own mating urge was strong enough. Coupled with this Tygerian’s so-called bonding, it would be enough to overpower him if he wasn’t careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePacing up and down like a trapped animal, he remembered what Taz had told him only the night before. “Your situation has changed, Nobyo, and you must learn to accept that fact. If you can, you can find peace and happiness here with me and my children, but if you can’t, if you continue to fight this, it will eventually destroy everything we have between us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want that, Taz. You’re my mate, but I’m also a Lycan. I can’t accept your domination. In my world, this wouldn’t happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaz stared steadily back at him. “You’re no longer in your world, Nobyo. Whether or not you like to admit it, I am your master. I’ll never give you up. And I’ve told you before to call me Taz-lan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle glared at him. He refused to even try to understand how Kyle felt. “What’s that about anyway? Is it part of your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. The suffix means ‘master’ in my language. It is the proper way a nobyo addresses his owner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle had snorted and pulled away. “My owner? Fuck that, Taz. No one owns me! I’m here because your brother kidnapped me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a prisoner of war. He captured you. And my brother tells me you came to kidnap him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To arrest him! It’s not the same thing at all!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arrest him? Oh whose authority? The Alliance? We’re at war with the Alliance, Nobyo, as you well know, and we care little about what they think. What crimes did they say he had committed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tarr Bonnet traffics in love slaves—he works with the Jolly Rogers and they’re a bunch of thugs. Surely you know what Tarr does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. But doesn’t your home planet also have love slaves? Along with other planets in the Alliance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle stood up and started pacing back and forth. “It just is! Our love slaves put themselves up for sale. They have contracts, and they get paid a lot of money. No one is forcing them!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaz nodded. “So do ours—except for captives of planets with which we’re at war.” He gave Kyle a long look. “Like you, Nobyo. Do you feel as if you’re being forced to submit to me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I do!” At Taz’s steady look, he backed off a little. “Okay, so you’re not exactly forcing me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you hate this so much and feel that you’re being taken advantage of, then I’ll let you go. I’ll find a way to send you home—perhaps a prisoner exchange.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Kyle shouted. “That’s not what I want. Not unless you come with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know that’s impossible. I have a child about to be born. My life is here on Tygeria, and I can’t leave it. I want you here with me, but we’re at war with the Alliance. It’s an ancient war and our scars are deep. The only role for you in my life—the only future we have—is for you to remain here as my nobyo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I’m basically spoils of war? Just a prisoner?” He stopped pacing and glared at Taz. “If I’m only a prisoner of war, why am I not in one of your prison camps? Why did you come for me in the first place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaz sighed and shook his head. “You know the answer to this, Nobyo. Why do you persist in being so stubborn? My brother thought I would like you. I did. I wanted you from the first moment I saw you. If I hadn’t taken you, then yes, you would now be in a prison camp. Do you want me to put you aside? Let you go home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, of course not. I told you that you’re my mate. Once I saw you—touched you—I can no longer be without you. My family has a biological imperative to be with their mates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why are we always discussing this?” Taz snapped. “Damn it! Even if you asked to leave me, I don’t know if I could really let you go!” He stood up and crossed the room to catch Kyle up in his arms and drag him over to the bed to make love to him. Most of their arguments ended the same way, actually, with Taz exerting his dominance over Kyle and trying to prove to him that he was in charge. Taz actually believed that he had vanquished Kyle’s Lycan wolf in some way, deep inside him. Actually, nothing could have been further from the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKyle’s wolf was still there, still very aware of what was happening. He was willing to submit to his mate, though not necessarily pleased about it. Still, in some ways he responded to Taz’s extreme dominance. Did his wolf recognize a true alpha in Taz and wish to submit? It was the only possible explanation for why he mostly wanted to obey his mate, and why he responded with so much excitement to their lovemaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he still badly needed to complete the mating by biting and claiming him as well, his wolf had been pacified by the almost constant lovemaking they’d been engaged in, and that was unusual for a true alpha. His cousin Lucas or Blayde would have gone insane by now. Perhaps he really was a beta, and thus, while he sometimes balked at his mate’s domineering behavior, he mostly responded to his orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaz had been careful so far never to allow Kyle to top him or be anywhere close enough to the back of his neck to bite him when they made love, but Kyle knew it was only a matter of time until he let down his guard. Until then, he was enjoying his mate and playing a kind of waiting game. The most he could hope for with the extremely dominant Tygerian would be a kind of partnership of equals. Kyle even thought he could allow him to be in charge, to a certain extent, but in order to accomplish either of those things, he had a lot more work to do. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/captive-wolf-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-5/page-11.html","bookId":1595,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:10 PM"}
