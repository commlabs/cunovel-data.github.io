{"id":30825,"no":21,"title":"Chapter XXI. My Cousin Oliver","content":"\u0026nbsp;I slept towards morning, and did not wake until the sun was rising; the light came golden-green through the stained windows. \u0026nbsp;I rose from my bed, and, opening the casement, looked out over sunlit woods; afar, through the break in the trees, I could make out the glittering waters of the sea. \u0026nbsp;In the decaying garden I saw the colours of many flowers among weeds; a hawthorn by an overgrown walk was a silver fount of blossom. \u0026nbsp;The gloom of the garden and the wood had passed with the darkness and the sea wind; only the pines and firs were sombre yet and sighing in the breeze. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I was still in my shirt when a rapping sounded on my door. \u0026nbsp;I hastened silently to pull away the chair, asking, “Who’s there?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My cousin Oliver answered gruffly, “It’s I, cousin,” and I let him in. \u0026nbsp;He was in shabby riding-rig, his black hair tumbled over his nose; he stood awkwardly in the doorway. \u0026nbsp;With the flush of drink off him he seemed not so ill a fellow, though his look was lowering and sullen, and he p. 170possessed none of his father’s elegance, but only a hard strength such as must have been my grandfather’s in his youth. \u0026nbsp;“Get into your breeches, cousin,” he muttered, “and ride with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, I’ll be happy,” said I.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We’ll ride down to the sea and swim in it, if you’ve a mind for it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ve a mind for it, yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Dress then. \u0026nbsp;I’ll wait for you,” and moved over to the window-seat and lounged there, till I had pulled on my clothes. \u0026nbsp;He sat sullenly regarding me; I could not estimate his disposition to me, believing that his father had instructed him to treat me with civility; from time to time I stole a glance at him reflected dully in the mirror, noting the health and strength of him, and could not find it in me to hate the fellow as with cause I hated his father. \u0026nbsp;Dressed at last, a towel about my neck, I said, “At your service, cousin,” and he, lurching up from his seat, strode before me down the gallery, and brought me by a dark stair out of the house into the courtyard. \u0026nbsp;I had a certain hesitation in accompanying him—with my escape from being shipped overseas with Blunt on the Black Wasp fresh in my mind; but reassured that I was safe now through my grandfather’s direction, I set my dread aside.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n p. 171He had anticipated my hesitation, it seemed, for he swung round, and demanded curtly, “Are you afraid to go with me, cousin?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I’m not afraid,” I answered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He cast a look about him, shot out his hand and gripped my sleeve. \u0026nbsp;He said, in that harsh tone of his, “You’ve no need to be, whatever others may do. \u0026nbsp;D’ye understand me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’m happy to understand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You saw me swilling last night.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ay, I saw.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said simply, “Wouldn’t the house and the folk in it drive a man to the devil?”—and turned abruptly and crossed the courtyard with me at his heels.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The courtyard was deserted. \u0026nbsp;Neglect and decay marked it; the moss grew green in crevices and cracks of the paving stones; the ivy held the out-buildings as it held the house. \u0026nbsp;The great stables were bare but for three horses in the stalls; a fellow ill of look, of middle-age, but seeming young by comparison with the old men about my grandfather, was plying a broom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Saddle the mare for Mr. Craike, Nick,” Oliver ordered. \u0026nbsp;“I’ll get my horse out.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nick responding, “Ay, ay, sir,” set down his broom, and stared at me. \u0026nbsp;A seaman surely, he was as brown as the old rogues; the silver rings p. 172in his ears, and the tattoo-marks on his bare arms, accorded ill with his shabby rig of a groom.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I waited by the stable-door until Nick brought out the mare; Oliver followed, leading a powerful black horse; and making down to the gates, he leaped to saddle. \u0026nbsp;I, rejoicing at the prospect of a better mount than ever it had been my lot to ride, disdained Nick’s assistance into saddle, and rode out after Oliver. \u0026nbsp;I had already a hope of friendship with this strong, uncouth, young kinsman of mine. \u0026nbsp;I thought to find him in his disposition no more a pattern of my uncle than he resembled the gentleman in his fashion and graces. \u0026nbsp;Yet I feared to confide in any of the folk of the house, and I resolved to keep my own counsel until I knew more of my cousin. \u0026nbsp;Indeed, he gave me no opportunity for conversation. \u0026nbsp;He made off at a gallop down the drive; and I had much ado to keep within sight of him. \u0026nbsp;He did not ride for the gates, but swerving off to the left, he rode down through the park to the wall, where it was crumbling and broken. \u0026nbsp;Setting his horse to the breach, he leaped it; and I following, he led me at a gallop down towards the sea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The joy of the morn dispelled for a time my thoughts of the gloomy house and its folk. \u0026nbsp;The sun was now clear; the breeze blew sweetly from the sea; little white clouds sailed over a blue p. 173heaven. \u0026nbsp;We came out of the wood into open country; we swept through green meadows and drained lands; he rode like the very devil, taking hedge and ditch; he did not pause till we were riding out through a break in the cliffs. \u0026nbsp;The shingly beach of a little cove was before us; the waters rolling in and the foam scudding. \u0026nbsp;I saw the white gulls wheel and dip; fishing boats were out at sea; no dwelling was in sight; the beach was all our own. \u0026nbsp;Oliver, dismounting, secured his bridle to a stunted tree, and silently walked down with me over the rocks to the beach; drawing apart from me to strip. \u0026nbsp;I had no proper realisation of his strength till I saw him racing out into the sea—it seemed to me to break with a dangerous wash upon the beach; he splashed out with the sunlight white upon him, and the waters foaming against him; he swam far out then and rode back with the breakers. \u0026nbsp;I, being accustomed only to inland waters, was nigh drowned, when I attempted to follow him; I was no more his match as swimmer than as horseman. \u0026nbsp;I was dressed, and glowing with warmth and health, ere he desisted and pulled on his clothes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Faith, cousin,” said I, “I would I had your strength and courage. \u0026nbsp;Had I dared swim out as you, I’d have drowned for sure.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n p. 174He nodded, not ill-pleased, and said, grinning, “I should have wagered you you’d not dare. \u0026nbsp;If you’d have drowned—” but broke off and turned from me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You mean, if I’d have drowned,” said I, “it would have been all to the advantage of other folk?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What does it matter what I meant? \u0026nbsp;Hark’ee, cousin, while you’re in the house, whatever’s done to get you out of it, I’m not for profiting by it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You mean you’re my friend.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I didn’t say so,” he answered heavily. \u0026nbsp;“I’m saying that I’m not for profiting at your cost—d’ye understand me?” \u0026nbsp;He did not face me, but stood staring seawards. \u0026nbsp;I said nothing, but waited. \u0026nbsp;He burst out presently, “You’ve a notion by now how old Edward came by his money. \u0026nbsp;If he have money? \u0026nbsp;If all this talk among the rogues about him be more than the chattering of old fools? \u0026nbsp;They talk of a secret store he keeps by him at the house. \u0026nbsp;They talk, when they fancy none’s listening to ’em, of gold and jewels. \u0026nbsp;They vow he’s hid his store in the house, and none knows where save himself. \u0026nbsp;From their talk ’twas evilly come by. \u0026nbsp;There’s blood upon it—every coin and gew-gaw; there’s a curse upon it; they say no man’ll ever profit p. 175by it; and every rogue among them itches to set his claws upon it, curse or no curse.” \u0026nbsp;He laughed and waved his hand seawards. \u0026nbsp;“We’re an ill race, we Craikes,” he muttered. \u0026nbsp;“We’ve been of the sea and the coasts year in, year out. \u0026nbsp;The sea calls every man of us down to it—you and I’ll be sailing yet, cousin; the sea calls us and the sea has us in the end. \u0026nbsp;Did you hear the beat of the sea like drums through the night, cousin? \u0026nbsp;Did you hear the wind crying?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ay, as if the spirits of the dead were in it. \u0026nbsp;Ay, and I feared.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said slowly, “I’ve heard it, many a night about the old house. \u0026nbsp;I’ve heard the voices growing louder. \u0026nbsp;D’ye think old Edward lies awake, and listens and fears? \u0026nbsp;He’s near to death. \u0026nbsp;He’s turned eighty years. \u0026nbsp;And all the old rogues about him know him breaking and cease to fear him. \u0026nbsp;He was their captain once by the strength and the will of him. \u0026nbsp;He would have died at their hands but for his strength and will, and never have brought his ship and his treasure home. \u0026nbsp;He’s breaking. \u0026nbsp;What’s to be the end, cousin?”—he laughed savagely to himself. \u0026nbsp;“D’ye think me mad, John Craike?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, having passed a night in the house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We’re like to see the end, you and I and my p. 176father,—he has wit enough to win. \u0026nbsp;But that fellow Blunt.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A damned rogue!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Blunt and his men of the Black Wasp, Thrale and old Mistress Barwise, will see to it yet there’s wild doings at the house. \u0026nbsp;She’s housekeeper, to be sure. \u0026nbsp;Blunt was ship’s boy with old Edward. \u0026nbsp;They think a treasure’s hid in the house. \u0026nbsp;What d’ye think of it all?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Think! \u0026nbsp;That I’d have you for my friend, cousin?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You’re like to be the heir of all this,” he said, laughing. \u0026nbsp;“Why should I be your friend?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Being what I think you,” I told him;
