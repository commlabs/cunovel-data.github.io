I must.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And what of your new god?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If you would destroy me, do it now, Ghost.’ With that she turned and began walking towards the Refugium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge stood, shifted the cusser to his right hand, and gauged distance. The Crippled God would welcome more allies, wouldn’t he just? You go, Emroth, to meet this timeless kin. With your words marshalled to sway them, to offer them a new faith. Your kin. Could be thousands of them. Tens of thousands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they’re not what you came for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike me, Emroth, you’re heading for the gate. Starvald Demelain. Where anything is possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncluding the destruction of the warrens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s the blood, you see. The blood of dragons. Outside and inside. Dead and living. Aye, amazing the things you figure out. once you’re dead. But not dead. Aye, it’s all about the will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cusser returned to his left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArm angled back. Then swung forward. He watched the cusser’s arc for the briefest of moments, then, as habit demanded, he pitched sideways, onto the ground-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as it lurched up to meet him, a stone cracking hard against his chin. The concussion had of course deafened him, and he stared about, spitting blood from his tooth-sliced tongue. His left arm was gone, as was most of his left hip and thigh. Snow and dust drifting down, sparkling in the sunlight. Pebbles and clods of frozen earth now landing all around him, bouncing, skittering. The snow in the air, sparkling like magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spat more blood, felt his chin with his one remaining hand and found a deep gash there, studded with gravel. He scowled, dismissed these absurd details. No more blood, a tongue whole and ever eager to wag. Smooth chin, unmarred by any gash-well, more or less smooth, under all that stubble. New left leg, hip, arm. Aye, that’s better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sapper climbed to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crater was appropriately large, suitably deep, reaching down past the skin of ice and snow to the ground underneath, that now steamed sodden and glistening. Pieces of Emroth here and there. Not many. Cussers were like that, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye,’ Hedge muttered, ‘Fid’s the sentimental one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty, then thirty-five paces on, reaching the first sward of riotous grass, the sapper came upon one more fragment of Emroth’s body. And he halted. Stared down for some time. Then slowly turned and studied the way he had come, the borderline between ice and earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarl ved ten ara. Refugium indeed. ‘Shit,’ he muttered. Worse yet, she’d told him. A place without the Ritual itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment, Hedge turned back to the forest ahead. He stepped over the torn, severed left leg lying bleeding in the grass. Flesh and blood, aye. A woman’s leg. Damned shapely at that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Shit,’ he said again, hurrying on. ‘Fid’s the soft-hearted one, that he is. Fiddler. Not me. Not me.’ Wiping at his cheeks, cursing the ghost tears on his ghost face, and alone once more in this insipid, uninspiring realm of the dead, the Bridgeburner went on. Undead for a few hundred thousand years. Broken, Fallen, then resurrected, enough to walk once more. And, finally, thirty or so paces from a return to life…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grim lesson about keeping the wrong company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeking the forest. Beneath the thick branches at last, the heavy fluttering of a new season’s painfully green leaves. Spin and whirl of insects, the chitter of birds. Into the forest, aye, beyond the sight of that severed limb, the borderland, the steaming crater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Damned soft of you, Fid. But we’re at war, like I keep telling you. We’re at war. And I don’t care if it’s a damned Jaghut Bridge of Death, it’s still a bridge, and you know what we do to bridges, don’t you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRefugium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no refuge for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emlava kittens were heavy as cattle dogs but shorter of leg and nowhere near as energetic. All they wanted to do was sleep. And feed. For the first few days, carrying them invited deadly fits of lashing talons and terrifying lunges with jaws opened wide. Unmindful of macabre irony, Onrack used their mother’s skinned hide to fashion a sack. Ends affixed to a cut sapling, the Imass and either Quick Ben or Trull would then carry between them the two hissing, thrashing creatures in their ghastly bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ay never came close again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA male and a female, their grey fur not yet banded and the pale hue of ashes rather than the dark iron of their mother. In the cave there had been a third one, dead a week or more. From the condition of its body, its siblings had decided on eliminating it. So fared the weak in this and every other world. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-285.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
