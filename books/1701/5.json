We chanted the anthem. He made a lovely good-bye speech. And several of us made little speeches wishing him well. I didn\u0027t, though. I\u0027ve never been fond of public speaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was thrilled. You should have seen the look on his face when they let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas slowed the strokes of his hand on her back thoughtfully. \"Larissa,\" he asked, \"what happens when they make the actual release? Where exactly did Roberto go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her bare wet shoulders in a small shrug. \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think anybody does, except the committee. He just bowed to all of us and then walked, like they all do, through the special door in the Releasing Room. But you should have seen his look. Pure happiness, I\u0027d call it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas grinned. \"I wish I\u0027d been there to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarissa frowned. \"I don\u0027t know why they don\u0027t let children come. Not enough room, I guess. They should enlarge the Releasing Room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll have to suggest that to the committee. Maybe they\u0027d study it,\" Jonas said slyly, and Larissa chortled with laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right!\" she hooted, and Jonas helped her from the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsually, at the morning ritual when the family members told their dreams, Jonas didn\u0027t contribute much. He rarely dreamed. Sometimes he awoke with a feeling of fragments afloat in his sleep, but he couldn\u0027t seem to grasp them and put them together into something worthy of telling at the ritual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this morning was different. He had dreamed very vividly the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind wandered while Lily, as usual, recounted a lengthy dream, this one a frightening one in which she had, against the rules, been riding her mother\u0027s bicycle and been caught by the Security Guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all listened carefully and discussed with Lily the warning that the dream had given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your dream, Lily.\" Jonas said the standard phrase automatically, and tried to pay better attention while his mother told of a dream fragment, a disquieting scene where she had been chastised for a rule infraction she didn\u0027t understand. Together they agreed that it probably resulted from her feelings when she had reluctantly dealt punishment to the citizen who had broken the major rules a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather said that he had had no dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabe?\" Father asked, looking down at the basket where the newchild lay gurgling after his feeding, ready to be taken back to the Nurturing Center for the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all laughed. Dream-telling began with Threes. If newchildren dreamed, no one knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas?\" Mother asked. They always asked, though they knew how rarely Jonas had a dream to tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did dream last night,\" Jonas told them. He shifted in his chair, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Father said. \"Tell us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The details aren\u0027t clear, really,\" Jonas explained, trying to recreate the odd dream in his mind. \"I think I was in the bathing room at the House of the Old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where you were yesterday,\" Father pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas nodded. \"But it wasn\u0027t really the same. There was a tub, in the dream. But only one. And the real bathing room has rows and rows of them. But the room in the dream was warm and damp. And I had taken off my tunic, but hadn\u0027t put on the smock, so my chest was bare. I was perspiring, because it was so warm. And Fiona was there, the way she was yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asher, too?\" Mother asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas shook his head. \"No. It was only me and Fiona, alone in the room, standing beside the tub. She was laughing. But I wasn\u0027t. I was almost a little angry at her, in the dream, because she wasn\u0027t taking me seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously about what?\" Lily asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas looked at his plate. For some reason that he didn\u0027t understand, he felt slightly embarrassed. \"I think I was trying to convince her that she should get into the tub of water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused. He knew he had to tell it all, that it was not only all right but necessary to tell all of a dream. So he forced himself to relate the part that made him uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted her to take off her clothes and get into the tub,\" he explained quickly. \"I wanted to bathe her. I had the sponge in my hand. But she wouldn\u0027t. She kept laughing and saying no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at his parents. \"That\u0027s all,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you describe the strongest feeling in your dream, son?\" Father asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas thought about it. The details were murky and vague. But the feelings were clear, and flooded him again now as he thought. \"The wanting,\" he said. \"I knew that she wouldn\u0027t. And I think I knew that she shouldn\u0027t. But I wanted it so terribly. I could feel the wanting all through me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your dream, Jonas,\" Mother said after a moment. She glanced at Father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lily,\" Father said, \"it\u0027s time to leave for school. Would you walk beside me this morning and keep an eye on the newchild\u0027s basket? We want to be certain he doesn\u0027t wiggle himself loose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas began to rise to collect his schoolbooks. He thought it surprising that they hadn\u0027t talked about his dream at length before the thank you. Perhaps they found it as confusing as he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, Jonas,\" Mother said gently. \"I\u0027ll write an apology to your instructor so that you won\u0027t have to speak one for being late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sank back down into his chair, puzzled. He waved to Father and Lily as they left the dwelling, carrying Gabe in his basket. He watched while Mother tidied the remains of the morning meal and placed the tray by the front door for the Collection Crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally she sat down beside him at the table. \"Jonas,\" she said with a smile, \"the feeling you described as the wanting? It was your first Stirrings. Father and I have been expecting it to happen to you. It happens to everyone. It happened to Father when he was your age. And it happened to me. It will happen someday to Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And very often,\" Mother added, \"it begins with a dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStirrings. He had heard the word before. He remembered that there was a reference to the Stirrings in the Book of Rules, though he didn\u0027t remember what it said. And now and then the Speaker mentioned it. ATTENTION. A REMINDER THAT STIRRINGS MUST BE REPORTED IN ORDER FOR TREATMENT TO TAKE PLACE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had always ignored that announcement because he didn\u0027t understand it and it had never seemed to apply to him in any way. He ignored, as most citizens did, many of the commands and reminders read by the Speaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I have to report it?\" he asked his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"You did, in the dream-telling. That\u0027s enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what about the treatment? The Speaker says that treatment must take place.\" Jonas felt miserable. Just when the Ceremony was about to happen, his Ceremony of Twelve, would he have to go away someplace for treatment? Just because of a stupid dream?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his mother laughed again in a reassuring, affectionate way. \"No, no,\" she said. \"It\u0027s just the pills. You\u0027re ready for the pills, that\u0027s all. That\u0027s the treatment for Stirrings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas brightened. He knew about the pills. His parents both took them each morning. And some of his friends did, he knew. Once he had been heading off to school with Asher, both of them on their bikes, when Asher\u0027s father had called from their dwelling doorway, \"You forgot your pill, Asher!\" Asher had groaned good-naturedly, turned his bike, and ridden back while Jonas waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the sort of thing one didn\u0027t ask a friend about because it might have fallen into that uncomfortable category of \"being different.\" Asher took a pill each morning; Jonas did not. Always better, less rude, to talk about things that were the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he swallowed the small pill that his mother handed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all,\" she replied, returning the bottle to the cupboard. \"But you mustn\u0027t forget. I\u0027ll remind you for the first weeks, but then you must do it on your own. If you forget, the Stirrings will come back. The dreams of Stirrings will come back. Sometimes the dosage must be adjusted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asher takes them,\" Jonas confided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother nodded, unsurprised. \"Many of your groupmates probably do. The males, at least. And they all will, soon. Females too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long will I have to take them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Until you enter the House of the Old,\" she explained. \"All of your adult life. But it becomes routine; after a while you won\u0027t even pay much attention to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at her watch. \"If you leave right now, you won\u0027t even be late for school. Hurry along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And thank you again, Jonas,\" she added, as he went to the door, \"for your dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePedaling rapidly down the path, Jonas felt oddly proud to have joined those who took the pills. For a moment, though, he remembered the dream again. The dream had felt pleasurable. Though the feelings were confused, he thought that he had liked the feelings that his mother had called Stirrings. He remembered that upon waking, he had wanted to feel the Stirrings again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, in the same way that his own dwelling slipped away behind him as he rounded a corner on his bicycle, the dream slipped away from his thoughts. Very briefly, a little guiltily, he tried to grasp it back. But the feelings had disappeared. The Stirrings were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lily, please hold still,\" Mother said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily, standing in front of her, fidgeted impatiently. \"I can tie them myself,\" she complained. \"I always have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that,\" Mother replied, straightening the hair ribbons on the little girl\u0027s braids. \"But I also know that they constantly come loose and more often than not, they\u0027re dangling down your back by afternoon. Today, at least, we want them to be neatly tied and to stay neatly tied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like hair ribbons. I\u0027m glad I only have to wear them one more year,\" Lily said irritably. \"Next year I get my bicycle, too,\" she added more cheerfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are good things each year,\" Jonas reminded her. \"This year you get to start your volunteer hours. And remember last year, when you became a Seven, you were so happy to get your front-buttoned jacket?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl nodded and looked down at herself, at the jacket with its row of large buttons that designated her as a Seven. Fours, Fives, and Sixes all wore jackets that fastened down the back so that they would have to help each other dress and would learn interdependence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front-buttoned jacket was the first sign of independence, the first very visible symbol of growing up. The bicycle, at Nine, would be the powerful emblem of moving gradually out into the community, away from the protective family unit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLily grinned and wriggled away from her mother. \"And this year you get your Assignment,\" she said to Jonas in an excited voice. \"I hope you get Pilot. And that you take me flying!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure I will,\" said Jonas. \"And I\u0027ll get a special little parachute that just fits you, and I\u0027ll take you up to, oh, maybe twenty thousand feet, and open the door, and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas,\" Mother warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was only joking,\" Jonas groaned. \"I don\u0027t want Pilot, anyway. If I get Pilot I\u0027ll put in an appeal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Mother said. She gave Lily\u0027s ribbons a final tug. \"Jonas? Are you ready? Did you take your pill? I want to get a good seat in the Auditorium.\" She prodded Lily to the front door and Jonas followed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-5.html","bookId":1701,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM"}
