I felt Michael’s gaze boring into my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn would arrive soon. At last the air was cool, but it smelled of loneliness and despair. Or perhaps that was me. I was shutting down. This was all too much. My legs felt tied down, my shoulders too heavy. My neck protested the weight of my head. I had to force one foot in front of the other until I reached Devyn’s Jag. I plopped inside ungracefully as he settled into the driver’s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not worry about the nights you owe me,” he said. “I will come back when you are better rested.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned back and closed my eyes. “I’ll give you your nights, Devyn. You more than earned them. But you know what? I don’t think you’ll claim them. You’re a man of honor, and you know I love another man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence that lasted a long, long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn you,” he finally muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was close to breaking completely, and I didn’t want it to be here, with this man. I wanted Lucius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevyn drove me to my apartment building. Finally. Home. When he reached the building, I trudged out of the car, and the door shut with a snap. The air was cooler than it had been all week—more fragrant, less dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe window eased down with a quiet whoosh. “Eden,” Devyn called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what he planned to say, but I spun around and reentered his car. I owed Devyn everything, yet he was getting nothing in return. He truly did possess too much honor to hold on to me. Without a word, I leaned into him and brushed my lips against his. Softly at first, then I increased the pressure. When his mouth parted, I swept my tongue inside. Again I tasted his warmth, his masculinity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t last long, only a few seconds before I pulled away. I watched Devyn lick his lips, savoring my taste. “Thank you for everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope we meet again,” he said, his amber eyes glowing. “And I hope your human is worthy of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is,” I said. I knew this one thing for sure. “He is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBandaged and medicated, Lucius was sleeping soundly in my bed. I showered, the dry spray washing away the horrors of the night. Clean at last, I curled into bed beside him. His warmth seeped into me. A tear rolled down my cheek, followed quickly by another. Down, down the golden droplets fell until I was sobbing, shaking, convulsing. I sobbed until my eyes swelled shut, sobbed for the family I had lost, both my parents and Michael, sobbed for the things I had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I had probably destroyed families, I had also rid the world of evil. People slept peacefully because of the kills I had made. I had to be content with that knowledge. And know that Michael had done the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I drifted off to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I awoke, the surroundings were unfamiliar to me at first. It seemed like an eternity since I had gazed at this room, and it took me a minute to recall that I was inside my new apartment. The canopied bed, the coffee-colored walls. Lucius was still asleep, was still beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lumbered off the mattress and stumbled into the kitchen, where I fixed myself a glass of sugar water. I drank deeply. I was just refilling my glass, with every intention of dumping the contents in Lucius’s face to wake him up, when he raced into the kitchen, a wild glaze in his ice-blue eyes. He stilled when he spied me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I now own you,” were the first words out of my mouth. “You’re bought and paid for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My God, Eden. I nearly killed myself with worry about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know the feeling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stalked toward me, and his hard expression was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. Something I couldn’t read glowed in those electric eyes of his. My heart thumped in my chest as he jerked me into his embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I’d lost you,” he said roughly. Rawly. He pushed me to arm’s length. “Where the hell have you been? What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze went to my mouth. “Explain later. I’ve missed you too much.” Then he was kissing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t make it to the bed. We just pulled off each other’s clothes and went at it on the self-warming kitchen tile. I couldn’t touch him enough. My hands were all over him, and his were all over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe strained and moved together, and when he entered me, I screamed with the force of my climax. His soon followed mine. And this time, we let the walls reverberate with the sounds of our pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the aftermath, we lay together, panting. I explained what had happened to me after the sale. I even told him about Michael killing my parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms tightened around me. “I didn’t know,” he said. “I’m so sorry, baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s cookie to you.” I brushed aside the pain inside me and smiled playfully. “And I’ll get over it. I need time, that’s all. Michael’s a good man, and he loves me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He loves you a hell of a lot. Maybe not as much I do, but he loves you all the same.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jolted up and spun to face him. He’d offered the words so casually, I was afraid I’d misunderstood. “What did you say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze bored deeply into mine. He didn’t pretend to misunderstand. “I love you. I have for a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA weight lifted off my shoulders, and I suddenly felt lighter than air. I felt my mouth curl into a wide grin. “Well, I love you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe now you can stop trying to prove yourself all the time.” He cupped my face in his hands. “I know how great you are. There’s no one better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words touched me,freed me somehow. I had his love. I’d closed this case and killed my target. Ihad proved myself. Iwas a success. “You’re pretty amazing yourself, you know that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a gentle tug, he urged me on top of him. “What did the Targon mean, that you’d made a bargain with him to free me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I kissed him,” I said. “Twice. And I’m not sorry. I would have given him everything to save you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hell, I would kiss him too if it meant saving your life. Just make sure it doesn’t happen again. You’re mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved hearing those words.You’re mine. “I’d believe you,” I said, biting my lower lip and forcing an expression of desolation. “Except…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he asked, frowning. “Except what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know your real name.” I stroked his abdomen…then his cock. “Tell me, and I’ll let you come.” I squeezed him. Tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Phineas Gaylord Hargrove,” he said on a moan. “Now what the hell does theF stand for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait.” My hold on him loosened. “Did you say Phineas? Phineas Gaylord? You’re kidding me, right? Trying to get me to tell you my deepest secret?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s the truth,” he growled. “That’s my name, so put your hand back where it was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed until my side hurt. Now I knew why he’d guarded his name so zealously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up and tapped his fingers against the tile. “I believe you have something to tell me, and I’m tired of waiting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. I’ll tell you. I bedeviled Michael so relentlessly, he added a middle name when he adopted me, making my name Eden Fucking Black.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucius gave a husky bark of laughter. “You’re shitting me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish I were,Phineas. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to level me with a glare, but his eyes were sparkling too much. We both burst into another round of laughter. But once the amusement subsided, we sank into a heavy silence. There was still something nagging and dragging between us, but I was loath to bring it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Agent Luc?” I finally asked, staying on safe ground by avoiding what we really needed to discuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Safe. We can go get her, later. First, I have a confession to make.” Lucius did what I’d been unable to do; he brought our troubles out into the open. “Michael paid me to guard you. He—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” I said, relieved that he’d finally told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be mad,” he rushed on. “I realized early in the case that you could take care of yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not mad.” I intertwined our fingers and squeezed. “I’m grateful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me for a long while. “Okay. Where’s the Eden Black I know and love? I expected another knife at my throat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I should be mad atyou. I wanted a piece of EenLi myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I’ll give you the next one. No, wait.” I nestled my head into the hollow of his neck. My hair spread over his chest like a golden curtain. “I left the agency. As of now, I’m unemployed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers caressed the length of my spine, making me shiver. “Maybe we should start our own company.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely. Tell me again about the Targon. I didn’t like the way he looked at you during your auction, and I still don’t like that he actually had his lips on you. I’m thinking he’ll be our first target.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. I just couldn’t help myself. I might be jobless, but right now, in Lucius’s arms, life had never seemed more ripe with promise. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/enslave-me-sweetly-alien-huntress-2/page-34.html","bookId":1767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:54 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:26:54 AM"}
