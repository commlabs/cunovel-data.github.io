I have failed you\". He heard the pain in the woman’s voice, one was leader of the female Ayyad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were not meant to kill him\", Demandred said. \"He is a foe beyond your skill. You have disrupted his command post?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\" Galbrait said. \"We killed half a dozen of his channelers, set the building aflame and destroyed his maps\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he channel? Did he reveal himself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, then shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he could not know for certain yet if this Cauthon was Lews Therin in disguise Demandred suspected he was, but there were reports from Shayol Ghul that Lews Therin had been seen there, on the slopes of the mountain. He had proven devious in the Last Battle before, jumping between battlefields, showing himself here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more Demandred maneuvered against the enemy general, the more he believed that Lews Therin was here. It would be very like Lews Therin to send a decoy north while coming to fight this battle himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLews Therin had difficulty letting others fight for him. He always wanted to be doing everything himself, leading every battle—every charge if he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes . how else could Demandred explain the skill of the enemy general. Only a man with the experience of an ancient was so masterly at the dance of battlefields. At their core, many battle tactics were simple. Avoid being flanked, meet heavy force with pikes, infantry with a well-trained line channelers with other channelers. And yet, the finesse of it . . . the little details . . . these took centuries to master. No man from this Age had lived long enough to learn the details with such care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the War of Power, the only thing that Demandred had ever done better than his friend was as a battle general. It stung to admit that, but he would no longer hide from that truth. Lews Therin had been stronger in the One Power. Lews Therin had been better at capturing the hearts of men. Lews Therin had taken Ilyena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Demandred . . . Demandred had been better at war. Lews Therin had never been able to correctly balance caution and boldness. The man would hold back and deliberate, worrying over his decisions, until boiling forward in a reckless military action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this Cauthon was Lews Therin, the man had grown better at that. The enemy general knew when to flip the coin and let fate rule, but did not let too much ride on each result. He would have made an excellent card player.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred would still defeat him, of course. The battle would merely be more . . . interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rested his hand on his sword, considering his scan of the battlefield moments before. His Trollocs continued their attack at the riverbed, and Lews Therin had formed his pikemen, opposite them, into disciplined square formations, a defensive move. Behind Demandred, the shaking booms of channelers marked the greater war, that between his Sharan Ayyad and the Aes Sedai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held the advantage there. His Ayyad were far better at war than the Aes Sedai. When would Cauthon commit those damane? Moghedien had reported some dissension between them and the Aes Sedai. Could Demandred widen the fracture there somehow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave orders, and the three Ayyad nearby retreated. Shendla remained, waiting his permission to leave. He had her scouting the area nearby and watching for more assassins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you worried?\" he asked her. \"You know now for which side we fight. So far as I know, you have not given yourself to the Shadow\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ve given myself to you, Wyld\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And for me you fight beside Trollocs? Halfmen? Creatures from nightmare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said some would call your actions evil\", she said. \"But I do not see them as such. Our path is clear. Once you are victorious, you will remake the world, and our people will be preserved\". She took his hand, and something stirred within him. It was quickly smothered by his hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would cast it all away\", he said, looking into her eyes. \"Everything for a chance at Lews Therin\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have promised to try\", she said. \"That will be enough. And if you destroy him, you will destroy one world and preserve another. I will follow you. We will follow you\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice seemed to imply that perhaps, once Lews Therin was dead, Demandred would be able to become his own man again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not certain. Rule only interested him insofar as he could use it against his ancient enemy. The Sharans, devoted and faithful, were just a tool. But within him, there was something that wished it was not so. That was new. Yes, it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air nearby warped, bending. No weaves were visible—this was a ripping of the fabric of the Pattern, Traveling by the True Power. M’Hael had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred turned, and Shendla released his arm, but did not leave his side. M’Hael had been given access to the Great Lord’s essence. That did not make Demandred jealous. M’Hael was another tool. Still, it made him wonder. Was anyone denied the True Power, these days?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are going to lose the battle near the ruins, Demandred\", M’Hael said with an arrogant smile. \"Your Trollocs there will be crushed. You had the enemy vastly outnumbered, and yet they still will defeat you! I thought you were supposed to be our greatest general, yet you lose to this rabble? I’m disappointed\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred raised his hand casually, two fingers up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM’Hael jerked as two dozen nearby Sharan channelers slammed shields between him and the One Power. They wrapped him in the Air, jerking him backward. He fought back, the air-warping aura of the True Power surrounding him, but Demandred was faster. He wove a True Power shield, building it from burning threads of Spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe threads trembled in the air, each one barbed with twisting strands of energy so small, the ends vanished into nothing. The True Power was so volatile, so dangerous. A shield crafted from it had a strange effect, drinking in the power of another trying to channel it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred’s shield stole M’Hael’s power, and used the man like a conduit. Demandred gathered the True Power and wove it into a crackling ball of force above his hand. Only M’Hael would be able to see it, and the man’s proud eyes opened wide as Demandred drained him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not unlike a circle. The pulling of energy made M’Hael tremble, sweat, as he was held up by the weaves of Demandred’s Ayyad. This flow could burn M’Hael out, if unchecked—could flay his soul with the rushing of the True Power, like a river surging beyond its banks. The twisting mass of threads in Demandred’s hands pulsed and crackled, warping the air, beginnin \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-238.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
