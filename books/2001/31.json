Every time he did it was like a punch to the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just couldn’t face him, because that look on his face had been as bad as the one on my mother’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been around five months after the Halloween party when I had decided I couldn’t take it anymore. The onslaught of emails, texts, phone calls, and Facebook messages had been bad, but at school, in real life? In the hallways, the bathrooms, the cafeteria, and the classrooms, people didn’t just whisper about what they heard happened when Blaine and I went into his bedroom. They openly talked about it in front of me. Called me every combination of lying whore you could come up with. The teachers didn’t stop it, neither did the staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo me and that picture frame that used to hold the photo of me and my best friend—the same girl who’d called me a slut that very day in the crowded hall at school—had gotten friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents could barely look at me before I cut my wrist but after? In the hospital room, Mom had lost it. For the first time in, like forever, she had lost it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had stormed into the private room, Dad trailing behind her. Her sharp gaze shot from my face to my bandaged wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStricken panic had crossed her too perfect features, and I thought that finally, she was going to pull me into her arms and tell me that everything was going to be okay, that we’d get through this together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat look of pain had given way to disappointment, to pity, and to anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How dare you shame yourself and your family like this, Avery. What am I supposed to tell people when they find out about this?” Mom had said and her voice had shook as she struggled to keep quiet in the hospital room, but she lost control. The next words were shrieked. “After everything else, you go and do this? Haven’t you put us through enough? What is wrong with you, Avery? What is God’s name is wrong with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurses had dragged Mom out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrangely, what I remembered from that night had been that brief look of panic on her face and how I had mistakenly believed it had been there out of concern for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stricken look had been on Cam’s face, and I wanted to be somebody else, because I knew that stricken look would eventually turn into something else, into disappointment, into pity, and into anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I couldn’t bear to see that happen with Cam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would do anything to avoid that, even if it meant taking drastic steps. Somewhere between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, I’d made up my mind about the current state of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis… this stuff with Cam had been doomed for failure from the beginning. Could a guy and a girl who were attracted to each other really be friends? I didn’t think so. Things would get too complicated. They’d either act on those feelings or stay away from each other. We had tried to act on those feelings for a hot second. We kissed a couple of times. That was all. And in reality, it wouldn’t have gone further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t sure that I could’ve gone further. Well, especially now I didn’t think so. Cam would eventually move on and I would have an absolutely obliterated heart. Not broken, but completely destroyed, because Cam… he was falling-in-love-with material. And I couldn’t let that happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe you already had, whispered an evil, terrible, bitchy voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo on Wednesday morning I went to my advisor and made up some excuse about there being too much school work and that I was getting behind. The last day for complete withdrawal from a class had been at the end of October, so to get out of astronomy I would have to take an incomplete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn incomplete would totally bitch slap my GPA, but the truth was I was doing good enough in the rest of my classes that it wouldn’t kill my overall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a decision to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFace Cam and deal with the inevitable broken heart or take the incomplete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the incomplete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as I left my advisor’s office, I knew what I’d done wasn’t so much making a decision. I was running. After all, wasn’t that what I was good at? Running?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrit and Jacob attempted to stage an intervention the following weekend. Both showed up at my apartment and if I hadn’t let them in, I was confident they’d beat down my door, or worse, involve Cam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in my moon chair, staring up at them. “Guys, really…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrit folded her arms, chin raised stubbornly. “We are your friends and obviously you’re facing a crisis of some sort, so we are here, and you can’t get rid of us that easily.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not having or facing a crisis.” God, had Cam told them what he’d seen? My stomach dropped, but I told myself he wouldn’t have done that. At least I didn’t think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Jacob said, returning from the kitchen. “Since you’ve come back from Thanksgiving break, you’ve been walking around like a zombie and not the cool, fast brain-eating kind. You looked like you’ve been crying your eyes out, you’ve been avoiding Cam and all talk of him, and there is nothing good to eat in your kitchen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my brow at the last statement. “I haven’t been avoiding Cam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bullshit,” Brit replied. “I talked to Cam yesterday. He said you won’t talk to him, answer his phone calls or your door when it’s him, and you haven’t been to astronomy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp pain sliced across my chest. I almost asked if she had approached him, but figured it didn’t matter. The less I thought about him the better. Not saying his name helped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving my two friends give me the third degree about him wasn’t helping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you guys get into a fight?” Jacob plopped down on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad we? Not really. I shook my head. “It’s nothing, guys. We didn’t get in a fight. I just haven’t been in the mood to talk to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shot me a bland look. “Avery, that’s bullshit, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raised my hands helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why haven’t you been going to astronomy?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I dropped the class.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gaped. “You’ve dropped the class? Avery, the last day to drop was—oh, my God, you’re taking an incomplete?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a big deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrit stared at me, so did Jacob. “Have you’ve lost your fucking mind, Avery?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, Brit glanced between Jacob and me. “Jacob, can you get back to the dorm by yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows knitted. “Uh yeah, it’s not that far of a walk, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” she chirped. Leaning forward, she kissed him on the cheek. “See you later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob sat there for a moment and then shook his head. He gave me a quick hug before he left. “Why did you kick him out?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because we need to talk girl to girl,” she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh dear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned forward, clenching her knees. “What happened between you two?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled to come up with a good excuse for why I was avoiding Cam. “It’s just that I don’t think pursuing a relationship with him is the right thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. You’re entitled to decide that, but no friendship? To the point you can’t be in the same class as him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t be friends,” I said after a few moments, already weary with this conversation. “That’s just it, okay? I really don’t want to talk about this. I’m not trying to be rude, but there’s nothing to say. I don’t want to see him. End of story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to see him. The thing about that was that it was only partially true. I was too embarrassed and ashamed to see him, but I missed him. It had only been a week, but I missed his smart ass comments, his wit and charm, and—I stopped myself with a shake of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrit pushed her hair off her forehead. “Alright, but I want to ask one question and I want a fucking honest answer, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened. “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he try something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I shrieked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met my stare. “Did he hurt you or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my God, no.” I stood, running my hands down my hips. “Cam didn’t do anything. I promise you. He didn’t do anything wrong. It’s me. Okay. Please don’t think that about him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrit nodded slowly. “I didn’t think he would’ve, but I had to ask. I had to know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stayed for a little while longer, switching the conversation to her latest hook up with Jimmie, and for a while I forgot about Cam and the whole mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she left, she stopped at the door and turned back to me. “Just in case you’re wondering, when I talked to Cam, he was really worried about you. He was upset. Whatever went down between you two, I hope you guys can work it out, because…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her lips together, exhaling through her nose. “Because I think the guy really does care about you, Avery. And I think you really care about him. It would be a fucking shame if you guys couldn’t fix this or work this out over some bullshit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the semester winding down, I threw myself into finals. With the incomplete in astronomy, I needed to ace all my exams to just to make myself feel somewhat better after making such a crazy decision. More than once over the last week or so, I wanted to punt kick myself in the face for taking an incomplete. In those very rare logical moments, I cursed myself every which way from Sunday. It was a stupid, stupid decision, especially over a boy, but there was nothing I could do now. I’d missed the last two weeks of class and there was no way I could make up for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I finished up my last final of the semester—music—I headed to the train station where my car was parked. Facing the brutal wind that seemed to blow straight in my eyes, I pulled out my cell. There were a couple of unread texts from Cam over the last week, one from the UNKNOWN CALLER who apparently got tired of calling me a whore over voicemail and moved on to texting it. Just like I avoided my cousin’s emails, I did the same with Cam’s texts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t delete them though. I’m not sure why. I just couldn’t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a missed call from Brit. She wanted to get together before she headed home for winter break. Neither her nor Jacob brought up the stuff with Cam again, but it hung between us every time we were together. After leaving campus, I headed to the grocery store for the long overdue trip. I milled through the aisles, not really finding anything appetizing, but more of just throwing stuff in my cart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way out, I spotted Ollie heading into the pizza joint at the end of the strip mall. We were less than a mile from the apartments, so it wasn’t a surprise to see him there, but I stopped in the middle of the parking lot, my heart pounding. He didn’t look over my way, probably didn’t even see me, but I saw him and I thought of that stupid tortoise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lump appeared in my throat and I inhaled sharply. Tears burned the back of my eyes as I forced myself to the back of my car. I unloaded the groceries, focusing on the mundane task until I felt the messy ball of emotion slid back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inevitable happened as I lugged up the last of my groceries. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wait-for-you-wait-for-you-1/page-31.html","bookId":2001,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:23 PM"}
