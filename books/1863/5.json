He had a nice face, serious, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith an unexpected dimple in his chin that gave him a slightly mischievous look. His body was nicely\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuscled but compact; standing, Jez knew, he\u0027d be no taller than she. There was a large bump coming up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon his forehead, just under the falling hair. The ghoul had probably slammed him against something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez jumped up and got a blue plastic cup full of water from her nightstand. She grabbed a clean T-shirt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom the floor and dipped it into the water, then she gently brushed back the hair from the boy\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was silky under her fingers. Even softer than she would have thought. Jez kept her face expressionless\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand began to wipe his face with the damp cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t stir. Jez\u0027s heart, which was already thumping distinctly, speeded up. She took a deep breath\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand kept wiping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, although it probably didn\u0027t have anything to do with the water, the boy\u0027s dark eyelashes moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe coughed, breathed, blinked, and looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief spread through Jez. \"Don\u0027t try to sit up yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what they all say,\" he agreed, and sat up. He put a hand to his head and groaned. Jez steadied\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" he said. \"Just tell the room to stop moving.\" He looked around the room, bunked again and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esuddenly seemed to focus. He grabbed her arm, his eyes wide. \"Something followed me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ghoul. It\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out his breath. Then he smiled wryly. \"You saved my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I don\u0027t even charge,\" Jez said, embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean it.\" His smile faded and he looked straight at her. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez could feel heat trying to rise to her face, and she had a hard time holding his gaze. His eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egray and so intense-fathomless. Her skin was tingling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away and said evenly, \"We should get you to a hospital. You might have a concussion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m okay. Let me just see if I can stand up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she opened her mouth to protest, he added, \"Jez, you don\u0027t know why I\u0027m here. It can\u0027t wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right; Jez had been so intent on getting him conscious that she hadn\u0027t even wondered what he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas doing here. She looked at him for a moment, then nodded. She helped him up, and let go of his arm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen she saw he could stand without falling over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, I\u0027m fine.\" He took a few steps, then made a circuit of the room, loosening his muscles. Jez watched\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim narrowly, ready to grab him if he fell. But he walked steadily except for a slight limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that wasn\u0027t from his encounter with the ghoul tonight, Jez knew. He\u0027d had the limp from childhood,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom when the werewolves took his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow he\u0027d been able to get over that and join Circle Daybreak, Jez would never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d lost his parents almost as young as she had. He\u0027d lost his two sisters and his brother, too. His entire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efamily had been on a camping trip atLake Tahoe , when in the middle of the night they\u0027d been attacked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby a pack of werewolves. Renegade \u0027wolves, hunting illegally because Night World law wouldn\u0027t let them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekill as often as they liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like Jez\u0027s old gang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u0027wolves had ripped through theDavis family\u0027s tents and killed the humans, one, two, three. Easy as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat. The only one they left alive was seven-year-old Hugh, because he was too little to have much meat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon his body. They had just settled down to eat the hearts and livers of their victims, when\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esuddenly the one too little to be worth eating was dashing at them with a homemade torch constructed of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ekerosene-soaked underwear wrapped around a stick. He was also waving a silver cross on a chain the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewerewolves had torn from his sister\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo things werewolves don\u0027t like: silver and fire. The little boy was attacking with both. The \u0027wolves\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edecided to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey almost did it. They managed to chew one of his legs almost off before a park ranger arrived,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eattracted by the spreading fire from the dropped torch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ranger had a gun, and the fire was getting out of control. The \u0027wolves left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh almost died of blood loss on the way to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was a tough kid. And a very smart one. He didn\u0027t even try to explain to anybody what he\u0027d been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoing with the silver necklace. He knew they would never believe him if he said he\u0027d suddenly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremembered a bunch of past lives, including one where he\u0027d seen a werewolf killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh Davis was an Old Soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a wakened Old Soul, which was even more rare. It scared Jez a little. He was human and she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom the Night World, but she didn\u0027t pretend to understand the magic that brought some humans back\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain and again, reincarnating them in new bodies. Letting them remember all their past lifetimes, making\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem smarter and more clearheaded every time they were born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Hugh\u0027s case, also gentler every time. In spite of the attack on his family, when he got out of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehospital the first thing he did was try to find some Night People. He knew they weren\u0027t all bad. He knew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esome of them would help him stop the werewolves from hurting anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, the first people he found were from Circle Daybreak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCircles were witch organizations, but Circle Daybreak was for humans and vampires and shapeshifters\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand werewolves, too. It was an underground society, as secret within the Night World as the Night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorld was secret within the human world. It went against the most basic tenets of Night World law: that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehumans were not to be told about the Night World, and that Night People shouldn\u0027t fall in love with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehumans. Circle Daybreak was fighting to unite everybody, to stop the killings, and to bring peace\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebetween the races.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez wished them luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly realized that Hugh had stopped walking and was looking at her. She blinked and focused,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efurious with herself for her slip in concentration. As a huntress-of vampires or anything else-you stayed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealert all the time, or you were dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were miles away,\" Hugh said softly. His gray eyes were calm but intense as always. That look Old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouls get when they\u0027re reading you, Jez thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"Sorry. Um, do you want some ice for that bump?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I like it. I\u0027m thinking of getting one on the other side, to match.\" He sat on the bed, serious again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, I\u0027ve got some stuff to explain to you, and it\u0027s going to take a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez didn\u0027t sit. \"Hugh, I think you need it. And I need to take a shower or my aunt will get suspicious\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout what I\u0027m doing in here for so long. Besides, the smell is driving me crazy.\" Although she couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euse her vampire powers without bringing on the bloodlust, her senses were still much more acute than a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eau de Ghoul? And I was just starting to enjoy it.\" Hugh nodded at her, switching from gentle humor to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egentle gravity as always. \"You need to do what will keep your cover here. I shouldn\u0027t be so impatient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez took the fastest shower of her life, then dressed in clean clothes she\u0027d brought to the bathroom. As\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe returned carrying a glassful of ice from the kitchen and a washcloth, she saw that Claire\u0027s bedroom\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoor was ajar and Claire was watching her narrowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez raised the glass in a mock toast, and slipped into her own bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here.\" She made an ice pack and handed it to Hugh. He accepted it docilely. \"Now, what is it that\u0027s so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eurgent? And how come you\u0027re so popular with ghouls all of a sudden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of answering, Hugh looked into a middle distance. He was bracing himself for something. Finally\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe lowered the ice pack and looked straight at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I care about you. If anything happened to you, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do. And if anything\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappened because of me...\" He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez told her heart to get down where it belonged. It was pounding in her throat, choking her. She kept\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher voice flat as she said, \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething like hurt flashed in his eyes and was gone instantly. \"You don\u0027t think I mean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez still spoke flatly, in a clipped, hurried voice. She wasn\u0027t good at talking about emotional stuff. \"Hugh,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elook. You were my first human friend. When I came to live here, nobody at Circle Daybreak would have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanything to do with me. I don\u0027t blame them-not after the things my gang did to humans. But it was hard\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause they wouldn\u0027t even talk to me, much less trust me, and they wouldn\u0027t believe I wanted to help\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem. And then you showed up that day after school. And you did talk to me-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I did trust you,\" Hugh said. \"And I still do.\" He looked distant again. \"I thought you were the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaddest person I\u0027d ever seen, and the most beautiful-and the bravest. I knew you wouldn\u0027t betray Circle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaybreak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s why I love you, Jez thought before she could stop herself. It was easier to live with if she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t put it into words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause it was hopeless, of course. You couldn\u0027t hang on to an Old Soul. Nobody could-not unless\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey were one of those tiny fraction of people who were soulmates. Wakened Old Souls were too...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eold. They knew too much, had seen too much to get attached to any one person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch less a person who was tainted with vampire blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo all she said was \"I know. That\u0027s why I work with Circle Daybreak. Because you convinced them I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasn\u0027t some kind of spy for the Night World. I owe you, Hugh. And-I believe you care about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you care about everybody, she added silently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh nodded, but he didn\u0027t look any happier. \"It\u0027s about something dangerous. Something I don\u0027t want\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto ask you to do.\" He dug into his jeans pocket and came up with a thick packet of what looked like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efolded newspaper articles. He held it out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez took it, frowned, then paged through the first few articles. Headlines jumped out at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Four-year old dies in coyote attack.\u0027 \u0027Record heatwave in Midwest; hundreds hospitalized.\u0027 \u0027Mother\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003econfesses: I killed my babies.\u0027 \u0027Mystery virus erupts in eastern U.S.: Scientists baffled.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were lots more, but she didn\u0027t look at them. She looked at Hugh, her eyebrows drawn together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for sharing this. Am I supposed to fight the coyote or the virus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips smiled, but his eyes were bottomless and frighteningly sad. \"Nobody can fight what\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappening-at least not in the ordinary way. And all that\u0027s just the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of what?\" She loved Hugh, but sometimes she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewanted to strangle him. Old Souls loved being mysterious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you noticed the weather lately? It\u0027s either floods or droughts. Record cold days in winter, record\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheat in the summer. Record number of hurricanes and tornadoes. Record snowfall and hail. It just gets\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweirder and weirder every year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-sure.\" Jez shrugged. \"They talk about it on TV all the time. But it doesn\u0027t mean any-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the earth\u0027s being disturbed, too. Earthquakes. Volcanoes. Last year four dormant volcanoes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eerupted and there were dozens of major quakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez narrowed her eyes. \"Okay...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And there\u0027s another weird thing, even though it\u0027s not as obvious. You have to kind of dig a little to get to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe statistics. There\u0027s been an increase in animal attacks all over the world. All kinds of animals.\" He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etapped the pile of newspaper articles. \"This coyote attack-a couple of years ago you never heard about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecoyotes killing kids. Just like you never heard of mountain lions attacking adults. But now it\u0027s happening,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand it\u0027s happening everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrickles of unease were going up Jez\u0027s arms. It was true, what Hugh was saying. Not that she\u0027d paid\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emuch attention to the human news when she was a vampire-but it did seem as if animal attacks were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egetting more frequent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bunch of elephants stomped their trainers last year,\" she said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dog attacks are up four hundred percent,\" Hugh said. \"According to the California state police. In\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Mexico there\u0027s an epidemic of rabid bats. In Florida they\u0027ve had seven tourists killed by alligators\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esince last January-and believe me, that information was hard to find. Nobody wanted to report it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then there are the insects. We\u0027re seeing more and more people get attacked by them. Killer bees. Fire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eants. Tiger mosquitoes-and, no, I\u0027m not joking. They\u0027re for real, and they carry dengue fever, a really\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enasty disease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which brings me to diseases.

Crimean-Congo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehemorrhagic fever. You bleed from your ears and nose and mouth and into the whites of your eyes-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez opened her mouth to say \"Hugh\" again, but he was racing on, his chest rising and falling quickly, his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egray eyes almost feverish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027re resistant to antibiotics the same way that the insects are resistant to pesticides.

And-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh.\" She got it in while he took a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-there\u0027s a hole in the ozone.\" He looked at her. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it all mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt means that things are changing. Spiraling out of control. Heading for...\" He stopped and looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat her. \"Jez, it\u0027s not those things themselves that are the problem. It\u0027s what\u0027s behind them.\" \"And what is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebehind them?\" Hugh said simply, \"The Old Powers are rising.\" Chills swept over Jez. The Old Powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ancient Magic that had controlled the universe in the old days of the Night World. No one could see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor know the Old Powers; they were forces of nature, not people. And they had been sleeping like giant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edragons for thousands of years ever since humans had gained control of the world. If they were waking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf magic was coming back again, everything would change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It shows in different weird ways,\" Hugh went on. \"Night People are getting more powerful. Lots of them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave noticed it. And they say the soulmate principle is back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soulmate principle. The idea that for every person there was one destined soulmate, one true love,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand that the two souls were bound for eternity. Jez lifted her shoulders and dropped them without\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emeeting Hugh\u0027s eyes. \"Yeah, I heard. Don\u0027t believe it, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen it,\" Hugh said, and for a moment Jez\u0027s heart stopped. Then it started again as he continued, \"In\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother people, I mean. I\u0027ve seen people our age who found their soulmate, and it\u0027s really true; you can see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit in their eyes. The Old Powers really are rising, Jez... for good and for evil. That\u0027s what\u0027s behind all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethese other changes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez sat very still. \"And so what happens if they keep rising?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens is...\" Hugh paused and then looked at her. \"It means a time of darkness is coming,\" he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A time-?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of serious darkness. The worst. We\u0027re talking the end of the world, here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez could feel gooseflesh on the back of her neck, where her wet hair touched her skin. She might have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen tempted to laugh if it were anybody else telling her this. But it was Hugh, and he wasn\u0027t joking. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad no desire to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But then it\u0027s all over,\" she said. \"There\u0027s nothing we can do. How can anybody stop the end of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworld?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well.\" He ran a quick hand through his hair, pushing it off his forehead. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. Because\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m hoping you can.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-5.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
