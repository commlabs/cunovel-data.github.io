(1)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heavenly Skill Image of the Silver Emperor behind Zhou Weiqing’s back slowly drifted to the front, and just like that it began to merge with the green-silver ball of light in front of him. This merging caused the silver light around Zhou Weiqing’s hand to brighten drastically, warping in an even stranger change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as his hands grasped together, the green-silver ball of light seemed to come to life. With violent reverberations, Zhou Weiqing’s entire body erupted with a powerful green and silver light. However, since he was so high up in the sky, no one else could see that his eyes had turned a full silver-white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s arms shook abruptly, and his hands slowly spread apart again. A tiny bird, fully silver in colour, appeared before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Silver Emperor?!” Even with Shangguan Longyin’s status and power, when he saw what Zhou Weiqing had done, he couldn’t help but exclaim out loud, unable to restrain himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Zhou Weiqing had done had toppled everything he thought he knew. He… he had actually used his own Heavenly Energy to coalesce a Silver Emperor!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scariest thing was… this Silver Emperor was clearly not just an image. As soon as it appeared, with Shangguan Longyin’s powerful senses, he could clearly sense a powerful life force from that Silver Emperor, far stronger than the Destruction Fire Phoenix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had to point out a difference between this energy-formed Silver Emperor and an actual Silver Emperor Heavenly Beast, it would be the colour of the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Heavenly King stage Heavenly Beast, the Silver Emperor had red eyes. However, for this Silver Emperor that Zhou Weiqing had formed, its eyes were a silver-white. Even so, as compared to an actual Silver Emperor, this energy-formed bird seemed to have a divine aura about it, as if it were above\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go.” Zhou Weiqing said softly, pointing his right hand downwards. The Silver Emperor before him cried out in a clear, bright cry, streaking down like a bolt of silver lightning towards the Destruction Fire Phoenix that was larger than it several dozen times over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Shangguan Longyin could not tell what Zhou Weiqing had unleashed, let alone the others. In truth, Zhou Weiqing and Shen Little Demon’s battle had not started for a long time, but anyone could tell that this was one of the most exciting battles for the current Heavenly Jewel Tournament, at least up until now. Both sides had unleashed Skills that were far above any ordinary Stored Skills, and the power that they displayed was definitely far beyond the six or seven Jewels they showed on the surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint smile caused Zhou Weiqing’s mouth to form a wicked smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis entire plan had been to force Shen Little Demon to use her Destruction Attribute. Otherwise, how could he learn more about the profound secrets behind the Destruction Attribute?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight and Fire… could these two Attributes fused together form the Destruction Attribute? No matter what, Zhou Weiqing could never believe that. Even if they were fused together, these two Attributes would be pure and upright, how could it be like the Destructive Attribute?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the Silver Emperor’s strongest Skill? Without a question, it was the Dual Attribute Skill Silver Emperor Spatial Rend, a fusion Skill of the Silver Emperor Wing Slash and the \u0026nbsp;Spatial Rend. Currently, the Silver Emperor swooping down was exactly unleashing that very Skill, forming a piercing green silver light that collided instantly to the Destruction Fire Phoenix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Hisss Laaa* A strange sound rang out, as if a red hot soldering iron had a bucket of ice water poured on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn mid air, the light dimmed abruptly, as if the sun’s light was being suppressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could clearly see a silver light fly into the head of the blood red Destruction Fire Phoenix, charging right down. Wherever it reached, it started breaking apart the entire body of the Destruction Fire Phoenix, and the green-silver body also began to shrink slowly as it charged down lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no violent explosions, but the terrifying energy reverberations in the skies could be clearly sensed by any Jewel Masters. Many watchers were secretly feeling lucky that this clash was in the skies; if it were on ground level, who knows what would have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreation. Once again, Zhou Weiqing had used the Saint Energy’s Creation, with the price of five drops of Saint Energy, to unleash the fusion Skill Silver Emperor Spatial Rend, coalescing the actual Silver Emperor. Ever since he had done so with the Hell’s Angel, he had been experimenting in repeating the process with other Skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout question, the power of this Skill was far above the original Silver Emperor Spatial Rend. With the power of the Saint Energy, the Destruction Attribute was being totally suppressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing had left a strand of his own spiritual energy in that coalesced Silver Emperor, allowing him to sense the energy reverberations and fluctuations of the Destruction Fire Phoenix, and any myriad changes it might have. He discovered that this Destruction Attribute energy had a crazy dissolving or disassembling effect on any other Attribute. Only the Saint Energy was able to resist this dissolving effect, but it wasn’t able to gain too much advantage either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, on the reverse side, the Destruction Attribute was also left helpless in front of the Saint Energy. It was destruction, and the Saint Energy was creation. Both sides were not even on the same level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust from visual effect alone, when that single wisp of green-silver light pierced and traveled right through the Destruction Fire Phoenix before disappearing stealthily, the Destruction Fire Phoenix looked as if it had been sliced into two from the middle before falling apart totally. Only Zhou Weiqing could clearly sense that in terms of pure strength of energy, his Silver Emperor was actually lesser than the Destruction Fire Phoenix. The reason he could destroy it was actually because of the core of the Destruction Fire Phoenix. Once the core of the Destruction Attribute had been destroyed, it had lost its soul, not allowing its full power to be unleashed. In that terrifying collision, both the powerful Skills disappeared just like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No… that’s not possible!” Pale and ashen, Shen Little Demon was barely standing with sheer exhaustion on the stage, her eyes staring up in total disbelief and shock. No matter what, she could not believe that what had happened in front of her eyes was true. Due to her fatigue, she had not been able to see clearly what Zhou Weiqing had done, only seeing a flash of silver before he Destruction Fire Phoenix vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Destruction Fire Phoenix held her Natal Core Flame and Natal Core Blood, when it vanished, she couldn’t help but involuntarily vomit out another mouth of fresh blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she unleashed that Skill, her goal had been to fight to the bitter end, to kill Zhou Weiqing no matter the price she had to pay. In her eyes, Zhou Weiqing would not be able to take this blow of hers. These three years, she had spent every single day training as hard as she could, putting her entire life into it. In the entire younger generation, she was one of the only three who had gained the Destruction Attribute. In order to do so, she had paid such a heavy price, withstood an unbelievable amount of pain and hardship, worked so hard in order to succeed. This time, coming to the Heavenly Jewel Tournament, she had not imagined that she would run into Zhou Weiqing again. However, the moment she saw him, the sparks of hatred within her had been reignited, causing her to unleash such a powerful killing Skill without holding anything back. Her only goal was to kill Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could be said that the past three years of labour and toil for Shen Little Demon had been warped into that Destruction Fire Phoenix. Yet, all of it had been just destroyed so easily by Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling as her body barely stood, Shen Little Demon grit her teeth, once again lifting her hand. She could not accept it, would not accept it! Even if she had to use her last bit of strength and life, she would destroy Zhou Weiqing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough.” A cold voice rang out. The next instant, the voice said solemnly: “Senior Shangguan, the first round, our Dan Dun Battle Team admits defeat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccompanying the voice was a figure who appeared onto the stage in a flash, gracefully holding onto Shen Little Demon’s waist as he brought her back down the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me go, let me go, I haven’t lost yet. He has to be just as spent as I am. Bro Feng, I cannot accept it, let me kill him, please!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Calm down.” The one who had carried Shen Little Demon off the stage was the Dan Dun Battle Team Leader, the youth with the cold expression. He did not hesitate to give her a slap, before enveloping her in a full embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your shame and humiliation, I will help you take revenge. However, you must survive and stay alive. You are already severely injured, with your vitality sapped to the limit. If you continue fighting, you will definitely die. The day you married me, your body no longer belongs to just yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter saying that, he gently laid Shen Little Demon onto one of the chairs in the Rest House. Turning, he looked upon Zhou Weiqing who was slowly descending from the skies onto the stage, his eyes filled with cold light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name was TianFeng, the true top genius of the Blood Red Hell younger generation. He was also the son of the Blood Red Hell Master. As for Shen Little Demon, she was the Princess of the Dan Dun Empire Royal Family. Although her status in the Blood Red Hell was very high, it could not be compared with TianFeng. In this year’s Heavenly Jewel Tournament, for TianFeng to personally lead their team, it could be said that they were determined to achieve victory at all costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNaturally, TianFeng had heard about everything that had happened in the previous Heavenly Jewel Tournament from Shen Little Demon, down to every little detail. This time, since they had met with another Battle Team led by Zhou Weiqing, though TianFeng was always so calm and collected, the competitive spirit in his heart was hidden but stronger than anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing stood on the stage, looking towards the Dan Dun Battle Team Rest House. Laughing heartily, he said: “Ahhh, the Dan Dun Battle Team has the Blood Red Hell at its back, and I originally thought your fighting spirit would be not bad. Who knew you would admit defeat just like that, how disappointing, how disappointing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bro, let me fight in the second round. I will take revenge for Sister in Law.” The one who spoke up now was the second youth, seated at TianFeng’s right hand side. He was TianMa, TianFeng’s younger brother, and his strength was above Shen Little Demon, second only to TianFeng. Clearly, he had been provoked and angered by Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTianFeng looked at Zhou Weiqing on the stage, as if he disdained to speak to him. Nodding to TianMa, he said: “Only victory is allowed. Do not lose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTianMa nodded. He did not even wait for Zhou Weiqing to descend the stage, and in a flash he leaped up the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTianFeng gave a cold smirk inwardly. \u003ci\u003eZhou Weiqing, you might be strong, but you are only a single person. Do you really think that you can stop my Dan Dun Battle Team just by yourself? Later, in the 2v2 match, I will let you remain on the stage… forever.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-24-chapter-219-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-24-chapter-220-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-24-chapter-220-01","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
