It\u0027s nothing short of a bad knockoff, a near miss, something that I once accused love of being. I wonder if all those marriages my mother sunk under like weights were nothing short of knockoffs for something pure she was trying to emulate - something special like what Cruise and I have. I wish I could gift that to her. Wrap up all of these wonderful feelings and ship them off to her with a shiny red bow. My mother deserves to have this. Everybody does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spot Lauren and Ally huddled near the window and head on over. A vagrant hand snatches me by the wrist, and I trace the red pea coat up to find Blair staring back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boy, you left in a hurry the other day.\" She reaches into her bag and pulls out a stack of loose papers. \"I got your stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you!\" I take them from her. \"My boyfriend had an emergency. His mom broke her leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you two are pretty close, huh?\" She sours at the thought. Couples like Cruise and I probably make her want to vomit, especially after coming off such a miserable breakup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very close.\" I shrug almost apologetically. \"He\u0027s amazing. I never thought I could have something like this with someone like Cruise. He\u0027s the nicest person on the planet.\" I can\u0027t seem to control my urge to gush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" She shakes her head. \"Don\u0027t you think you\u0027re too young to settle? And guys like, Cruise, did you say? When you\u0027re that good-looking, you\u0027re always getting hit on. They say \u0027pretty boys\u0027 are ninety percent more likely to cheat than some average Joe.\" Cal walks by outside, and she points a finger in his direction. \"Now take that guy for instance. He would make much better boyfriend material in the long run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not what his girlfriend says.\" I\u0027m quick to correct. \"Anyway, I\u0027d better go. Hey! It\u0027s your special day,\" I tease. \"You ready for the big reveal?\" Blair is scheduled to collect two hundred bones after class today and most likely just as many boners while conducting the semi-indecent exposure. Blair is pretty. I\u0027m sure any of the guys in art class, or Garrison in general, would love to get to know her better. But she\u0027s totally been burned, so I doubt they have a chance. Wounds like that need serious time to heal. When you hurt that deep, you\u0027re probably still emotionally clinging to the person that hurt you. It\u0027s that whole power exchange thing Cheryl hit on in class. Someone still very much holds all of Blair\u0027s power, and she needs to take it back before she could ever hope to move on with her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The big reveal?\" Her forehead wrinkles. \"Oh, I\u0027ve changed my mind.\" Blair slits me with a look that could cut my throat. \"Unlike some people, I\u0027d rather keep my dignity intact.\" She walks out the door with the verbal snipe still fresh on her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally? Some people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go over and take a seat next to Lauren and Ally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morning!\" I sing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren\u0027s face is bloated and patchy as if she\u0027s been up crying all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything okay?\" Everything is not okay, but I\u0027m pretty sure, who the hell shit on you isn\u0027t the best way to start a conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren unearthed some serious incriminating evidence,\" Ally whispers, speaking in code. \"Lace panties tucked in the couch.\" She makes a face. \"That\u0027s the calling card of every tramp who wants to get discovered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cal?\" My mouth falls open as I gape at Lauren.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bright red, crotchless,\" she whimpers. \"I found the matching bra under his bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a progressive dinner was enjoyed by all,\" Ally snipes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so sorry.\" I reach over and lay my hand over hers. I genuinely feel bad for Lauren. And, if it were the old me, I might have given her a spiel on how love doesn\u0027t exist, but I don\u0027t buy that anymore. A very real part of me wants to give her hope. \"You\u0027ll find someone else. There\u0027s someone special out there just for you. Believe me, the last thing you want is someone who strays.\" I hate cheaters. This is the exact kind of bullshit my friends in high school had to deal with. It seemed like everyone\u0027s boyfriend was prone to dip his wick whenever the offer presented itself. It was part of the reason I wasn\u0027t so quick to jump into a relationship. Not that Cruise would ever do that. We have something special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we had something special,\" she bleats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard. There\u0027s no way in hell Cruise and I could ever land in the deep end of the shitter like Lauren and Cal. What we have is forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we would be together forever.\" Her words meld with a cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She hasn\u0027t called him out on it.\" Ally nods into Lauren as if coaxing the truth out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a lot of parties at his place.\" Lauren digs her pinkies into the corners of her eyes and is quick to recompose herself. \"There\u0027s a good chance he\u0027s innocent. Besides, I think I should throw a pretty brunette at him one more time to solidify my theory.\" She hardens her gaze as if to insist I have no say in the boyfriend-trapping matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was totally resistive the last time we tried,\" I say, trying to break it to her gently. \"Besides, it felt like I was assaulting him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because you were in public, and Ally works there. He knows I\u0027m never that far from Ally. It extinguished his potential hard-on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One last time, I swear,\" she pleads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate the thought of having her disappointed in me, but something about it doesn\u0027t feel right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" I say, getting up to head to my English class, \"I know a girl who has some unspoken vendetta against anyone with a spare appendage hanging between his legs. She\u0027d probably be happy to do it. I need to run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey offer anemic good-byes as I head out into the cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems like everyone has a boyfriend, or husband, that cheats. Maybe Mom\u0027s long line of ill-gotten suitors wasn\u0027t such a fluke after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruise is different. I can feel it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if my mother ever said that about any of her ex-husbands?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear God, Cruise had better be different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the evening, under a sterile bloom of moonlight, Cruise drives us over to an Italian restaurant called the, Della Argento. We round out the building and find a spot not too far from the entrance. It looks busy, but Cruise lets me know he made reservations. Strangely, the sheer mention of reservations makes me feel more adult than either living three thousand miles from my mother or copulating with him like a sexed-up bunny. Reservations require forethought and planning, a phone call - all of which my adolescent fast-food brain quantifies as a giant leap into adulthood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large gift-wrapped box sits wedged behind his seat. I pretended not to see it when I climbed in. For all I know, it could be a birthday gift for maniacal Molly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something for you.\" The sweet kiss of moonlight pours in through the windshield, caressing his features. Its clean glow highlights the fact that Cruise is born of God\u0027s own breath and beauty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Cruise Elton ever sees in me I will never know. He reaches back and pulls the gift up front. The slick red box takes up the entire space between us. \"It\u0027s sort of a belated birthday gift.\" His dimples implode, sending an entire riot of pleasure spasming through me. Soon, all I\u0027ll have to do is look at Cruise, and I\u0027ll have a spontaneous orgasm. That should make for an interesting hour during gender relations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already gave me the perfect gift for my birthday. It was you, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t remember.\" His cheek digs in with a naughty half-smile. \"Maybe you can jog my memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give a little laugh and unwrap the shiny crimson package. A glossy white box lies beneath. Even that feels expensive, something far too opulent for me to ever own. I lift the lid and pull back layers of tissue, revealing a dark wool coat. I extract it with care as I feel its heft, its warmth already radiating over my fingers. It\u0027s so beautiful - charcoal grey with matte silver buttons, a svelte woolen sash attached at the hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cruise.\" I gasp as I pull it to my chest. \"It\u0027s gorgeous. You didn\u0027t have to do this.\" I happen to know these are damn expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to.\" He rounds out his gaze over me with a quiet stillness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruise bought me a gift. One he couldn\u0027t really afford. I don\u0027t think anyone has ever done anything so thoughtful for me before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" he continues, \"no matter how hot you look in that jean jacket of yours, it won\u0027t stave off pneumonia. And, if you get sick, who am I going to do this with?\" He leans over and indulges in a gentle kiss - the barely there flick of his tongue caressing mine. A soft moan squeezes out of his throat and drives me insane with pleasure. For a moment, I think of abandoning our dinner plans, but he went out of his way to call ahead, so I don\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruise comes around to my side and helps me put the jacket on. It stops just above my knees and warms me as proficient as a heater. I cinch the belt around my waist, and he groans while embracing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think you could get any hotter.\" He presses out a gorgeous smile and my insides cinch just like that first night we met. \"But you are on fire, Kenny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, thank you.\" I give his lips a slow seductive lick in lieu of a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And frisky.\" He slips an arm around my waist while adjusting the hard-on in his pants. \"You don\u0027t even know what you\u0027re doing to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Della Argento is dimly lit with a romantic ambience sponsored mostly by an arsenal of candles strewn about. A lush red carpet rolls throughout the walkways, and replicas of oil paintings from the Renaissance period cover the walls. A false lattice stretches across the ceiling and rows of grapes hang overhead like a canopy. Bodies fill the tables as if they were giving away free booze while a moody instrumental hums throughout the speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gorgeous blonde greets us with a pair of menus. Her hair is curled down to her waist, and her eyes sparkle a clear shade of green. One eyebrow is arched higher than the other, giving her that perennial vixen appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, hello handsome.\" She gives Cruise the exclusive greeting as she lunges her cleavage at him. \"Is it snowing outside?\" She offers a conciliatory glance in my direction. Her teeth shine like glass, so white against her perfect red lips. Just the sight of her turns my stomach. I\u0027m not sure I like the idea of her smiling so wide at my boyfriend, let alone calling him handsome, even if he is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. Perfect night.\" He glances over at me, and his dimples go off like sirens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe motions for us to follow her, but she keeps pace with Cruise, eyeing him every now and again even though he\u0027s openly holding my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I know you.\" She bites her finger playfully while inspecting him. \"That\u0027s right, you were in Osborne\u0027s class with me last year. I didn\u0027t fare so well.\" She stops shy of a table and lays our menus down. \"I could really use someone who knows what they\u0027re doing. You know, like a tutor.\" She brushes her hip against his in a not so accidental manner, and my heart sinks like a brick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruise steps out of the way like a perfect gentleman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck with that.\" He pulls me in and kisses the side of my cheek. I can feel the heat from his body envelop me like a cloud born of desire. I hope the bleached bimbo is physically and emotionally crushed from his outright disregard for her. But she\u0027s beautiful - far more in his league than I can ever be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe disappears, and we take our seats. I\u0027m sick over how blatantly she flirted with him. I\u0027ll probably arrange for her to take a terrible fall at some point this evening because my immature and bitchy nature demands it. I never said I was above stretching my legs at an opportune moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry about that.\" He picks up my hand and kisses it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t apologize.\" I take him in under the flicker of candlelight. I wouldn\u0027t blame every woman in the vicinity for wanting to get on their knees for him, beg him to tutor them - hell, I did. \"I guess it\u0027s an occupational hazard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. That budding lewd grin widens as he affixes his gaze over mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kenny\" - his eyes glaze over the way they do just before he pours out all of his lust for me - \"you\u0027re the only woman I see. I used to wonder if love existed. I thought I knew, but I had no idea. Before, I simply stepped off the ground, but with you - I\u0027m in the stratosphere. You leave me breathless.\" He needles me with a smoldering gaze, and I take off my coat, slow and seductive. I lean in and my chest bulges from the low-cut dress I specifically chose to entertain him with this evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe place our orders, and Cruise never once looks up at the menu-wielding menace. She crimps her lips with disappointment and stalks off while he openly molests me with those sky-born eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\" He jumps to his feet and takes up my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we going to steal kisses?\" I pant, trying to keep up as he moves us toward the back in haste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m going to fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruise\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blackened hall of the Della Argento stretches out seamlessly like a tunnel void of reality, nothing but a dark arid space. I pull Kenny into a private alcove laden with spare tables rolled onto their sides, the entry partially covered with curtains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so damn beautiful,\" I say before plunging my tongue down her throat, my hands running wild over her satin dress. The minute I set eyes on her tonight, she got me going. There was a second, back in the truck, when I thought of taking off, hell - taking off her clothes right then and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull down the top of her dress and close my mouth over her nipple, flicking my tongue around it gently until it\u0027s nice and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenny gasps and scratches at the back of my neck just enough to let me know it\u0027s driving her insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand slides up her dress and between her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark laugh rumbles from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not wearing underwear,\" I whisper, already out of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenny doesn\u0027t say a word. She simply unzips my pants, dips her hand into my boxers, and my dick extends like it\u0027s ready for a handshake, more than happy to greet her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenny\u0027s teeth shine in the dark. \"Number seven on the revised syllabus clearly stipulates a carnal act in a public establishment is required to pass your class.\" She offers a sarcastic sigh before lifting her dress and slipping me into her, hot and wet. A groan gets buried in my chest. \"And I do plan on passing your class, Professor Elton.\" Kenny hikes her legs around my waist, and I catch her by the thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenny runs her fingers through my hair, and I push in deep until she gives a small cry. She digs her nails into my back as I plunge in over and over with a primal ferocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a trans-species language reverberating between the two of us - one that resonates in a palace as easily as a zoo - and apparently the corridor of a hundred-dollar-a-plate restaurant as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re drinking down the juice of our lust, satisfying the hunger of our flesh as we engage in the power exchange of a lifetime. But I\u0027d give it all to Kenny willingly, kiss the ground she walks on just to be in her presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head dips back, and the arch of her neck rises and falls in front of me. I watch captivated as she glows, riding high, crashing over me like a wave. Our movements hit a fevered pitch. I bury a kiss in her cleavage and tremble into her as I detonate with all of my love. Her legs begin to slip, and I hoist her over my hips with a husky laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenny bites down a smile, her eyes clouded over with lust. I slip my fingers in the beautiful warm slick between her thighs, pleasuring Kenny until her breathing becomes labored - until her face ignites with ecstasy. Kenny writhes in my arms, and I welcome it - running my lips over the landscape of her features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cruise...\" She pants into my neck. \"You didn\u0027t wear a hat,\" she whimpers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give a little laugh and peel a heated kiss off her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so fucking cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the weekend, Kenny doesn\u0027t get out of bed. She spends time in the bathroom retching, and I seriously entertain the fact that maybe the waitress I shut down poisoned her food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly said she\u0027d handle things with Mom after I told her Kenny wasn\u0027t feeling well. It\u0027s kind of nice having both Mom and Molly know who Kenny is - to have seen her. All those girls that comprised my life before - it was as if they were phantoms - an entire invisible parade of entities that evaporated like smoke once I was through with them. It\u0027s horrific knowing there were so many, and the fact I don\u0027t remember most of them doesn\u0027t sit well with me either. Some nights there was enough alcohol in my system to ensure I forgot who I was in the process. And right now, I wish they wouldn\u0027t remember me. I wish every one of them would forget me and every intimate act I may have carried out with their bodies. That waitress had me rattled. For a split second, I wondered if I had her, if she were simply trying to come back for more. That\u0027s the unwanted gift I\u0027ve accidently given Kenny. Every girl she sees will be a possibility - someone who had slept with her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHusband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep trying it on for size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to ask Kenny to marry me. She\u0027ll probably want a long engagement - that is if she says yes. Maybe after she graduates we\u0027ll make it official. But I\u0027m okay with right now if she wanted. I\u0027d crawl down the aisle on all fours if she asked just to have her next to me until I\u0027m no longer breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenny bolts from the bathroom and flops on the bed. I slide up next to her, wrapping an arm around her waist. Her hair is tangled, and the sharp smell of mouthwash plumes in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the third time you threw up today.\" I run my fingers through her hair, soft as not to hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keeping score?\" She burrows her face in the pillow and moans like an injured dove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m keeping score. Three strikes - you\u0027re out. Come on.\" I pull her up and throw a coat over her shoulders. \"I\u0027m taking you to see a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only financial perk of being a student at Garrison is the fact they make sure your ass is covered with a solid-gold insurance policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe medical facility is stark in nature. A few people sit in the waiting area, each a good couple feet away from one another in an effort to avoid brewing a microcosm of germs in the unaired room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI help Kenny fill out a mountain of forms, then let her lay over me with her hair splayed out over my chest in long dark ribbons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cruise?\" She looks up at me with those watery baby blues and I wish with my entire being I could make this misery go away for her. \"Do you think you could ever hate me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hate you?\" I give a small laugh into her delirium, and she rides up and down my chest with the effort. \"Nope. Not happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just in case - don\u0027t freak out or anything.\" She nestles into me and sniffles. \"I\u0027m not the brightest bulb, you know. I\u0027m human.\" She says human like it\u0027s an unfortunate condition. \"I\u0027m prone to making huge mistakes - like really big ones.\" She sniffles again, and this time I\u0027m pretty sure she\u0027s crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides turn to stone when she says the words huge mistake. Am I the huge mistake? Maybe I\u0027m the one who\u0027s making her sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse calls us back and I help Kenny into the small room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to stay.\" She shakes her head a little too aggressively as her cheeks fill with color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax. I\u0027m not going anywhere. And you don\u0027t have to feel embarrassed. I\u0027ve participated in more public hurling sessions than I\u0027d like to remember.\" I stroke the hair away from her face and give a weak smile. \"You\u0027re family, Kenny. You couldn\u0027t get rid of me if you tried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Family?\" Her hand covers her lips. Her eyes explode in crimson tracks at the mention of such an intimate bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA light knock erupts at the door followed by a giant beast of a man with a neck the size of a tree trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" I mutter. His tag reads, Dr. Gaines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know they let the wrestling team play dress up,\" I say it light, but damn, I mean it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a wrestler.\" He gives a slight bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenny straightens. Her eyes widen at the sight of him. She\u0027s probably scared to death he\u0027s going to pin her to the ground. I bet she\u0027s really glad I decided to stick around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s going on?\" He looks over the chart briefly before inspecting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been sick, throwing up all weekend,\" I offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diarrhea?\" He asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenny averts her eyes and shakes her head. Not sure she would cop to it with me in the room. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noro\u0027s not going around,\" he muses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We ate the same thing for dinner the other night and I didn\u0027t get sick.\" I pull a bleak smile. \"Maybe you could run some tests, and see if she ate something she\u0027s allergic to - or something poisonous.\" I had to go there. I was thinking it for God\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lets out a graveled laugh. \"Let\u0027s start with a few more obvious suspects. We want to capture all the horses before we start chasing zebras. I\u0027ll have the nurse run a blood panel - probably just the flu. Kendall - is there anything you suspect might be making you ill?\" He gives a plain smile, his eyes dull out awaiting her response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she rasps. \"And I\u0027d like a pregnancy test to prove it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/someone-to-love-someone-to-love-1/page-16.html","bookId":1870,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:24 PM"}
