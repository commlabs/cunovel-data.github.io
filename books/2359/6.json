{"id":68077,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eThere were sixty women in Cell Block C, four to a cell. Faces peered out from behind bars as Tracy was marched down the long, smelly corridor, and the expressions varied from indifference to lust to hatred. She was walking underwater in some strange, unknown land, an alien in a slowly unfolding dream. Her throat was raw from the screaming inside her trapped body. The summons to the warden\u0027s office had been her last faint hope. Now there was nothing. Nothing except the mind-numbing prospect of being caged in this purgatory for the next fifteen years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matron opened a cell door. \"Inside!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy blinked and looked around. In the cell were three women, silently watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move,\" the matron ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy hesitated, then stepped into the cell. She heard the door slam behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cramped cell barely held four bunks, a little table with a cracked mirror over it, four small lockers, and a seatless toilet in the far corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell mates were staring at her. The Puerto Rican woman broke the silence. \"Looks like we got ourselves a new cellie.\" Her voice was deep and throaty. She would have been beautiful if it had not been for a livid knife scar that ran from her temple to her throat. She appeared to be no older than fourteen, until you looked into her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA squat, middle-aged Mexican woman said, \"\u0026amp;#1038;Que suerte verte! Nice to see you. What they got you in for, querida?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy was too paralyzed to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third woman was black. She was almost six feet tall, with narrow, watchful eyes and a cold, hard mask of a face. Her head was shaved and her skull shone blue-black in the dim light. \"Tha\u0027s your bunk over in the corner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy walked over to the bunk. The mattress was filthy, stained with the excreta of God only knew how many previous occupants. She could not bring herself to touch it. Involuntarily, she voiced her revulsion. \"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I can\u0027t sleep on this mattress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat Mexican woman grinned. \"You don\u0027 have to, honey. Hay tiempo. You can sleep on mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy suddenly became aware of the undercurrents in the cell, and they hit her with a physical force. The three women were watching her, staring, making her feel naked. Fresh meat. She was suddenly terrified. I\u0027m wrong, Tracy thought Oh, please let me be wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found her voice. \"Who\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;who do I see about getting a clean mattress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God,\" the black woman grunted. \"But he ain\u0027t been around here lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy turned to look at the mattress again. Several large black roaches were crawling across it. I can\u0027t stay in this place, Tracy thought. I\u0027ll go insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though reading her mind, the black woman told her, \"You go with the flow, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy heard the warden\u0027s voice: The best advice l can give you is to try to do easy time....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black woman continued. \"I\u0027m Ernestine Littlechap.\" She nodded toward the woman with the long scar. \"Tha\u0027s Lola. She\u0027s from Puerto Rico, and fatso here is Paulita, from Mexico. Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027m Tracy Whitney.\" She had almost said, \"I was Tracy Whitney.\" She had the nightmarish feeling that her identity was slipping away. A spasm of nausea swept through her, and she gripped the edge of the bunk to steady herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where you come from, honey?\" the fat woman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I don\u0027t feel like talking.\" She suddenly felt too weak to stand. She slumped down on the edge of the filthy bunk and wiped the beads of cold perspiration from her face with her skirt. My baby, she thought. I should have told the warden I\u0027m going to have a baby. He\u0027ll move me into a clean cell. Perhaps they\u0027ll even let me have a cell by myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard footsteps coming down the corridor. A matron was walking past the cell. Tracy hurried to the cell door. \"Excuse me,\" she said, \"I have to see the warden. I\u0027m\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll send him right down,\" the matron said over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand. I\u0027m\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matron was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy crammed her knuckles in her mouth to keep from screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sick or somethin\u0027, honey?\" the Puerto Rican asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy shook her head, unable to speak. She walked back to the bunk, looked at it a moment, then slowly lay down on it. It was an act of hopelessness, an act of surrender. She closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tenth birthday was the.most exciting day of her life. We\u0027re going to Antoine\u0027s for dinner, her father announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntoine\u0027s! It was a name that conjured up another world, a world of beauty and glamour and wealth. Tracy knew that her father did not have much money: We\u0027ll be able to afford a vacation next year, was the constant refrain in the house. And now they were going to Antoine\u0027s! Tracy\u0027s mother dressed her in a new green frock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust look at you two, her father boasted. I\u0027m with the two prettiest women in New Orleans. Everyone\u0027s going to be jealous of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntoine\u0027s was everything Tracy had dreamed it would be, and more. So much more. It was a fairyland, elegant and tastefully decorated, with white napery and gleaming silver-and-gold monogrammed dishes. It\u0027s a palace, Tracy thought. I\u0027ll bet kings and queens come here. She was too excited to eat, too busy staring at all the beautifully dressed men and women. When I\u0027m grown up, Tracy promised herself, I\u0027m going to come to Antoine\u0027s every night, and I\u0027ll bring my mother and father with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re not eating, Tracy, her mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to please her, Tracy forced herself to eat a few mouthfuls. There was a cake for her, with ten candles on it, and the waiters sang Happy Birthday and the other guests turned and applauded, and Tracy felt like a princess. Outside she could hear the clang of a streetcar bell as it passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clanging of the bell was loud and insistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppertime,\" Ernestine Littlechap announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy opened her eyes. Cell doors were slamming open throughout the cell block. Tracy lay on her bunk, trying desperately to hang on to the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Chow time,\" the young Puerto Rican said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of food sickened her. \"I\u0027m not hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaulita, the fat Mexican woman spoke. \"Es llano. It\u0027s simple. They don\u0027 care if you\u0027re hungry or not. Everybody gotta go to mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInmates were lining up in the corridor outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better move it, or they\u0027ll have your ass,\" Ernestine warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t move, Tracy thought. I\u0027ll stay here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell mates left the cell and lined up in a double file. A short, squat matron with peroxided-blond hair saw Tracy lying on her bunk. \"You!\" she said. \"Didn\u0027t you hear the bell? Get out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy said, \"I\u0027m not hungry, thank you. I\u0027d like to be excused.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matron\u0027s eyes widened in disbelief. She stormed inside the cell and strode over to where Tracy lay. \"Who the fuck do you think you are? You waitin\u0027 for room service? Get your ass in that line. I could put you on report for this: If it happens again, you go to the bing. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not understand. She did not understand anything that was happening to her. She dragged herself from the bunk and walked out into the line of women. She was standing next to the black woman. \"Why do I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Ernestine Littlechap growled out of the corner of her mouth. \"No talkin\u0027 in line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women were marched down a narrow, cheerless corridor past two sets of security doors, into an enormous mess hall filled with large wooden tables and chairs. There was a long serving counter with steam tables, where prisoners lined up for their food. The menu of the day consisted of a watery tuna casserole, limp green beans, a pale custard, and a choice of weak coffee or a synthetic fruit drink. Ladles of the unappetizing-looking food were thrown into the tin plates of the prisoners as they moved along the line, and the inmates who were serving behind the counter kept up a steady cry: \"Keep the line moving. Next... keep the line moving. Next...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tracy was served, she stood there uncertainly, not sure where to go. She looked around for Ernestine Littlechap, but the black woman had disappeared. Tracy walked over to a table where Lola and Paulita, the fat Mexican woman, were seated. There were twenty women at the table, hungrily wolfing down their food. Tracy looked down at what was on her plate, then pushed it away, as the bile rose and welled in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaulita reached over and grabbed the plate from Tracy. \"If you ain\u0027t gonna eat that, I\u0027ll take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLola said, \"Hey, you gotta eat, or you won\u0027t last here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to last, Tracy thought hopelessly. l want to die. How could these women tolerate living like this? How tong had they been here? Months? Years? She thought of the fetid cell and her verminous mattress, and she wanted to scream. She clenched her jaw shut so that no sound would come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mexican woman was saying, \"If they catch you not eatin\u0027, you go to the bing.\" She saw the uncomprehending look on Tracy\u0027s face. \"The hole\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;solitary. You wouldn\u0027t like it.\" She leaned forward. \"This is your first time in the joint, huh? Well, I\u0027m gonna give you a tip, querida. Ernestine Littlechap runs this place. Be nice to her an\u0027 you got it made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes from the time the women had entered the room, a loud bell sounded and the women stood up. Paulita snatched a lone green bean from a plate next to her. Tracy joined her in the line, and the women began the march back to their cells. Supper was over. It was four o\u0027clock in the afternoon\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;five long hours to endure before lights out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Tracy returned to the cell, Ernestine Littlechap was already there. Tracy wondered incuriously where she had bee at dinnertime. Tracy looked at the toilet in the corner. She desperately needed to use it, but she could not bring herself to do so in front of these women. She would wait until the lights went out. She sat down on the edge of her bunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnestine Littlechap said, \"I understan\u0027 you didn\u0027t eat none of your supper. Tha\u0027s stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she have known that? And why should she care? \"How do I see the warden?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You put in a written request. The guards use it for toilet paper. They figure any cunt who wants to see the warden is a troublemaker.\" She walked over to Tracy. \"There\u0027s lotsa things kin get you in trouble here. What you need is a friend who kin he\u0027p keep you outta trouble.\" She smiled, showing a gold front tooth. Her voice was soft. \"Someone who knows their way around the zoo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy looked up into the black woman\u0027s grinning face. It seemed to be floating somewhere near the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the tallest thing she had ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s a giraffe, her father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were at the zoo in Audubon Park. Tracy loved the park. On Sundays they went there to listen to the band concerts and afterward her mother and father took her to the aquarium or the zoo. They walked slowly, looking at the animals in the cages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t they hate being locked up, Papa?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father laughed. No. Tracy. They have a wonderful life They\u0027re taken care of and fed, and their enemies can\u0027t get them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked unhappy to Tracy. She wanted to open their cages and let them out. l wouldn\u0027t ever want to be locked up like that, Tracy thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 8:45 the warning bell rang throughout the prison. Tracy\u0027s cell mates began to undress. Tracy did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLola said, \"You got fifteen minutes to get ready for bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women had stripped and put.on nightgowns. The peroxided-blond matron passed the cell. She stopped when she saw Tracy lying on her cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get undressed,\" she ordered. She turned to Ernestine. \"Didn\u0027t you tell her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. We tol\u0027 her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matron turned back to Tracy. \"We got a way of takin\u0027 care of troublemakers,\" she warned. \"You do what you\u0027re told here, or I\u0027ll bust your ass.\" The matron moved down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaulita cautioned, \"You better listen to her, baby. Old Iron Pants is one mean bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, Tracy rose and began to undress, keeping her back to the others. She took off all her clothes, with the exception of her panties, and slipped the coarse nightgown over her head. She felt the eyes of the other women on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a real nice body,\" Paulita commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, real nice,\" Lola echoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy felt a shiver go through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnestine moved over to Tracy and looked down at her. \"We\u0027re your friends. We gonna take good care of you.\" Her voice was hoarse with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy wildly jerked around. \"Leave me alone! All of you. I\u0027m\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027m not that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black woman chuckled. \"You\u0027ll be any way we want you to be, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hay tiempo. There\u0027s plenty of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark was Tracy\u0027s enemy. She sat on the edge of her bunk, her body tense. She could sense the others waiting to pounce on her. Or was it her imagination? She was so overwrought that everything seemed to be a threat. Had they threatened her? Not really. They were probably just trying to be friendly, and she had read sinister implications into their overtures. She had heard about homosexual activity in prisons, but that had to be the exception rather than the rule. A prison would not permit that sort of behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, there was a nagging doubt. She decided she would stay awake all night. If one of them made a move, she would call for help. It was the responsibility of the guards to see that nothing happened to the inmates. She reassured herself that there was nothing to worry about. She would just have to stay alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy sat on the edge of her bunk in the dark, listening to every sound. One by one she heard the three women go to the toilet, use it, and return to their bunks. When Tracy could stand it no longer, she made her way to the toilet. She tried to flush it, but it did not work. The stench was almost unbearable. She hurried back to her cot and sat there. It will be light soon, she thought. In the morning I\u0027ll ask to see the warden. I\u0027ll tell him about the baby. He\u0027ll have me moved to another cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy\u0027s body was tense and cramped. She lay back on her bunk and within seconds felt something crawling across her neck. She stifled a scream. I\u0027ve got to stand it until morning. Everything will be all right in the morning, Tracy thought. One minute at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 3:00 she could no longer keep her eyes open. She slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was awakened by a hand clamped across her mouth and two hands grabbing at her breasts. She tried to sit up and scream, and she felt her nightgown and underpants being ripped away. Hands slid between her thighs, forcing her legs apart. Tracy fought savagely, struggling to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy,\" a voice in the dark whispered, \"and you won\u0027t get hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy lashed out at the voice with her feet. She connected with solid flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carajo! Give it to the bitch,\" the voice gasped. \"Get her on the floor!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hard fist smashed into Tracy\u0027s face and another into her stomach. Someone was on top of her, holding her down, smothering her, while obscene hands violated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy broke loose for an instant, but one of the women grabbed her and slammed her head against the bars. She felt the blood spurt from her nose. She was thrown to the concrete floor, and her hands and legs were pinned down. Tracy fought like a madwoman, but she was no match for the three of them. She felt cold hands and hot tongues caressing her body. Her legs were spread apart and a hard, cold object was shoved inside her. She writhed helplessly, desperately trying to call out. An arm moved across her mouth, and Tracy sank her teeth into it, biting down with all her strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a muffled cry. \"You cunt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFists pounded her face.... She sank into the pain, deeper and deeper, until finally she felt nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the clanging of the bell that awakened her. She was lying on the cold cement floor of her cell, naked. Her three cell mates were in their bunks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the corridor, Iron Pants was calling out, \"Rise and shine.\" As the matron passed the cell, she saw Tracy lying on the floor in a small pool of blood, her face battered and one eye swollen shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell\u0027s goin\u0027 on here?\" She unlocked the door and stepped inside the cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She musta fell outta her bunk,\" Ernestine Littlechap offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matron walked over to Tracy\u0027s side and nudged her with her foot. \"You! Get up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy heard the voice from a far distance. Yes, she thought, I must get up; I must get out of here. But she was unable to move. Her body was screaming out with pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matron grabbed Tracy\u0027s elbows and pulled her to a sitting position, and Tracy almost fainted from the agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough one eye Tracy saw the blurred outlines of her cell mates silently waiting for her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \" Tracy tried to speak, but no words would come out. She tried again, and some deep-seated atavistic instinct made her say, \"I fell off my bunk....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matron snapped, \"I hate smart asses. Let\u0027s put you in the bing till you learn some respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a form of oblivion, a return to the womb. She was alone in the dark. There was no furniture in the cramped basement cell, only a thin, worn mattress thrown on the cold cement floor. A noisome hole in the floor served as a toilet. Tracy lay there in the blackness, humming folk songs to herself that her father had taught her long ago. She had no idea how close she was to the edge of insanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was not sure where she was, but it did not matter. Only the suffering of her brutalized body mattered. I must have fallen down and hurt myself, but Mama will take care of it. She called out in a broken voice, \"Mama...,\" and when there was no answer, she fell asleep again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slept for forty-eight hours, and the agony finally receded to pain, and the pain gave way to soreness. Tracy opened her eyes. She was surrounded by nothingness. It was so dark that she could not even make out the outline of the cell. Memories came flooding back. They had carried her to the doctor. She could hear his voice: \"...a broken rib and a fractured wrist. We\u0027ll tape them up.... The cuts and bruises are bad, but they\u0027ll heal. She\u0027s lost the baby....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my baby,\" Tracy whispered. \"They\u0027ve murdered my baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she wept. She wept for the loss of her baby. She wept for herself. She wept for the whole sick world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracy lay on the thin mattress in the cold darkness, and she was filled with such an overpowering hatred that it literally shook her body. Her thoughts burned and blazed until her mind was empty of every emotion but one: vengeance. It was not a vengeance directed against her three cell mates. They were victims as much as she. No; she was after the men who had done this to her, who had destroyed her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe Romano: \"Your old lady held out on me. She didn\u0027t tell me she had a horny-looking daughter....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony Orsatti: \"Joe Romano works for a man named Anthony Orsatti. Orsatti runs New Orleans....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry Pope: \"By pleading guilty; you save the state the expense of a trial....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudge Henry Lawrence: \"For the next fifteen years you\u0027re going to be incarcerated in the Southern Louisiana Penitentiary for Women....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were her enemies. And then there was Charles, who had never even listened to her: \"If you needed money that badly, you could have discussed it with me.... Obviously I never really knew you.... You\u0027ll have to do whatever you think best with your baby....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to make them pay. Every one of them. She had no idea how. But she knew she was going to get revenge. Tomorrow, she thought.
