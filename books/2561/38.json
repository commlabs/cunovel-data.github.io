The familiar icy blue slowly became tinged with purples and pinks. The atmosphere gradually thinned. By midday on the third day thousands of stars were visible. As the day wore on the sun too changed colour from deep orange to light yellow, to white and finally monochrome grey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next three days the tide went further and further out until the water had completely disappeared. Where once there had been cold ocean there was now nothing - just a vast and silent tundra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe temperature increased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air became drier and started to taste and smell different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the sixth day every alien ship drifted upwards into the sky and hovered silently at an unimaginable height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the eighth day Tom left the rocks in search of food. He ran across the dry sea bed from the island to the shore. Tired and weak, his fear kept him moving forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I was running I was fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nervousness, the trepidation and apprehension all disappeared in seconds. I just kept putting one foot down in front of the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that they were watching me but I didn\u0027t care and I knew that they didn\u0027t care either. I was of no interest to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran back towards Thatcham but I couldn\u0027t find it. The whole village had just disappeared, as had every road, building, animal, car, tree and person. In its place I found an unending blue-green blanket of what looked like grass. It was finer though, and shorter - almost a moss of sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was there for just over an hour but I couldn\u0027t find anything to eat or drink. I knew it was pointless to keep searching and so turned to head back to Clare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped for a while when I was up high on the hills again. I looked down over where the ocean had once been and watched the moss which had covered the land slowly spreading out over the drying seabed. It was moving as I watched - creeping out towards Clare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rested for a minute or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up above me I could see thousands of alien ships just sitting and waiting. I didn\u0027t dare think about what they might be waiting for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran back to Clare and sat with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe held each other and talked about all that had happened and all that had gone. She went to sleep that afternoon and didn\u0027t wake up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what they had done to the rest of the human race, they hadn\u0027t beaten me. I hadn\u0027t fallen in line with their program. I had kept control. I knew that it wouldn\u0027t be long before I died, but I would die knowing who I was and why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor another seven hours Thomas Winter was the last man alive. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-38.html","bookId":2561,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:57:51 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:57:51 AM"}
