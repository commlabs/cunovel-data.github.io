Her embarrassment intensified, of course, and she desperately tried to think of a way to turn their attention away from her eating habits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them was ready to change the topic, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it a fine, spring evening?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you eat more when you\u0027re nervous?\" Quinlan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat an odd question. \"No,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rude men all laughed again. She waited for them to quiet down before once again trying to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connor, will you introduce me to your soldiers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll introduce themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe already knew Owen and Quinlan by name, of course, and when she looked at the other three warriors, they each told her their names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAeden was the thinnest of the group, though he still wouldn\u0027t be considered puny by an Englishman\u0027s measure, she supposed, and Donald was the name of the soldier with the big brown eyes that reminded her of a doe\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiric was the shy one in the group. He could barely look directly at her when he told her his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a pleasure to meet all of you,\" she announced once they\u0027d finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask you a question, mi\u0027lady?\" Quinlan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you first saw us, you were afraid. Some of us were wondering why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you think we were going to harm you?\" Aeden asked. He added a smile, indicating he found the possibility amusing. \"You were praying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I was praying, and yes, I did believe you were going to harm me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But after, mi\u0027lady,\" Owen said. \"After you knew we meant you no harm, weren\u0027t you still afraid? I wondered why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHadn\u0027t any of them ever looked in a mirror? Or did they have such luxuries where they lived?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided it would be unkind to point out how peculiar they looked, and so she simply shrugged and didn\u0027t say anything at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them wanted to let it go. \"Was it our war paint that put you on your guard?\" Owen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t care to answer, for I have no wish to hurt your feelings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, her honesty made the men laugh again. She decided to be a bit more blunt then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"However, I will admit it was your war paint that put me on my guard. Yes, it was,\" she emphasized with a nod. \"And your size, and your dress, and your manners, and your intimidating frowns, and the way my father\u0027s twelve soldiers cowered to the five of you… Shall I go on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could tell they\u0027d taken her comments as compliments. She really should set them straight, she thought, and explain she hadn\u0027t been at all impressed with them—no proper English lady in her right mind would be—but then a fresh worry popped into her head, and she immediately looked at Connor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not wearing war paint. You might as well understand that fact right this minute. It\u0027s barbaric, Connor, and you cannot expect me to…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men\u0027s laughter stopped her protest. Connor didn\u0027t laugh, of course; the man never laughed as far as she could tell, but he did smile. Her heart noticed by pounding a quick beat. He had beautiful white teeth, all of them did, and she wondered how they could put such ugly paint on their skin and take such good care of their teeth at the same time. They really were a peculiar lot, all right. Would she ever be able to understand them or find her place among them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Women aren\u0027t given the honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what he was talking about. \"What honor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paint,\" he explained. \"The tradition belongs to warriors alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor didn\u0027t look as though he was jesting, and so she didn\u0027t dare laugh. The effort cost her, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer throat ached considerably from the strain of being polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you never seen a Highlander before, mi\u0027lady? Do you know anything at all about us?\" Giric asked in a whisper. He was blushing to the roots of his freckles and, in his shyness, had directed his question to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was younger, I thought I knew all about you. I even knew where you lived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you think we lived?\" Donald asked, smiling over the sparkle he\u0027d noticed in his mistress\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Under my bed. You came out only at night, while I was sleeping. I\u0027d always wake up screaming, of course, and run like lightning to my parents\u0027 chamber.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe expected the men to laugh over her jest, or at the very least, smile a little. Unfortunately, none of them seemed to understand she was teasing them. Three of them looked confused; the other two looked appalled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you just insult us?\" Owen asked. He sounded as though he couldn\u0027t believe such an atrocity was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I was jesting. For heaven\u0027s sake, couldn\u0027t you tell the difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all shook their heads. Quinlan had the most difficulty hiding his smile. \"It seems your bride has been dreaming about you for years, Laird,\" he drawled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would seem so,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t even try to hide her exasperation. The effort to have a decent conversation with them was making her head throb, and being polite was a wasted undertaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave up trying. \"Connor, may I be excused?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bowed her head to the men and walked away. She had already headed for the lake with her hairbrush, fresh clothing, and her blanket in her arms before Connor got around to giving her permission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached the break in the pines, stopped, and then glanced back over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinlan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, mi\u0027lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They weren\u0027t dreams. They were nightmares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t laugh until she was well out of sight, but the sound of their amusement was loud enough to reach the other side of the lake. She didn\u0027t believe the soldiers had finally gotten her jest, though; they appeared to be too slow-witted for that. She assumed Connor had made an atrocious remark about something his men would find humorous, like murder and mayhem. They all seemed to have a twisted sense of humor. She\u0027d come to her opinion when she saw them smiling like heathens after Connor had told them they could kill the English soldiers. And hadn\u0027t they pouted like boys when the order was rescinded?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna was immediately nagged by guilt. She knew she shouldn\u0027t continue to judge Connor so harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he help it if he was a barbarian or that he had been raised like a wild animal? No, no, of course he couldn\u0027t. Besides, he was her husband now. She was going to be stuck with him for the rest of her life, and shouldn\u0027t she at least try to like him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he expect to take her to his bed tonight? She tried to block the frightening possibility as soon as it entered her mind. That was easier said than done, however; Lord help her, she couldn\u0027t even think about Connor touching her without shaking in panic. She knew her reaction wasn\u0027t at all reasonable. She was a grown woman now, not a child, and, therefore, understood what was expected of her. Her mother had patiently explained that all husbands wanted to bed their wives as soon as the wedding festivities ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t given her daughter any specifics though, and while Brenna understood the basics, or at least believed she did, she\u0027d still been left guessing about the finer points. It all sounded horribly awkward and messy to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna wouldn\u0027t worry about it. If Connor decided to bed her, perhaps God would take pity on her and let her sleep through the ordeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled over this fanciful notion while she stripped out of her clothes. She ran into the water before she could change her mind, gritted her teeth against the chill, and hurriedly washed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she was getting out, she heard someone approach. She moved back into the water, until she was covered to her chin, and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute or so later, Connor appeared. A plaid was draped over his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s time to get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have privacy when I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t believe he needed to ask. \"Because I require it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to freeze to death. Come out. Now.\" His hard command didn\u0027t leave room for argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not get out. I\u0027m not wearing anything. I really must have privacy now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pretended not to notice she\u0027d shouted at him. \"No one\u0027s here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re here, and you\u0027re standing right in the moonlight. I cannot come out until you leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis bride had dared to shout at him again. He shook his head over her audacity. \"Don\u0027t raise your voice to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded as though he\u0027d run out of patience. She reminded herself she\u0027d vowed to get along and thought that perhaps if she gave him what he wanted, he would naturally reciprocate in kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips were getting numb from the frigid water and her teeth were chattering so, she could barely speak at all now. \"All right then. I won\u0027t shout. Will you please leave now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer husband obviously didn\u0027t understand how to reciprocate. She\u0027d have to explain it all to him later, but not now. Her skin was wrinkling like old prunes, and if she didn\u0027t get out soon, she really would freeze to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePride was killing her. \"I cannot possibly get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Are you embarrassed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded surprised by the possibility. She closed her eyes, said a fast prayer for endurance, then answered, \"Of course I\u0027m embarrassed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shyness has no place between us. Do you want me to come in after you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drown you if you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ridiculous threat made him smile. \"Will it help if I take my clothes off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t realize he was teasing her, and honest to God, if she shouted at him once more, he thought he just might go in and get her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Connor, will you at least turn your back while I get dressed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sigh was strong enough to push her under the water. \"You\u0027re being very foolish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t mind his criticism. She got what she wanted, after all. He finally turned around. She hurried up the bank and dried herself with all possible haste. Fearing there wouldn\u0027t be enough time before her impatient husband turned around, she didn\u0027t bother putting on her chemise but slipped the white cotton gown over her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePink ribbons secured the thin undergown from the bottom of her waist to the top of her chin. Her fingers felt as though they were being pricked by a thousand sharp pins now, making the task terribly awkward, and try as she did, she couldn\u0027t get the delicate ribbons properly tied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave up on the task for the moment. The heavy tunic she planned to put over the undergown would sufficiently cover her bare chest. The problem was getting to the thing. She\u0027d draped the garment on a low-hanging branch so it wouldn\u0027t get dirty, but she\u0027d have to walk around Connor to get to it. She wasn\u0027t about to let him see her in such an indecent state and was forced to ask him to please hand it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned around instead. She started backing away from him, thinking only to put a little distance between them, but then she felt herself slipping on the wet slope. She would have fallen flat on her face or plunged back into the water, but Connor saved her from disgracing herself by pulling her back to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he hadn\u0027t looked so disgruntled, she would have thanked him for his assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled her gown tight over her br**sts and frowned with disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to understand you have nothing to fear from me. My duty is to take care of you, not harm you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t fear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just backed away from me,\" he reminded her dryly. \"You were obviously frightened a minute ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. The ribbon holding her hair up in a lopsided knot near the top of her crown flew into the water, and the thick mass of curls dropped down around her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at her in such a disheveled state gave him a sudden rush of pleasure. She was the most provocative creature he\u0027d ever met. A man could get lost in the magic of those big blue eyes of hers and forget all about his duties while he paused to admire the sensual grace in the way she moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell was wrong with him? Brenna wasn\u0027t casting a spell on him, yet he was acting as though she were. He quickly became irritated. He wasn\u0027t about to let her rob him of his discipline, and damn, but she was a bother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a temptress. All he wanted to think about was kissing her frown away and making hard, hot love to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would probably die of fright if she had any idea of his thoughts. She couldn\u0027t possibly know how alluring she was, or how his body was reacting to her near nakedness. She wouldn\u0027t be frowning up at him with such indignation if she realized how close she was to being tossed onto the nearest blanket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop shaking your head at me,\" he ordered in a gruff voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was merely letting you know, most emphatically, that I wasn\u0027t frightened. It\u0027s just that I didn\u0027t expect you to turn around, and I was surprised. Your manners do give me grave concerns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. Her eyes widened in disbelief. \"Manners aren\u0027t important to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? But you should think they\u0027re important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she repeated. Her mind went blank. Heaven help her, she couldn\u0027t come up with a single reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way Connor was looking at her, with such warmth and tenderness in his eyes, made her forget even what they\u0027d been talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a step closer to him. \"You are a very confusing man,\" she whispered. \"But if I am to keep my sanity, I guess I\u0027ll have to try to understand you. You\u0027d better be worth the bother, Connor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost as an afterthought, she said, \"You may let go of me now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t feel like letting go of her, and because he was accustomed to doing exactly what he wanted to do, he ignored her wishes. Her soft skin, as smooth as an angel\u0027s and the color of pale gold in the moonlight, felt good against his rough, callused hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had this treasure eluded other men?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you ever been courted by other men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was betrothed to a baron, but he died before I was old enough to marry him. I never actually met the man, or many others for that matter. Father wouldn\u0027t allow any men around his daughters, especially Rachel,\" she explained. \"She\u0027s the pretty one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did the baron to whom you were pledged die in battle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He died in bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was tragic,\" she snapped. \"Not amusing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only an Englishman would die in his bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought his opinion too ignorant to argue about. \"Will you stop squeezing my arms now?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-10.html","bookId":1845,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:46 PM"}
