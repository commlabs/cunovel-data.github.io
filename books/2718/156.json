So I go on in the house. Walk upstairs. It smells sweet. There’s lily of the valley in a jar on the dresser. And the window looks out on the ocean, where the sun and its shadow hang low in the sky. The bed’s been turned down, and I realize I’m really tired. But a good tired, like I’ve spent all day at the beach. The sheets are cool and welcoming as I slip in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s like everything is slowing down inside me. Beep. Beep. Whirr. Whirr. The ceiling. White like the moon.

Glory steps over to the respirator and flicks a switch. She turns off the EKG and the heart monitor, too, flipping switches till the room is perfectly quiet. I’m sort of floating here. It’s not bad.

The room gets darker, and I feel like I’m being pulled toward something I can’t see. Things streak past me. Stars. Gases. Satellites. Whole planets wobble and careen away. Universes, too. It makes me feel vast and impossibly small at the same time. Connected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust before the room falls completely away, Glory puts a hand over my eyes and just like that, the world disappears. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/going-bovine/page-156.html","bookId":2718,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:41 PM"}
