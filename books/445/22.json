{"id":24382,"no":22,"title":"XX. CHILD AND MARRIAGE.","content":"I have a question for thee alone, my brother: like a sounding-lead, cast I this question into thy soul, that I may know its depth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thou art young, and desirest child and marriage. But I ask thee: Art thou a man ENTITLED to desire a child?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Art thou the victorious one, the self-conqueror, the ruler of thy passions, the master of thy virtues? Thus do I ask thee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Or doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity? Or isolation? Or discord in thee?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I would have thy victory and freedom long for a child. Living monuments shalt thou build to thy victory and emancipation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Beyond thyself shalt thou build. But first of all must thou be built thyself, rectangular in body and soul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not only onward shalt thou propagate thyself, but upward! For that purpose may the garden of marriage help thee!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A higher body shalt thou create, a first movement, a spontaneously rolling wheel—a creating one shalt thou create.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marriage: so call I the will of the twain to create the one that is more than those who created it. The reverence for one another, as those exercising such a will, call I marriage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Let this be the significance and the truth of thy marriage. But that which the many-too-many call marriage, those superfluous ones—ah, what shall I call it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ah, the poverty of soul in the twain! Ah, the filth of soul in the twain! Ah, the pitiable self-complacency in the twain!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Marriage they call it all; and they say their marriages are made in heaven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, I do not like it, that heaven of the superfluous! No, I do not like them, those animals tangled in the heavenly toils!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Far from me also be the God who limpeth thither to bless what he hath not matched!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Laugh not at such marriages! What child hath not had reason to weep over its parents?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Worthy did this man seem, and ripe for the meaning of the earth: but when I saw his wife, the earth seemed to me a home for madcaps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yea, I would that the earth shook with convulsions when a saint and a goose mate with one another.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This one went forth in quest of truth as a hero, and at last got for himself a small decked-up lie: his marriage he calleth it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That one was reserved in intercourse and chose choicely. But one time he spoilt his company for all time: his marriage he calleth it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Another sought a handmaid with the virtues of an angel. But all at once he became the handmaid of a woman, and now would he need also to become an angel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Careful, have I found all buyers, and all of them have astute eyes. But even the astutest of them buyeth his wife in a sack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Many short follies—that is called love by you. And your marriage putteth an end to many short follies, with one long stupidity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Your love to woman, and woman’s love to man—ah, would that it were sympathy for suffering and veiled deities! But generally two animals alight on one another.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But even your best love is only an enraptured simile and a painful ardour. It is a torch to light you to loftier paths.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Beyond yourselves shall ye love some day! Then LEARN first of all to love. And on that account ye had to drink the bitter cup of your love.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bitterness is in the cup even of the best love: thus doth it cause longing for the Superman; thus doth it cause thirst in thee, the creating one!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thirst in the creating one, arrow and longing for the Superman: tell me, my brother, is this thy will to marriage?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Holy call I such a will, and such a marriage.—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61034.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
