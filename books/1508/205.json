Not only that, Lin Ming’s cultivation was also low, so the blood in him hadn’t fully awoken. Therefore, a common Thunder Lizard was unable to feel it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut this peak Houtian realm Thunder Lizard was powerful, so it’s bloodline was much purer.

Everything about her was outstanding. She wore a flame-red coat, and she had a flowing scarlet dress wrapped around her. Her soft, ink black hair hung down to her waist, and both her feet were bare. Her fair, jade-like feet were standing on an azure platform of 10,000 year frost ice. She was like a vibrant red rose that grew out of the snow. The crimson red and snow white contrast reflected a glamorous and majestic beauty.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd in front of that woman, there was a scarlet crested bird. It seemed to have a blood red crown, and its feathers were red like living flames. Its long tail dragged against the ground, burning the floor wherever it passed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThat is… the Vermillion Bird!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s eyes widened.

One human and one bird, with the same flame coloration, standing above the vast white fields of 10,000 year ice; it was just like a blazing inferno, beautiful and sublime to the point where it seemed unreal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Interesting.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe woman looked at Lin Ming for a good while, and then suddenly, she smiled gently.

Feeling this strikingly hot air, Lin Ming already felt his back seep with a cold sweat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“So… the Vermillion Bird I saw in Blackwater Swamp is this woman’s mount… perhaps that Vermillion Bird \u0026nbsp;was already carrying that woman, and she saw the scene where I was being hunted by the little flame boy.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Why would she come to Thundercrash Mountain?

Since he had come this far, he might as well attempt to go further. Even if the Thunder Soul wasn’t for him, that didn’t mean there weren’t any other lucky chances. The summit of Thundercrash Mountain had already shined with endless thunder for 10,000 years. Who knew what sort of valuable materials were born there? If the opportunity was good, he might find some surprises.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had just taken a few steps forwards, when the sky suddenly resounded with the decisive sharp sound of a bird, directly reaching into the Primal Chaos Heavens!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was…Phoenix Cry?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithout having a chance to reflect on what had just happened, Lin Ming heard the thunderous sound of a beast roar one after another! For a time, it was like he was in the midst of a massive thunderstorm; absolutely deafening!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What… what the hell?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming felt a little muddled. At this moment, he heard the sound of a rumbling vibration spread through the ground. It was like the countless roaring and thunderous beats of a drum. He could even feel the ground shaking, as if a massive stampede of monsters was rushing out!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming withdrew the Heavy Profound Soft Spear. In the distance, he saw a the deep Blue Thunder Lizard menacingly rush towards him. Because of the speed at which it was going, clouds of snow curled around it like a snow dragon, billowing into the sky!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That’s the peak Houtian realm Thunder Lizard powerhouse I just saw earlier!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s pupils contracted.

The Blue Thunder Lizard blew past Lin Ming in a rolling cloud of smoke and snow as it blew through, having no intention to pause.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming found that this Thunder Lizard hadn’t come to deal with him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut if not him, had it come for that woman in red from a moment ago? Remembering the scene from before and that resonant Phoenix Cry that had sounded once, Lin Ming tensed up.

Lin Ming had excellent eyesight. Even though it was a far distance, he was still able to see that the Thunder Lizard was very dark blue. From the deep color of its scales, its strength was no less than a peak Houtian realm martial artist!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Peak Houtian realm… I fear that anything below that rank doesn’t have the qualifications to participate in this war… Also, that woman in red was at least a Xiantian powerhouse.

He used his movement technique and directly sped towards the summit at full speed. Because all of the strong Thunder Lizards had rushed towards the summit, Lin Ming was able to travel up unimpeded.
