Dr. Luther prepared something in a hypodermic syringe, while Dr. Minton strapped his former patient onto a padded examining table. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Doctor ...\" Ron whispered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hush, Ron. It\u0027s all right....\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But what is all this? Who am I?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The doctor frowned. \"You\u0027re Ronald Carver. You\u0027re the same Ronald Carver you always were. But you have made an exchange of bodies. That is all.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But why? How?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t really know. God help us. It was his project from start to finish—that thing upstairs.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Who is he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A phenomenon. A mutation. A freak. A genius. A god. I can\u0027t explain him. He was born twelve years ago, to normal parents in the middle west. He was a recognized prodigy at the age of six months, a mathematical wizard at one, a scientific genius at three.... You\u0027ve heard of this kind of thing, Ron. Once a generation, something like this. And once a millenium—a horror like this one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t understand! What is Project Scholar?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He is. All by himself. The government has taken charge of his abilities, at least for the time being.\" He snorted. \"He\u0027s already done things I wouldn\u0027t have believed possible in five thousand years of evolution. And yet he is still only twelve years old....\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Only twelve?\" Ron squirmed in the straps. \"Doctor! This body—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, Ron. It\u0027s his, of course. He grew angry with it; wanted to discard it, like everything else which doesn\u0027t fit his conception of the fitness of things. It was awkward—a giant\u0027s brain in a child\u0027s body. So he developed a solution—an operation, involving the total transference of electrical energy....\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The doctor\u0027s shaggy head bowed. \"He needed human help for that. That\u0027s when I was brought in as assistant. And it was my function to select the perfect body as a temporary house for his ego....\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Temporary?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When this body ages and grows feeble, there will be another. Our friend has outwitted Death itself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The doctor looked up, his jaw firm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I was instructed to destroy his body when the transference was completed. I couldn\u0027t do it, Ron. I managed to spirit you away where you would be cared for. It was almost a year before you came to your senses after the operation. By that time, I didn\u0027t know what to do with you. My first thought was the Roverwood Home, where I am a director, where you would be lost among many, many boys\u0027 faces....\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But why me, doctor? Why me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I had to choose someone, Ron. It was merely a question of who....\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dr. Luther entered, priming the needle.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ready?\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"One moment.\" The doctor\u0027s hand covered Ron\u0027s mouth, and he felt the contours of a small round pill against his lips. He realized he was meant to swallow it, and he did.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ready now,\" Dr. Minton said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dr. Luther performed the injection.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good night, sweet prince,\" he said gently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3272/89522.html","bookId":513,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:53:08 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:53:08 AM"}
