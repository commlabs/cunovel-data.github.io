Not really. I wanted to sit down, maybe lie down, or stand up, maybe throw up. What I did was drag Cassandra away from the Favreaus\u0027 and back to her place. Luckily, it wasn\u0027t a long trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside the cool, shadowed interior, I sat at her kitchen table and put my head between my knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t faint on me,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I donor faint.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re doing a damn good imitation.\" She sat, too. \"The wolf at the window?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly I lifted my head and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d told her my dream, that I\u0027d seen a wolf with human eyes, but I hadn\u0027t mentioned whose eyes they were. From the expression on her face, she already knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you saw the wolf, where was Adam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In bed with me.\" I took a deep breath, let it out slowly. \"Must have been a dream after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or a premonition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have premonitions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra went silent. Still a little woozy, I was having a hard time assimilating the information, having no luck at all interpreting it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You dreamed of a wolf with human eyes before we knew that werewolves have them.\" She glanced in my direction. \"Human eyes, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably just a coincidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A coincidence is running into someone right after you thought about them. What you described to me is not a coincidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No clue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn, you\u0027re helpful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t rise to the bait. Why I was baiting her, I wasn\u0027t sure. Right now, she was the only friend I had, the only person I trusted. I tried to make amends by making excuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I read something about werewolves in the past and my subconscious remembered. I read a lot of bizzaro stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband never mentioned it, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra cast me a sharp glance. \"He saw one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut on the moors, D-baby. A man became a wolf and then ran beneath the full moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking he didn\u0027t get close enough to see the eyes.\" Until that last night anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s one thing that bugs me,\" Cassandra murmured\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrilled to leave the memory of Simon and his death behind, I jumped on the comment \"Just one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t bother to acknowledge my attempt at levity. \"Why is it a wolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe I should ask, how is it a wolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassandra, what are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marie Favreau said wolves make wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we can believe her.

Could we get back to the topic at hand, which I\u0027m still not clear on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If it takes a wolf to make a wolf, where did the first wolf come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a riddle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra ignored me again. She was getting very good at it \"No wolves in Louisiana. That\u0027s what got you here in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were wolves once. Red wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a red wolf?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Too big, too black, too timber wolfy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which brings us back to the curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to you,\" I murmured, \"man became beast with no biting involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why a wolf? Why not an alligator, or a snake, or a leopard for that matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a bad feeling. Without asking permission, I headed for Cassandra\u0027s office, started clicking away on her computer before she even got there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking, Diana?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Names have power,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later I saw how much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Ruelle,\u0027\" I read.\" \u0027French for \"famous wolf.\"\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra drew in a quick, sharp breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why the curse created a wolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know for sure - \" she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not\" I stood and started for the door. \"But I plan to find out\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder he\u0027d said there wasn\u0027t a loup-garou.

As I stepped through the beads hanging in the doorway, she slapped her knife into my palm. \"Silver, through and through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of shoving a knife into Adam -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, Diana, if he grows fangs and a tail, you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if he doesn\u0027t?\" I glanced at the window. \"It\u0027s daytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touch him with the thing. See if he smokes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrific,\" I muttered. \"He\u0027s going to think I\u0027m insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. If this is insane, then he isn\u0027t the loup-garou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we had a whole new set of problems. Because if Adam wasn\u0027t, who was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra bit her lip. \"Maybe I should go, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he can kill both of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He isn\u0027t going to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he wanted you dead, you\u0027d be dead already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could take Detective Sullivan along.
