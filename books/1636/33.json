It almost looked as if they were guarding this dome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt steeled himself, resisting the urge to shoot such a close target. What good would it have done? He couldn\u0027t penetrate those shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt vibrations, and in the distance lights flickered along the rim of the crater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bulbous hull of a Covenant Seraph single ship appeared, then another Seraph appeared, then seven more… and then two dozen flying in formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt held his breath, hoping this was just a search party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA line of Covenant destroyers followed, so massive they blotted out the stars in the night sky. A second wave of cetacean-shaped vessels resolved, and then a Covenant carrier flew on overwatch, surrounded by a hundred Seraph fighters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt had never seen so many enemy ships so close—all of them headed toward his position. Twenty warships. The subsonic thrum of their antigrav units made his insides go soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sentinels circling the dome moved to intercept the new threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePinpoint laser artillery shot them out of the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two leading destroyers peeled off the battle group and drifted over the dome. Shafts of sparkling purple light flashed from their undersides—antigrav transporter beams. A hundred armored Elite shock troopers streamed to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt looked for Dante and spotted him high on the dome\u0027s inner surface attached with a rigging of rope and suction climbers. He pressed blobs of C-12 onto the patterned stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt directed his single beam at the COM relay on the landing pad. \"Will, what\u0027s Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalsey\u0027s status?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s found something,\" Will replied. \"Says she needs ten minutes to get it ready\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get what ready? Never mind. We don\u0027t have ten minutes,\" Kurt told him. \"Prepare for a hot reception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt watched Covenant assets pour down the transport beams and assemble in the city: more Elites with plasma rifles, titanlike Hunter pairs wielding fuel-rod cannons and nearly impenetrable shields, plasma turrets and their Grunt tenders, and a monstrous Scarab walker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpirit and Phantom dropships escorted by Banshee fliers buzzed the dome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an invading army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt motioned his Spartans down the lines to the landing pad. They had to fall back— fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teams silently slid to safety. After all had gone down their rope, Kurt followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue plasma splashed across the archway ledges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt loosened his grip on the rope and free-fell a dozen meters, squeezing the brake at the last instant before he hit the floor. He rolled and dove behind the starboard hull of their ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLasers stitched the stone platform behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix dropships and their Banshee escorts entered through the archways. They circled, rapidly descending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred and Lucy crouched, hefted SPNKr missile launchers, and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe missiles streaked up and detonated on the cockpits of the incoming dropships. The ships hobbled out of control and crashed into the dome wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other four dropships landed hard; Elites jumped out, took position behind the hulls, and opened fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air filled with crisscross patterns of needier shards, plasma bolts, and streaks of MA5B and MASK tracers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt didn\u0027t want to leave the FENRIS warheads behind, but there was no way they could hold this position. Their cover was poor, and they\u0027d have to contend with more air support soon. He started to order their retreat, but Covenant plasma spattered nearby, and a square meter of their dropship\u0027s hull blasted away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Hunter pair emerged and they hunkered down behind their overlapping battle-plate shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda took aim at the monstrous pair and waited for them to present a target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne Hunter eased its fuel-rod cannon around the edge of its impenetrable shields— green energized rounds glowing with deadly radiation—and fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred jumped from cover, his MJOLNIR armor ablaze as if it was burning phosphorus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunter hit him dead center in his chest, a blast that would have destroyed their dropship. His energy shields flared brighter, failed, and Fred crumpled to the floor, his armor smoking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cover fire!\" Kurt shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans sprayed the Elites and the Hunters, who turtled behind their shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante and Lucy darted out and grabbed Fred, dragging him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fire team of five Elites popped from cover and unleashed a torrent of plasma and needles. They were riddled with bullets and dropped—but one managed to shoot at Dante and a plasma bolt glanced his side. He flinched, but didn\u0027t stop pulling Fred to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunter pair peeked around their overlapped shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda fired methodically—orange blood spattered from one Hunter\u0027s exposed midsection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hunters dropped behind their shields, screaming, but still standing \"Over the edge, everyone,\" Kurt ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one the Spartans slipped to the edge and jumped into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt set three grenades on the floor, grabbed a zip line, and rappelled down. One wide swing into the open and he pendulated back, landing on the curve of spiral stairs under the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDull explosions whumped overhead and the ropes fell away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt saw that Dante and Lucy supported a groggy Fred between them. Fred\u0027s MJOLNIR armor was carbonized black. His bio signs were erratic but strong. All their bio signs were pushing the redline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blow the dome,\" Kurt told Dante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante nodded, passed Fred over to Mark\u0027s shoulder, and he limped to the far edge of the stairs, remote detonator in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt motioned for Olivia to take point, and the rest of the Spartans followed her down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder echoed off the dome walls, and chunks of rock thudded onto the landing platform overhead. Elites screamed and blue plasma detonations lit the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree revolutions around the stairs and Olivia held up a hand. They all halted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gotcha in my sights,\" Kelly said over TEAMCOM. \"Stand by, defusing the mines… okay, come ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt and the others entered the chamber. Kurt noticed the LOTUS antitank mines stuck on this room\u0027s walls and ceiling, making it a good kill zone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill and Kelly crouched to either side of the opening to the bridge of light, hidden by its glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt did a quick count. All present… save Dante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante brought up the rear, limping into the room, one hand holding his side. He stood straight and saluted Kurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" he said, \"I think I got nicked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante\u0027s bio signs flatlined and he collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt dropped to Dante\u0027s side and unlatched his SPI chest piece. He\u0027d seen him grazed by plasma on his left side, and sure enough, there were second- and third-degree burns there that had boiled off the liquid-ballistic layer. Under his arm and across his chest a half dozen needier shards had lodged and detonated. The bones of his rib cage were exposed, and deeper, black congealing blood pooled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was limp. Cold. Bio signs flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante was dead. There was nothing Kurt could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt had watched Shane, Robert, and Jane die. He had listened to Tom tell how Beta got wiped out on Pegasi Delta. Now Dante. One more gone on his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be easy to blame Ackerson and Parangosky for the deaths of his Spartans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesigned for high-risk missions, they were all going to die, weren\u0027t they? And Kurt had played along and followed orders. What other option was there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe examined his hands, covered in the Spartan blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda set a hand on Kurt\u0027s shoulder. \"We\u0027ll bring him with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis training reasserted itself. Move—fight—live. The alternative was to sit here and join Dante.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt gently set Dante onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to focus. They had a mission: get the Forerunner technology. Get the rest of his team out alive. Kurt promised the scales would be balanced for Dante. Somehow. He\u0027d see to it himself if he had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda and Olivia moved to Dante and picked him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grab your gear and follow,\" Kurt said to Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe marched over the bridge of light and entered the holographic map room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey stood at the Forerunner console, hieroglyphs swarming over its surface, the symbols\u0027 meaning changing as they aligned into higher-dimensional patterns for a moment, then rearranged into new kaleidoscopic formations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia and Linda set Dante\u0027s body down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark, Ash, and Holly knelt next to him and gingerly set his hands together on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Halsey?\" Kurt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up one hand and with the other she furiously typed on the laptop that Mendez held for her. The laptop\u0027s tiny projection pad emitted a mote of light that flitted among the symbols like a bee gathering nectar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez handed Kurt the thumb-sized datapad. \"Codes locked and ready to go, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt checked it out: Detonation codes for the FENRIS warheads streamed across the tiny screen. He slipped it into his gauntlet\u0027s data port and clenched his fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s so much here,\" Dr. Halsey whispered. \"I\u0027ve confirmed this world is part of the Forerunners\u0027 plan together with the Halo rings—their \u0027sword\u0027 and \u0027shield.\u0027 Other parts still elude me. There is a reference to the \u0027ark.\u0027 I have yet to determine if something went wrong… why they are not here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor,\" Kurt said more firmly, and he stepped closer. \"We have a Covenant armada over our heads, and an army about to swarm through this building. Is there a way out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes and no,\" she replied, still not looking at him. \"There is a room in the core of this world,\" she explained, \"where the Forerunners were to secure something precious. Perhaps the technologies you seek. The room is normally inaccessible, but the arming of the Halo rings triggered something within this planet.\" She ran her fingers across overlapping streams of hieroglyphics struggling to read. \"There is an entrance to this room, open now, but closing. In one hour seventeen minutes the core entrance will shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Core of the planet?\" Kurt said. \"There is no way to get to the core that fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must gather what is within, and make our escape.\" She finally looked up at him, excitement glistening in her eyes. \"And there is indeed a way to get there. This map room can access a Slipspace translocation system similar to the one Cortana used on the Halo ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt saw they stood upon a matte-black surface flush with the floor. It was four meters wide and had seven sides. His gaze seemed to slide deeper into the surface like he was looking at something infinitely deep… or nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, looked away. \"Slipspace translocation? A tele-portation system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In effect, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room shook and dust rained from the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey focused past Kurt into the room. She made a slight cutting motion over several gold symbols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge of light connecting to the outer chamber vanished. The door to the map room closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spotted Dante and her face drained of color. \"Oh…\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must get us to the other SPARTAN-IIIs locked in cryo first,\" Kurt told her, \"Of course, I believe I understand the intricacies of the transportation system well enough,\" she said. \"I must caution you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethough, not to detonate the FENRIS warheads. The EMP will render the system inoperable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understood,\" Kurt said. \"Just activate this \u0027translocation\u0027 device. Get me to my Spartans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is still so much to learn here,\" Dr. Halsey said. \"I suggest you leave me. I can—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremendous shudder shook the room. Chunks of rock rained from the ceiling. Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalsey fell, and Kurt caught her, shielded her with his back as baseball-sized stones bounced off the hardened plates of his SPI armor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the chamber there were four gut-jarring detonations— the LOTUS antitank mines Kelly had set up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve run out of time, Doctor,\" Kurt said. \"They are here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood, brushed the dust from her lab coat, and straightened her glasses. \"So it appears.\" She tapped a handful of symbols. \"There is a translocation platform\"—she consulted the holographic map—\"within a kilometer of the other Spartans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the holographic map of Onyx, the wall of the room cracked as the stones heated to dull red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartans positioned themselves between the wall and Dr. Halsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt stepped directly in front of the Doctor and Mendez took up a position at his flank, his MA5B leveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh dug into his pack and passed out Jackal shield gauntlets to his team. Together they crouched before the SPARTAN-IIs, forming a shield wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey shifted the Forerunner symbols. \"There,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heating wall exploded and rubble bounced off the Spartans\u0027 shields. From the breach in the wall, plasma bolts and crystal shards crisscrossed the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jackal shields deflected it all—but were draining fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill, Kelly, and Fred popped up and sprayed suppressing fire into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLinda maneuvered between them, leveled her sniper rifle, and squeezed off three rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enemy ceased fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now would be good. Doctor,\" Kurt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Activating,\" Dr. Halsey said. \"There may some disorientation.\" She reached for a glowing symbol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKurt\u0027s COM crackled to life and Endless Summer\u0027s voice filled his helmet. \"Come in, Ambrose,\" the AI said. \"I have a high-priority mission redirect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed Dr. Halsey\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mote of light on her laptop stretched into a bare-chested Indian warrior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were destroyed,\" Kurt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Sentinels did find and destroy the COM launcher, but I had my escape well planned.\" He held his hand apart and a globe appeared. It rotated to the north polar region, zoomed into ice fields, and then down a volcanic caldera. \"These coordinates are the latest thermal images provided by a UNSC prowler in high orbit. You must go there. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have other matters to take care of first,\" Kurt told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnically Endless Summer had the authority to order him anywhere it liked, but under the circumstances, Kurt wasn\u0027t listening to an ONI-controlled AI—not when his people\u0027s lives were at stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This site is a Sentinel manufacturing facility,\" Endless Summer said, glowering. \"In orbit there is a battle raging between a Covenant fleet and these alien craft, one that will likely destroy the Covenant forces.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-33.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
