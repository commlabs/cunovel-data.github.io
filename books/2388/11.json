Someone must have made some in the kitchen at the end of the hall. “That’s one of my favorite smells,” she mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mine too,” Jordan said, clutching a pillow. “You got any others?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily thought for a moment. “Rubber balls and gasoline, I guess. And the smell of my old best friend’s bedroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alison’s?” Jordan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded. She’d told Jordan about Ali almost immediately. It was one of those things she just had to get out of the way when she made new friends these days—everyone had seen Pretty Little Killer, the docudrama about what Ali did to them, anyway. “I used to sneak into her bedroom during sleepovers,” she admitted, blushing. “Her room smelled like flowers and powder and just … her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really loved her, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily cast her eyes downward. That was something else she’d admitted to Jordan right away: There was no use in hiding her attraction to girls anymore. It was easy to tell Jordan things, though—she was so accepting of everything that came out of Emily’s mouth. She’d just smiled faintly and said that was fine with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cleared her throat and looked up at Jordan. “I meant to ask you. Do you need to call your parents? I have a phone card you can borrow. They’re probably wondering where you are, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan shrugged. “I said I was staying at a friend’s house for a while. They won’t check up on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure? For a whole week?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They probably don’t even notice I’m gone.” Jordan fiddled with her velvet headband. “My parents are way more concerned with their own lives. They don’t really have time for me. Add in the fact that I’m not the perfect daughter they always wanted, and they’d probably rather I was just gone for good.” She said it nonchalantly, finishing with a sarcastic laugh, but the pain was obvious in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily drew a squiggle in the margin. “Sometimes I think my parents want me to disappear, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan looked up at her, clearly waiting for Emily to say more. “I’ve done some stuff to make them really mad,” Emily said vaguely. Even though she’d shared a lot, she wasn’t ready to get into that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut suddenly, Jordan’s face had moved closer. The air smelled heavily of jasmine perfume. “I don’t know why anyone would want you to disappear,” she blurted. “No matter what you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily held her breath, noticing for the first time that Jordan’s eyes were the color of tourmaline gemstones. Then her cell phone let out a few sharp bleeps. She groaned, rolled over, and looked at the screen. Hanna had sent a text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA is on the boat. Meet me near the tiki bar now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily turned the phone over so Jordan couldn’t see the message. “I-I’ll be back,” she whispered, and was through the door before Jordan could ask what had just happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, Emily stood at the tiki bar, a steady rain pelting the awning above her head. Naturally, the deck was empty. Somewhere down below, she could hear the strains of New Age music from a late Cirque du Soleil performance in the theater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator doors opened, and Spencer and Aria walked out. They spied her and jogged over, shielding their heads from the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna emerged up a staircase wearing a long sundress, high heels, and an incongruous oversized white hoodie that stretched to her mid thighs. Her eyes were wild, her face was pale, and she held her phone tightly in her right hand. “The bitch somehow made it on board with us,” she snapped when they approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thrust the phone at the girls. Emily stared at the text message on the screen. Be careful who you hit and run, jailbird. See you on the Fiesta Deck!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria squinted at the note. “Hit and run? What is A talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t it obvious?” Hanna said. “The accident on Reeds Lane? That horrible night in the rain? A knows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s mouth dropped open. The night of Hanna’s accident felt so far removed—it had happened at the beginning of the summer, before anything else. She’d found out she was pregnant just after spring break in Jamaica, and though she’d still been living at home when Hanna had called, she was moving in with Carolyn the following week, much to her sister’s chagrin. When Hanna called Emily, she had almost declined—she had a little belly bulge at the time, and what if the other girls guessed what was going on? It was hard enough to hide it from her parents. Her mother had even commented on Emily’s new billowy-shirt style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a split second later, she’d felt terrible. Hanna needed her. And then Aria had called, saying she’d swing by and pick her up, and Emily didn’t know how to say no. In the end, if any of them noticed her belly, no one said anything. They were all too preoccupied with the car crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily leaned against the bar. “How does A know about that?” she asked, looking at Hanna. They’d been on such a desolate stretch of road, and they’d driven away before the ambulance had arrived. But then more of the night came back to her. They’d possibly hurt the girl. And then they’d run, like it was a prank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna fiddled with a large, carved tiki-head candle on top of one of the tables. “I’m not sure. But you know that girl in the car, Madison? It turns out she’s Naomi Zeigler’s cousin. Naomi and I have been getting along, and at first I thought it seemed suspicious, but then I figured she’d turned over a new leaf. Until I saw her fake ID—it’s Madison’s picture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria’s brow furrowed. “So you think Naomi was being nice to you because she’s A?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure,” Hanna said. “But if she’s not, A is going to tell her about the crash. Naomi will turn us in for sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, if A doesn’t turn us in first.” Spencer pointed at Hanna’s phone. “A called you jailbird.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hanna, did Naomi say anything about the accident?” Aria asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sort of,” Hanna admitted, looking at Spencer. “She mentioned going through some terrible stuff last summer. And she got this weird look on her face when someone asked her who it was on her fake ID. She was like, My cousin doesn’t need her ID anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like she was dead?” Spencer gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s eyes widened. “In the crash?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She couldn’t have died in the crash.” Hanna’s eyes darted back and forth. “She was still breathing when you guys got to the scene.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was she?” Aria squinted. “Did anyone actually check?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked around at the others. “I don’t remember if we did or not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t, either,” Aria said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s face was green. “What if we killed her when we moved her?” She slumped against one of the metal posts that propped up the awning. “I dropped her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t jump to conclusions yet, Spence,” Aria said quickly, though she looked just as sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you think A knows about that?” Emily asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna shrugged. “If A is Naomi, she could have seen the accident from her house. It is just over the hill from the crash, not that I’d ever made that connection.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or maybe Madison lived, and she saw the girl playing you in Pretty Little Killer and figured it out,” Aria piped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Madison would’ve had to figure it out before that,” Hanna insisted. “If Naomi is A, she must have known almost immediately—and decided to stalk all of us. That could be how she found out about Gayle and Kelsey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded, considering this. She had spent time at Gayle’s house that summer, and Gayle had offered to buy Emily’s baby in a café. If Naomi had been following her, it would have been easy for her to figure out what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria ran her hands down the length of her face. “I’m not sure Naomi makes sense as A, though. How could she know about all the other secrets A knows? Like Jamaica—that happened before the thing with Madison.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it’s easy to explain how she knew about what happened to us in the summer—Naomi lives in Rosewood.” Hanna’s eyes were wide. “She’s friends with Kate—she’s been at my house hundreds of times. She definitely could have dug up tons of dirt on me like that.” She snapped her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer bit her lip. “Actually, Naomi was around a lot when A was threatening me about Kelsey, too. She was one of the witches in Macbeth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And she latched onto Klaudia—a lot of my A notes were about her for a while,” Aria added thoughtfully. “And she was at Noel’s when I got a message from A about his family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked at Emily, waiting for her to contribute her own Naomi story. She just shrugged. “I haven’t had any interaction with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was at Gayle’s funeral, remember?” Hanna pointed out. “Don’t you think that’s weird?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stared at the flag flapping on the pole overhead. She wasn’t sure if it was weird or not. “A lot of people live in Rosewood, though—someone else could have been watching us. And Jamaica still doesn’t make sense,” she whispered. “Naomi wasn’t there—we would have seen her. How could she know about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s got to be a connection,” Hanna said. “Maybe she was there and we didn’t know it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s fingers flew on her phone. “Nope, Naomi was in St. Bart’s for spring break—it says so on her Facebook page.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, maybe there are two As—one who saw what happened in Jamaica, and then Naomi, who’s carrying out all the evil deeds,” Hanna suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer squeezed her eyes shut. “God. My head is going to explode. Now we have to think about who a second A could be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily breathed in. “I think I have an idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna looked at her sharply. “Let me guess. Real Ali?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Ali,” Emily said in a small voice. If Jordan had snuck aboard so easily and effortlessly, who was to say Real Ali couldn’t have done the same thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced over her shoulder, terrified that Real Ali was watching them. A bolt of lightning flickered at sea. Puddles glistened under the lights. The idea of coming face-to-face with Real Ali on a boat terrified her. There were only so many places she could hide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Real Ali is dead,” Spencer said dismissively. “It’s got to be someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria cleared her throat. “Something weird happened to me today, too.” She took a deep breath. “You know how I signed up for that scavenger hunt? I got partnered with this guy who’d recently transferred from a school in New Jersey. We talked for a while, and I found out he knew Tabitha.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burned-pretty-little-liars-12/page-11.html","bookId":2388,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:44 AM"}
