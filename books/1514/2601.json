It was through this act that they were able to prevent this world from falling into the enemy’s hands. His eight disciples had similarly given everything they had for this world. All the experts of \u0026nbsp;this world had a heartfelt respect when they talked about these heroes. This was also the reason why Ying Huanhuan’s group could easily establish the three great alliances. It was not purely due to the pressure from their strength.
