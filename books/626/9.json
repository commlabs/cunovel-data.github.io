She smiled at the children who were lined up at the cafeteria. It warmed her heart to see how much they liked her food.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 49\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maurecia was first in line.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what would you like today, Maurecia?\" Miss Mush asked. She knew the name of every child in Wayside School.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maurecia looked at the sign.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Special Today: Mushroom Surprise\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Just milk,\" said Maurecia. \"I brought my lunch.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Mush smiled and gave Maurecia a carton of milk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joy was next in line.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what would you like, Joy?\" asked Miss Mush.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Milk,\" said Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Mush smiled and gave Joy a carton of milk. \"And what would you like, Jason?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Milk, please,\" said Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Just milk,\" said Dameon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Milk,\" said D.J.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Milk,\" said Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was almost Ron\u0027s turn. He hadn\u0027t brought a lunch. He normally brought a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to school, but there hadn\u0027t been a single slice of bread in his house this morning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know!\" his mother had said. \"Ill give you some money and you can buy a nice hot lunch from Miss Mush!\" She thought it was a brilliant idea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 50\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can\u0027t I just have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the bread?\" Ron had asked. Now he looked up at the sign.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Special Today: Mushroom Surprise\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He wished he weren\u0027t so hungry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was the eighteenth day in a row that the special was Mushroom Surprise. It was called Mushroom Surprise because it would have been a surprise if anybody had ever ordered it. No one ever did- except Louis, of course. That\u0027s why they\u0027d had it for eighteen days. There was always plenty left over.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Milk,\" said Terrence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Milk,\" said Sharie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Milk,\" said Calvin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Milk, please,\" said Bebe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what would you like today, Ron?\" asked Miss Mush.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ron took a breath. \"Mushroom Surprise,\" he squeaked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tears of joy filled Miss Mush\u0027s eyes. She blew her nose on her apron, then said, \"One Mushroom Surprise, coming right up!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Tears came to Ron\u0027s eyes too, but for a different reason. He looked at the Mushroom Surprise. It was sort of green.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So was Ron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 51\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Mush proudly dumped a hot lump of Mushroom Surprise on a paper plate and handed it to Ron. He put it on his tray, then pushed it over to the cash register, where he paid for it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The news quickly spread around the cafeteria, then up and down the stairs and out to the playground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ron ordered the Mushroom Surprise!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ron ordered the Mushroom Surprise!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls was sitting in the teachers\u0027 lounge on the twelfth floor when Bebe burst into the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the teachers were shocked to see her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bebe, you\u0027re not allowed in here,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"This is a secret place.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ron ordered the Mushroom Surprise!\" Bebe shouted; then she ran back up to the cafeteria.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Ron sat down at a table, eighty-seven kids crowded around him to watch him eat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder what the surprise is,\" said Deedee. She had the best view. She was pushed right up alongside Ron\u0027s chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe it tastes good,\" said Leslie. \"Maybe that\u0027s the surprise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I think it\u0027s called Mushroom Surprise because after you eat it, it\u0027s a surprise if you don\u0027t die,\" said Mac.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louis eats it. He\u0027s not dead,\" said Jason.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Louis has been eating Miss Mush\u0027s food for so long, he\u0027s immune to it,\" said Allison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 52\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ron dug his plastic fork into the goop. He raised it to his mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana covered her eyes. \"I can\u0027t watch!\" she exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ron opened his mouth wide. The fork entered. He brought the fork out again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was empty!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ron chewed twice, then swallowed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He ate it!\" Deedee announced for those who couldn\u0027t see.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stephen screamed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hmm,\" said Ron. \"Not too bad. It sort of tastes like a mixture of bananas and spinach.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the surprise?\" asked Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ron looked at Deedee. His face flushed and his eyes changed color. His whole body began to shake, like a washing machine on the spin cycle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Deedee was afraid he was going to throw up. She tried to get away, but with everyone crowded around, there was no room for her to move.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Ron didn\u0027t throw up. He stood up, put his arms around Deedee\u0027s neck, and kissed her smack on the lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sat back down. His eyes returned to their normal color.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ylah!\" said Deedee, wiping her mouth on her sleeve.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Ron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 53\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t you know what you just did?\" asked Allison.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He shrugged. \"I ate some Mushroom Surprise. It wasn\u0027t bad. Sort of like a mixture of a hot dog and grape jelly. I wonder what the surprise is.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He dug his plastic fork back into the goop.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everybody ran away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Mrs. Jewls entered the cafeteria, no one was there except for Ron. He was sitting alone at a table eating Mushroom Surprise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls sat down next to him. \"Hi Ron,\" she said. \"So how does it taste? And what\u0027s the surprise?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ron swallowed another mouthful. He looked at his teacher.
