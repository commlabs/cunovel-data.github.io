I asked God to send me a mom, especially one with pretty fingernails, and then Dad met you and he was listening to me when I asked him about getting me a baby sister and then all of a sudden...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now everything looks so bad. I won\u0027t forget you, sweetheart, and the Navy doesn\u0027t have anything to say about the two of us being special friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in the least. We\u0027ll give your dad and me time to work matters out at the office, and once everything is settled there, I\u0027ll invite you over for the night and we can order pizza and rent a movie and we\u0027ll do our fingernails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Catherine, could we really? I\u0027d like that so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, was a bit of commotion behind Kelly that sounded like a door being jerked opened. \"I\u0027ve got to go now, Missy,\" Kelly said deliberately loud, placing heavy emphasis on her friend\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it your dad just opened the closet door?\" Catherine asked, unable to contain a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, sweetheart. Now listen, it probably would be best if you didn\u0027t phone me again for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I promise I\u0027ll talk to your dad...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only do it soon, okay?\" she pleaded. \"I will, I promise,\" Catherine pledged, feeling more depressed than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe despair had grown heavier and more oppressive a week later. Royce hadn\u0027t spoken one unnecessary word to her in all that time. It was as though she were invisible. A necessary body that filled a space. Necessary to the legal department, but not necessary for him. If Royce did happen to glance in her direction it was by accident, and it seemed he looked straight through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weekend hadn\u0027t been much better. Catherine couldn\u0027t remember a Saturday and Sunday that felt more empty. On Saturday she\u0027d done busywork around her apartment and answered mail. At least her good friend Brand Davis from Hawaii was happy, she mulled, reading over the wedding invitation. Then on Sunday, after church services, she\u0027d attended a matinee and cooked a meal she didn\u0027t feel like eating, and ended up giving the leftovers to Sambo, who apparently wasn\u0027t interested, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutwardly everything was as it always had been, but inside Catherine felt empty. As empty as a black hole. How stark her life felt, how barren. Until she\u0027d met Royce, she\u0027d been blissfully unaware of the lonely nothingness of her life. Royce had stirred her soul to life, and now she hungered for someone to share the everyday routine, someone to give meaning to her bleak existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe single red rose in a crystal stem vase was sitting on her desk waiting for her when she walked into the office Monday morning. Her heart quickened at the beauty of the delicate flower, but she knew immediately it couldn\u0027t, wouldn\u0027t be from Royce. He wasn\u0027t a man who would allow a rose to do his speaking for him. He wasn\u0027t a man to indulge in such romantic extravagances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA card was pinned to the shiny red ribbon attached to the narrow vase. Catherine stared at the envelope for several moments, calculating in her mind who would have given her a rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to read who it\u0027s from?\" Elaine asked, much too casually to fool Catherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In time.\" She unpinned the card and slipped it free of the small envelope. The name was scrawled across the face of the card in bold, even strokes. She grinned, somewhat amused. It was exactly who she thought it would be. Knowing Elaine was watching her, she replaced the card in the envelope, then set the rose on the edge of her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Elaine demanded impatiently. \"Who sent it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My my, aren\u0027t you the nosy one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you must know, it\u0027s a little more than idle curiosity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine pulled out her chair and sat down. \"I suppose you\u0027ve got money riding on this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten bucks.\" Then without hesitation, she asked, \"Commander Parker, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine grinned and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it all along,\" Elaine said, grinning broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine was pleased her secretary took such delight in the fact Commander Dan Parker had seen fit to flatter her with a red rose, but frankly, her secretary was more thrilled about it than she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lack of appreciation, Catherine realized, could be attributed to the fact she realized what was sure to follow. An invitation she didn\u0027t want to accept. It happened just as she suspected, just when she was preparing to leave the office that same afternoon. Commander Parker strolled into the room, grinning boyishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon, Catherine,\" he greeted, and struck a casual pose. He was tall and reasonably good-looking, his features well defined. From the scuttlebutt Catherine had picked up around the base, Dan Parker had the reputation of being a playboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon, Commander,\" she responded formally, wanting to keep it impersonal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze drifted over to her desk, where she\u0027d left the rose. \"I see you found my little surprise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was very thoughtful of you,\" she said, eyeing the door, anxious to get away. The office was deserted, and she didn\u0027t want to get stuck in a long, boring conversation with a man she had no interest in cultivating a relationship with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m pleased you enjoyed it so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s lovely.\" She reached for her coat and slipped into it, doing her best to give the appearance that she was about to leave. Anything that would cut short this game of cat and mouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Parker would ask her out, and she\u0027d decline. Then he\u0027d give her his well-practiced hurt-little-boy look, and she\u0027d be required to spend the next ten minutes making up some excuse why she wouldn\u0027t go out with him. Something that would soothe the ruffled feathers of his substantial male ego.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose you have plans Friday night?\" he asked right on cue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, I\u0027m busy.\" Which was true. She planned on changing Sambo\u0027s litter box. Not exactly an exciting prospect, but it gave credence to her words. She looped the strap of her purse over her shoulder, determined not to play the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping you\u0027d let me take you to dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another time perhaps,\" she suggested, heading toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the Birthday Ball?\" Every October the Navy celebrated its birthday with an elaborate ball. The celebration was coming later this year because the admiral had been gone. \"It\u0027s two weeks away, and I was hoping you\u0027d accompany me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine didn\u0027t have a single excuse. Her presence would be expected, but she hadn\u0027t given the matter of a date more than a fleeting thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of spending the evening with anyone other than Royce didn\u0027t interest her. Her attitude was excessively stupid. They\u0027d be able to dance once, maybe twice without raising suspicions. Risking anything more than that would be foolish in the extreme. The way matters were between them presently, it was doubtful Royce would go anywhere near her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catherine,\" Dan prodded. \"The Birthday Ball?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced herself to smile as though it was a difficult decision. \"I appreciate the invitation, in fact I\u0027m flattered, but no thanks. I\u0027m...I\u0027ve decided to go stag this year. It\u0027s nothing personal, Dan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommander Parker\u0027s smile didn\u0027t waver, neither did the light in his dark eyes dim, if anything it brightened. Slowly, without hesitation, he raised his hand and ran one finger down the side of her cheek. \"I think I know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine\u0027s heart thundered against her chest with alarm. She stared up at him and blinked, certain he could read everything she felt for Royce like a notice on a bulletin board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" he whispered sympathetically, \"your secret is safe with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquaring her shoulders, Catherine\u0027s only choice was to pretend he couldn\u0027t be more wrong. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. I prefer to attend the Birthday Ball alone this year, and whatever connotation you put on that decision is of your own making.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan chuckled. \"\"You\u0027re right, of course. Absolutely right.\" He straightened and was about to leave when he turned back, his friendly eyes suddenly somber and dark. \"Good luck, Catherine, but be careful. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could continue with the pretense, Catherine nodded. \"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce was in a foul mood, but that wasn\u0027t anything new. He\u0027d been in a dangerous one for nearly two weeks, and frankly he couldn\u0027t see it lessening anytime soon. The fact he\u0027d recently spoken to Dan Parker hadn\u0027t improved his disposition any. Of all the foolish, mule-headed deeds Catherine had committed since he\u0027d met her, rejecting Dan\u0027s invitation to the Birthday Ball took the cake. He\u0027d like to wring her skinny neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha,\" he said aloud, discrediting his thoughts. The last thing he wanted was to see Catherine suffer. Anytime he was within ten feet of her it was all he could do not to haul her into his arms and breathe in the fresh, womanly scent that was hers alone. He wanted to drink in her softness, savor her warmth and her love. He needed her so damn much, he was about to go out of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce didn\u0027t know what the hell he was going to do. One thing for sure, they couldn\u0027t continue like this much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce had done everything he could think to do to forget her. He was working himself into an early grave, spending all kinds of extra hours at the office. Kelly was barely speaking to him, and he\u0027d lost just about every friend he\u0027d made in seventeen years of military service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething had to be done, and fast, before he ended up destroying himself and in the process, Catherine, too. He just didn\u0027t know what the hell the solution was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA polite knock on his door interrupted his thoughts. Whoever it was possessed the courage of David facing Goliath to confront Royce in his current mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in,\" he barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Catherine opened the door, Royce\u0027s heart dropped to his knees. What now? He couldn\u0027t be any less encouraging than the last time they spoke. He couldn\u0027t have been any more sarcastic. No matter what he said, no matter what he did, she just kept coming back. By heaven, that woman was stubborn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" he demanded, giving the illusion of being busy, too busy to be intruded upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow sweet her voice sounded, how soft and feminine. Royce had lain awake nights tormented by the memory of her making delicate, whimpering love sounds. How close he\u0027d come to breaking the very code of honor he\u0027d sworn to uphold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing more to say,\" he said, forcefully pushing all thoughts of her and that night from his mind. \"I thought I made that fact perfectly clear.\" His voice was as brittle and hard as he could make it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about Kelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My daughter is none of your business, Lieutenant Commander.\" Royce felt as though he\u0027d been kicked in the stomach. Catherine had no way of knowing that Kelly continued to bring up her name night and day until he\u0027d absolutely forbidden his own daughter to speak of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you have no objection, I\u0027d like Kelly to spend the weekend with me and...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" The word was edged with steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanting to spend time with Kelly has nothing to do with you and me,\" Catherine insisted softly. \"But everything to do with Kelly. She needs...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be the one to determine my daughter\u0027s needs.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-woman-navy-4/page-13.html","bookId":1959,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:25 AM"}
