She might think we were gossiping about her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we are gossiping about her. Besides, I don\u0027t believe she would do… you know, that… with anyone. She doesn\u0027t seem at all that sort of woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe it,\" Leo had said. \"Usually the ladies most inclined to squander their favors are the ones who don\u0027t have any.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" Bea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He means unattractive ladies are more easily seduced,\" Poppy had said wryly, \"which I don\u0027t agree with. And besides, Miss Marks isn\u0027t unattractive at all. She\u0027s only a bit… stern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And scrawny as a Scottish chicken,\" Leo had muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the carriage passed Marble Arch and proceeded to Park Lane, Miss Marks glued her gaze to the spring floral displays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing at her idly, Leo noted that she had a decent profile-a sweet little tip of a nose supporting the spectacles, a gently rounded chin. Too bad the clenched mouth and frowning forehead ruined the rest of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his attention back to Poppy, pondering her lack of desire to stay in London. Surely any other girl her age would have been begging to finish the season and enjoy all the balls and parties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about this season\u0027s prospects,\" he said to Poppy. \"Can it be that not one of them holds any interest for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Not one. I\u0027ve met a few whom I do like, such as Lord Bromley, or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bromley?\" Leo repeated, his brows lifting. \"But he\u0027s twice your age. Are there any younger ones you might consider? Someone born in this century, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s Mr. Radstock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Portly and plodding,\" Leo said, having met the porker on a few previous occasions. The upper circles of London were a relatively small community. \"Who else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is Lord Wallscourt, very gentle and friendly, but… he\u0027s a rabbit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Curious and cuddly?\" Beatrix asked, having a high opinion of rabbits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy smiled. \"No, I meant he was rather colorless and… oh, just rabbity. Which is a fine thing in a pet, but not a husband.\" She made a project of neatening the bonnet ribbons tied beneath her chin. \"You\u0027ll probably advise me to lower my expectations, Leo, but I\u0027ve already dropped them to the extent that even a worm couldn\u0027t squeeze itself beneath my expectations. I must tell you, the London season is a grave disappointment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Poppy,\" Leo said gently. \"I wish I knew a fellow to recommend to you, but the only ones I know are ne\u0027er-do-wells and drunkards. Excellent friends. But I\u0027d rather shoot one of them than have him as a brother-in-law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That leads to something I\u0027ve wanted to ask you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" He looked into her sweet, serious face, this perfectly lovely sister who aspired so desperately to have a calm and ordinary life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that I\u0027ve been out in society,\" Poppy said, \"I\u0027ve heard rumors.…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeo\u0027s smile turned rueful as he understood what she wanted to know. \"About me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Are you really as wicked as some people say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the private nature of the query, Leo was aware of both Miss Marks and Beatrix turning their full attention to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so, darling,\" he said, while a sordid parade of his past sins swept through his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Poppy asked with a frankness he ordinarily would have found endearing. But not with Miss Marks\u0027s sanctimonious gaze fastened on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s much easier to be wicked,\" he said. \"Especially if one has no reason to be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about earning a place in heaven?\" Catherine Marks asked. He would have thought she had a pretty voice, if it hadn\u0027t come from such an unappealing source. \"Isn\u0027t that reason enough to conduct yourself with some modicum of decency?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That depends,\" he said sardonically. \"What is heaven to you, Miss Marks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considered the question with more care than he would have expected. \"Peace. Serenity. A place where there is no sin, nor gossip, nor conflict.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Miss Marks, I\u0027m afraid your idea of heaven is my idea of hell. Therefore my wicked ways shall happily continue.\" Turning back to Poppy, he spoke far more kindly. \"Don\u0027t lose hope, Sis. There\u0027s someone out there, waiting for you. Someday you\u0027ll find him, and he\u0027ll be everything you were hoping for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think so?\" Poppy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I\u0027ve always thought that was a nice thing to say to someone in your circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoppy snickered and poked Leo in the side, while Miss Marks gave him a stare of pure disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn their last evening in London, the family attended a private ball given at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Simon Hunt in Mayfair. Mr. Hunt, a railway entrepreneur and part owner of a British locomotive works, was a self-made man, the son of a London butcher. He was part of a new and growing class of investors, businessmen, and managers who were unsettling the long-held traditions and authority of the peerage itself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-44.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM"}
