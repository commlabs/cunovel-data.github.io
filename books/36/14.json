Well, we’ve been all through this now a number of times. The people who make a living doing what they love are the people who insist on doing so. They don’t give up. They never give in. They dare life not to let them do what they love.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut there’s another element that must be brought up, because this is the missing element in most people’s understanding when it comes to life work.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s that?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a difference between being and doing, and\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003emost people have placed their emphasis on the latter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShouldn’t they?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no “should” or “should not” involved.

Where are you—and where are you coming from—as you encounter life?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, in the example of the two equally qualified workers, one is successful and the other is not, not because of anything either is doing, but because of what both are being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOne person is being open, friendly, caring, helpful, considerate, cheerful, confident, even joyful in her work, while the other is being closed, distant, uncaring, inconsiderate, grumpy, even resentful of what she is doing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow suppose you were to select even loftier states of beingness?

Now let’s take “worldly success” as our sub-ject for the moment, since that’s what you’ve been talking about, asking about.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTerrific.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, do you have a thought, “I want worldly success”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, yes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd do you also sometimes have the thought, “1 want more money”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou can therefore neither have worldly success nor more money.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhy not?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause the universe has no choice but to bring you the direct manifestation of your thought about it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour thought is, “I want worldly success.” You un-derstand, the creative power is like a genie in a bottle. Your words are its command. You understand?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen why don’t I have more success?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI said, your words are its command. Now your words were, “1 want success.” And the universe says, “Okay, you do.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI’m still not sure I follow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThink of it this way. The word “I” is the key that starts the engine of creation. The words “1 am” are extremely powerful. They are statements to the universe. Com-mands.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow, whatever follows the word “I” (which calls forth the Great I Am) tends to manifest in physical reality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTherefore “I” + “want success” produces you wanting success. “I” + “want money” must produce you wanting money. It can produce no other thing, because thoughts, words are creative. Actions are, too. And if you act in a way which says that you want success and money, then your thoughts, words, and actions are in accord, and you are sure to have the experience of this wantingness.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou see?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes! My God—does it really work that way?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course! You are a very powerful creator. Now granted, if you had a thought, or made a statement, just once—as in anger, for instance, or frustration, it’s not very likely that you’ll convert those thoughts or words into reality. So you don’t have to worry about “Drop dead!” or “Go to hell,” or all the other less-than-nice things you sometimes think or say.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThank God.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’re welcome. But, if you repeat a thought, or say a word, over and over again—not once, not twice, but dozens, hundreds, thousands of times—do you have any idea of the creative power of that?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA thought or a word expressed and expressed and expressed becomes just that—expressed. That is, pushed out It becomes outwardly realized. It becomes your physical reality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGood grief.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s exactly what it produces very often—good grief. You love the grief, you love the drama. That is, until you don’t anymore. There comes a certain point in your evolution when you cease to love the drama, cease to love the “story” as you’ve been living it. That’s when you decide—actively choose—to change it. Only most don’t know how. You now do. To change your reality, simply stop thinking like that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn this case, instead of thinking “I want success,” think “I have success.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat feels like a lie to me. I’d be kidding myself if I said that. My mind would shout, “The hell you say!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen think a thought you can accept. “My success is coming to me now,” or “all things lead to my success.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo this is the trick behind the New Age practice of affirmations.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAffirmations do not work if they are merely state-ments of what you want to be true. Affirmations work only when they are statements of something you already know to be true.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe best so-called affirmation is a statement of gratitude and appreciation. “Thank you, God, for bring-ing me success in my life.” Now, that idea, thought, spoken, and acted upon, produces wonderful re-sults—when it comes from true knowing; not from an attempt to produce results, but from an awareness that results have already been produced.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJesus had such clarity. Before every miracle, He thanked Me in advance for its deliverance. It never occurred to Him not to be grateful, because it never occurred to Him that what He declared would not happen. The thought never entered His mind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo sure was He of Who He Was and of His relation-ship to Me that His every thought, word, and deed reflected his awareness—just as your thoughts, words, and deeds reflect yours.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf, now, there is something you choose to experience in your life, do not “want” it—choose it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDo you choose success in worldly terms? Do you choose more money? Good. Then choose it. Really. Fully. Not half-heartedly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet at your stage of development do not be surprised if “worldly success” no longer concerns you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat is that supposed to mean?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere comes a time in the evolution of every soul when the chief concern is no longer the survival of the physical body, but the growth of the spirit; no longer the attainment of worldly success, but the realization of Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn a sense, this is a very dangerous time, particu-larly at the outset, because the entity housed in the body now knows it is just that: a being in a body—not a body-being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt this stage, before the growing entity matures in this point of view, there is often a sense of no longer caring about affairs of the body in any way. The soul is so excited about being “discovered” at last!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe mind abandons the body, and all matters of the body. Everything is ignored. Relationships are set aside. Families are disappeared. Jobs are made secondary. Bills go unpaid. The body itself is not even fed for long periods. The entire focus and attention of the entity are now on the soul, and matters of the soul.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis can lead to a major personal crisis in the day-to-day life of the being, although the mind per-ceives no trauma. It is hanging out in bliss. Other people say you have lost your mind—and in a sense you may have.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDiscovery of the truth that life has nothing to do with the body can create an imbalance the other way. Whereas at first the entity acted as if the body were all there is, now it acts as if the body matters not at all. This, of course, is not true—as the entity soon (and some-times painfully) remembers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are a tri-part being, made of body, mind, and spirit. You will always be a tri-part being, not just while you are living on the Earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are those who hypothesize that upon death the body and the mind are dropped. The body and the mind are not dropped. The body changes form, leaving its most dense part behind, but retaining always its outer shell. The mind (not to be confused with the brain) goes with you, too, joining with the spirit and the body as the one energy mass of three dimensions, or facets.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShould you choose to return to this experiencing opportunity that you call life on Earth, your divine self will once again separate its true dimensions into what you call body, mind, and spirit. In truth you are all one energy, yet with three distinct characteristics.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs you undertake to inhabit a new physical body here on Earth, your ethereal body (as some of you have termed it) lowers its vibrations—slows itself from a vibration so rapid that it cannot even be seen, to a speed that produces mass and matter. This actual matter is the creation of pure thought—the work of your mind, the higher mind aspect of your three-part being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis matter is a coagulation of a million billion trillion different energy units into one enormous mass—control-lable by the mind.. .you really are a master mind!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs these tiny energy units have expended their energy, they are discarded by the body, while the mind creates new ones. This the mind creates out of its continuing thought about Who You Are! The ethereal body “catches” the thought, so to speak, and lowers the vibration of more energy units (in a sense “crystallizes” them), and they become matter—the new matter of you. In this way, every cell of your body changes every several years. You are—quite literally—not the same person you were a few years ago.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you think thoughts of illness or disease (or continu-ing anger, hatred, and negativity), your body will trans-late these thoughts into physical form. People will see this negative, sick form and they will say, “What’s the matter?” They will not know how accurate their ques-tion is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe soul watches this whole drama play out, year after year, month after month, day after day, moment after moment, and always holds the Truth about you. It never forgets the blueprint; the original plan; the first idea; the creative thought. Its job is to remind you—that is, to literally re-mind you—so that you may remember once again Who You Are—and then choose Who You now Wish to Be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn this way the cycle of creation and experience, imaging and fulfilling, knowing and growing into the unknown, continues, both now and even forever more.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhew!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, exactly. Oh, and there’s much more to explain. So much more. But never, ever in one book—nor probably even in one lifetime. Yet you have begun, and that is good. Just remember this. It is as your grand teacher William Shakespeare said: “There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMay I ask you some questions about this? Like, when you say the mind goes with me after death, does that mean my “personality” goes with me? Will I know in the afterlife who I was?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. . .and who you have ever been. It will all be opened onto you—because then it will profit you to know. Now, in this moment, it will not.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd, with regard to this life, will there be an “accounting”—a review—a tally taking?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is no judgment in what you call the afterlife.

Yet! am not—and that is a great truth you cannot accept.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, while there will be no judgment in the afterlife, there will be opportunity to look again at all you have thought, said, and done here, and to decide if that is what you would choose again, based on Who You say You Are, and Who You Want to Be.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is an Eastern mystical teaching surrounding a doctrine called Kama Loca—according to this teaching, at the time of our death each person is given the opportunity to relive every thought ever entertained, every word ever spoken, every action ever taken, not from our standpoint, but from the standpoint of every other person affected. In other words, we’ve already experienced what we felt thinking, saying, and doing what we did—now we’re given the experience of feeling what the other person felt in each of these moments—and it is by this measure that we’ll decide whether we’ll think, say, or do those things again. Any comment?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat occurs in your life after this is far too extraor-dinary to describe here in terms you could compre-hend—because the experience is other-dimensional and literally defies description using tools as severely limited as words. It is enough to say that you will have the opportunity to review again this, your present life, without pain or fear or judgment, for the purpose of deciding how you feel about your experience here, and where you want to go from there.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMany of you will decide to come back here; to return to this world of density and relativity for another chance to experience out the decisions and choices you make about your Self at this level.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOthers of you—a select few—will return with a different mission. You will return to density and matter for the soul purpose of bringing others out of density and matter. Always there are on the Earth those among you who have made such a choice. You can tell them apart at once. Their work is finished. They have re-turned to Earth simply and merely to help others. This is their joy. This is their exaltation. They seek naught but to be of service.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot miss these people. They are every-where. There are more of them than you think. Chances are you know one, or know of one.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAm I one?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo. If you have to ask, you know you are not one.

Do nothing else! You have so little time. How can you think of wasting a moment doing something for a living you don’t like to do? What kind of a living is that? That is not a living, that is a dying!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf you say, “But, but... I have others who depend on me. . .little mouths to feed.. .a spouse who is looking to me. . .“ I will answer: If you insist that your life is about what your body is doing, you do not understand why you came here. At least do something that pleases you—that speaks of Who You Are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen at least you can stay out of resentment and anger toward those you imagine are keeping you from your joy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat your body is doing is not to be discounted. It is important. But not in the way that you think. The actions of the body were meant to be reflections of a state of being, not attempts to attain a state of being.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn the true order of things one does not do some-thing in order to be happy—one is happy and, hence, does something. One does not do some things in order to be compassionate, one is compassionate and, hence, acts in a certain way. The soul’s decision precedes the body’s action in a highly conscious person. Only an unconscious person attempts to produce a state of the soul through something the body is doing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is what is meant by the statement, “Your life is not about what your body is doing.” Yet it is true that what your body is doing is a reflection of what your life is about.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is another divine dichotomy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet, know this if you understand nothing else:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have a right to your joy; children or no children; spouse or no spouse. Seek it! Find it! And you will have a joyful family, no matter how much money you make or don’t make. And if they aren’t joyful, and they get up and leave you, then release them with love to seek their joy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIf, on the other hand, you have evolved to the point where things of the body are not of concern to you, then you are even more free to seek your joy—on Earth as it is in heaven. God says it’s okay to be happy—yes, even happy in your work.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYour life work is a statement of Who You Are.
