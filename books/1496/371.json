If he was being chased by a single person, he would definitely turn and fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might even try fighting if there were two or three people. Considering how heroic and incredible he was, he figured he could probably come out on top in a situation like that. After all, with the level of his fleshly body, it wasn’t likely that only two or three people in the same cultivation level as himself would be strong enough to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when he looked over his shoulder, he saw dozens of Core Formation cultivators all bearing down on him with burning killing intent. From what he could tell, if that many people all attacked him at once, it wouldn’t matter if his Undying Live Forever Technique was even stronger than it was, he would still lose his poor little life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch thoughts filled his heart with both gloom, and also rage toward the little turtle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little turtle didn’t seem to think he had screwed Bai Xiaochun over at all, though. He flew along off to the side, eyes gleaming with excitement, letting loose a stream of shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hahaha! Bring it on, \u003cem\u003ebring it on\u003c/em\u003e! Ya bunch of wimps! Let’s see if you have what it takes to kill my master!” Then he lowered his voice to talk to Bai Xiaochun. “Don’t be afraid, Little Bai. They’re just a bunch of wimps, right? Come, come. Throw me back toward them again, I’ll crush them to death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up! This is all your fault!” Bai Xiaochun didn’t dare to throw the little turtle back toward the crowd of cultivators from the three sects. When he thought about the enraged look on the face of the man who had been marked with the turtle, his heart trembled. As he pushed forward with greater speed, all sorts of dazzling magical techniques shot toward him. Ice mountains, lightning, seas of flame, twisting vines, hundreds of flying swords, and even a gigantic vortex-like wave of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the pressure weighing down from this tide of magical techniques couldn’t compare to the defensive spells from earlier, the sheer number involved created a shockingly deadly force. Unfortunately, the turtle-wok wouldn’t be of much help in this situation. After all, the restrictive spells from before had only blasted into the turtle-wok, and hadn’t attempted to lift it up. These people wouldn’t just let him hide underneath and pretend to be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m finished. Kaput. The Mountain of Legacy Seals is gone, why hasn\u0027t the teleportation begun? If it doesn’t start soon, then I\u0027m dead!” He continued to speed along rapidly, the enraged roars of his pursuers echoing out constantly behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t you run, Bai Xiaochun!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were just blowing your horn a few seconds ago, why are you running like a scared rabbit now?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph! You challenged us to fight before, and now we’re giving you the chance. Stand and fight!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone from the other three sects was giving vent to their frustration, and their killing intent was so intense it caused brightly-colored light to flash in heaven and earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, the roughly one hundred Core Formation cultivators were like countless streams of light shooting after Bai Xiaochun. That was especially true of the Starry River Court cultivator who had been branded with the little turtle mark. His heart was completely overtaken by rage. No matter how he rubbed at his cheek, he couldn’t wipe the mark away. The odd looks given to him by people nearby were especially humiliating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m gonna kill you, Bai Xiaochun!” he screamed, his voice rising up above the voices of all the other cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun dodged the flying swords, pierced through the vortex, and leaped over a sea of flames. However, a few lightning bolts managed to hit him, causing him to shake visibly. Bruiser, who was still nestled in the folds of his robe, struggled to get free, but Bai Xiaochun pushed him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay put, there are some bad people out here!” Unfortunately, the legacy zone wasn’t very big, and Core Formation cultivators could move very quickly. As a result, they were already starting to run in circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Bai Xiaochun’s despair, he found that the Core Formation cultivators were slowly getting closer and closer. Furthermore, the teleportation effect had not yet activated. Worse, the Core Formation cultivators were splitting up into three groups to try to surround him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was really on the verge of going crazy. Eyes completely bloodshot, he shouted, “You people are forcing me to do this!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get over here, little turtle!” When the little turtle heard this, his eyes immediately lit up, and he shot toward Bai Xiaochun’s outstretched hand. Then, he let out a whoop as Bai Xiaochun tossed him violently into the air!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA whizzing sound could be heard as the little turtle turned into nothing but a blur of afterimages. This was a type of speed that Core Formation cultivators couldn’t match. In the blink of an eye, he had landed smack dab onto the right cheek of a burly man from the Polarity River Court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds echoed out as the burly man screamed and staggered backward, blood spraying out of his mouth along with quite a few chunks of teeth. When he looked up, a black turtle mark could be seen on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had a head, a tail, four limbs, and seemed very lifelike....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe burly man’s jaw dropped, and he reached up to rub the side of his face. When he realized that the mark wouldn’t rub off, he looked over at the cultivator from the Starry River Court who had a similar mark, and then his eyes turned completely bloodshot. Roaring with rage, he shot directly toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, he even unleashed some unique divine ability that caused him to suddenly accelerate past everyone else. Shockingly, it took him only a moment to be right in front of Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time to die, Bai Xiaochun!” The burly man extended his right hand, and a powerful Core Formation aura erupted, creating a huge vortex. At the same time, the indistinct image of a huge devil hand appeared behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevil qi swirled out, pouring into the devil hand as it shot toward Bai Xiaochun to grab him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it closed in, it grew larger, until it was fully 300 meters tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun let out a shout as he waved his right hand, summoning a violet cauldron which instantly smashed into the devil hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntense rumbling sounds echoed out. This violet qi cauldron was formed by the power of a Heaven-Dao Gold Core, causing the devil hand to collapse as soon as it was hit. The resulting shockwave caused the burly man from the Polarity River Court to cough up a huge mouthful of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun wasn’t harmed in the least, and yet his anger continued to burn. Reaching his right hand up into the air, he shouted, “Little turtle!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little turtle immediately flew back into his hand, after which he strode over to the burly man and reached his hand back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now I’ll give you another!” he howled, then smashed the little turtle down onto the burly man’s other cheek. Then he hit his chest, and before the man could react, had hit him in nearly a dozen other places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood sprayed out of the man\u0027s mouth, and his eyes burned with madness. Finally, he drew upon his own life force to shove Bai Xiaochun and then speed away, the madness in his eyes replaced by terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he fled, it was possible to see more than a dozen little turtle marks all over him....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bring it on!” Bai Xiaochun yelled confidently. Just when he was about to give voice to some taunts, more than a dozen magical techniques descended toward him like rainwater. The sight of so many lightning bolts, seas of flame, vortexes, wild winds and vines caused Bai Xiaochun’s heart to seize with fear. Immediately, he fell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, countless magical techniques slammed into the spot he had just been occupying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You people are too brutal! Stop ganging up! If you have what it takes, come fight me one at a time!” Drawing upon the Undying Live Forever Technique, and his powerful fleshly body, he continued to flee at top speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Yunshan from the Starry River Court immediately yelled out, “We have to team up to deal with a shameless villain like you! If we kill you together, it won’t matter that we broke the rules!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words instantly bolstered the killing resolve of many in the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chen Yunshan!” Bai Xiaochun yelled, glaring over at him. He had been targeting Bai Xiaochun from the beginning, and that left Bai Xiaochun feeling very angry. Seeing how he continued to try to incite the crowd, Bai Xiaochun angrily threw out the little turtle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hit him in the mouth! Shut him up!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little turtle sailed excitedly through the air. When he appeared directly in front of Chen Yunshan, Chen Yunshan’s face fell, and he tried to dodge. But he simply wasn’t capable of evading the little turtle. A boom rang out as the little turtle slammed into his face, sending all of his teeth flying out of his mouth as he staggered backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bai Xiaochun!!” he screamed. Eyes completely bloodshot, Chen Yunshan ignored the mark which had just been left on his face and performed a double-handed incantation gesture. Instantly, streams of starlight power descended onto him, giving him blinding speed as he chased after Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e--\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranslator:\u003c/strong\u003e Deathblade.\u003cstrong\u003e Chinese language consultant:\u003c/strong\u003e ASI a.k.a.
