{"id":39634,"no":41,"title":"CHAPTER XLI. THE DAY AFTER.","content":"\u0026nbsp;When Mr. Simnel woke on the morning succeeding the night of Kate Mellon\u0027s death, he felt a numbness in his limbs, a burning, throbbing pain in his head, and a general sensation of prostration. He made an attempt at getting up, thinking he would string himself into vigour with his cold bath; but he found his head whirling--his legs shaking; and, after a severe shivering fit, he was fain to forego the attempt, and to get into bed again. Then he rang his bell, and told his servant to ask Dr. Prater to step round at once, and then to go on to Mr. Scadgers, whom he was to bring back with him. The servant despatched, Mr. Simnel lay back in bed, and endeavoured to give himself up to reflection. But the events of the last twenty-four hours had been far too exciting for that; still lay stretched before his eyes the crushed and mangled figure of his loved one; still her last broken words rung upon his ears. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Dearest, kindest Robert!\u0027 she called me that--my darling called me that with her last breath. \u0027Dearest kindest Robert!\u0027--the last words! never to see her any more--never to hear her voice again! All over now; all--No, not all; one thing to be done, and done at once --a settlement with Charles Beresford!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Simnel smiled very grimly as this idea came into his mind. It was not the first time that the idea had occurred to him. As, bit by bit, he gleaned poor Kitty\u0027s incoherent story, as he knelt by her bed, he had rapidly framed his course of action, and indeed carried it out in his mind. He saw himself thrashing Beresford in the streets--saw the row that would take place thereon consequent, the desperate confusion at the Tin-Tax Office; and, through the perspective, had a distant vision of a long stretch of sand on the Calais coast--he and Beresford fronting each other as principals, a couple of soldiers from the neighbouring caserne as seconds, and an army medical man looking on. He knew that Beresford was a man of courage; but he thought that he would probably refuse to fight in such an affair as this; therefore Simnel determined that no option should be given. He would not have a friend of his wait on Beresford with a challenge. He (Simnel) would pick a quarrel with him on some frivolous pretext, and insult him in the street. That was what he had made up his mind to do, and that was what he had intended to do that very day, if his sudden indisposition had not prevented him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Little Dr. Prater found his patient very restless and tolerably impatient. \"Well, my dear sir, and how are we? Glad I was at home, and able to come round at once. A fortunate chance to catch me, for there is a great deal of sickness just now amongst the upper classes. The tongue? Thank you. The pulse? Ah; dear me, dear me! as I feared--a galloping pulse, my dear sir, and a high state of fever! Have you now--have you had any cause for excitement?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" said Simnel, shortly; \"I was last night at the deathbed of one very dear to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"To be sure, my dear sir; how came I to forget it!--Miss Kate Mellon\u0027s. Oh, my dear sir, of course I heard of it,--I hear every thing,--at least, I heard of her being very ill--impossible to live. Slade attended, didn\u0027t he? Ah, couldn\u0027t have a better man. One of the rough diamonds of our profession, my dear sir; not polished, but--all here!\" and the little doctor laid his forefinger on his forehead. \"And so she\u0027s gone, poor young lady! Well, well! Now, my dear sir, it\u0027s my duty to prescribe for you the utmost quietude. The least bit of excitement may be highly prejudicial; in fact, I would not answer for the consequences.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When shall I be able to go out?\" asked Simnel impatiently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Go out, my dear sir! Not for several days--perhaps longer. I will send in a nurse to look after you; for you must be carefully watched, and have your medicines at stated times; and I\u0027ll look in this evening.

The old gentleman, clad in his never-varying rusty black, and still as desirous as ever to hide his hands under his coat-sleeves, received Frank in his usual icy manner, and bade him sit down. \"I have here,\" said he, \"a letter for you from the late Sir Marmaduke Wentworth, with the contents of which I am not acquainted; but which refers, I believe, to the will, a copy of which I also have here.
