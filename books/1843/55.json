Too agitated to sit, he stood with Hugh and Edwin and strained to overhear the king\u0027s conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn ignored the barons as he once again addressed Gillian. \"Where is it?\" he demanded urgently, and before she could respond, he asked, \"Do you have Arianna\u0027s treasure with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my lord, but I think I know where it\u0027s hidden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think?\" he repeated in a near shout. \"You aren\u0027t certain? If I have made this journey on a whim, I assure you I will be displeased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was turning red, and she hurried to explain before he completely lost his temper and went into one of his famous rages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t have time to look for myself, but I\u0027m certain it\u0027s here… at Dunhanshire. Just a short walk away,\" she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer explanation calmed him. \"If the treasure is recovered, you do realize that it will prove without a doubt that your father was involved in the murder of Arianna?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she shouldn\u0027t argue with the king, but she couldn\u0027t stop herself from defending her father. \"I was told… and I believe… that my father was an honorable man, and honorable men do not kill innocent women.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I, too, believed your father was a loyal subject and a good man,\" John said, \"…until he betrayed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot believe that he did betray you,\" she whispered. \"My mother had only just passed away, and my father was mourning her at home… here, my lord, at Dunhanshire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know he wasn\u0027t in court when Arianna died, but Alford is convinced that he was in league with another. Aye, the man who killed Arianna passed the treasure to your father. If the treasure is here, it proves Alford\u0027s theory is correct.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what to say to convince you that my father was innocent,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon we may have proof that he was a blackheart. If you had kept silent about the treasure\u0027s whereabouts, I never would have known for certain that your father betrayed me. Why, then, did you send for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alford imprisoned my Uncle Morgan and told me that he would kill him if I didn\u0027t go to the Highlands and find my sister. Alford believed she had the box, and I was ordered to bring her and the treasure back to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn glanced at Bridgid but otherwise continued to ignore her as he defended his baron\u0027s actions. \"Alford\u0027s zeal in helping me with my search for Arianna\u0027s treasure has not dimmed over the years, and I cannot fault him for going to such extremes. Besides, it appears the end might justify the means.\" Smiling as though he were a father explaining his precocious son\u0027s behavior, he added, \"But he has his faults, and one is greed. I\u0027m sure he wanted you to bring the treasure to him so that he could give it to me and collect the reward. I would do the same thing, and so, apparently, would you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lord, I don\u0027t want a reward. Truly I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Uncle Morgan is one of your faithful barons, and I ask that you protect him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is all you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king\u0027s disposition shifted as quick as a bolt of lightning, and he was suddenly charming and solicitous. Though she had heard about his radical changes of mood, she was still caught off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have just spoken at length with Morgan,\" he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian\u0027s voice shook when she asked, \"He is well, my lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s old and tired and making outrageous accusations, but he is well. You\u0027ll see him soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears clouded her vision. \"Thank you, my lord,\" she whispered. \"I know you are anxious to see if the treasure is here, but if I may, I would ask…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m wrong and the box isn\u0027t here, please don\u0027t take your displeasure out on my Uncle Morgan. He had nothing to do with this. I alone am responsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I should therefore turn my wrath on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn sighed. \"I have waited over fifteen years for the return of the treasure, and I find that anticipation increases my joy and my sadness. I don\u0027t want to hurry,\" he explained. \"For the possible disappointment will be very painful for me. As for Morgan,\" he continued. \"I assure you that even if the treasure isn\u0027t here, your uncle will still have my protection, and so shall you. Do you think me an ogre? I will not hold you responsible for your father\u0027s crimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough she knew that at this moment he was sincere, she also knew how swiftly he could change his mind. She didn\u0027t dare put her faith in his promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are very kind, my lord,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can upon occasion be kind,\" he arrogantly agreed. \"Now answer a question for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you married to the giant barbarian with the long golden hair named Laird Buchanan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian swayed. \"I am his wife, my lord,\" she stammered. \"He is here… you have seen him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, I\u0027ve seen him,\" he drawled. \"And he is indeed here, with two other lairds and an army at their side. The Highlanders surround Dunhanshire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid\u0027s deep indrawn breath drew the king\u0027s attention. \"I\u0027ve been ignoring you far too long, my dear. Forgive me my poor manners and tell me, who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is my dearest friend,\" Gillian said. \"Her name is Bridgid KirkConnell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridgid smiled at the king, and within a heartbeat he was smiling back. \"Ah, you are the lady the Laird Sinclair has come for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do belong to his clan, my lord,\" she whispered, nervous to have the king\u0027s undivided attention. \"And I am one of his many loyal followers, but he wouldn\u0027t come all this way just for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king laughed. \"From the way he was ranting at me, I believe you\u0027re mistaken. I must admit the Highlanders are an impressive and intimidating lot, to be sure. When I saw them, I considered returning to London to get additional troops, and I was certainly urged to do just that by my guard,\" he added. \"But then the three lairds separated from their men and rode hard to intercept me. It seems they had only just found out that the two of you were inside, and they were… highly agitated. I commanded them to stay outside the walls, and I will tell you that I was most unhappy when Laird Maitland dared to argue with me. When I told him that you had sent for me, and that I would not allow any harm to come to you, they grudgingly agreed to wait. Why did you come all this way, Bridgid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Gillian, hoping she would explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baron Alford believes Bridgid is my sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she isn\u0027t,\" the king said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my lord, she isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We lied to Baron Alford,\" Bridgid blurted. \"But Gillian told me I mustn\u0027t lie to you, my lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king seemed amused by Bridgid\u0027s honesty. \"And she was right,\" he said before turning to Gillian again. \"And what of your sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian bowed her head. \"She is forever lost to us, my lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded, accepting what she said as fact. Alford interrupted the conversation then by offering the king refreshments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll dine with you when I return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Return, my lord?\" Alford asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" John answered. \"Lady Gillian is going to show me where she believes Arianna\u0027s treasure is hidden. We will not know for certain that it\u0027s here until we look for ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlford took a step toward his commander and motioned for him to come to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn smiled at Gillian. \"Shall we go then?\" he asked as he stepped back and graciously offered his arm to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand trembled when she placed it on the king\u0027s arm. Noticing her distress, John put his hand on top of hers, gave it an affectionate pat, and commanded that she cease being afraid of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a loyal subject, are you not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my lord, I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, as I said before, you have nothing to fear from me. Do you know, Gillian, that you remind me of her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Arianna, my lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face dropped, and he became melancholy. \"Aye, she was my Arianna, and though your eyes are not the same color as hers, they are as beautiful. I loved her, you know, as I have never loved any other woman. She was… perfection. I often wonder what course my life would have taken had she lived. She brought out the good in me, and when I was with her, I wanted to be… different.\" He sounded like a very young boy now in the throes of his first love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king suddenly pulled away from her and turned to Alford, for he\u0027d only just noticed his friend was in deep discussion with one of his soldiers. John lashed out, berating the baron for his rudeness, reminding him that when he was in the room, it was the law of England that he, and only he, be the center of attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving just been duly chastised, Alford bowed his head while he gave John his apology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you discussing with your soldier?\" John demanded. \"It must have been important for you to be so impertinent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Horace is one of your most loyal soldiers, and I was telling him that I would ask you it you would allow him and three other worthy men the honor of escorting you and Gillian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a negligible shrug, John granted permission. \"We won\u0027t be gone long,\" he said, and then he commanded his soldiers, \"All of you stay here. No one leaves this hall until I return. Bridgid, my dear, will you please wait here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my lord,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlford drew the king\u0027s attention yet again. \"May I accompany you and Gillian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down,\" John commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlford didn\u0027t heed the warning in the king\u0027s voice and dared to ask a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrritated with his baron, John decided to make him suffer. \"No, you may not come along,\" he said once again. \"And while Gillian and I are taking our stroll, I suggest that you and Hugh and Edwin stay away from the open windows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlford looked confused by the suggestion. John chuckled as he explained. \"Did I forget to mention that Dunhanshire is completely surrounded by Highlanders? Ah, I can see from your expression I did forget. How remiss of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The heathens are here?\" Alford\u0027s eyes bulged, and he swallowed loudly as he tried to get past his surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just said that they were,\" John replied. \"You do know why they\u0027ve come, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlford feigned ignorance. \"No, my lord, I don\u0027t know why. How could I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn grinned, enjoying his friend\u0027s discomfort. He was annoyed with Alford for being so impudent in his presence and also because of the mischief he\u0027d caused with Baron Morgan. The king had few loyal lords now, and even though Morgan wasn\u0027t a favored baron, he was well thought of by the others, and his voice in support of John\u0027s policies could well make a difference in the future. Alford\u0027s zeal in trying to locate Arianna\u0027s treasure had put his king in the middle of a squabble, and he planned to make his friend suffer a bit longer before he forgave him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, he would always forgive him for the simple reason that Alford had brought Arianna to him. No matter how severe his transgressions were, John would never forget that most wondrous gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking to make him squirm now, he explained the Highlanders\u0027 mission. \"Would you like me to tell you why they\u0027ve come all this way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you are so inclined,\" Alford replied smoothly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want to kill you. Let me try to remember their exact words. Ah, yes, I recall now. The tallest one… his name is Maitland. He told me he\u0027s going to tear your heart out with his bare hands and shove it down your throat. Isn\u0027t that amusing? He\u0027s big enough to do it,\" he added with a chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king didn\u0027t expect an answer and continued on. \"All three of the lairds were arguing—and in front of me, mind you—as to which one has the right to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlford forced a smile. \"Yes, that is amusing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve also made threats against you, Edwin, and you as well, Hugh. The Buchanan laird has gotten it into his head that one of you struck Lady Gillian. He believes he now has the right to cut off the culprit\u0027s hands. Oh, he also mentioned cutting your feet off, Alford, or did I already mention that threat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlford shook his head. \"You should kill them for threatening your friends,\" Alford cried. \"Aren\u0027t we loyal to each other? You and I have been through many trying times, and I have always stood by your side against your enemies, including the pope. Kill them,\" he demanded with a shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Gillian cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn patted her arm. \"See how you have upset this dear lady? Come along, Gillian. This discussion can wait until we return, but I assure you, I have no plans to kill the lairds. Even I know that I would have every man in the Highlands at my doorstep, and I have enough disruption in my kingdom at the moment. I don\u0027t need more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors were thrown open and they stepped outside. Gillian was looking down at the steps as she lifted her skirts, and when she looked up again, she came to a dead stop and gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, standing in the center of the courtyard, were Iain and Ramsey and Brodick. They were all armed, with their swords in their scabbards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrodick\u0027s eyes seemed to blaze with anger, and he was staring at her. She couldn\u0027t take her gaze off him, and he looked as if he couldn\u0027t wait to get his hands on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn had given orders that they were to remain outside the walls, and he therefore didn\u0027t know what to make of the lairds\u0027 appearance. How, then, had they gotten inside? More curious than angry, he glanced at Gillian and asked, \"You willingly pledged yourself to that laird?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did willingly marry him, my lord,\" she answered. \"And I love him very much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what they say is true. Love is surely blind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot knowing if he was jesting and expected her to laugh, or serious and expected her agreement, she remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she moved closer to Brodick, he shifted his position until his legs were braced apart and he took up twice the space. Iain and Ramsey immediately did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir message was clear. They weren\u0027t going to let Gillian get past them, and she knew that if she and the king tried to walk around them, they\u0027d block them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the king\u0027s soldiers stood in the background with their hands on the hilt of their swords, watching and waiting for John\u0027s command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lairds seemed impervious to the soldiers, and Gillian was frantic with worry for their safety. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-55.html","bookId":1843,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM"}
