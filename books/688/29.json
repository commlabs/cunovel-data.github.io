He had made up his mind, however, and he meant to carry it through. He let her lean on his bosom and sob away her grief.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And can\u0027t I ever see you—even just a little bit?\" she moaned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" he said firmly. \"Can you not see, Mary, that there is no place in the[103] world where I could keep you that that woman could not track me to?

You are right, and I must make the sacrifice. I will go—I can bear it, I guess. But oh, Jim, I never really loved any one but you, and I never shall.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall never forget you,\" said he. \"And I will give you all you need, Mary,—you won\u0027t have to worry about money.\" But the girl scarcely heard him; she was not thinking about money.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And where will you go?\" he asked finally.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said she. \"I have no home.

His hand shook like an[106] autumn leaf as he stretched it out to her. \"A locket! a locket!\" he gasped. \"My God! Have you got it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" cried the girl, in astonishment, and she went to the bureau. She held it to him as he ran toward her, and he took one glance at it and staggered back like a man struck to the heart with a knife. He gave one wild, horrible cry, and clutched his hands to his head, and reeled, and would have fallen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But Mary had sprung to him in terror. \"Jim! Jim!\" she cried, \"what is it?\" She would have caught him, but he shrunk from her touch as from a wild beast. \"No! no!\" he screamed, and crouched in the corner with eyes of dreadful fear. \"No! go back!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But, Jim,\" cried the girl, \"what is it?

Jim!\" she cried[107] hysterically, \"you must tell me what it is—you must—you must! Do you know who my father was?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" he gasped, writhing, \"I know—I know!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And who was he?

As he felt the warmth of her breath and the pressure of her arms about him, it sent a sudden shudder through his frame, and he flung her away with a force that sent her reeling across the floor. Then he staggered to his feet, and with a moan he rushed to the door. He caught one glimpse of the girl\u0027s face, and then fled madly down the steps.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Outside his cab was waiting. He did not see it, and started away; but the driver shouted to him, and that brought him to his senses for an instant.
