There are two messages for you, Miss Evans. You\u0027re to call Mrs. Hudson. I put the number on your dresser. And your mother called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana walked into the study, Kemal was at his computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up. \"Hey, you\u0027re back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m back,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s dope. I was hoping you\u0027d be here for Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana hugged him. \"You bet. I wouldn\u0027t have missed it for the world.

I have a couple of calls to make. I\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad news first, Dana thought. She called her mother\u0027s number. She had not spoken to her since the incident in Westport. How could she have married a man like that? Dana listened to the phone ring several times, then her mother\u0027s recorded voice came on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not home right now, but if you leave a message, we will call you back. Wait for the tone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana waited. \"Merry Christmas, Mother.\" She hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next call was to Pamela.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dana, I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re back!\" Pamela Hudson exclaimed. \"We heard on the news that Jeff is away, but Roger and I are having a few people over for an early Christmas dinner tomorrow, and we want you and Kemal here. Please don\u0027t tell me you have other plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dana said. \"As a matter of fact, I don\u0027t. And we would love to come. Thank you, Pamela.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful. We\u0027ll expect you at five o\u0027clock. Casual.\" She paused. \"How are things going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Dana said frankly. \"I don\u0027t know if they\u0027re going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, forget about everything for now. Get some rest. We\u0027ll see you both tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana and Kemal arrived at the Hudsons\u0027 on Christmas Day, they were greeted at the door by Cesar. His face lit up when he saw Dana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Evans! I\u0027m so pleased to see you.\" He smiled at Kemal. \"And Master Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Cesar,\" Kemal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana handed Cesar a brightly wrapped package. \"Merry Christmas, Cesar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what - \" He was stammering. \"I didn\u0027t - you\u0027re too kind, Miss Evans!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gentle giant, as Dana thought of him, was blushing. Dana handed him two more packages. \"These are for Mr. and Mrs. Hudson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Miss Evans. I will put them under the tree. Mr. and Mrs. Hudson are in the drawing room.\" Cesar led the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePamela said, \"You\u0027re here! We\u0027re so glad you two could make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are we,\" Dana assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePamela was looking at Kemal\u0027s right arm. \"Dana, Kemal has a - that\u0027s wonderful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana grinned. \"Isn\u0027t it? Courtesy of my boss. He\u0027s quite a fellow. I think it\u0027s changed Kemal\u0027s whole life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you how pleased I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger nodded. \"Congratulations, Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Mr. Hudson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoger Hudson said to Dana, \"Before the other guests arrive, there\u0027s something I should mention. Remember I said that Taylor Winthrop told friends he had retired from public life and then became ambassador to Russia?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I suppose the president pressured him to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought. But it seems that it was Winthrop who pressured the president to appoint him ambassador. The question is, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other guests began to arrive. There were only twelve other people at the dinner, and the evening was warm and festive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dessert, everyone went into the drawing room. In front of the fireplace was a huge Christmas tree. There were gifts for everyone, but Kemal got the lion\u0027s share: computer games, Rollerblades, a sweater, gloves, and videotapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time passed swiftly. The joy of being with such friendly people, after the stress of the last few days, was immense. I just wish Jeff were here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana Evans was sitting at the anchor desk, waiting for the eleven o\u0027clock news to begin. Beside her was coanchor, Richard Melton. Maury Falstein was seated in the chair usually occupied by Jeff. Dana tried not to think about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Melton was saying to Dana, \"I miss you when you\u0027re away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana smiled. \"Thanks, Richard. Miss you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been gone quite a bit. Is everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go for a bite afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to see that Kemal\u0027s all right first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can meet somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe must meet somewhere else. I think I\u0027m being watched. The aviary section at the zoo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelton continued. \"They say that you\u0027re checking out some big story. Want to talk about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to talk about yet, Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard on the grapevine that Cromwell isn\u0027t too happy that you\u0027re away so much. I hope you don\u0027t get into trouble with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me give you some advice. Don\u0027t go looking for trouble, or you\u0027re going to find it. That\u0027s a promise. Dana was finding it hard to concentrate on what Richard Melton was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He likes to fire people,\" Melton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill Kelly disappeared the day after the fire. He didn\u0027t pick up his check, just left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Melton kept talking. \"As God is my witness, I don\u0027t want to work with a new anchor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe witness to the accident was an American tourist, Ralph Benjamin. A blind man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five - four - three - two...\" Anastasia Mann pointed a finger at Dana. The camera\u0027s red light flashed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe announcer\u0027s voice boomed out, \"This is the eleven o\u0027clock news on WTN with Dana Evans and Richard Melton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana smiled into the camera. \"Good evening. I\u0027m Dana Evans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m Richard Melton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were back on the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Today in Arlington, three students at Wilson High School were arrested after police searched their lockers and found seven ounces of marijuana and various weapons, including a stolen handgun. Holly Rapp has more on this story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don\u0027t have too many art thefts, and the MO is always the same. This is different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe broadcast was over. Richard Melton looked at Dana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we meet later?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not tonight, Richard. There\u0027s something I have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose. \"Okay.\" Dana had a feeling he wanted to ask her about Jeff. Instead he said, \"See you tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana stood up. \"Good night, everybody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana walked out of the studio and went to her office. She sat down, turned on her computer, logged on to the Internet, and began searching again through the myriad articles about Taylor Winthrop. On one of the Web sites, Dana came across an item about Marcel Falcon, a French government official who had been ambassador to NATO. The article mentioned Marcel Falcon negotiating a trade agreement with Taylor Winthrop. In the middle of negotiations, Falcon had given up his government post and retired. In the middle of a government negotiation? What could have happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana tried other Web sites, but there was no further information on Marcel Falcon. Very strange. I have to look into that, Dana decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Dana was finished, it was twoA. M . Too early to telephone Europe. She went back to the apartment. Mrs. Daley was waiting up for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m so late,\" Dana said. \"I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. I saw your broadcast tonight. I thought it was wonderful as always, Miss Evans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Daley sighed. \"I just wish all the news wasn\u0027t so dreadful. What kind of world are we living in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a good question. How is Kemal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The little devil\u0027s fine. I let him beat me at rummy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana smiled. \"Good. Thank you, Mrs. Daley. If you want to come in late tomorrow - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. I\u0027ll be here bright and early to get you all off to school and work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana watched Mrs. Daley leave. A gem, she thought gratefully. Her cell phone rang. She ran to pick it up. \"Jeff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry Christmas, dearest.\" His voice washed through her body. \"Am I calling too late?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never too late. Tell me about Rachel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeff means she\u0027s back at her house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a nurse here, but Rachel will only let her stay until tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana hated to ask. \"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The test results indicate that the cancer has spread. Rachel doesn\u0027t want me to leave yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. I don\u0027t mean to sound selfish, but isn\u0027t there someone else who - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has no one, darling. She\u0027s all alone and panicky. She won\u0027t have anyone else here. I honestly don\u0027t know what Rachel would do if I left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do if you stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want to start chemotherapy immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long will it take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll need a treatment every three weeks for four months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt has asked me to take a leave of absence. I\u0027m so sorry about all this, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did he mean that? Sorry about his job? Sorry about Rachel? Or sorry that our lives are being torn apart? How can I be so selfish? Dana asked herself. The woman may be dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, too,\" Dana finally said. \"I hope everything turns out all right.\"Turns out all right for whom? For Rachel and Jeff? For Jeff and me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jeff put down the phone, he looked up and saw Rachel standing there. She was wearing a nightgown and a robe. She looked lovely, with an almost translucent light about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was Dana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Jeff said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel moved closer to him. \"Poor darling. I know how much this is hurting you both. I - I just couldn\u0027t have gone through all this without you. I needed you, Jeff. I need you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana arrived at her office early in the morning and logged on to the Internet again. Two items caught her attention. Separately, they were innocuous, but together, they suggested a mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first item read: \"Vincent Mancino, the Italian minister of commerce, has unexpectedly resigned during trade contract negotiations with Taylor Winthrop, the representative for the United States. Mancino\u0027s assistant, Ivo Vale, took over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second item read: \"Taylor Winthrop, special adviser to NATO in Brussels, has asked to be replaced and has returned to his home in Washington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcel Falcon had resigned, Vincent Mancino had resigned, Taylor Winthrop had quit unexpectedly. Were they connected? Coincidence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana\u0027s first call was to Dominick Romano, who worked for the Italia 1 network in Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dana! It\u0027s good to hear from you. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming to Rome, and I\u0027d like to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bene! What about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana hesitated. \"I\u0027d rather discuss it when I get there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there Saturday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will bring out the fatted pasta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana\u0027s next call was to Jean Somville, who was working in Brussels at the press headquarters of NATO on the rue des Chapeliers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jean? Dana Evans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dana! I haven\u0027t seen you since Sarajevo. Those were some times. You ever going back there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grimaced. \"Not if I can help it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you, cherie ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming to Brussels in the next few days. Will you be around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you? Certainly. Something special going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dana said quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. You\u0027re just sight-seeing, huh?\" There was a skeptical note in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"I look forward to it. Au revoir. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Au revoir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt Baker would like to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him I\u0027ll be right there, Olivia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more phone calls and Dana was on her way to Matt\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said without preamble, \"We may have lucked into something. I heard a story last night that might be a clue to what we\u0027re looking for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana felt her heart quicken. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a man named\" - he consulted a slip of paper on his desk -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Dieter Zander, in D��sseldorf. He was in some kind of business with Taylor Winthrop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana was listening intently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have the whole story, but apparently something very bad happened between them. They had a violent falling-out, and Zander swore to kill Winthrop. It sounds like it might be worth checking on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It certainly does. I\u0027ll look into it right away, Matt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey chatted for a few more minutes, then Dana left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder how I can find out more about it? She suddenly thought of Jack Stone and FRA. He might know something. She found the private number he had given her and called it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice came on the line. \"Jack Stone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Dana Evans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Miss Evans. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to find something out about a man named Zander in D��sseldorf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dieter Zander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.
