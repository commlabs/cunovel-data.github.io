{"id":78585,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe scene as Julie and I make our way out of the airport resembles either a wedding procession or a buffet line. The Dead are lined up in the halls to watch us pass. Every last one of them is here. They look restless, agitated, and would clearly love to devour Julie, but they don\u0027t move or make a sound. Over Julie\u0027s heated protests I asked M to escort us out. He follows a few paces behind, huge and vigilant, scanning the crowd like a Secret Service agent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unnatural silence of a room full of people who don\u0027t breathe is surreal. I swear I can hear Julie\u0027s heart pounding. She is trying to walk steady and look cool, but her darting eyes betray her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you sure about this?\u0027 she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s like . . . hundreds of them.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Keep you safe.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Right, right, safe, how could I forget.\u0027 Her voice grows very small. \u0027Seriously, R . . . I mean, I\u0027ve seen you kick ass, but you know if someone decides to ring the dinner bell right now I\u0027m going to be sushi.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They . . . won\u0027t,\u0027 I tell her with a surprising degree of confidence. \u0027We\u0027re . . . new thing. Haven\u0027t . . . seen before. Look at them.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks closer at the surrounding faces, and I hope she can see what I\u0027ve been seeing. The strange array of their reactions to us, to the anomaly we represent. I know they will let us through, but Julie seems unconvinced. A tight wheeze creeps into her breathing. She fumbles in her messenger bag and pulls out an inhaler, takes a hit from it and holds it in, eyes still darting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027ll . . . be okay,\u0027 M says in his low rumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe expels the breath and whips her head around to glare at him. \u0027Who the fuck asked you, you fucking blood sausage? I should have hedge-trimmed you in half yesterday.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM chuckles and raises his eyebrows at me. \u0027Got . . . a live one . . . \"R\".\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continue unmolested all the way to the Departures gate. As we step out into the daylight, I feel a nervous buzz in my stomach. At first I think it\u0027s just the ever-present terror of the open sky, now looming over us in bruised shades of grey and purple, boiling with high-altitude thunderheads. But it\u0027s not the sky. It\u0027s the sound. That low, warbling tone, like baritone madmen humming nursery rhymes. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve just gotten more attuned to it or if it\u0027s actually louder, but I hear it even before the Boneys make their appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Shit, oh shit,\u0027 Julie whispers to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey march around both corners of the loading zone and form a line in front of us. There are more of them than I\u0027ve ever seen in one place. I had no idea there even were this many, at least not in our airport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Problem,\u0027 M says. \u0027They look . . . pissed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s right. There is something different in their demeanour. Their body language seems stiffer, if that\u0027s possible. Yesterday they were a jury stepping in to review our case. Today they are judges, announcing the sentence. Or perhaps executioners, executing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Leaving!\u0027 I shout at them. \u0027Taking her back! So they won\u0027t . . . come here!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe skeletons don\u0027t move or respond. Their bones harmonise in some sour alien key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What . . . do you want?\u0027 I demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire front row raises its arms in unison and points at Julie. It strikes me how wrong this is, how fundamentally different these creatures are from the rest of us. The Dead are adrift on a foggy sea of ennui. They don\u0027t do things in unison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Taking her back!\u0027 I shout louder, faltering in my attempt at reasonable discourse. \u0027If . . . kill her . . . they\u0027ll come here. Kill . . . us!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no hesitation, no time for them to consider anything I\u0027ve said; their response is predetermined and immediate. In unison, like demon monks chanting Hell\u0027s vespers, they emit that noise from their chest cavities. That proud crow of unyielding conviction, and although it\u0027s wordless, I understand exactly what it\u0027s saying:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo need to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo need to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything is already known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe will not leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will kill her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is how things are done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways has been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways will be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Julie. She is trembling. I grip her hand and look at M. He nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the pulse-warmth of Julie\u0027s hand flooding through my icy fingers, I run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe bolt left, trying to dodge around the edge of the Boneys\u0027 platoon. As they clatter forward to block my path, M surges out in front of me and rams his bulk into the nearest row, knocking them into a pile of hooked limbs and interlocked ribcages. A fierce blast of their invisible horn stabs the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are you doing?\u0027 Julie gasps as I drag her behind me. I am actually running faster than her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Keep you sa - \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t you even think about saying \"keep you safe\"!\u0027 she shrieks. \u0027This is about as far from safe as I\u0027ve ever - \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screams as a skinless hand pinches down on her shoulder and digs in. The creature\u0027s jaw opens to sink its filed fangs into her neck, but I grab it by the spine and wrench it off her. I fling it to the concrete as hard as I can, but there is no impact and no shattering of bones. The thing almost seems to float in defiance of gravity, its ribcage barely touching the ground before springing upright again, lurching towards my face like some hideous, unkillable insect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027M!\u0027 I croak as it grapples for my throat. \u0027Help!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM is busy trying to peel skeletons off his arms, legs and back, but he seems to be standing his ground thanks to his superior mass. As I struggle to keep the skeleton\u0027s fingers out of my eyes, M lumbers towards me, pulls the thing off me, and flings it into three others about to jump on him from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Go!\u0027 he yells and shoves me forward, then turns to face our pursuers. I grab Julie\u0027s hand and dash towards our target. Finally, she sees it. The Mercedes. \u0027Oh!\u0027 she pants. \u0027Okay!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe jump in the car and I bring the engine to life. \u0027Oh Mercey . . .\u0027 Julie says, stroking the dashboard like a beloved pet. \u0027So happy to see you right now.\u0027 I put the car in gear and release the clutch, gunning us forward. Somehow, it seems easy now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM has given up trying to fight and is now just running for his life with a mob of skeletons trailing behind him. Hundreds of zombies stand outside the Departures entry area, watching everything in silence. What are they thinking? Are they thinking? Is there any chance they\u0027re forming a reaction to this event unfolding in front of them? This sudden explosion of anarchy in the state-approved programme of their lives?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM cuts across the street, directly across our exit route, and I floor the accelerator. M crosses in front of us, then the Boneys cross in front of us, then four thousand pounds of German engineering smashes into their brittle, ossified bodies. They shatter. Bits of anatomy fly everywhere. Two thigh bones, three hands and half a cranium land inside the car, where they vibrate and twitch on the seats, releasing dry gasps and insectile buzzes. Julie hurls them out of the car and frantically wipes her hands on her sweatshirt, shuddering in revulsion and whimpering, \u0027Oh my God oh my God.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we are safe. Julie is safe. We roar past the Arrivals gates, onto the freeway, and out into the wider world while the storm clouds churn overhead. I look at Julie. She looks at me. We both smile as the first raindrops begin to fall. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warm-bodies-warm-bodies-1/page-9.html","bookId":2434,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:01 PM"}
