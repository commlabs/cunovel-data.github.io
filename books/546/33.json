I says \"Hold on!\" and it stopped alongside, and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that\u0027s got a dry throat, and then says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I hain\u0027t ever done you no harm. You know that. So, then, what you want to come back and ha\u0027nt ME for?\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I hain\u0027t come back -- I hain\u0027t been GONE.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn\u0027t quite satisfied yet. He says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn\u0027t on you. Honest injun, you ain\u0027t a ghost?\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Honest injun, I ain\u0027t,\" I says. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well -- I -- I -- well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can\u0027t somehow seem to understand it no way. Looky here, warn\u0027t you ever murdered AT ALL?\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I warn\u0027t ever murdered at all -- I played it on them. You come in here and feel of me if you don\u0027t believe me.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again he didn\u0027t know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? He said, let him alone a minute, and don\u0027t disturb him. So he thought and thought, and pretty soon he says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right; I\u0027ve got it. Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on it\u0027s your\u0027n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I\u0027ll go towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you; and you needn\u0027t let on to know me at first.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All right; but wait a minute. There\u0027s one more thing -- a thing that NOBODY don\u0027t know but me. And that is, there\u0027s a nigger here that I\u0027m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is JIM -- old Miss Watson\u0027s Jim.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\" What ! Why, Jim is --\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and went to studying. I says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027ll say. You\u0027ll say it\u0027s dirty, lowdown business; but what if it is? I\u0027m low down; and I\u0027m a-going to steal him, and I want you keep mum and not let on. Will you?\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis eye lit up, and he says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll HELP you steal him!\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most astonishing speech I ever heard -- and I\u0027m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation. Only I couldn\u0027t believe it. Tom Sawyer a NIGGER-STEALER! \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shucks!\" I says; \"you\u0027re joking.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I ain\u0027t joking, either.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" I says, \"joking or no joking, if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger, don\u0027t forget to remember that YOU don\u0027t know nothing about him, and I don\u0027t know nothing about him.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way and I drove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door, and he says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, this is wonderful! Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it? I wish we\u0027d a timed her. And she hain\u0027t sweated a hair -- not a hair. It\u0027s wonderful. Why, I wouldn\u0027t take a hundred dollars for that horse now -- I wouldn\u0027t, honest; and yet I\u0027d a sold her for fifteen before, and thought \u0027twas all she was worth.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see. But it warn\u0027t surprising; because he warn\u0027t only just a farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too. There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way, down South. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn about half an hour Tom\u0027s wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty yards, and says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, there\u0027s somebody come! I wonder who \u0027tis? Why, I do believe it\u0027s a stranger. Jimmy \" (that\u0027s one of the children)\u0027 \"run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEverybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger don\u0027t come EVERY year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting for the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store clothes on, and an audience -- and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them circumstances it warn\u0027t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable. He warn\u0027t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no, he come ca\u0027m and important, like the ram. When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn\u0027t want to disturb them, and says: \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my boy,\" says the old gentleman, \"I\u0027m sorry to say \u0027t your driver has deceived you; Nichols\u0027s place is down a matter of three mile more. Come in, come in.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, \"Too late -- he\u0027s out of !j:\u0001\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/71/3913.html","bookId":546,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:36:40 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:36:40 AM"}
