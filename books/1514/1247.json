It was not strange for the latter to detect the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol in his body. However, from the latter’s tone, it was obvious that the Thunderbolt Master had learnt about him from a conversation with the Flame Master.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAlthough Lin Dong was unaware of how the Flame Master had described him, he still nodded.

Hence, he had to thank the Thunderbolt Master for lending a hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Killing the Yimo is my duty and responsibility. I have spent a long time searching for them. It is only because of you that I managed to obtain a clue today. Therefore, there is no need for you to thank me.” The Thunderbolt Master shook his head. His voice was as loud as thunder.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Thunderbolt Master’s eyes swept towards Lin Dong. The former’s eyes appeared to be judging the latter. Finally, he nodded, “It is surprising that you are actually able to break the Seventh Seat King’s Devil Emperor Armor with your current strength. It seems that you are just as remarkable as the Flame Master described.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHis voice contained a rare trace of amazement. He had fought far too many times with the upper echelons of the Yimo, and was naturally well aware of just how strong the Devil Emperor Armor was. It was the only reason why that Seventh Seat King had been able to endure for such a long time in his hands. Yet, Lin Dong was able to rely on his own power to break the Devil Emperor Armor. Even the Thunderbolt Master could not help but be somewhat amazed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong merely chuckled. In order to achieve such a result, that attack had gathered powers of the two Ancestral Symbol strength in his body and the mysterious power obtained from the Zenith. It could be considered his strongest attack. Despite this, it had only been able to injure the Seventh Seat King. Killing him was still impossible.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Thunderbolt Master looked at Lin Dong.

The Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol was a natural divine object, and he was the first owner of the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol. However, he was well aware that such a divine object would seek its own owner. Back then, he had cut off his connection with the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol when he fell into a deep slumber. Plus, its new owner was Lin Dong.

After which, a lightning arc swirled on the Thunderbolt Master’s palm. The Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol also possessed a spirit.

It was a long time later before he handed it back to Lin Dong and said, “You are the current owner of the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol and should be aware of some responsibilities that come with this status. I hope that you will not bring dishonor to its name.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong grasped the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol.

However, from a certain point of view, we are merely allies. They have their own freedom and have the right to choose their new owners. If the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol is without an owner, I will naturally bring it away with me. However, it has already chosen a new owner for itself. Since this is the case, its choice is definitely the most suitable for it. The choice of the Ancestral Symbol is never wrong.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Thunderbolt Master smiled after saying this. There was some pride in his smile, “Moreover, you should not underestimate us. It is true that the Ancestral Symbols can further strengthen us. However, even without them, we are still powerful.
