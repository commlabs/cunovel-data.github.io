Kelsey didn\u0027t even try to parry the mighty blows, knowing that unless his sword angle was exactly perfect, Robert\u0027s powerful cuts would surely blast right through his meager defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally in such a fight against a larger foe, the elf would hold a wide advantage of quickness, especially with his opponent wielding so heavy and unwieldy a sword. But not this time; Robert swung the blade as easily as Kelsey maneuvered his slender elven sword, and the giant man proved deceptively quick and always balanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain came a mighty swing, and this time, the elf barely managed to get back out of harm\u0027s way. Robert\u0027s widening smile mocked Kelsey\u0027s continuing retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey was far from ready to surrender, though - not that vicious Robert would have accepted it anyway. He had gone through many trials to get to this point, and now, so close to realizing his quest, the one great task appointed him for his life, his elven blood coursed through his slender limbs with renewed vigor. Besides, the elf reminded himself as the red-haired giant continued to stalk in, he had known all along that the fight against Robert would be the greatest trial of all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert\u0027s sword whipped across yet again, and once more Kelsey slipped backwards out of reach. The huge man came on fiercely, suddenly, turning his wrists to send his weapon up high, then reversing his grip to angle the sword for a mighty downwards chop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey threw his sword up above him, angled diagonally. In typical combat, the cunning elf would have turned his sword horizontal as the blow came in, catching his opponent\u0027s weapon on his own blade to fully stop his attacker\u0027s momentum chop. From there, a simple twist would throw the attacking sword harmlessly aside and leave Kelsey\u0027s foe vulnerable for a counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWisely Kelsey did not try his usual tactics against the inhumanly strong Robert. As Robert\u0027s sword crashed in, the elf, instead of turning his sword to the horizontal plane, twisted it vertically and immediately stepped to his left, away from the deflected blow. Robert was quick to recover, but not quick enough to defeat Kelsey\u0027s obvious advantage. With Robert\u0027s sword far to the other side, Kelsey rushed by the red-haired man\u0027s right flank, launching a rapid series of stinging slashes and pokes as he passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, grand move!\" Mickey blurted out around the edges of his long-stemmed pipe, clapping his chubby little hands together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery onlooker, and Robert as well, thought that Kelsey would then simply run out of range again, putting the fight back on even ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of them, particularly not the dragon, truly understood the fires that burned in the veins of the noble elf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Robert spun to catch up with the passing elf, Kelsey cut around in a tight circle, keeping ahead of Robert\u0027s blade and keeping Robert\u0027s right flank open and vulnerable. The elf\u0027s sword hit home perhaps a dozen times in the next frenzied moments before Robert wisely stopped his futile chasing and retreated a few steps instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, grander move!\" Mickey called, adding another series of claps. Robert turned an angry glare upon the leprechaun, silencing Mickey immediately, except for a profound gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary thought that the huge man would surely run over and slaughter Mickey - and Gary didn\u0027t trust that the monstrous red-haired man would stop at that. The weight of doom suddenly heavy around his shoulders, Gary looked to Geno for support. He was not comforted by what he saw, though, for the dwarf had prudently moved a dozen long steps away from Mickey\u0027s other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut fears of the attack proved unfounded. Robert was too busy in his battle to take any actions against the others at that time. He turned his glower upon Kelsey, then looked disdainfully at his wounded side. His right arm had been opened in several places - one gash had the brute\u0027s corded muscles hanging out right beyond his thick skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had thought to spare you,\" Robert spat at Kelsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lie,\" Kelsey muttered in reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now you die!\" Robert roared, and he came on wildly, sword slashing back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite Kelsey\u0027s previous moments of brilliance, Gary found that he absolutely believed Robert\u0027s prediction as the next furious assault began. How could anyone - especially one as slender and delicate as Kelsey - fend off or escape the crushing power of Robert\u0027s mighty swings? And even if Kelsey managed to stay away, how could he hope to win? He had nailed Robert with many direct hits - strikes that would have killed, or at least stopped, any real human opponent - to no avail, and Robert showed not the slightest signs of tiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey dropped behind one of the few stalagmite mounds in the room, hoping to diminish the intensity of the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert didn\u0027t slow, didn\u0027t hold back his ringing sword at all. Sparks flew as the great weapon slammed against the stone, and when they cleared, the stalagmite mound stood but half its original height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the companions\u0027 dismay, Robert\u0027s sword had not broken, had not even visibly chipped. On came the red-haired monster, his face contorted with rage, his sword humming as it again began its death-promising sidelong cuts through the empty air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey did not fear his constant retreating in the vast room, but neither did he believe that he was gaining any advantage, that the great Robert would tire. The elf knew that he would have to continue his brilliance and his daring, and that one mistake would surely cost him his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey nearly laughed at that thought. His life mattered not when weighed against the successful completion of his life-quest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey backed and watched, watched closely the subtle movements of Robert\u0027s fingers clenched about the huge sword\u0027s leather-strapped hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary tried to look away, not wanting to see his friend share a similar fate with the halved stalagmite. He found that he could not avoid the remarkable spectacle, though, and his mouth drooped open in confusion when he looked back to the combatants, back to Kelsey, unexpectedly smiling with apparently sincere confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary couldn\u0027t know it then, but the elf had found his advantage. For all of Robert\u0027s sheer power and uncanny quickness, the dragon was not a swordsman - at least not by the elf\u0027s high standards. Robert\u0027s attacks were straightforward, his movements, even his feints, becoming more and more predictable to the seasoned warrior of Tylwyth Teg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey continued to watch those gnarly, huge fingers, waiting for the telltale turn. A few strides, a few swings later, Robert twisted and sent his sword flying up high - and Kelsey was ready for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like the first time he had attempted the downwards chop, three quick strides brought the red-haired man rushing towards the elf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey, though, did not offer a defense similar to the previous one. He, too, came rushing forward, sword leading, desperate to beat Robert to the quick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert\u0027s great sword was still up high over his head when the fine tip of Kelsey\u0027s elven blade came in tight against Robert\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lose!\" the elf cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert roared and drove his sword down at the elf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey could have thrust his sword right through Robert\u0027s throat - his instincts almost made him do it. But what good to him would be a slain dragon? He dove aside instead, rolling to his feet and pointing an accusing finger Robert\u0027s way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treachery!\" he yelled, looking to his companions, the witnesses, for support. \"I had you bested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not down!\" Robert roared back. \"You had nothing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What fairness is this?\" Kelsey cried, pleading his case to Mickey and the others, to the stones of the cavern, to anyone and anything that could hear his voice. He turned back on Robert. \"Must I kill you to win? What is my gain, then, in this challenge of honor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had nothing!\" Robert roared back, and it seemed to Gary as if his voice had changed somewhat, taken on a more throaty call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sword was at your throat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And mine at your head,\" Robert quickly added. \"To finish your move would have allowed me to finish mine.\" Robert poked his finger against his own throat. \"Small hole,\" he spat sarcastically. \"Perhaps fatal, but not so surely fatal as an elf cut down the middle!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey knew Robert\u0027s estimate of the fight was far from accurate. He could have driven his sword right through Robert\u0027s neck and still dodged the downwards chop. But Robert\u0027s argument was convincing, Kelsey knew, convincing enough for the dragon to avoid the mark of dishonor in the general retelling of the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s playing Bilbo\u0027s game,\" Gary muttered under his breath. Mickey looked up at him curiously, remembering the story, then nodded his accord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Half-truths,\" Gary went on. \"Kelsey had him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell that to Robert,\" Mickey muttered. \"But wait long enough for me to get far from yer side afore ye do, lad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary didn\u0027t miss the leprechaun\u0027s point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough of this foolishness!\" Robert roared suddenly. With one arm, he heaved his huge sword across the room. It hit the wall with a blinding flash, and hung in place, halfway embedded in the solid stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary thought for a moment that Robert had capitulated, had admitted that Kelsey had fairly won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensing the truth, though, Kelsey raced back to retrieve the magical shield of Cedric Donigarten, working frantically to get it in place on his slender arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary started to question the elf\u0027s movements, but when he looked back to Robert, he came to understand, came to understand so very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert began to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human coil warped and bulged; red hair wrapped Robert\u0027s head and blended with his mutating skin. A great wing sprouted, then another, and huge claws tore the boots from the creature\u0027s feet. Great snapping sounds of re-forming bones echoed sickeningly through the chamber; a monstrous, scaly tail slammed to the floor behind the creature and rushed out as it thickened and elongated, seeming almost like a second creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God!\" Gary Leger stammered. \"Sonofab... Holy Sh... Oh my God!\" Gary simply ran out of expletives. His mouth worked weird contortions, but no words spewed forth. If Tommy had been standing beside him and had uttered one of his customary \"Duhs,\" Gary would certainly have patted him on the leg for giving him the right word. Nothing in Gary Leger\u0027s life, not the volumes of fantasy reading he had done nor any sights he had ever seen, in his own world or in Faerie, could have possibly prepared him for the spectacle before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chamber no longer seemed so large - the dragon had reached fifty feet long and continued to grow, to stretch. Gary remembered the dry lake, Loch Tullamore, and now he understood how the dragon might indeed have \"hissed\" it away. He clutched atThe Hobbit, sitting in a pouch on his belt, like it was some protecting amulet, a source of strength and a reminder that others had faced such a creature and lived to tell about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even Gary\u0027s amulet could not begin to insulate him from the sheer terror of facing Robert the Wretched. The change was complete then - Robert loomed nearly a hundred feet in length, with spear-like, stone-tearing claws and a maw that could snap a man in half, or fully swallow him, at the dragon\u0027s whim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary\u0027s knees went weak under him. He wanted nothing except to run away, but knew his legs wouldn\u0027t carry him. He wanted nothing except to close his eyes, but he could not, held firmly by the awesome spectacle, the majesty and the horror of the true dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough!\" the dragon roared again. If Robert\u0027s voice in human form could shake stones, then the power of this blast could surely split them. \"The game is ended, Kelsenellenelvial Gil-Ravadry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeno cast a disconcerting look Gary and Mickey\u0027s way. \"I suppose that the spear will have to wait some time before it gets back in one piece again,\" the dwarf muttered sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stupid elf,\" he added, and his derisive chuckle momentarily freed Gary from his awe-stricken trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem too concerned,\" he muttered Geno\u0027s way, his voice cracking several times as he struggled to spit out the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeno gave a resigned shrug. \"Robert will not eat me,\" he replied with some confidence. \"Dragons are not overly fond of the taste of dwarfs, and besides, dragons like the pretty things a dwarf hammer might bring.\" Geno\u0027s snort twanged against the marrow of Gary\u0027s bones. \"He\u0027ll eat you, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary turned his attention back to the fight, which seemed more a prelude to a massacre now. Kelsey\u0027s smile was long gone, and so was the elf\u0027s look of confidence, even of determination. And who could blame him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we help him?\" Gary whispered to Mickey, though Gary knew that if Mickey told him to charge in beside Kelsey, his quivering legs would betray his noble intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leprechaun snorted incredulously, and Gary said no more. He finally managed to close his eyes and turned his thoughts inwards instead, calling upon the sentient spear, his most reliable battle ally, for some answers to this nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey braced himself and clutched his sword more tightly, trying to remind himself of his purpose in being there, of the fact that he had known from the beginning of his quest what creature he would ultimately face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRationale just didn\u0027t seem an antidote to the sheer terror evoked by the sight of the unbeatable dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerpentine Robert slithered, belly low, towards Kelsey. He gave a swipe of his huge foreclaw, almost a playful swing, like some kitten with a ball of yarn. Kelsey threw his weight behind the heavy shield to block, but still went sliding many feet across the stone floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, damn,\" Geno muttered, and turned away, thinking the fight at its gruesome end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" the dwarf corrected weakly when he looked back, looked at Kelsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow still standing and somehow undaunted, the elf stepped right back and ripped off a series of three short jabs into the dragon\u0027s extended arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind from Robert\u0027s ensuing laughter knocked Kelsey to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not make it so easy,\" the dragon growled. \"I wish to play for as long as I might. Who knows when another hero might be as foolish as you, Kelsenellenelvial Gil-Ravadry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How might I aid my friend?\" Gary\u0027s thoughts asked the sentient spear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called mentally to the spear several times, insisting that it communicate with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fight is not yours,\"the spear finally answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must help Kelsey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must not!\"came an emphatic reply.\"The fight is a challenge of honor; events go exactly as they were dictated before the elfs quest was undertaken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary started to protest, to argue that no one single warrior could defeat such a beast and that the quest must be abandoned for the sake of Kelsey\u0027s life. But then he understood. The spear cared nothing for Kelsey. This battle, carried out properly in accordance with ancient rules, was the sentient weapon\u0027s only chance of being reforged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelplessly Gary Leger opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey was on the attack again, rushing in beyond Robert\u0027s foreclaws and banging away at the dragon\u0027s scaly armor with all his strength. The huge horned dragon head bobbed with bellowing laughter, mocking Kelsey. Every now and then, Robert casually dropped a claw near to the elf, knocking him aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut stubborn, incredibly stubborn, Kelsey did not relent, and his persistence paid off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert\u0027s lizard-like features contorted suddenly in pain as Kelsey\u0027s sword slipped between armor plates and dug deep at dragon flesh. The dragon set his wings into a fierce beat, their wind driving Kelsey back while lifting Robert to his towering height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey stubbornly kept his balance, using the great shield to somewhat deflect the blasting wind. He nearly overbalanced when the dragon sucked in its breath, countering the force of the beating wings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here it comes,\" Gary heard Mickey mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd indeed it did, a blast of fire that seemed to swallow pitiful Kelsey and warmed all the vast chamber so profoundly that Gary, standing many yards away, felt his eyebrows singe underneath his loose-fitting helmet. Robert\u0027s exhale went on for many seconds, the white-hot fires pouring over Kelsey, scorching the stone all about the elf\u0027s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was ended - and Kelsey still stood! Stone bubbled beside him and the outer metal of the shield of Cedric glowed an angry red, but the elf, even his clothes, and the ground in the protective shadow of that shield, appeared unharmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damned good shield,\" Geno said in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert, too, seemed stricken, gawking at the elf who somehow had held his ground against a blast that could melt stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ye\u0027ll have to do better than that, mighty wyrm,\" Kelsey chided, apparently gaining some confidence in the proof that the legendary shield could, as the bard\u0027s pen had declared, \"turn the fire of a dragon\u0027s breath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert launched another blast, Kelsey just barely ducking behind the protective shield in time. Now the stone around the elf hissed and sputtered, that sulphuric smell permeated the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when the fires ceased, Kelsey poked his head around the shield - and he was wearing a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimply surviving Robert\u0027s breath was insult enough, but the elf\u0027s taunts, and now his smile, sent the dragon into a rage beyond anything Gary had ever imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, begorra,\" he heard Mickey whisper, and then came the scraping and pounding of the dragon\u0027s charge that tore the cavern floor in its wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaws hammered down at Kelsey, a hit so fierce that Gary thought the elf surely dead. Somehow Kelsey held his ground, but then the terrible maw snapped down, cat-quick, to bite at him. Somehow again - it seemed impossible to Gary - Kelsey managed to dodge, even to smack Robert several times before the dragon got its massive horned head back out of range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaws rained destruction, back legs kicked, wings beat down mercilessly, and once, the dragon\u0027s tail snapped around with force enough to fell a thick-trunked oak. But Kelsey was ahead of nearly every attack, and those that did connect did no more than slow the elf\u0027s own frenzied offense. The slaps of Kelsey\u0027s sword sounded as a tap dance, rhythmical and constant, beating at every target Robert presented to him. Dragon fire came roaring in again, but the shield repelled it, and Kelsey even managed to close in under the fiery cover and snap off three vicious strikes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible,\" Gary groaned, turning to Mickey. The leprechaun was too intent on the action to answer him, but Geno replied, tossing a hammer casually off the side of Gary\u0027s helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut your big mouth,\" the dwarf growled, his unexpected anger stunning Gary to silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert\u0027s frenzy did not relent - Gary came to fear that all the mountain would crumble under the dragon\u0027s pounding. But neither did Kelsey relent, snapping, slicing, poking, beating at the dragon from every angle, moving with such speed and precision that at times he seemed no more than a thin blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA claw sent him reeling backwards, a solid hit, and as he started forward once more, Robert\u0027s great maw fell over him. Gary nearly swooned as the dragon\u0027s head came up with Kelsey in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey wasn\u0027t finished. Somehow, impossibly, the elf had wedged his shield between the dragon\u0027s jaws, and Robert\u0027s actions now actually worked against the dragon, for now Kelsey was within reach of the beast\u0027s only vulnerable area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his slender, wicked sword dancing less than an inch from the dragon\u0027s yellow, reptilian eye, Kelsey asked evenly, \"Do ye yield?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could breathe you to char!\" the dragon hissed between its locked jaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And ye\u0027d lose yer eye,\" Kelsey proclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert made not a move, considering his options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it,\" Gary breathed, his voice full of stunted elation. He just shook his head and stared blankly as the god-like dragon obediently lowered the elf to the floor and released him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring the ancient spear and be done with it!\" the dragon roared, stamping his foreclaws, and several stones in the wide cavern did indeed split apart under the force of Robert\u0027s outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unbelievable,\" Gary muttered again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep quiet, lad,\" Mickey implored him. \"Say not a word and get yer part done as quickly as ye can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary considered the leprechaun curiously, wondering why Mickey was so full of intensity and trepidation. Was that a bead of sweat on Mickey\u0027s forehead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy? Gary wondered, for the greatest trial had been passed - Kelsey had won. The elf had survived the wrath of Robert, had taken blows that would have toppled ancient trees and flattened mountains...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary abruptly halted his confused train of thought. \"Ye\u0027d lose yer eye?\" he mumbled under his breath, imitating the accent that Kelsey had used when demanding Robert\u0027s surrender. Now he understood Geno\u0027s anger at his proclamation that Kelsey\u0027s feats were impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary turned his attention to the scene before him. Robert had started away, shifting his great scaled body to the side, towards a wide and high tunnel running off of the main chamber. Kelsey stood in the same spot where Robert had released him, impassive, apparently basking in his victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary looked right through the illusionary elf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first hit,\" Mickey whispered to him, seeing that he had finally figured out the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary quickly recalled the events of the battle, the first powerful sidelong swipe that Robert had launched Kelsey\u0027s way, then looked to the appropriate side. Crumpled beside a stalagmite mound lay Kelsey, curled in a ball and covered in blood. The elf was alive, Gary could see, and trying hard not to make any move or sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will need the shield,\" Geno remarked to Gary. With the illusionary scene dispelled to him, Gary noticed the shield lying where Kelsey had first placed it on the floor, beside the scars of dragon fire and the fast-cooling stone. He wondered how he might retrieve it without alerting Robert to the trick, but Mickey was already taking care of that part. The illusionary Kelsey walked over to the real shield and laid the illusionary shield atop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all very confusing to Gary - and he didn\u0027t understand why the dragon hadn\u0027t seen right through the leprechaun\u0027s trick - but he went over and picked up the shield and followed Geno and Robert into the side chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back as he exited the room, and watched Mickey\u0027s illusionary elf go and sit beside the real Kelsey at the stalagmite mound, the leprechaun going as well to tend to the real Kelsey\u0027s very real wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary slumped even lower behind the shield when he heard the sharp intake of the dragon\u0027s breath. He felt like he had to go to the bathroom - feared that he would embarrass himself right then and there. But he could say nothing. The spear was laid out on a flat stone before him and he, as the prophecies dictated, held tight to its bottom half. Geno had tied the two ends of the shaft together with a leather thong and had sprinkled some flaky substance - Gary couldn\u0027t tell if it was metal scrapings or crushed gemstones - along the part to be rejoined. Now Geno stood far back, hammer in one heavy-gauntleted hand and bag of the same flaky substance in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary reminded himself that he had not actually witnessed the shield deflecting the dragon\u0027s terrible breath, that what he had seen had been no more than one of Mickey\u0027s illusions. He peeked up over the rim of the shield, wanting to protest, but saw that he hadn\u0027t the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the flames came and Gary didn\u0027t know if he had wet his pants or not - and in that heat, they certainly would have dried in an instant anyway! Great gouts of white fire licked at Gary around the edges of his shield; his hand holding the magical spear warmed and then burned with pain. He held onto the weapon\u0027s shaft, though, for Geno had promised him some very unpleasant consequences if he didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it was over, suddenly. Gary blinked the sting out of his eyes, almost fainting with relief that the shield had indeed turned aside the white-hot flames. On the flat stone before him, the magical spear glowed an angry orange in the dimly lit room. Immediately the dwarven craftsman fell over it, sprinkling flakes and pounding away, sprinkling and pounding. Geno muttered many arcane phrases that Gary couldn\u0027t begin to understand, but from the dwarf\u0027s ritualistic movements and reverent tone, Gary correctly assumed it to be some sort of smithy magic, a spell to strengthen the bonding beyond the might of simple metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe work went on for many minutes, Geno tapping and banging, chanting and sprinkling still more of the flaky substance on the still-hot metal shaft. Then the dwarf lifted the spear up and looked along the shaft, checking to be certain that it was perfectly straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped it back to the stone, gave a few more taps, and lifted it for another inspection. Geno\u0027s smile was all the answer that Gary Leger needed. The dwarf backed away and slipped his hammer into a loop on his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glow dissipated; the spear seemed remarkably cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now you are in the legends once again, mighty Robert,\" Geno called to the dragon. \"All the world will know that it was Robert, greatest of wyrmkind, who gave the fires to reforge the ancient spear!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf\u0027s attempt to placate the fuming dragon seemed to have little effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get you gone from my mountain!\" the beast roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGary concurred with Geno\u0027s nodding head; they wouldn\u0027t have to be asked twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pick it up,\" Geno instructed Gary, indicating the spear. With one hand, Gary easily hoisted the long weapon. It seemed even lighter now than either of its previous parts, and even more balanced. If before, Gary had believed that he could hurl it a hundred yards, now he felt as though he could throw it two hundred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sentient spear did not communicate to Gary in any discernible words, but Gary could clearly feel its profound elation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-woods-out-back-spearwielder-s-tale-1/page-24.html","bookId":2184,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:49:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:49:57 PM"}
