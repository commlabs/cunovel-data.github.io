Oh Right, Because I\u0027m An Idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt like - like I don\u0027t know what. Like this wasn\u0027t real. Like I was in some Goth version of a bad sitcom. Instead of being the AAdweeb about to ask the head cheerleader to the prom, I was the finished-second-place werewolf about to ask the vampire\u0027s wife to shack up and procreate. Nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I wouldn\u0027t do it. It was twisted and wrong. I was going to forget all about what he\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I would talk to her. I\u0027d try to make her listen to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she wouldn\u0027t. Just like always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward didn\u0027t answer or comment on my thoughts as he led the way back to the house. I wondered about the place that he\u0027d chosen to stop. Was it far enough from the house that the others couldn\u0027t hear his whispers? Was that the point?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe. When we walked through the door, the other Cullens\u0027 eyes were suspicious and confused. No one looked disgusted or outraged. So they must not have heard either favor Edward had asked me for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated in the open doorway, not sure what to do now. It was better right there, with a little bit of breathable air blowing in from outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward walked into the middle of the huddle, shoulders stiff. Bella watched him anxiously, and then her eyes flickered to me for a second. Then she was watching him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face turned a grayish pale, and I could see what he meant about the stress making her feel worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going tolet Jacob and Bella speak privately,\" Edward said. There was no inflection at all in his voice. Robotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over my pile of ashes,\" Rosalie hissed at him. She was still hovering by Bella\u0027s head, one of her cold hands placed possessively on Bella\u0027s sallow cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward didn\u0027t look at her. \"Bella,\" he said in that same empty tone. \"Jacob wants to talk to you. Are you afraid to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe alone with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella looked at me, confused. Then she looked at Rosalie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose, it\u0027s fine. Jake\u0027s not going to hurt us. Go with Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be a trick,\" the blonde warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see how,\" Bella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carlisle and I will always be in your sight, Rosalie,\" Edward said. The emotionless voice was cracking, showing the anger through it. \"We\u0027re the ones she\u0027s afraid of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Bella whispered. Her eyes were glistening, her lashes wet. \"No, Edward. I\u0027m not___\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, smiling a little. The smile was painful to look at. \"I didn\u0027t mean it that way, Bella. I\u0027m fine. Don\u0027t worry about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSickening. He was right - she was beating herself up about hurting his feelings. The girl was a classic martyr. She\u0027d totally been born in the wrong century. She should have lived back when she could have gotten herself fed to some lions for a good cause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone,\" Edward said, his hand stiffly motioning toward the door. \"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe composure he was trying to keep up for Bella was shaky. I could see how close he was to that burning man he\u0027d been outside. The others saw it, too. Silently, they moved out the door while I shifted out of the way. They moved fast; my heart beat twice, and the room was cleared except for Rosalie, hesitating in the middle of the floor, and Edward, still waiting by the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose,\" Bella said quietly. \"I want you to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blonde glared at Edward and then gestured for him to go first. He disappeared out the door. She gave me a long warning glower, and then she disappeared, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we were alone, I crossed the room and sat on the floor next to Bella. I took both her cold hands in mine, rubbing them carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Jake. That feels good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to lie, Bells. You\u0027re hideous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she sighed. Tm scary-looking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thing-from-the-swamp scary,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"It\u0027s so good having you here. It feels nice to smile. I don\u0027t know how much more drama I can stand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay,\" she agreed. \"I bring it on myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you do. What\u0027re you thinking, Bells? Seriously!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he ask you to yell at me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of. Though I can\u0027t figure why he thinks you\u0027d listen to me. You never have before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you - ,\" I started to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know that 7 told you so\u0027 has a brother, Jacob?\" she asked, cutting me off. \"His name is \u0027Shut the hell up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned at me. Her skin stretched tight over the bones. \"I can\u0027t take credit - i got it off a rerun of The Simpsons\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missed that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t talk for a minute. Her hands were starting to warm up a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he really ask you to talk to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"To talk some sense into you. There\u0027s a battle that\u0027s lost before it starts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why did you agree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. I wasn\u0027t sure I knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did know this - every second I spent with her was only going to add to the pain I would have to suffer later. Like a junkie with a limited supply, the day of reckoning was coming for me. The more hits I took now, the harder it would be when my supply ran out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll work out, you know,\" she said after a quiet minute. \"I believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat made me see red again. \"Is dementia one of your symptoms?\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, though my anger was so real that my hands were shaking around hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" she said. Tm not saying things will work out easily, Jake. But how could I have lived through all that I\u0027ve lived through and not believe in magic by this point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Magic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially for you,\" she said. She was smiling. She pulled one of her hands away from mine and pressed it against my cheek. Warmer than before, but it felt cool against my skin, like most things did. \"More than anyone else, you\u0027ve got some magic waiting to make things right for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you babbling about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill smiling. \"Edward told me once what it was like - your imprinting thing. He said it was like A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream, like magic. You\u0027ll find who you\u0027re really looking for, Jacob, and maybe then all of this will make sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she hadn\u0027t looked so fragile I would\u0027ve been screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it was, I did growl at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think that imprinting could ever make sense of this insanity ...\" I struggled for words. \"Do you really think that just because I might someday imprint on some stranger it would make this right?\" I jabbed a finger toward her swollen body. \"Tell me what the point was then, Bella! What was the point of me loving you? What was the point of you loving him? When you die\" - the words were a snarl - \"how is that ever right again? What\u0027s the point to all the pain? Mine, yours, his! You\u0027ll kill him, too, not that I care about that.\" She flinched, but I kept going. \"So what was the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epoint of your twisted love story, in the end? If there is any sense, please show me, Bella, because I don\u0027t see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I don\u0027t know yet, Jake. But I just... feel... that this is all going somewhere good, hard to see as it is now. I guess you could call it faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re dying for nothing, Bella! Nothing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand dropped from my face to her bloated stomach, caressed it. She didn\u0027t have to say the words for me to know what she was thinking. She was dying for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not going to die,\" she said through her teeth, and I could tell she was repeating things she\u0027d said before. \"I will keep my heart beating. I\u0027m strong enough for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a load of crap, Bella. You\u0027ve been trying to keep up with the supernatural for too long. No normal person can do it. You\u0027re not strong enough.\" I took her face in my hand. I didn\u0027t have to remind myself to be gentle. Everything about her screamed breakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can do this. I can do this,\" she muttered, sounding a lot like that kids\u0027 book about the little engine that could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t look like it to me. So what\u0027s your plan? I hope you have one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, not meeting my eyes. \"Did you know Esme jumped off a cliff? When she was human, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she was close enough to dead that they didn\u0027t even bother taking her to the emergency room - they took her right around to the morgue. Her heart was still beating, though, when Carlisle found her___\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what she\u0027d meant before, about keeping her heart beating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not planning on surviving this human,\" I stated dully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m not stupid.\" She met my stare then. \"I guess you probably have your own opinion on that point, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emergency vampirization,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It worked for Esme. And Emmett, and Rosalie, and even Edward. None of them were in such great shape. Carlisle only changed them because it was that or death. He doesn\u0027t end lives, he saves them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a sudden twinge of guilt about the good vampire doctor, like before. I shoved the thought away and started in on the begging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me, Bells. Don\u0027t do it that way.\" Like before, when the call from Charlie had come, I could see how much difference it really made to me. I realized I needed her to stay alive, in some form. In any form. I took a deep breath. \"Don\u0027t wait until it\u0027s too late, Bella. Not that way. Live. Okay? Just live. Don\u0027t do this to me. Don\u0027t do it to him.\" My voice got harder, louder. \"You know what he\u0027s going to do when you die. You\u0027ve seen it before. You want him to go back to those Italian killers?\" She cringed into the sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left out the part about how that wouldn\u0027t be necessary this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStruggling to make my voice softer, I asked, \"Remember when I got mangled up by those newborns? What did you tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited, but she wouldn\u0027t answer. She pressed her lips together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me to be good and listen to Carlisle,\" I reminded her. \"And what did I do? I listened to the vampire. For\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You listened because it was the right thing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay - pick either reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. \"It\u0027s not the right thing now.\" Her gaze touched her big round stomach and she whispered under her breath, \"I won\u0027t kill him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands shook again. \"Oh, I hadn\u0027t heard the great news. A bouncing baby boy, huh? Shoulda brought some blueballoons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face turned pink. The color was so beautiful - it twisted in my stomach like a knife. A serrated knife, rusty and ragged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to lose this. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know he\u0027s a boy,\" she admitted, a little sheepish. \"The ultrasound wouldn\u0027t work. The membrane around the baby is too hard - like their skin. So he\u0027s a little mystery. But I always see a boy in my head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not some pretty baby in there, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see,\" she said. Almost smug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t,\" I snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re very pessimistic, Jacob. There is definitely a chance that I might walk away from this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t answer. I looked down and breathed deep and slow, trying to get a grip on my fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake,\" she said, and she patted my hair, stroked my cheek. \"It\u0027s going to be okay. Shh. it\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look up. \"No. It will not be okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped something wet from my cheek. \"Shh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the deal, Bella?\" I stared at the pale carpet. My bare feet were dirty, leaving smudges. Good. \"I thought the whole point was that you wanted your vampire more than anything. And now you\u0027re just giving him up? That doesn\u0027t make any sense. Since when are you desperate to be a mom? If you wanted that so much, why did you marry a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was dangerously close to that offer he wanted me to make. I could see the words taking me that way, but I couldn\u0027t change their direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"It\u0027s not like that. I didn\u0027t really care about having a baby. I didn\u0027t even think about it. It\u0027s not just having a baby. It\u0027s... well... this baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a killer, Bella. Look at yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not. It\u0027s me. I\u0027m just weak and human. But I can tough this out, Jake, I can - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, come on! Shut up, Bella. You can spout this crap to your bloodsucker, but you\u0027re not fooling me. You know you\u0027re not going to make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at me. \"I do not know that. I\u0027m worried about it, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worriedabout it,\" I repeated through my teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped then and clutched at her stomach. My fury vanished like a light switch being turned off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" she panted. It\u0027s nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t hear; her hands had pulled her sweatshirt to the side, and I stared, horrified, at the skin it exposed. Her stomach looked like it was stained with big splotches of purple-black ink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw my stare, and she yanked the fabric back in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s strong, that\u0027s all,\" she said defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ink spots were bruises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost gagged, and I understood what he\u0027d said, about watching it hurt her. Suddenly, I felt a little crazy myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the change in my voice. She looked up, still breathing heavy, her eyes confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, don\u0027t do this:\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me. Don\u0027t get your back up yet. Okay? Just listen. What if... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if this wasn\u0027t a one-shot deal? What if it wasn\u0027t all or nothing? What if you just listened to Carlisle like a good girl, and kept yourself alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not done yet. So you stay alive. Then you can start over. This didn\u0027t work out. Try again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. She raised one hand and touched the place where my eyebrows were mashing together. Her fingers smoothed my forehead for a moment while she tried to make sense of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.... What do you mean, try again? You can\u0027t think Edward would let me... ? And what difference would it make? I\u0027m sure any baby - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I snapped. \"Any kid of his would be the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tired face just got more confused. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t say any more. There was no point. I would never be able to save her from herself. I\u0027d never been able to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she blinked, and I could see she got it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Ugh. Please, Jacob. You think I should kill my baby and replace it with some generic substitute? Artificial insemination?\" She was mad now. \"Why would I want to have some stranger\u0027s baby? I suppose it just doesn\u0027t make a difference? Any baby will do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean that,\" I muttered. \"Not a stranger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned forward. \"Then what are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. I\u0027m saying nothing. Same as ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did that come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, suspicious. \"Did he tell you to say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, surprised that she\u0027d made that leap so quick. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, really. He didn\u0027t say anything about artificial whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face softened then, and she sank back against the pillows, looking exhausted. She stared off to the side when she spoke, not talking to me at all. \"He would do anything forme. And I\u0027m hurting him so much.... But what is he thinking? That I would trade this\" - her hand traced across her belly - \"for some stranger\u0027s ...\" She mumbled the last part, and then her voice trailed off. Her eyes were wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to hurt him,\" I whispered. It burned like poison in my mouth to beg for him, but I knew this angle was probably my best bet for keeping her alive. Still a thousand-to-one odds. \"You could make him happy again, Bella. And I really think he\u0027s losing it. Honestly, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t seem to be listening; her hand made small circles on her battered stomach while she chewed on her lip. It was quiet for a long time. I wondered if the Cullens were very far away. Were they listening to my pathetic attempts to reason with her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a stranger?\" she murmured to herself. I flinched. \"What exactly did Edward say to you?\" she asked in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. He just thought you might listen to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that. About trying again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes locked on mine, and I could see that I\u0027d already given too much away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth fell open a little. \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was silent for a few heartbeats. I looked down at my feet again, unable to meet her stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He really would do anything, wouldn\u0027t he?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you he was going crazy. Literally, Bells.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised you didn\u0027t tell on him right away. Get him in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I looked up, she was grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought about it.\" I tried to grin back, but I could feel the smile mangle on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what I was offering, and she wasn\u0027t going to think twice about it. I\u0027d known that she wouldn\u0027t. But it still stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There isn\u0027t much you wouldn\u0027t do for me, either, is there?\" she whispered. \"I really don\u0027t know why you bother. I don\u0027t deserve either of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It makes no difference, though, does it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this time.\" She sighed. \"I wish I could explain it to you right so that you would understand. I can\u0027t hurthim\" - she pointed to her stomach - \"any more than I could pick up a gun and shoot you. I love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you always have to love the wrong things, Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared the lump out of my throat so that I could make my voice hard like I wanted it. \u0027Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to get to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not doing any good here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held out her thin hand, pleading. \"Don\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the addiction sucking at me, trying to keep me near her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t belong here. I\u0027ve got to get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you come today?\" she asked, still reaching limply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just to see if you were really alive. I didn\u0027t believe you were sick like Charlie said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t tell from her face whether she bought that or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you come back again? Before ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to hang around and watch you die,Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flinched. \"You\u0027re right, you\u0027re right. You should go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye,\" she whispered behind me. \"Love you, Jake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost went back. I almost turned around and fell down on my knees and started begging again. But I knew that I had to quitBella, quit her cold turkey, before she killed me, like she was going to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, sure,\" I mumbled on my way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t see any of the vampires. I ignored my bike, standing all alone in the middle of the meadow. It wasn\u0027t fast enough for me now. My dad would be freaked out - Sam, too. What would the pack make of the fact that they hadn\u0027t heard me phase? Would they think the Cullens got me before I\u0027d had the chance? I stripped down, not caring who might be watching, and started running. I blurred into wolf mid-stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were waiting. Of course they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob, Jake,eight voices chorused in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome homenow, the Alpha voice ordered. Sam was furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt Paul fade out, and i knew Billy and Rachel were waiting to hear what had happened to me. Paul was too anxious to give them the good news that I wasn\u0027t vampire chow to listen to the whole story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to tell the pack I was on my way - they could see the forest blurring past me as I sprinted for home. I didn\u0027t have to tell them that I was half-past crazy, either. The sickness in my head was obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey saw all the horror - Bella\u0027s mottled stomach; her raspy voice; he\u0027s strong, that\u0027s all: the burning man in Edward\u0027s face: watching her sicken and waste away... seeing it hurting her, Rosalie crouched over Bella\u0027s limp body: Bella\u0027s life means nothing to her - and for once, no one had anything to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir shock was just a silent shout in my head. Wordless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was halfway home before anyone recovered. Then they all started running to meet me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost dark - the clouds covered the sunset completely. I risked darting across the freeway and made it without being seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe met up about ten miles out of La Push, in a clearing left by the loggers. It was out of the way, wedged between two spurs of the mountain, where no one would see us. Paul found them when I did, so the pack was complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe babble in my head was total chaos. Everyone shouting at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam\u0027s hackles were sticking straight up, and he was growling in an unbroken stream as he paced back and forth around the top of the ring. Paul and Jared moved like shadows behind him, their ears flat against the sides of their head. The whole circle was agitated, on their feet and snarling in low bursts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first their anger was undefined, and I thought I was in for it. I was too messed up to care about that. They could do whatever they wanted to me for circumventing orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the unfocused confusion of thoughts began to move together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can this be? What does it mean? What will it be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot safe. Not right. Dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnnatural. Monstrous. An abomination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can\u0027t allow it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pack was pacing in synchronization now, thinking in synchronization, all but myself and one other. I sat beside whichever brother it was, too dazed to look over with either my eyes or my mind and see who was next to me, while the pack circled around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe treaty does not cover this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis puts everyone in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to understand the spiraling voices, tried to follow the curling pathway the thoughts made to see where they were leading, but it wasn\u0027t making sense. The pictures in the center of their thoughts were my pictures - the very worst of them. Bella\u0027s bruises, Edward\u0027s face as he burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fear it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they won\u0027t do anything about it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtecting Bella Swan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can\u0027t let that influence us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe safety of our families, of everyone here, is more important than one human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf they won\u0027t kill it, we have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtect the tribe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtect our families.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to kill it before it\u0027s too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother of my memories, Edward\u0027s words this time: The thing is growing. Swiftly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled to focus, to pick out individual voices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo time to waste,Jared thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will mean a fight,Embry cautioned. A bad one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere ready,Paul insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell need surprise on our side,Sam thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we catch them divided, we can take them down separately. It will increase our chances of victory, Jared thought, starting to strategize now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, rising slowly to my feet. 1 felt unsteady there - like the circling wolves were making me dizzy. The wolf beside me got up, too. His shoulder pushed against mine, propping me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait,I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe circling paused for one beat, and then they were pacing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s little time,Sam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut - what are you thinking? You wouldn\u0027t attack them for breaking the treaty this afternoon. Now you\u0027re planning an ambush, when the treaty is still intact?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not something our treaty anticipated,Sam said. This is a danger to every human in the area. We don\u0027t know what kind of creature the Cullens have bred, but we know that it is strong and fast-growing. And it will be too young to follow any treaty. Remember the newborn vampires we fought? Wild, violent, beyond the reach of reason or restraint. Imagine one like that, but protected by the Cullens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don\u0027t know - I tried to interrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWedon\u0027t know, he agreed. And we can\u0027t take chances with the unknown in this case. We can only allow the Cullens to exist while we\u0027re absolutely sure that they can be trusted not to cause harm. This. . . thing cannot be trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey don\u0027t like it any more than we do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam pulled Rosalie\u0027s face, her protective crouch, from my mind and put it on display for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome are ready to fight for it, no matter what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s just ababy, for crying out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for long,Leah whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake, buddy, this is a big problem,Quil said. We can\u0027t just ignore it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re making it into something bigger than it is,I argued. The only one who\u0027s in danger here is Bella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain by her own choice,Sam said. But this time her choice affects us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can\u0027t take that chance. We won\u0027t allow a blood drinker to hunt on our lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen tell them to leave,the wolf who was still supporting me said. It was Seth. Of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd inflict the menace on others? When blood drinkers cross our land, we destroy them, no matter where they plan to hunt. We protect everyone we can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is crazy,I said. This afternoon you were afraid to put the pack in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis afternoon I didn\u0027t know our families were at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe this! How\u0027re you going to kill this creature without killing Bella?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no words, but the silence was full of meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI howled. She\u0027s human, too! Doesn\u0027t our protection apply to her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s dying anyway,Leah thought. We\u0027ll just shorten the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat did it. I leaped away from Seth, toward his sister, with my teeth bared. I was about to catch her left hind leg when I felt Sam\u0027s teeth cut into my flank, dragging me back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI howled in pain and fury and turned on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop!he ordered in the double timbre of the Alpha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy legs seemed to buckle under me. I jerked to a halt, only managing to keep on my feet by sheer willpower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his gaze away from me. You will not be cruel to him, Leah, he commanded her. Bella\u0027s sacrifice is a heavy price, and we will all recognize that It is against everything we stand for to take a human life. Making an exception to that code is a bleak thing. We will all mourn for what we do tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight?Seth repeated, shocked. Sam - think we should talk about this some more. Consult with the Elders, at least. You can\u0027t seriously mean for us to -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can\u0027t afford your tolerance for the Cullens now. There is no time for debate. Youwilldo as you are told, Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetfYs front knees folded, and his head fell forward under the weight of the Alpha\u0027s command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam paced in a tight circle around the two of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need the whole pack for this. Jacob, you are our strongest fighter. Youwillfight with us tonight. I understand that this is hard for you, so you will concentrate on their fighters - Emmett and Jasper Cullen. You don\u0027t have to be involved with the... other part. Quil and Embry will fight with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy knees trembled; I struggled to hold myself upright while the voice of the Alpha lashed at my will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul, Jared, and I will take on Edward and Rosalie. I think, from the information Jacob has brought us, they will be the ones guarding Bella. Carlisle and Alice will also be close, possibly Esme. Brady, Collin,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth, and Leah will concentrate on them. Whoever has a clear lineon - we all heard him mentally stutter overBella\u0027s name - the creature will take it. Destroying the creature is our first priority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pack rumbled in nervous agreement.The tension had everyone\u0027s fur standing on end. The pacing was quicker, and the sound of the paws against the brackish floor was sharper, toenails tearing into the soil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Seth and I were still, the eye in the center of a storm of bared teeth and flattened ears. Seth\u0027s nose was almost touching the ground, bowed under Sam\u0027s commands. I felt his pain at the coming disloyalty. For him this was a betrayal - during that one day of alliance, fighting beside Edward Cullen, Seth had truly become the vampire\u0027s friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no resistance in him, however. He would obey no matter how much it hurt him. He had no other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echoice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what choice did I have? When the Alpha spoke, the pack followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam had never pushed his authority this far before; I knew he honestly hated to see Seth kneeling before him like a slave at the foot of his master. He wouldn\u0027t force this if he didn\u0027t believe that he had no other choice. He couldn\u0027t lie to us when we were linked mind to mind like this. He really believed it was our duty to destroy Bella and the monster she carried. He really believed we had no time to waste. He believed it enough to die for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw that he would face Edward himself; Edward\u0027s ability to read our thoughts made him the greatest threat in Sam\u0027s mind. Sam would not let someone else take on that danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw Jasper as the second-greatest opponent, which is why he\u0027d given him to me. He knew that I had the best chance of any of the pack to win that fight. He\u0027d left the easiest targets for the younger wolves and Leah. Little Alice was no danger without her future vision to guide her, and we knew from our time of alliance that Esme was not a fighter. Carlisle would be more of a challenge, but his hatred of violence would hinder him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sicker than Seth as I watched Sam plan it out, trying to work the angles to give each member of the pack the best chance of survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was inside out. This afternoon, I\u0027d been chomping at the bit to attack them. But Seth had been right - it wasn\u0027t a fight I\u0027d been ready for. I\u0027d blinded myself with that hate. I hadn\u0027t let myself look at it carefully, because I must have known what I would see if I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle Cullen. Looking at him without that hate clouding my eyes, I couldn\u0027t deny that killing him was murder. He was good. Good as any human we protected. Maybe better. The others, too, I supposed, but I didn\u0027t feel as strongly about them. I didn\u0027t know them as well. It was Carlisle who would hate fighting back, even to save his own life. That\u0027s why we would be able to kill him - because he wouldn\u0027t want us, his enemies, to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn\u0027t just because killing Bella felt like killing me, like suicide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePull it together, Jacob,Sam ordered. The tribe comes first\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was wrong today, Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour reasons were wrong then.
