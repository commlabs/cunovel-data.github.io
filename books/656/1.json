Annie poured some of the liquid on to his left ankle and some more onto the blade of the axe. \u0027There won\u0027t be much pain, Paul. It won\u0027t be bad.\u0027 It\u0027s no good screaming - no one can hear. And if you think things arc as bad as they can get, just listen to the \u0027morse\u0027. Paul Sheldon is a world-famous writer. On his way to deliver the typewritten pages of his latest book, he has an accident on a snow-covered road. When he wakes up, he\u0027s in bed . . . But it\u0027s not a hospital bed. And though the woman who saved him is one of his greatest admirers, she\u0027s also dangerously insane. And in her lonely country house, she has Paul, his legs badly broken and in extreme pain, completely in her power. When she learns what he has just done to Misery Chastain, her favourite character from his books, Paul knows he\u0027s in trouble, deep trouble. The one thing you don\u0027t do with Annic Wilkes is make her angry. She knows how to cause pain. The only question is, how much can a man stand? Stephen King is probably the most popular author now writing. There are over 150 million copies of his novels in print and he makes $2 million a month from his books and the films of his books. He was born in 1947 in Portland, Maine, USA and became a full-time writer after his first novel, Carrie (1973), was sold for $400,000. Many of King\u0027s books have been made into films. The screen version of Misery was one of the most popular films of 1990. Kathy Bates won an Oscar for playing Annie Wilkes. James Caan played Paul Sheldon.
