Then peering at the honed edge, before snorting. ‘Looks a hundred years old, and neglected for half that.’ She returned it to the sled. ‘Why aren’t there any Letherii weapons here?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Liosan steal them, sir.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, that’s one way to beat us – a mass exchange of weapons, until all we’re left with is that useless crap they brought from the other side. Better send word to the prince – we need to deny them these particular spoils, and make a point of it.’ Pithy retrieved her old sword. ‘Here, you got small fingers – see if you can thread that strip through on the end here, where it’s pulled loose. Just thread it and I’ll do the rest.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of her fingers, the girl used her teeth, and in moments had managed to tug the leather strip through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Smart lass.’ Pithy tugged hard on the strip and was pleased to see the coil draw tighter to the wooden handles encasing the tang. ‘There, should do for the next fight or two. Thanks for helping fix my sword. Now, off you go – I see ’em massing again on the other side.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl took up the ropes and hurried off with her sled, the ivory runners sliding easily across the strand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaptain Pithy walked to her place in the line. ‘Now,’ she said in a loud voice, ‘it’s Nithe’s day off, the lazy shit. He probably thinks he’s earned those five whores and the jug of wine sharing his bed, but that was just me feeling sorry for him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Cap’n’s a pimp!’ someone shouted from a few rows back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePithy waited for the laughter to die down. ‘Can’t make piss on the coin they pay officers in this army, so don’t begrudge me something on the side.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Never you, Captain!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorns sounded and Pithy faced the breach. ‘Coming through, soldiers! Harden up now like a virgin’s dream! Weapons ready!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vague mass of shapes, pushing and then slashing through bruised light thin as skin. Then the blades drew back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s this? Something different – what are —\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the wound, three enormous Hounds bursting through. Blood-thick sand sprayed as the creatures skidded. One twisted to one side, shot off towards the Shake line on Pithy’s right, a white blur, huge as a bull. Another charged for the other flank, and the one directly before Pithy met her eyes in the instant before it lowered its broad head, and she felt the strength leave her body in a single, soft breath. Then the Hound lunged straight at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the jaws stretched wide, revealing canines long as daggers, Yan Tovis ducked low and swung her sword. The blade bit into the left of the beast’s neck, and then rebounded in a splash of blood. Beside her, a Shake warrior shrieked, but the cry was short-lived, vanishing when the beast bit down, its jaws engulfing his head. Bones crunching, the man was lifted from his feet as the Hound reared back, fangs sawing through his neck. Gore sprayed as the headless corpse fell to the sand and rolled on to its back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis thrust her sword, but the point skidded across the beast’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnarling, it swung its head. The impact sent Yan Tovis spinning. Landing hard, she rolled on to her side, seeing Liosan ranks plunging through the breach not fifteen paces from her. She’d lost her sword, and her groping hand found nothing but clumps of blood-glued sand. She could feel her strength faltering, draining away, pain spreading across half her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, the Hound began killing her people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt ends. As simple as that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pikes!’ someone screamed – was it me? As the massive Hound leapt for her, Pithy dropped to the sand, twisted as the beast passed directly over her, and thrust her sword into its belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point was punched back out as if fired from a crossbow, driving her elbow into the ground. One of the Hound’s back legs lifted her from the sand, carried her flailing forward. She heard the clash of pike shafts close in on all sides. Half stunned, she curled up beneath the beast. Its snarls filled her world, along with the crunch of bones and the shrieks of dying Letherii. She was kicked again, this time spilling her out to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeeth grinding, she forced herself into a crouch. She still held her sword, glued to her hand now by streams of blood – she was cut somewhere – and she made herself close on the thrashing demon. Lunged. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-224.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
