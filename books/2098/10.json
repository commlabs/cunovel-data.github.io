Her room was bright but cold, and the March morning air contained a windy chil that shook the windows. She would have given anything to stay beneath her warm covers and hide from the day, but she knew that wasn\u0027t an option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead she got up, wrapped herself in her blue terrycloth bathrobe, and made her way outside to fetch the newspaper. She assumed there would be a write-up on Constance in the obituary section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no paper on the front porch, but Cassie did find Adam, curled up beneath his jacket, asleep on the porch swing. She watched him for a moment. How peaceful he looked, but he couldn\u0027t be comfortable. His long legs and arms were pretzeled into the swing, hanging halfway off. He\u0027d probably been there all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis boy really loves me, Cassie thought to herself, looking down on his beautifully sculpted body, crunched as it was within the confines of the swing. He probably loves me way too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out and grazed his cheekbone with her fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled sleepily at her, stretching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What in the world are you doing out here?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam quickly took inventory of his surroundings and rubbed the back of his sore neck. \"Protecting you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the witch hunters?\" Cassie blurted out. \"But who was protecting you while you were out here all night protecting me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was,\" Adam said, and then laughed. \"But I guess I dozed off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie took his face into her hands. \"What am I going to do with you?\" She kissed his chapped lips slowly and warmly. \"Promise me next time you\u0027ll at least come inside and sleep on the couch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam kissed her back passionately. He wrapped his strong arms around her and pulled her in close. She could smell the ocean on his clothes and in the creases of his neck. She kissed him there and expected to taste salt, but instead it tasted fresh and cold like ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise,\" he said, with a shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you come inside now and let me warm you up?\" she asked flirtatiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked his long dark lashes at her and eagerly followed her through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Faye?\" Diana asked, but nobody seemed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana had found a protective spell in her Book of Shadows, and she wanted to cast it upon the group as soon as possible. But they\u0027d been waiting at the beach for over an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faye\u0027s been late to every meeting this week,\" Diana said. \"This is unacceptable. Suzan, will you call her again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not answering,\" Suzan said. \"She\u0027s been totally sketchy lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean nodded. \"We had plans with her last night, and she blew us off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it were anyone other than Faye they were talking about, Cassie would have been worried. But she knew Faye would show up eventually. In the meantime, Cassie was glad to be at the beach rather than the lighthouse. She felt safe there among the long stretch of sand, the steady repetition of crashing waves, and the vast, limitless sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to enjoy every last second they had before tourist season littered the sand with strangers. She imagined it now like a nightmare: foldout chairs as far as the eye could see, bratty sunbathers, and self-righteous surfers; toppled-over soda cans and screaming, orange-fingered, Dorito-munching children. She much preferred a cold, abandoned beach to a hot, crowded one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of Scarlett then, how it would be nice to invite her out to the beach one night this week. Maybe they could build a bonfire and make s\u0027mores. It would be a fun way to offset all this stressful Circle business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Faye appeared, waking Cassie from her daydream. \"Am I late?\" she said. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been?\" Diana asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, you couldn\u0027t handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana ignored her comment. \"We need to begin the protection spell before the sun starts to set.\" Cassie tried to assume the role of a leader as the group arranged themselves into a wide circle formation. Diana kneeled in front of a stone kettle, mixing together a dark, oily concoction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In this cauldron is salt water from the ocean mixed with blueberry oill and eucalyptus,\" she said. Then she looked up at Faye and Cassie. \"Will the two of you, together, use the dagger to draw our circle around me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye unsheathed the silver dagger, which had been concealed beneath her flowing black skirt, strapped to the inside of her thigh. Her eyes narrowed, as they always did when she had a sharp object in her grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me your hand,\" she said to Cassie. She guided Cassie\u0027s thin fingers around the dagger\u0027s pearl handle and enveloped them with her own. Together, as one, they drew the circle in the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach member of the group stepped inside as Melanie placed two candles on either end of the cauldron Diana was mixing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here I place two candles,\" Melanie announced according to ceremony. \"One blue, for physical protection, and one purple, for power and wisdom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she bent down to light the candles, she recited a chant from Diana\u0027s Book of Shadows: \"Divine Goddess, God Divine, if evil dwells within this place, make it now leave our space.\" She then positioned the book on the ground beside Diana and took her spot within the circle next to Laurel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana stood in the center of the circle holding up the cauldron. \"In order for this to work,\" she said, \"you all need to picture a white light around you. Let it surround your whole body as I recite the chant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone agreed and closed their eyes. Diana raised the cauldron high up to the sky and said, \"By the power of the Source, no evil shal enter here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Cassie closed her eyes, too, and pictured a white light wrapping itself around her like a warm winter coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana\u0027s voice dropped an octave, and the chant left her throat like thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePsychic hunters in the night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePsychic hunters of the day\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDestroy no more what I achieve\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDestroy no more what I receive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a few seconds of quiet, hindered only by the Bill owing wind and crashing waves. Then, Cassie heard the bell-like echo of Diana stirring the mixture inside the stone cauldron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith this potion, I anoint this Circle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be protected from you, this magic I do Cassie opened her eyes and watched Diana rub a smudge of the inky blue mixture upon her forehead with her thumb. Then she did the same to Faye\u0027s forehead, and Cassie\u0027s, and all the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she finished anointing the group, Diana asked Cassie and Faye to join her in the center. The three of them held hands around the cauldron and candles, with closed eyes. Cassie pictured the white light surrounding not only her own body now but the whole group as one. She imagined it encapsulating them like a giant helium ball oon and floating them up to the safety of the cloudless sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana finished the spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the power of this ocean, wide and deep, By the power of day, and night, and powers three, This is our will, so let it be!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle by little, everyone opened their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did it work?\" Sean asked, raising his fingers up to the blue smudge on his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long do we have to walk around with this oill on us?\" Suzan asked. \"It probably causes breakouts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can go wash it off in the ocean in just a minute,\" Diana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s it?\" Faye asked, picking up the dagger from the sand and re-sheathing it beneath her skirt. \"We\u0027re invincible now? Why didn\u0027t we do this long ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are conditions,\" Diana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" W ha t conditions?\" Faye asked, mocking Diana\u0027s measured, proper tone of voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana wasn\u0027t bothered by Faye\u0027s ridicule, probably because she was so accustomed to it. \"We\u0027ll be safe from bodily harm inflicted by the hunters,\" she said. \"But the spell only protects us on the island of New Salem. If we step beyond that, we\u0027re vulnerable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So nobody leaves the island,\" Adam said. \"Under any circumstances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over at Nick, who had taken to disappearing for days at a time, but Nick ignored him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana dug a deep hole in the sand to discard the remaining potion. \"It also doesn\u0027t mean the hunters can\u0027t find us. So everyone has to be extra careful. We have to do everything we can to remain undetected.\" She stood up, wiped the sand from her hands, and looked directly at Faye. \"We can\u0027t practice magic at all. The hunters will be looking for anything out of the ordinary to find out who we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Faye charged at Diana like she might tackle her to the ground. \"Our magic is the only power we have. How else are we supposed to defeat these guys if we can\u0027t use magic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana squared her thin shoulders to Faye and matched her gaze with equal ferocity. \"We find them before they find us,\" she said. \"That\u0027s how we\u0027re going to defeat them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faye,\" Melanie said, stepping between her and Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are my aunt\u0027s murderers we\u0027re talking about. You\u0027re going to put your magic on hold, because if you don\u0027t, you\u0027re putting the whole group at risk. And we can\u0027t have that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCool-headed Melanie had never threatened anyone in her life, but here she was, an inch taller than Faye, ready for a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam got between them before things had a chance to escalate. \"Everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down,\" he said. \"We can\u0027t afford to be fighting each other right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Melanie argued, shoving Adam\u0027s peacekeeping hand aside. \"What we can\u0027t afford is Faye not following Circle rules when our lives are at stake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, Faye.\" Adam was practically begging her to cooperate. \"No magic. Just until we figure out who the hunters are. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. My God, you people are so boring.\" Faye began walking away, toward the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not all,\" Diana called out. \"We also need to be on the lookout for Outsiders who are getting too close. And anyone new in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana glanced sharply at Cassie. She didn\u0027t name Scarlett specifically, but she didn\u0027t have to. Then she turned to Faye. \"So you need to lay off Max.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzan smirked. \"How can she lay off him when he won\u0027t even let her lay on him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye looked like all the fight had been knocked out of her. It obviously bothered her that Max wasn\u0027t falling under her spell like every other boy in school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\" she asked Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana nodded. \"For now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye turned and marched toward the ocean to wash her forehead clean. Her black skirt and hair flowed behind her like a dark shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning at school, Faye pulled into the empty parking space beside Cassie and Adam. \"Is Diana here yet?\" she asked, before she was even out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" Adam said. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye looked anxiously around the school lot, at Sally and Portia gathering their pompoms and books, at a few lacrosse players playing catch, and finally at Suzan sitting on the hood of her Corol a, applying mascara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t handle this no-magic thing,\" Faye said. \"I had to wait for water to boil this morning. Can you believe that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight minutes. Like I have nothing better to do with my time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with Faye,\" Suzan said from behind her hand mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel so ordinary, so unexceptional. It\u0027s dehumanizing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And on top of all that, you have a stain on your shirt,\" Faye said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" Suzan scratched at the blotch on her collar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do normal people get ketchup out of their clothes?\" Diana zipped her Volvo into the spot next to Faye and hurriedly pushed her door open. She was less put together than usual. Her hair was loose and wild, and her jacket was hanging half off. She had a coffee cup in one hand and a bagel in the other, which she shoved in her mouth to dig for her books in the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See,\" Faye said. \"Even Diana\u0027s a mess. We can\u0027t live like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil this moment, Cassie hadn\u0027t realized how much her friends used magic in their everyday lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam helped Diana with her books. \"This isn\u0027t easy for any of us,\" he said. \"But we have to stick with it. It\u0027s only temporary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the group arrived sporadically. Whether it was purely psychological or not, Cassie noticed they all seemed a bit distressed without their magic - except Deborah, who tore through the parking lot with her motorcycle up on one wheel. Cars and people scattered from her path until she lowered the front tire down, screeched to a halt, and cut the engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s your helmet?\" Diana asked, once Deborah joined the rest of the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeborah rolled her eyes. \"I\u0027m not going to mess up my hair with a helmet when I\u0027m invincible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may be invincible,\" Diana said. \"But you can still accidentally run over somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then maybe they should be wearing helmets,\" Faye said, which drew a sharp look from Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, don\u0027t abuse the protection spell,\" Diana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not an excuse to be irresponsible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re telling me this?\" Deborah removed one of her leather gloves, then the other, and pointed at the sky. \"What about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie noticed everyone in the parking lot had stopped going about their business and were focused on something overhead. She followed the communal gaze, just as Diana did, to find Chris and Doug on the roof of the school building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone screamed out, \"What are those maniacs doing up there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they\u0027re fencing,\" another voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana had to look away. \"Please tell me they didn\u0027t bring real swords to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically they\u0027re not in school,\" Sean said. \"They\u0027re on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris and Doug sparred back and forth, swinging wildly at each other, ducking and bobbing. The crowd gasped as Doug took a slicing hit on the shoulder. He cried out, dropped to the ground, and fake blood spurted from the rooftop like a sprinkler. Their schoolmates started to scream, but then Doug jumped back to his feet with one arm hidden within his sleeve and resumed the fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re having way too much fun with this,\" Adam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie eyed the crowd of spectators, wondering if any of them noticed Chris and Doug were impenetrable to the swords\u0027 sharp blades. But everyone was so accustomed to the twins\u0027 crazy antics that none of them seemed to question it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Max, who was still the talk of the school, was amused by their performance. He was standing with his lacrosse friends and the swarm of pretty girls who fluttered around him at all times. The girls had, for once, diverted their attention away from Max to watch the rooftop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug slashed Chris across the chest, slitting his shirt diagonally open. It flapped like a flag in the wind. \"Serves you right, brother,\" Chris called out. \"This T-shirt was one of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughter passed over the crowd in a wave. Max shook his head, stepped away from his crew, and made his way over to Diana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone should stop those two,\" he said. \"Before they\u0027re both completely naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie observed how Max\u0027s admirers visibly sighed at the sight of him talking to Diana. They obviously considered her competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can\u0027t be the one to stop them,\" Max continued, leaning in close to her. \"Can\u0027t you work some of your magic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana froze for a second, but it was clear to Cassie that Max meant nothing by it. He was fixated on Diana\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have every guy in school at your beck and call,\" he said to her. \"I imagine if anyone can get them down, it\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiana exhaled deeply and laughed. She self-consciously tried to smooth her hair down, but it remained beautifully tousled. \"If only that were true,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can get them off the roof,\" Faye offered, but Max ignored her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just that if my dad catches them up there, there\u0027s no telling what he\u0027ll do,\" Max said. \"He\u0027s not big on kids bringing weapons to school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Understandably,\" Diana answered, nodding. But before she could return her attention to Chris and Doug, Nick appeared on the roof behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The show\u0027s over,\" he called out, approaching the two of them like he might wring their necks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris and Doug looked at each other and dropped their swords. They raised their hands in defense and backed away from Nick, edging closer and closer to the roof\u0027s edge. The crowd fell silent. It had to be a twenty-foot drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick caught on to the trick and stood still. \"That\u0027s enough,\" he said. \"You had your fun. Now just come down quietly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris and Doug glanced at the crowd and then latched hands. \"Never!\" they screamed, and leaped from the roof, landing on a large Dumpster below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople covered their mouths and turned away. Even Max winced, subtly turning his face in toward Diana\u0027s as he did so. But the twins landed with a synchronized tumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a scratch, they climbed down and took their bows. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-divide-the-secret-circle-4/page-10.html","bookId":2098,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:39 PM"}
