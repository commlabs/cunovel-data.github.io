{"id":29551,"no":21,"title":"XXI. A FRIEND.—PRISONER’S BASE.","content":"“So The Count asked you if you were rich?” said a pretty little boy of about my own age, as he came up to where I was standing; “don’t mind what he says, he is a little cracked. Did what he said distress you? Don’t cry, there is nothing to cry about; The Count doesn’t know what he says half his time. He always goes off by himself in that grand way, when we first come out to play; but when once we have settled upon a game, and are going to begin, he forgets his straps and other toggery, and plays harder than any of us. Will you play at Prisoner’s Base?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t know the game,” I answered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No?” said he, in a surprised tone. “Well, I will teach it to you; it’s not difficult, you shall be on my side.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I did not dare to refuse the offer which was so kindly made, and yet I scarcely dared to accept it. My new friend, however, who was full of spirit and fun, cut short my excuses, and, taking me by the hand, led me off. As we walked across the playground he informed me that his name was Marc Sublaine, and that his father was the president of the local tribunal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In enlisting me on his side he had made but a sorry recruit; and in the beginning his comrades did not scruple to tell him so. I utterly ignored all the rules of the game: I rushed blindly about, without the least method. I allowed myself to be made prisoner like a goose; and, once prisoner, I began to think of something else, instead of trying to escape, and holding out my hand to my comrades to help me. Once, when I was near making a prisoner—just on the point, in fact, of catching him—the boy, who felt he would be caught directly, turned and ran after me; when I, stupidly afraid of him, ran off as fast as I could amid shouts of laughter from both sides.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once I forgot which side I belonged to. Each cried out, “Here, here! this way!” and I ran first to one, and then the other, bewildered and in such a state of agitation that I nearly gave up the game. If I had done so I should have lost the good opinion of my playfellows for ever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fortunately just about this time the clock struck, and the two sides mingled together to go into school. I feared that I should be reproached for being so stupid and playing so badly; but the boys had laughed merrily at me and felt no ill-will towards me. Marc put his arm through mine; he smiled at me, it was with good nature and no desire to tease me. I felt I loved this kind boy with all my heart; and at the same time I felt very sorry that I had behaved so ridiculously while playing; for I feared he must despise me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am afraid you must think me very silly?” I said timidly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Very silly? why should I?” he answered kindly. “Not at all. You didn’t know the game and you made mistakes; that was all. One can’t do things all at once: one must learn how to do them. But I will tell you what I noticed when we were playing, and that was that you are a very good tempered boy.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I reddened with pleasure, and without thinking that my request might appear sudden and strange, I said to him, “Will you be my friend?” and I held out my hand to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He took it, and looking in my face, smiled again, and simply said:—“I should like it very much.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I cast a look of triumph in The Count’s direction; but unfortunately his back was turned towards me.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1958/56168.html","bookId":746,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:40:01 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:40:01 AM"}
