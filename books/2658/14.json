With rhythmic laps of his tongue, he abraded the stiff peak, intuitively knowing how to make her mad for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Marcus …” She struggled, knowing it was wrong to give in, fighting to regain control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a low growl, he released her breast and yanked the sheet out of the way. He covered her body with his, his mouth claiming hers, the heat and hardness of his frame causing her to melt into him helplessly. His hands moved with tender skill, knowing her so well, ravishing her senses, coaxing away her tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil she dissolved in pleasure, falling from grace with a cry of surrender, knowing even as she did so that the climb back up grew longer by the moment …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth entered the main house through the study’s garden doors. Although not yet dawn, the kitchen staff would already be preparing for the day’s meals and she didn’t want to chance crossing paths with one of them. Not with her hair a fright and her skin so flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elizabeth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, she jumped. Finding William in the open doorway, her stomach tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, William?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A moment, if you please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, she waited as he stepped into the room and closed them inside. She braced herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What in hell are you doing with Westfield? In our guesthouse? Have you lost your wits?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” There was no point in denying it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” he asked, clearly confused and hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll kill him,” he growled. “To treat you like this, to use you so callously. I told you to stay away from him, that his intentions were dishonorable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tried, truly I did.” Turning away, Elizabeth sank into a nearby chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuttering an oath, William began to pace in front of her. “You could have had anyone. If you were so set against marriage, you could have chosen a more suitable companion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“William, I love you for your concern, but I am a grown woman and I can make my own decisions, especially about something as personal as taking a lover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good God,” he bit out. “To have to speak of such matters with you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t, you know,” she said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yes, I do.” He rounded on her. “After suffering through your endless lectures about my licentious behavior—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you see, I learned from the best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam stilled. “You’ve no notion. You are in over your head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth took a deep breath. “Perhaps. Or perhaps it is Westfield who is out of his depth.” If not, he soon would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. “Elizabeth—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough, William, I’m tired.” She stood and moved toward the hallway. “Westfield will call this evening to escort me to the Fairchilds’ dinner.” She’d tried to argue, but Marcus insisted her safety was in question. It was either with his escort or she couldn’t attend. He’d been adamant, in his charming, drawling way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” William snapped. “I’ll have a word with him when he arrives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved her hand nonchalantly over her shoulder. “Be my guest. Send for me when you’re done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is odious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gathered you think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An abomination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, yes.” She moved out into the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will thrash him if he hurts you,” William called after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth stopped and turned to face him. As meddling as he was, he was acting out of love, and she adored him for it. With a tender smile, she returned to him and hugged his waist. He crushed her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are the most vexing sibling,” he said into her hair. “Why could you not be more pliable and even-tempered?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I would bore you to tears and drive you insane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “Yes, I supposed you would at that.” He pulled back. “Be careful, please. I couldn’t bear to see you hurt again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sadness evident on his handsome features tugged at her heart, and reminded her of the precariousness of her situation. Playing with Marcus was playing with fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry so much, William.” Linking her arm with his, Elizabeth tugged him toward the staircase. “Trust me to take care of myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m trying, but it’s damned difficult when you engage in stupidity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, Elizabeth released his arm and ran up the stairs. “First one to the vase at the end of the gallery wins.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEasily reaching the vase first, William escorted Elizabeth to her bed chamber. Then he returned to his own room and wasted no time changing. He left a bewildered Margaret still abed and traveled into town to the Westfield townhouse. Taking the steps two at a time, he pounded the brass knocker that graced the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe portal opened, revealing a butler dripping in chilly hauteur as he gazed down the length of his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanding over his card, William barreled his way through the doorway and entered the foyer. “You may announce me to Lord Westfield,” he said curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler glanced at the card. “Lord Westfield is from home, Lord Barclay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord Westfield is abed,” William snapped. “And you will rouse him and bring him to me or I will seek him out myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a disdainful arch of his brow, the servant led him to the study, and then retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the door opened again, Marcus entered. William lunged at his old friend without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bloody hell,” Marcus cursed as he was tackled to the rug. He cursed again when William’s fist connected with his ribcage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam continued to rain blows as they rolled across the study floor, bumping into the chaise and knocking over a chair. Marcus made every effort to deflect the attack, but not once did he fight back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Son of a bitch,” William growled, made more furious by being denied the fight he’d come for. “I’ll kill you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damned if you’re not doing an admirable job of it,” Marcus grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, there were more arms in the fray, intervening and pulling them apart. Yanked to their feet, William fought off the unyielding grip that held his arms behind him. “Damn you, Ashford. Release me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Paul Ashford held tight. “In a moment, my lord. No offense intended. But Mother is home, and she does not care much for brawls in the house. Always made us go outside, you see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus stood opposite him and a few feet away, shrugging off the helping hand of Robert Ashford, the youngest of the three brothers. The resemblance between the two was uncanny. Only Robert’s gold-rimmed spectacles and slighter frame distinguished the two. Unlike the brother behind William, who was raven-haired and dark-eyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam ceased his struggles, and Paul released him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly, gentlemen,” Paul said, straightening his waistcoat and wig. “Much as I love a good fracas in the morning, you should at least be dressed for the occasion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding a hand to his side, Marcus ignored his brother and said, “I trust your spirits have improved, Barclay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Slightly.” William glared. “It would have been more sporting if you’d participated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And risk angering Elizabeth? Don’t be daft.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam snorted. “As if you have a care for her feelings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No doubt of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why this? Why use her in this manner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert pushed up his spectacles, and cleared his throat. “I think we’re done here, Paul.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope so,” Paul muttered. “Not the type of conversation I prefer to have at this time of morning. Now be good, gentlemen. Next time, it may be Mother who intercedes. I would pity you both then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brothers shut the door behind them as they retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus ran a hand through his hair. “Remember that chit you dallied with when we were at Oxford? The baker’s daughter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” William remembered her well. A young, nubile thing. Beautiful and worldly, she was free with her favors. Celia loved a good hard fuck more than most and he’d been hot to give it to her. In fact, they’d once spent three days in bed, taking time only to bathe and eat. She’d been enjoyable with no strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he caught the implication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you want to die?” William growled. “You are talking about my sister for God’s sake!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And a woman grown,” Marcus pointed out. “A widow, no innocent maid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elizabeth is nothing like Celia. She hasn’t the experience to engage in fleeting liaisons. She could be hurt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? She seemed able to jilt me well enough and she shows no remorse for her actions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would she? You were an absolute cad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are both to blame.” Marcus moved to one of the wingbacks that flanked the dark fireplace and lowered himself into a weary sprawl. “However, things appear to have worked out for the best. She was not unhappy with Hawthorne.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then leave well enough alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I cannot. There is something remaining between us. We’ve both agreed, as consenting adults, to allow it to run its course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam moved to take the seat opposite. “I still cannot understand that Elizabeth could be so …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonchalant? Laissez faire?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, exactly.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “She was devastated at what you’d done, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah yes. So devastated she married another man posthaste.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What better way to run?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think I don’t know her?” William asked, shaking his head. “Have a care with her affections,” he warned as he stood and moved toward the door. He paused on the threshold and looked back. “If you hurt her, Westfield, I’ll see you on a field at dawn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus tilted his head in acknowledgment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the meantime, come early this evening. We can await the women together. Father still has a fine collection of brandy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An irresistible invitation. I will be there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhat mollified, William made his egress. He also made a mental reminder to clean his pistols.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ball was a massive success, as witnessed by the overflowing ballroom and the beaming face of the hostess, Lady Marks-Darby. Elizabeth wove her way through the crush, escaping onto a deserted balcony. From her vantage point, she could see couples wandering through the intricate maze of hedges in the garden below. She closed her eyes and took a deep, cleansing breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last week had been both heaven and hell. She went to Marcus every night in the guesthouse and while he’d never promised anything in return, she’d had her own expectations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she suggested the affair, she assumed he would pounce on her immediately upon her arrival, carry her off to bed, and when finished with her body take his leave. Instead, he drew her into conversation or fed her sumptuous cold suppers he brought with him. He encouraged discourse on a variety of topics and appeared genuinely interested in her opinions. He asked her about her favorite books and purchased the ones she mentioned that he had not yet read. It was all so very strange. She was completely unaccustomed to such intimacy, which seemed much more pervasive than their physical connection. Not that Marcus ever allowed her to forget that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her in a constant state of physical turmoil. An erotic master, Marcus used the entirety of his formidable skill to make certain he never left her mind for even a moment. He found ways to surreptitiously brush against her shoulder or slip his hand down the curve of her spine. He bent far too close when speaking, breathing in her ear in a way that made her quiver with longing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughter from the maze below brought a thankful respite from her thoughts. Two women came to a halt directly beneath the balcony, their melodious voices floating up to be heard clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The marriageable men are slim in number this Season,” said one to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is unfortunately true. And it’s hideous luck that Lord Westfield should be so determined to win that wager. He practically hovers over Hawthorne’s widow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She seems not to care much for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fool is unaware of what she is missing. He is glorious. His entire body is a work of art. I must confess, I am completely besotted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth gripped the railing with white-knuckled force as one of the women giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lure him back, if you miss him so keenly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I shall,” came the smug reply. “Lady Hawthorne may be beautiful, but she’s a cold one. He’s merely in it for the sport. Once he has redeemed himself, he’ll want a little more fire in his bed. And I’ll be waiting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the women gasped in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, ladies,” interrupted a masculine voice. The two women continued further into the maze, leaving Elizabeth to fume on the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unmitigated gall! She grit her teeth until her jaw ached. The damned wager. How could she have forgotten?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady Hawthorne?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned at the sound of her name murmured in a deep, pleasantly raspy voice behind her. She eyed the gentleman who approached, taking in his appearance in an effort to identify him. “Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was tall and elegantly dressed. She could not know his hair color, covered as it was by a wig that was long in the back and tied at his nape. He wore a mask that wrapped around his eyes, but the brilliant blue color of his irises refused to be contained by it. Something about him arrested her gaze, tugging at her memory in a vaguely familiar way, and yet she was certain she had never met him before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we acquainted?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head and she straightened, studying him closely as he emerged from the shadows of the overhang. What she could see of his face was well deserving of such beautiful eyes. He was, quite frankly, beyond handsome. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ask-for-it-georgian-1/page-14.html","bookId":2658,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:09 AM"}
