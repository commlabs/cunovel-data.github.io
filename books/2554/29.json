Hold that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThompson smiled. \"Well, well. Look who got invited to the party. I didn\u0027t know if Tyleski had got to you or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tyleski?\" The name threw Ernst for a second, then he remembered. \"Oh, yes. That was the name he gave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bogus as all hell.\" He raised the paper sack he was carrying. \"But these will bring out the truth. Before the night is over, we\u0027ll know everything about this guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst removed the Taser from his pocket and held it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will help too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s way too tame, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if he is the one who Tasered us last summer, it is only fair, no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThompson grinned. \"Well, maybe for appetizers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator stopped at the top floor and he let Thompson lead the way across the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, everybody,\" he said as he opened the door to the loft. \"It\u0027s party ti - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped dead one step inside the threshold. Ernst was expecting that but purposely ran into him from behind, pushing him farther into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit!\" Thompson cried. \"Oh, fuck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst put on a suitably shocked expression and pushed past him. Perhaps only partially put on. It always surprised him how much blood the human body contained. And when it ran out through multiple large exit wounds, it formed pools of remarkable size. These three pools had merged into a crimson lake. Clotting had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThompson seemed mesmerized by the blood, but he tore his gaze away and focused on the empty chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I can see that,\" Ernst said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how? Szeto and I taped him into that chair ourselves. No way he could have gotten out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst stepped around the pool of blood and inspected the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tape? What tape? There is no tape here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s gotta be!\" Thompson\u0027s eyes looked ready to pop from his head. \"What the fuck\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Szeto once told me he thought he was a ninja.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A ninja? Naw, he was just some American guy, but this - this is like supernatural!\" He looked around. \"We better get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that is wise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the bodies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis encounter had served its purpose. The Order would want answers. Ernst would say he arrived and found them all dead. Thompson would back that up. But Ernst would wonder aloud about Thompson ... the last to see the three men alive ... or had they been alive when he\u0027d left? He claimed to have taped the stranger into the chair, but no tape was evident when Ernst arrived ... could he be working with the stranger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Order would find no evidence of that, but the questions would focus attention on Thompson while Ernst searched for clues to the One\u0027s whereabouts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven better, the One might contact him. Since he could no longer go to Szeto for \"minor logistical support,\" as he\u0027d called it, would he turn again to Ernst Drexler? Ernst hoped so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf that happened, and if Ernst regained the One\u0027s trust and favor, the deal with Jack would be null and void. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-29.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
