She struck the water, and for a short time was so disoriented that she dared not move. Eventually her head broke water and she caught a glimpse of the dorkon drawing away from her. She tried not to stare after it, knowing that would only serve to sap her fading spirits to no purpose. The dorkon\u0027s wake was froth in the moonlight, then drifted and was lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a terrible effort, Olivia worked her knife out of her belt, trying not to thrash with the struggle. Part of the time she was able to breathe air, occasionally she was under the water, and it stung her nose and lungs, adding to the discomfort and confusion that was gradually overwhelming her. She fumbled with the knife and it dropped to the bottom of her sack; it took her far too long to retrieve it, and when she did, her whole body was lethargic, so that any movement at all was a grueling ordeal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brought the knife up to the cord around her neck, but could not cut it. Disheartened, she let herself drift for a little time, then resolved to make another attempt. This time she tried to cut the sack itself. One, two, three times she poked at the rough fabric without success. On the fourth jab, which she noticed was weaker than the others had been, the tip of the knife snagged on a heavy slub in the weave, and as she tried to pull it free, a large tear opened like the mouth of an exotic sea creature. Sobbing, choking, Olivia renewed her efforts, and at last she had ripped away all but the small section of the sack that held the cord around her neck like a bizarre wreath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was out of the sack, but her body was exhausted; the earth in the soles of her shoes was wet, steadily losing its potency. Only the power of the night gave her any resistance to the insidious somnolence that tempted her. It would be so easy to stop fighting, to yield to the seductive lure of the water, to drift away from all the turmoil and the pain and the strife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the distant motion of the torches on the fishing boats held any fascination to her, and she clung to that with some small, committed core of herself. If they could float, so would she! Her arms ached whenever she moved them, her head was muzzy, her legs might as well have belonged to someone else for all the sense she had of them. Her knife was gone, dropped some time—she did not recall when—while she strove to escape from the sack. She focused her dwindling attention on the fishing boats and hoped that morning would not come too soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDazed, demoralized, she floundered, sometimes keeping the torches in sight, sometimes not. There were fewer of them, she thought. Most of the fishermen must have their catch and were now returning to the land. She tried to paddle toward them, but the effort was too great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it did seem to her, she thought when she was not filled with chaos, that a few of the boats were nearer. One of the torches seemed to be growing larger, and she made a last, pathetic effort to swim toward it. She splashed ineffectively, and for a short time she slipped under the surface again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she rose and was able to clear her head a bit, she noticed that one of the fishing boats had come quite near, and was moving back and forth over the sea. She watched it, bemused, her body no longer able to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was gazing up into the immensity of the night, caught by the beauty and vastness of the sky, the constellations no longer clear to her, when something brushed her outflung arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia let out a hoarse yelp, then whimpered as a darkness loomed between her and the stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Poseidon, will you give me your hand, Olivia?\" Niklos ordered in an undervoice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she was certain that none of this was happening, that she had actually sunk to the depths of the sea and was lost in a pleasant dream, she did her best to humor herself, and with tremendous exertion, was able to wag her hand out of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiklos grabbed it, muttering a string of obscenities that would have awed the boatmaster. He was desperate with worry, and took little care about how he got her aboard. Dragging first her arm and then her leg, he wrestled her over the side and onto the rough planks. He wrapped four stout ropes around her, securing her to the mast. All the while he watched her, distracted with apprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Zejhil!\" he commanded, keeping his voice low since he was aware how well sound carried over water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tartar woman came from the shallow hold. \"You have her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, and the word itself made him giddy. \"Bring that rolled mattress. Wrap it around her. And then head for Cyzicus.\" He rose from his task and went to the high tiller set aft in the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZejhil obeyed, her impassive features only once revealing the alarm she felt. \"She is half-drowned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But only half,\" Niklos pointed out, letting himself laugh for the first time in days. He kept his eye on the shore, but his attention was more on Olivia than the line of darkness at the edge of the bright sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNear dawn, Olivia turned her head. \"Niklos?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the word was little more than a croaking whisper, Niklos beamed at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to Kythera.\" He glanced down at Zejhil asleep in the bottom of the boat. \"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll… heal.\" She leaned back against the mast. \"This mattress is soaked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So were you,\" he pointed out, leaving most of his feelings unspoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That hymn—?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave a donation to three monks; I said it was for a relative feared lost at sea. They accepted the donation.\" He secured the tiller with cords, then came to her side. \"Shall I take the mattress away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. I still need it.\" Her voice was faint but each word was steadier, less strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" He beamed at her. \"Tell me about it later. There\u0027s plenty of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answering smile was weary and her chuckle ended in a cough, but at last she said, \"Yes, centuries. Thanks to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiklos put his hand on her stringy, matted hair. \"Just returning an old favor.\" As he got to his feet, he said, \"Sunrise soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia turned her head to the stern of the boat and saw the first tarnished glow at the rim of the sea. As she watched, it brightened and smoldered, as if distant Constantinople were on fire. She closed her eyes, and when she opened them, she had turned, facing the bow again, and the pallid moonpath spread over the wrinkled sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eText of a letter from Chrysanthos to Belisarius, delivered to Konstantinoupolis three weeks after the General\u0027s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the great and admirable Belisarius, greetings from the godforsaken out-post Colonna Romanum where Chrysanthos now commands, by default as much as promotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has been more than three years since I have written, and almost nine since I have seen you. For the lack of letters, I ask pardon, but there has been so little to tell. Out here, we are cut off half the time, and the rest of the time we are so bored that there is nothing to report except for the number of flies biting the horses. Ever since Totila was killed, and then his heir Teias, we\u0027ve had few skirmishes even at outposts like this one. Until two months ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrosos was posted to Mons Falconis, which is a three day ride from here. He was second-in-command to Solonios, nephew of the Exarch Narses, and I do not need to tell you how Solonios got his position, do I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I say was. Drosos was killed six weeks ago. Mons Falconis got cut off and Solonios would not order an attack or send anyone for reinforcements, for fear of what his illustrious uncle would say. Drosos took it upon himself to remedy that, and with Fabios, Leonidas\u0027 son, rode around the enemy lines. Fabios arrived here, wounded and half-baked with fever and we did what we could for Solonios and his men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrosos wasn\u0027t so lucky. He was thrown when his horse was lanced, and the barbarians caught him. They staked him out, still bleeding, and then rode to the charge over him. There wasn\u0027t enough left to give him proper burial. If he hadn\u0027t disobeyed Solonios, none of the men would have survived, and so he had what he told me last year he no longer deserved: an honorable death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am sorry to have to send you this news, especially since it is my understanding that in your battles with the Huns last year you were badly wounded yourself. The rumor is—and I hope it is not true—that you have been blinded. It is bad enough to have lost Drosos; to know you cannot fight again would be too much for this old soldier to bear. Let me hear from you much sooner than you have heard from me, with news that you are thriving now that you have saved Konstantinoupolis and are once again in some favor with Justinian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it true that Kimon Athanatadies was found guilty of heresy and hanged on a butcher\u0027s hook across from Hagia Sophia? I could not believe it when the story reached here. I hope that it is so, and that he suffered long and hard for all he had done. If it isn\u0027t so, I might well be the one hanging on a hook when I am posted back to Konstantinoupolis at the end of next year, but I doubt if it would bother me as much now as it would have when I left there nine years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope that the next time I write to you, it is with good news, and the invitation to dine with me upon my return. It is an honor I look forward to with joy and gratitude. Until then, my respect and my affection is with you; it is heartening to know you have been vindicated at last. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-90.html","bookId":2509,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:25 PM"}
