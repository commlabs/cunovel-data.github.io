Right now, I wanted answers, and I wasn’t sure how long I’d be able to stay conscious. “How did you find me? How did you make it out of my house?” The bomb! How could I have forgotten about my grandmother? I tried to sit up. “Nana is—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. She’s fine and with my dad, waiting to see you.” He gently pushed me back to the bed. “Ankh had to sew you up. I don’t want you to tear your stitches. And before you ask about the carnage, you’ll be happy to know my dad and your grandmother went through the rubble and managed to salvage some of your things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what?” If I’d lost the photos of my family…if I’d lost the journal…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I haven’t left your side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sweet of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really. I was determined to fight you if you decided to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would have hurt my side to laugh, so I focused on getting the rest of the answers I wanted. “What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At your house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your grandmother had gone to her room. One of the Anima employees tossed in a mini grenade. I dove for cover. When I came to, my dad was there and the suits were gone. We found your grandmother, and she’d been knocked around pretty good, but all of her injuries were treatable. Then, Justin showed up. He told me what was going down, told me where to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Wright had lied about the bomb—big shocker—and Justin had helped us. Why? That made no sense, not fitting what I knew about him and his co-sleezeworkers. “Did everyone make it out okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis attention dropped to his feet. “No. Haun is…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead. Trembling, I gazed around, needing a moment to collect myself. We were in a plush bedroom. A velvet drape hung over the bed. Pastel flowers had been papered on the walls. A crystal chandelier dripped with thousands of sparkling teardrops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll this loss we were forced to bear. All this pain and heartache. And there would be more, so much more, because we would continue to hunt and fight. We had to. We had to protect those we loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise everything we’d already done would have been a waste, and we would see no light in the future—only darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared away the emotion clogging my throat. “Where am I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Ankhs’ house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock sounded, and Mr. Holland peeked inside the room. “We heard voices and hoped you were awake. We’ve got a roomful of people who want to check on you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached up to try and smooth my hair into place, but the tangles I encountered made me cringe. There would be no fixing my appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look beautiful,” Cole said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure I did. But I appreciated the compliment anyway. Although, he still wore that serious expression, so maybe he really believed it. “Send them in,” I said, trying not to sigh dreamily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst came Nana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole got up and moved to the only window, and she rushed to me, hugged me while being careful of my middle and fawned over me, generally making me feel better as she settled into Cole’s chair. There were bruises on her forehead, but no other injuries that I could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext Lucas, Derek, Collins, Cruz, Frosty, and Bronx filed into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looking good,” Frosty said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Ali packs a big punch,” Lucas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll fight with you anytime,” Derek said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you get tired of Cole, give me a try,” Collins said, earning a sharp look from Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not bad. For a beginner,” Bronx said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were the first words he’d ever spoken to me, and they’d been grunted. And yet, I cherished them. Coming from him, that was high praise indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, guys,” I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, the friends you’ve made,” Nana said with a shake of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys exited and Mackenzie and Trina entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate to say this,” Mackenzie said, looking me over, “but you were kind of awesome out there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, she was,” Trina said with a grin. “I noticed she used a few of my patented moves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way. Those were my moves!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey argued as they left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, Kat burst into the room. “About time I got a turn,” she announced, rushing to my side. She grabbed my hand and held on as tightly as if it was a life raft and she was drowning. “As the best friend, I should have been first. Someone will have to be punished for my misery, but don’t worry, it won’t be you, Ali.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beyond excited to see her, but I glanced at Cole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She knows,” he said. “When she couldn’t reach you, she called Frosty and me about a thousand times. She was about to tell the world you’d been abducted when my dad finally gave us permission to read her into the program.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you should have done it a long time ago!” Kat exclaimed. “Like I can’t handle knowledge that there are zombies out there.” She leaned down and, losing her smile, her color, whispered, “I’m not sure I can handle the knowledge that there are zombies out there. When you’re better, we’re talking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Definitely,” I whispered back. Then, louder, “So, you and Frosty are back together now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, we are,” Frosty called from the hallway at the same time Kat said, “After he’s suffered a little more. He’s my whipping boy, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes he know about you? I mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t tell him, then. Although, now that I thought about it, he might already know. I bet Mr. Holland and Mr. Ankh had done a background check on her when Frosty first started dating her. But that, too, was a confession for another day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone knows what I am to you, Kitty Kat,” Frosty said, moving into the doorway and leaning against the frame, his arms crossed over his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doesn’t mean they can’t use more examples. Now go! The girls are talking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am.” Grinning, he walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat and I chatted about everything and nothing, laughing and catching up, until my eyelids began to droop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed my hand, worry falling over her features. “You know, Ali, the first time I saw you in a hospital bed it was no big deal. You had the tiniest little scratch I’d ever seen. I mean, really. I’ve had worse mosquito bites. This time, you’re trapped in bed and looking like…” She waved her hand over me. “This is a big freaking deal. You have two days to get better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI so loved this girl. “Or?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or I end things with Frosty, here and now, forever,” she said loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he called, making it clear he’d remained in the hall to eavesdrop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I might anyway,” she added. “My neighbor has been asking me out every day. And he’s cute. If cute is the new word for ‘outrageously sexy.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA growling Frosty stomped back into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, enough.” Nana shooed everyone but Cole out of the room. “And you,” she said, kissing my forehead, “say good-night to your friend and get some sleep.” She left the room, closing the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what’s next?” I asked through a yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For starters, you and your grandmother are staying with the Ankhs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the mansion? “I can live with that,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just as long as you do, in fact, live,” Cole said, and we shared a smile—before I ruined it with another yawn. He placed a soft kiss on my lips. “Sleep. I’ll be here when you wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and your commands,” I said, my eyes already shutting. But I wouldn’t have him any other way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of him, I’d learned how to survive this new world. More than that, I’d learned how to overcome it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep down I knew fighting zombies was the only thing that would satisfy me now, the only thing that would make me feel as though I’d lived to the fullest. When the end came, I could rest in peace knowing I’d done everything in my power to walk in the light. And I would have Cole at my side. We were in this together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could deal with anything else. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/alice-in-zombieland-white-rabbit-chronicles-1/page-63.html","bookId":2520,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:28:24 PM"}
