Another message only partially delivered. She ain\u0027t going to be satisfied until they\u0027re both dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was the boy now? Where did he live, now that his home had been sold? She remembered the only time she\u0027d ever given him a hug—in fourth grade, after chasing that car, how she\u0027d hugged him and reassured him and told him to forget the shithead bigots in this world. He was better than them. The same words her father had told her, when she was small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe traced her fingers along the Los Lobos CD, thinking of burning raisin bread in a Wedgwood oven, bougainvillea petals falling in the backyard as Carnaval music surged over the rooftops from Mission Street, Mallory jumping up to touch the arc of morning glories that had grown even taller than her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed her car keys and put on her coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn San Angelo Street, she found a parking spot a block up from the old middle school, deserted now for Christmas break. The air was cool and damp, the sidewalk slick with fog, but it was nothing like the hard freeze of nine years before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had just slipped the key into the lock of the townhouse when a man\u0027s voice called, “Hey!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood in the middle of the street—a withered old Latino with a bent back and microscope lenses for glasses. He was wheeling groceries behind him in a little red wagon. Norma vaguely recognized him—a neighbor from ten years before, though she couldn\u0027t remember which floor of which building he rented. He\u0027d complained about Katherine\u0027s music once, back in another lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You still own that place?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was tempted to say no, but having just put the key in the lock, she said instead, “Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, what did you drop in there—dog shit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saturday night! Dog shit!” the man repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma was too mystified to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe persisted. “Look, were you here on Saturday night or not? I could smell sewage right through the walls for two days. Ain\u0027t so bad now, but damn. Happens again I\u0027m gonna call the cops, get them down here with some Lysol.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man kept going, grumbling as he wheeled his wagon of groceries along the middle of the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaturday night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been here that afternoon, as had Chadwick, but they\u0027d both left before dark. She wondered if the man\u0027s bad eyesight might have caused him some confusion about the time, or the woman he\u0027d seen, or maybe even which building smelled bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransients might have found their way into the house. That had happened before. Each time they\u0027d been pretty indiscriminate about where they\u0027d gone to the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma tried the door without turning the key. It was unlocked. She stomped loudly up the stairs, into the empty living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bad smell, all right—but worse than dog shit. A dead rat. Rotten garbage. Something sweet masking it—almost like perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered one time, the Mexican restaurant across the fence had dumped their garbage in the alley for two months to avoid paying for pickup. By the time the police came, the smell in the neighborhood had been something like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went in the kitchen and opened the window, but nothing wafted in except taquería smoke—cabrito and flank steak grilled with cilantro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peeked in the kitchen closet. Nothing but a decade-old roach trap. The oven was empty. The master bedroom and closet—nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked into Katherine\u0027s room and a point of fear pressed like an ice cube between her shoulder blades. The only piece of furniture, Chadwick\u0027s old wooden chair, had been busted into kindling. The portable stereo was smashed, too—D batteries scattered across the floor, a cracked Brahms CD glinting in a square of sunlight near the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVandals. But why wouldn\u0027t they have taken the CD player?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma swallowed back her desire to run. This was her house. There was no one here except her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell wasn\u0027t coming from Katherine\u0027s room. She forced herself to move—back to the living room again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smell was strongest here. It seemed to be coming from the fireplace, but there was nothing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared around the empty room, remembering where the television had been, Chadwick\u0027s black leather chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick\u0027s father had sat in that chair during the last years of his life, watching out the window. He had shrunk to a frail, senseless old man, much smaller than his son, hardly moving except when his clocks went off on the mantel, every hour, driving Norma crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma ran her eyes over the wainscoting, then moved her fingers along the wall until she found the crack. Hide-and-seek. Katherine\u0027s favorite hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma pressed the corner of the closet. The old door sprang open, and with it, the smell—excrement and cologne, rotten meat and baby powder and sour fear. Her eyes didn\u0027t understand what they were seeing at first—folds of crinkled plastic expanding, as if breathing, blue fabric and dark brown smears on pale skin, a crust of stubble and saliva on a cheek, a straight part in graying brown hair. She backed away and the thing twisted, tumbling out of its shower curtain as if to follow her—inanimate flesh that used to be a human face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma stumbled backwards, fell, kicked at a dead hand. She was in Katherine\u0027s bedroom, then, pressing against the window, trying to claw it open, trying to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut part of her refused to go into shock—the part that was inured to death, that dreamed of death all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop, she said. Stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned, stepped back into the living room and stared at the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must\u0027ve been there for several days, encased in plastic and doused in its own cologne, rotting, stiffening, in a place no one would ever look, in a house no one ever visited—no one except her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Saturday, the day Chadwick was in town, the day Ann\u0027s embezzlement problem had been made public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Chadwick would never do this. To kill in cold blood, to wrap the body and take it elsewhere. This house, of all places. That was the work of a monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, Norma believed in monsters. She had believed in them for nine years, had gotten close enough to see hers in the bathroom mirror, gripping a handful of blue and yellow pills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn was dead. There was no longer room for doubt. No room for Ann\u0027s fucking optimism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorma heard Ann\u0027s voice in her head, pleading for more time. Don\u0027t call the police, not yet. But Norma had had enough of that. She wouldn\u0027t let anyone soften her. Never again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez\u0027s feet were bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had walked for maybe an hour, but had only just hit the road, if you could call it a road—a two-rut path, sprouting weeds in the middle like a hairy spine. The gravel and mud were no kinder on his feet than the fields had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to concentrate on the morning, which was really very fine—cold, but sunny. It made Pérez think of a winter day in Monterrey, back at his family\u0027s ranch. This place was greener, but otherwise much like home. Better than the fog of Mill Valley, that damn hilltop house of Mr. Z\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez stumbled along, cursing his luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should\u0027ve taken the clean shot at Chadwick when he had the chance, last night in the woods, but something had failed him—some unwanted twinge of conscience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt bothered him that Chadwick had read him so well. Pérez wished he were the type who could track down a man who\u0027d just released him—put a bullet in his head. But he couldn\u0027t do that. He couldn\u0027t even muster anger at Mallory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe consoled himself with the thought of a payoff. Now that he understood the truth, the knowledge would be worth something. He could turn the tables. He could become Samuel. The idea made him smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was God\u0027s will he had spared Chadwick\u0027s life. In return, Chadwick—the deluded bastard—had unwittingly given him knowledge, a way to make money. Chadwick was in enough danger—he didn\u0027t need Pérez\u0027s help to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez would kill no more. He would demand his cut of the millions, and he would get it. He would return to Monterrey a hero, live out the rest of his days on the ranch, free of debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wife, Rosa, would take him back. He would be with his children again, two boys he had not seen since they were babies. They would be scared of him at first, maybe even angry, but eventually they would understand why he had left for so long, to provide for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would spend the rest of his life making amends. He was still young. He would enjoy many winter mornings like this, in his own fields, teaching his children to ride and to shoot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so focused on the horizon, wondering where the muddy path would lead him, that he did not hear the vehicle behind him until it was almost on top of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a new blue minivan—out of place on the country road. When Pérez saw the driver, he frowned. He had not counted on this—but he could handle it. Cool and dumb. He had not yet played his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van stopped. The driver\u0027s window purred down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell you want?” Pérez demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were not easy to find.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez spat into the dust. “You got something to tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027ve walked far enough. You want a ride?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez thought about that, knowing he should refuse, but that would look bad. And his feet hurt. There was no danger here—just some bullshitting, some posturing, a test he knew he could pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, stepped around the front, and the van started moving forward, bumped gently into his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez glared through the windshield. He stepped back, not amused by the joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe van lurched forward again, and again bumped Pérez\u0027s legs. But Pérez didn\u0027t move out of the way. It was not in his nature to back down. He tapped his chest with his fingers. “What the fuck?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he read the situation—a heartbeat too late—just as the driver punched the gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez clawed at metal, felt himself being spun around like a child in a blindfold game, and then he was looking at the cold blue sky, his arm held up by a barbed wire fence, several barbs sticking in the skin of his forearm. His legs were numb. He couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the van\u0027s door open and close. He imagined the porch of his ranch in Monterrey. He imagined that the steps coming toward him were his wife\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver stood over him—an outline rimmed in the sunset. A voice from high above said, “I could\u0027ve been gone by now, Emilio. But I wanted to see you kill Chadwick. You disappointed me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez imagined the sounds of the children he had not seen in so long. He saw the sunlight catching the edges of Rosa\u0027s cotton dress, triangles of red fluttering around her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now you\u0027ve figured it,” the voice told him. “You and the girl both. I can tell in your eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez tried to speak, tried to tell Rosa he loved her, but no sound came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me help you out here, Emilio,” the voice told him. “Let me give you a lift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePérez heard thunder. As his eyes went dark, he felt a small warm spot on his forehead, as if someone—perhaps a child—had planted a kiss there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have two choices,” Hunter said. “Your teammates left an hour ago. You can still log your solo trip, make the pickup area by noon tomorrow. Or you can sit it out, restart Black Level with the group below you. Do you understand?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-47.html","bookId":2423,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:06 PM"}
