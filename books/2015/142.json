And when you shouted, I knew that in my heart, I didn’t want to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that means that the magic was not summoning you to the dance, but only inviting you. And so you could say no. But Likari was summoned. He went because he had to, and so he wanted to go, because once the dance had touched him, he could think of nothing else. Don’t you think that others have tried to keep those they loved from the dance? They have run after them, and carried them back and tied them. It did no good. Still they danced, and they heard nothing from their lovers or their children, and they saw nothing and they would not eat and they would not sleep until they were released to go to the dance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears had started fresh down her cheeks before she was halfway through her speech. They continued to run as she spoke, and her voice hoarsened. On her last words, her throat choked her to stillness. She stood, silent and empty. Even the tears slowed and then ceased, as if nothing were left inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will go to Kinrove and tell him he must release Likari to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you might feel that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoldier’s Boy knew who was there before he turned. He had felt the unpleasant tingle of iron against my senses. I knew an iron bearer must be somewhere close, perhaps just outside Lisana’s lodge. Dasie stood in the doorway, a dour look on her face. Yet just for an instant, I thought I glimpsed a gleam of satisfaction in her eyes. Rage rose in Soldier’s Boy, and again he forced it down. He tried for a reasonable tone. “I did not expect that Kinrove would call my feeders with his summoning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrows. “I, too, am surprised at that. But perhaps we should not be. You have not given him many reasons to love you. Perhaps he considered it a sort of justice, to take from you what you had not expected to lose in this gamble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gamble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our war against the intruders.” She came into the lodge and advanced to my chair by the hearth. With a grunt of satisfaction, she ensconced herself, uninvited. Her feeders remained standing at the door. Outside, her iron bearer waited. Had she expected Soldier’s Boy to be angry enough that she needed a guard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want the boy back.” Soldier’s Boy spoke bluntly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDasie laughed. It wasn’t a cruel laugh; rather, it was the laugh of someone who sees a child finally realize the consequences of his own foolishness. “Don’t you think we all wanted those we loved back? Well, at least you have the power to get him back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean, if I go to Kinrove, he’ll give him up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I very much doubt that.” She motioned irritably at my feeders, and, with the exception of Olikea, it was as if they wakened from a spell. They sprang into motion, adding wood to the fire and beginning the preparation of food. She settled more comfortably in my chair. “As I said, you’ve given him no reason to love you. Perhaps taking something you cared about from you brought him a special satisfaction. I think perhaps you know that he has no children. Seeing you enjoy that young boy as if he were your own—well. Perhaps he thought you deserved to feel the same lack that he does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You knew he would call Likari.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked her head at me. “I suspected he would try. I had no idea if the boy would be vulnerable or not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You chose not to warn me.” Soldier’s Boy stated it flatly and waited for her response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is correct.” My feeders brought her a platter of food. She looked it over consideringly and picked up a slice of smoked fish. A similar platter was conveyed to me. Soldier’s Boy ignored it, awaiting her response. It finally came, after she had licked her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought perhaps you should have a higher stake in stopping the dance. And in driving the intruders from our territory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t trust me,” Soldier’s Boy said bluntly. “Likari is a hostage. If I don’t do as you say, you’ll see that he dies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ate another slice of the fish with evident relish. “Now there’s a Jhernian concept. A hostage. Yes, you could see it that way. But it isn’t that you must do what I say. Only that you must succeed in doing what you said you’d do. What you have always been meant to do. If you succeed in driving the intruders away, Kinrove’s dance will no longer be needed. The boy will come back to you. But if you do not—” She picked at the fish, and then took a handful of nuts instead. She seemed to feel no need to finish her sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a hard morning. Soldier’s Boy was hungry and the food at my elbow smelled wonderful. He hated that he could even think of eating at a moment like this, and yet my body clamored at him relentlessly. He refused to look at the platter but could not stop smelling the tempting aromas. The magic nagged to be fed. Soldier’s Boy saw Dasie’s gaze move from my face to the platter and back again. She knew. She knew how he resisted the food and it amused her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/renegade-s-magic-the-soldier-son-trilogy-3/page-142.html","bookId":2015,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:26 PM"}
