THE RABBLE.","content":"Life is a well of delight; but where the rabble also drink, there all fountains are poisoned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To everything cleanly am I well disposed; but I hate to see the grinning mouths and the thirst of the unclean.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They cast their eye down into the fountain: and now glanceth up to me their odious smile out of the fountain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness; and when they called their filthy dreams delight, then poisoned they also the words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Indignant becometh the flame when they put their damp hearts to the fire; the spirit itself bubbleth and smoketh when the rabble approach the fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mawkish and over-mellow becometh the fruit in their hands: unsteady, and withered at the top, doth their look make the fruit-tree.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And many a one who hath turned away from life, hath only turned away from the rabble: he hated to share with them fountain, flame, and fruit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And many a one who hath gone into the wilderness and suffered thirst with beasts of prey, disliked only to sit at the cistern with filthy camel-drivers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And many a one who hath come along as a destroyer, and as a hailstorm to all cornfields, wanted merely to put his foot into the jaws of the rabble, and thus stop their throat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And it is not the mouthful which hath most choked me, to know that life itself requireth enmity and death and torture-crosses:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But I asked once, and suffocated almost with my question: What? is the rabble also NECESSARY for life?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Are poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and filthy dreams, and maggots in the bread of life?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not my hatred, but my loathing, gnawed hungrily at my life! Ah, ofttimes became I weary of spirit, when I found even the rabble spiritual!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And on the rulers turned I my back, when I saw what they now call ruling: to traffic and bargain for power—with the rabble!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Amongst peoples of a strange language did I dwell, with stopped ears: so that the language of their trafficking might remain strange unto me, and their bargaining for power.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And holding my nose, I went morosely through all yesterdays and to-days: verily, badly smell all yesterdays and to-days of the scribbling rabble!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Like a cripple become deaf, and blind, and dumb—thus have I lived long; that I might not live with the power-rabble, the scribe-rabble, and the pleasure-rabble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Toilsomely did my spirit mount stairs, and cautiously; alms of delight were its refreshment; on the staff did life creep along with the blind one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What hath happened unto me? How have I freed myself from loathing? Who hath rejuvenated mine eye? How have I flown to the height where no rabble any longer sit at the wells?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did my loathing itself create for me wings and fountain-divining powers? Verily, to the loftiest height had I to fly, to find again the well of delight!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, I have found it, my brethren! Here on the loftiest height bubbleth up for me the well of delight! And there is a life at whose waters none of the rabble drink with me!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Almost too violently dost thou flow for me, thou fountain of delight! And often emptiest thou the goblet again, in wanting to fill it!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And yet must I learn to approach thee more modestly: far too violently doth my heart still flow towards thee:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My heart on which my summer burneth, my short, hot, melancholy, over-happy summer: how my summer heart longeth for thy coolness!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Past, the lingering distress of my spring! Past, the wickedness of my snowflakes in June! Summer have I become entirely, and summer-noontide!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A summer on the loftiest height, with cold fountains and blissful stillness: oh, come, my friends, that the stillness may become more blissful!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For this is OUR height and our home: too high and steep do we here dwell for all uncleanly ones and their thirst.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cast but your pure eyes into the well of my delight, my friends! How could it become turbid thereby! It shall laugh back to you with ITS purity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the tree of the future build we our nest; eagles shall bring us lone ones food in their beaks!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, no food of which the impure could be fellow-partakers! Fire, would they think they devoured, and burn their mouths!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, no abodes do we here keep ready for the impure! An ice-cave to their bodies would our happiness be, and to their spirits!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And as strong winds will we live above them, neighbours to the eagles, neighbours to the snow, neighbours to the sun: thus live the strong winds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And like a wind will I one day blow amongst them, and with my spirit, take the breath from their spirit: thus willeth my future.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, a strong wind is Zarathustra to all low places; and this counsel counselleth he to his enemies, and to whatever spitteth and speweth: “Take care not to spit AGAINST the wind!”—\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61043.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
