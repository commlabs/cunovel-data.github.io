At least, not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s your job to say no,\" she says, as if it\u0027s that easy. Sierra isn\u0027t a virgin anymore, she\u0027d said yes. Why is it so hard for me to say yes, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will I know when it\u0027s the right time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure as hell won\u0027t be asking me about it. I guess when you\u0027re totally ready you\u0027ll want to do it with no reservations or questions. We know they want to have sex. It\u0027s up to you to make it happen. Or not. Listen, the first time wasn\u0027t fun or easy. It was kind of sloppy and most of the time I felt stupid. Opening yourself up to making mistakes and being vulnerable is what makes it beautiful and special with the person you love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that why I haven\u0027t wanted to do it with Colin? Maybe deep down I don\u0027t love him as much as I thought. Am I even capable of loving someone so much that I open myself up to being vulnerable? I really don\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tyler broke up with Darlene today,\" Sierra whispers to me. \"He started dating a girl in his dorm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I didn\u0027t feel sorry for Darlene before, now I do. Especially because she thrives on attention from guys. It fuels her self-esteem. It\u0027s no wonder she was totally all over Shane tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as the rest of the guys and Darlene come into view and set blankets down on the beach. Darlene grabs Shane\u0027s shirt and pulls him aside. \"Let\u0027s go make out,\" she tells him. Shane is all too ready to honor her request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling her away from him, I lean close and say so only she can hear, \"Don\u0027t fool around with Shane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you don\u0027t like him like that. Don\u0027t use him. Or let him use you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarlene pushes me away. \"You seriously have a demented view of reality, Brit. Or maybe you want to point out everyone else\u0027s imperfections so you stay the Queen of Perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s not fair. I don\u0027t want to point out her flaws, but if I see her going on a self-destructive path, isn\u0027t it up to me as her friend to stop her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe not. We\u0027re friends, but not super-close friends. The only one I let close enough is Sierra. How dare I give Darlene advice when she can\u0027t reciprocate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSierra, Doug, Colin, and I sit on blankets and talk about the last football game in front of a bonfire we make with sticks and old pieces of wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe laugh, remembering the missed plays and imitating the football coach who yelled at the players from the sidelines. His face gets all red and when he\u0027s really upset spit flies out of his mouth as he yells. Players get out of the way so they don\u0027t get sprayed. Doug does a hilarious imitation of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels good sitting here with my friends and Colin, and for a while I forget about my chemistry partner, who\u0027s been occupying my thoughts lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, Sierra and Doug go for a walk and I\u0027m leaning against Colin in front of the fire, the light giving the sand around us a bright glow. Darlene and Shane have hooked up for the night despite my advice against it and aren\u0027t back yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab the bottle of Chardonnay the guys brought. The boys have been drinking beer and the girls have been drinking wine because Sierra hates the taste of beer. I bring the bottle to my lips and finish it off. I\u0027m feeling buzzed, but I probably need to drink an entire bottle myself in order to feel completely carefree.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you miss me this summer?\" I ask, leaning into Colin as he smoothes down my hair. It\u0027s probably a mess. I wish I was drunk enough not to care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin takes my hand in his and leads it to his crotch. He lets out a slow, moaning breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he says into my neck. \"Lots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I take my hand back, his arms snake around to my front. He squeezes my boobs like they\u0027re water balloons. I\u0027ve never minded Colin\u0027s touch before, but now I\u0027m annoyed and creeped out by his roving hands. I shrug out of his grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong, Brit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" I really don\u0027t know. Things with Colin seem strained since school started. And thoughts of Alex keep invading my head, which is annoying me more than anything. I reach over and grab a beer. \"It feels forced,\" I tell my boyfriend as I open the can and take a sip. \"Can\u0027t we sit here without fooling around?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin lets out a long, dramatic deep breath. \"Brit, I want to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try and down the entire can in one gulp, but end up spewing out some of it. \"You mean now?\" Where our friends can see us if they turn around?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? We\u0027ve waited long enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Colin,\" I say, really scared to be having this conversation although I knew it was coming. \"I guess ... I guess I thought it would happen naturally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can be more natural than doing it outside, in the sand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about condoms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pull out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat doesn\u0027t sound romantic at all. I\u0027ll be freaking out the entire time and worrying about getting pregnant. Not how I want my first time to be. \"Making love means a lot to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To me, too. So let\u0027s do it already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like this summer changed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it did,\" he says defensively. \"Maybe I realized our relationship has to be more. Geez, Brit. Whoever heard of a senior being a fucking virgin? Everyone thinks we\u0027ve done it, why don\u0027t we just do it? Shit, you even let that guy Fuentes think he can get into your pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart slams into my chest. \"You think I\u0027d rather sleep with Alex than you?\" I ask, my eyes getting watery. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the alcohol making me emotional or if it\u0027s because his words hit the target. My thoughts are on my chem partner. I hate myself for having these thoughts, and hate Colin right now for pointing it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Darlene?\" I throw back. I look around, making sure Darlene is out of hearing range. \"You two are like one cozy couple in chemistry class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off it, Brit. So some girl pays attention to me in chemistry. Obviously you don\u0027t because you\u0027re too busy arguing with Fuentes. Everyone knows it\u0027s all foreplay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not fair, Colin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Sierra says, walking up with Doug from behind a large boulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I tell her. I stand up, my sandals in hand. \"I\u0027m going home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSierra grabs her purse. \"I\u0027ll go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" I\u0027m finally feeling light-headed. It\u0027s like I\u0027m having an out-of-body experience and I want to go through it it all by myself. \"I don\u0027t want or need anyone. I\u0027ll walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s drunk,\" Doug says, eyeing the empty bottle and beer can beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am not,\" I tell them. I snatch another beer and open it as I walk down the beach. Alone. By myself. Which is how it should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSierra says, \"I don\u0027t want you going alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to be by myself right now. I need to sort things out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brit, come back here,\" Colin says, but doesn\u0027t get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go past the fourth pier,\" Sierra warns. \"It\u0027s not safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafe shmafe. So what if something happens to me, anyway? Colin doesn\u0027t care. Or my parents, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes as the sand sinks between my toes, I breathe in the scent of the fresh, cool Lake Michigan breeze washing over my face and drink more beer. Forgetting everything except the sand and my beer, I continue walking, pausing only to look out over the dark water with moonlight shining across it like a line splitting the water in two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve passed two piers. Or maybe three. Anyway, it\u0027s not a long walk home. Less than a mile. When I get to the next beach entrance, I\u0027ll walk up the street and head home. It\u0027s not like I haven\u0027t done it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sand feels so good beneath my feet, like one of those squishy bean bag pillows you sink into. And I hear music up ahead. I love music. Closing my eyes, my body moves to the unfamiliar song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven\u0027t realized how far I\u0027ve walked and danced until the sound of laughing and voices in Spanish make me freeze. People wearing red and black bandannas in front of me are a clue I\u0027ve gone past the fourth pier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look everybody, it\u0027s Brittany Ellis, Fairfield High\u0027s sexiest pompom girl,\" a guy says. \"Come here, mamacita. Dance with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan the crowd desperately for a familiar or friendly face. Alex, lie\u0027s here. Sitting in his lap facing him is Carmen Sanchez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sobering picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother guy advances on me. \"Don\u0027t you know this side of the beach is for Mexicanos only?\" he says, moving closer. \"Or maybe you\u0027ve come sniffin\u0027 for some dark meat. You know what they say, baby--dark meat\u0027s the juiciest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave me alone.\" My words are slurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you\u0027re too good for me?\" He moves toward me, his eyes full of anger. The music stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stagger backward. I\u0027m not too drunk to know I\u0027m in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Javier, lay off.\" Alex\u0027s voice is low--it\u0027s an order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex is caressing Carmen\u0027s shoulder, his lips mere inches from it. I sway. This is a nightmare and I need to get away, fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start running, the gang members\u0027 laughter ringing in my ears. I can\u0027t run fast enough and feel like I\u0027m in a dream where my feet are moving but I\u0027m not going anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brittany, wait!\" a voice calls from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around and am face-to-face with the guy who\u0027s haunting my dreams . . . daydreams and night dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy who I hate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy who I can\u0027t get out of my mind, no matter how drunk I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ignore Javier,\" Alex says. \"Sometimes he gets carried away tryin\u0027 to be a badass.\" I\u0027m stunned when he steps closer and wipes away a tear from my cheek. \"Don\u0027t cry. I wouldn\u0027t let him hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I tell him I\u0027m not afraid of being hurt? I\u0027m afraid of not being in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough I haven\u0027t run far, it\u0027s far enough from Alex\u0027s friends. They can\u0027t see me or hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you like Carmen?\" I ask as the world tilts and I stumble in the sand. \"She\u0027s mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holds out his hands to help me but I flinch, so he stuffs his hands in his pockets. \"What the fuck do you care, anyway? You stood me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had stuff going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like washin\u0027 your hair or gettin\u0027 a manicure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr having my hair ripped out by my sister and getting reamed out by my mom? I jab my finger into his chest. \"You\u0027re an asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re a bitch,\" he says. \"A bitch with a kick-ass smile and eyes that can seriously screw with a guy\u0027s head.\" He winces, as if the words slipped out and he wants to take them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was expecting him to say a lot of things, but not that. Especially not that. I notice his bloodshot eyes. \"You\u0027re high, Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well you don\u0027t look too sober yourself. Maybe now\u0027s a good time to give me that kiss you owe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Por que no? Afraid you\u0027ll like it so much you\u0027ll forget your boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiss Alex? Never. Although I\u0027ve been thinking about it. A lot. More than I should. His lips are full and inviting. Oh, boy, he\u0027s right. I am drunk. And I\u0027m definitely not feeling right. I\u0027m past numbness and going on delirium, because I\u0027m thinking things I have no business thinking. Like how I want to know what his lips feel like against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Kiss me, Alex,\" I say, stepping forward and leaning into him. \"Then we\u0027ll be even.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-15.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
