{"id":31807,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"\u003cp\u003eTHERE comes a time in every rightlyconstructed boy\u0027s life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper, but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital, for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money. \"Where\u0027ll we dig?\" said Huck.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, most anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, is it hid all around?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No, indeed it ain\u0027t. It\u0027s hid in mighty particular places, Huck -- sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha\u0027nted houses.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Who hides it?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, robbers, of course -- who\u0027d you reckon? Sunday-school sup\u0027rintendents?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. If \u0027twas mine I wouldn\u0027t hide it; I\u0027d spend it and have a good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"So would I. But robbers don\u0027t do that way. They always hide it and leave it there.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t they come after it any more?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks -- a paper that\u0027s got to be ciphered over about a week because it\u0027s mostly signs and hy\u0027roglyphics.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"HyroQwhich?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hy\u0027roglyphics -- pictures and things, you know, that don\u0027t seem to mean anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you got one of them papers, Tom?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, how you going to find the marks?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha\u0027nted house or on an island, or under a dead tree that\u0027s got one limb sticking out. Well, we\u0027ve tried Jackson\u0027s Island a little, and we can try it again some time; and there\u0027s the old ha\u0027nted house up the Still-House branch, and there\u0027s lots of deadlimb trees -- dead loads of \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it under all of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How you talk! No!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how you going to know which one to go for?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Go for all of \u0027em!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Tom, it\u0027ll take all summer.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di\u0027monds. How\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHuck\u0027s eyes glowed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred dollars and I don\u0027t want no di\u0027monds.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. But I bet you I ain\u0027t going to throw off on di\u0027monds. Some of \u0027em\u0027s worth twenty dollars apiece -- there ain\u0027t any, hardly, but\u0027s worth six bits or a dollar.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Is that so?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Cert\u0027nly -- anybody\u0027ll tell you so. Hain\u0027t you ever seen one, Huck?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, kings have slathers of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027 know no kings, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I reckon you don\u0027t. But if you was to go to Europe you\u0027d see a raft of \u0027em hopping around.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they hop?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Hop? -- your granny! No!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what did you say they did, for?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Shucks, I only meant you\u0027d see \u0027em -- not hopping, of course -- what do they want to hop for? -- but I mean you\u0027d just see \u0027em -- scattered around, you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Richard? What\u0027s his other name?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t have any other name. Kings don\u0027t have any but a given name.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But they don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don\u0027t want to be a king and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say â€“ where you going to dig first?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know. S\u0027pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill t\u0027other side of Still-House branch?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I like this,\" said Tom.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your share?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I\u0027ll go to every circus that comes along. I bet I\u0027ll have a gay time.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, ain\u0027t you going to save any of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Save it? What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that ain\u0027t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws on it if I didn\u0027t hurry up, and I tell you he\u0027d clean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to buy a new drum, and a sure-\u0027nough sword, and a red necktie and a bull pup, and get married.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Married!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom, you -- why, you ain\u0027t in your right mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait -- you\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty well.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That ain\u0027t anything. The girl I\u0027m going to marry won\u0027t fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom, I reckon they\u0027re all alike. They\u0027ll all comb a body. Now you better think \u0027bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What\u0027s the name of the gal?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It ain\u0027t a gal at all -- it\u0027s a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl -- both\u0027s right, like enough. Anyway, what\u0027s her name, Tom?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you some time -- not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All right -- that\u0027ll do. Only if you get married I\u0027ll be more lonesomer than ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No you won\u0027t. You\u0027ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and we\u0027ll go to digging.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another half-hour. Still no result. Huck said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they always bury it as deep as this?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes -- not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven\u0027t got the right place.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little, but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time. Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve, and said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I reckon maybe we\u0027ll tackle the old tree that\u0027s over yonder on Cardiff Hill back of the widow\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I reckon that\u0027ll be a good one. But won\u0027t the widow take it away from us, Tom? It\u0027s on her land.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"She take it away! Maybe she\u0027d like to try it once. Whoever finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don\u0027t make any difference whose land it\u0027s on.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It is mighty curious, Huck. I don\u0027t understand it. Sometimes witches interfere. I reckon maybe that\u0027s what\u0027s the trouble now.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Shucks! Witches ain\u0027t got no power in the daytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s so. I didn\u0027t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that\u0027s where you dig!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Then consound it, we\u0027ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It\u0027s an awful long way. Can you get out?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet I will. We\u0027ve got to do it to-night, too, because if somebody sees these holes they\u0027ll know in a minute what\u0027s here and they\u0027ll go for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ll come around and maow to-night.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Let\u0027s hide the tools in the bushes.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At last Tom said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It ain\u0027t any use, Huck, we\u0027re wrong again.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, but we can\u0027t be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it, but then there\u0027s another thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\".\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too early.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHuck dropped his shovel.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" said he. \"That\u0027s the very trouble. We got to give this one up. We can\u0027t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing\u0027s too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something\u0027s behind me all the time; and I\u0027m afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there\u0027s others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Lordy!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they do. I\u0027ve always heard that.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom, I don\u0027t like to fool around much where there\u0027s dead people. A body\u0027s bound to get into trouble with \u0027em, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to stir \u0027em up, either. S\u0027pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t Tom! It\u0027s awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it just is. Huck, I don\u0027t feel comfortable a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Say, Tom, let\u0027s give this place up, and try somewheres else.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, I reckon we better.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027ll it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTom considered awhile; and then said:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The ha\u0027nted house. That\u0027s it!\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Blame it, I don\u0027t like ha\u0027nted houses, Tom. Why, they\u0027re a dern sight worse\u0027n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don\u0027t come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain\u0027t noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I couldn\u0027t stand such a thing as that, Tom -- nobody could.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don\u0027t travel around only at night. They won\u0027t hender us from digging there in the daytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s so. But you know mighty well people don\u0027t go about that ha\u0027nted house in the day nor the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s mostly because they don\u0027t like to go where a man\u0027s been murdered, anyway -- but nothing\u0027s ever been seen around that house except in the night -- just some blue lights slipping by the windows -- no regular ghosts.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there\u0027s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz you know that they don\u0027t anybody but ghosts use \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s so. But anyway they don\u0027t come around in the daytime, so what\u0027s the use of our being afeard?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, all right. We\u0027ll tackle the ha\u0027nted house if you say so -- but I reckon it\u0027s taking chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/51/3277.html","bookId":586,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:39:50 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:39:50 AM"}
