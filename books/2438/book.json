Darren is beginning to cope with life as a vampire\u0027s assistant though he still refuses to drink human blood and hates his companion, Mr. Crepsley, for turning him into a half vampire which has led him to faking his own death. Although he is far stronger than any human, and a shotput world champion, as he discovers, he is still finding it hard to adjust to his new life. His unchallenged strength causes him to be alone, as he can not make any human friends without breaking their hands. Larten teaches Darren all about vampirism and sometimes is shown regreting for blooding Darren and decides to take him to the Cirque du Freak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2.jpg","author":"Darren Shan","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:43 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:49 PM"}
