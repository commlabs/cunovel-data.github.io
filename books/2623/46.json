Every last one of them. They were the Dark\u0027s rejects and the failures, the dunces who had no prospects because they had too many shortcomings. It wasn\u0027t simply that the Dark Ones didn\u0027t feel sorry for them – they were a hindrance, they got in the way. The Day Watch was nothing like the almshouse that we sometimes resembled. The Day Watch got rid of anyone who was surplus to requirements. In fact, it usually got us to do the job, handing them a trump card, the right to respond, to redress the balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Twilight figure that had directed me to the Ostankino Tower was another product of the Dark. An insurance policy, in case I couldn\u0027t guess where I ought to go to fight my battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the real action was being co-ordinated by just one Other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabulon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t feel the least resentment against me. Of course not. What use would such complex and petty feelings be in a serious game like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d eaten dozens like me for breakfast, removing them from the board, sacrificing his own pawns to pay for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen would he decide that the game was played out and it was time for the endgame?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you have a light?\u0027 I asked, putting down my beer mug and picking up a pack of cigarettes lying on the counter. Someone had forgotten them, maybe one of the restaurant\u0027s customers, fleeing in a state of panic, maybe one of the Dark Ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiger Cub\u0027s eyes lit up and she tensed her muscles. I realised the sorceress could start her battle transformation at any moment. She must have assessed the enemy\u0027s strength too. She knew we had a serious chance of success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old third-grade Dark Magician casually held out his Ronson lighter. It gave a tuneful little click and shot out a tongue of flame, and he carried on talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s only one reason why you constantly accuse the Dark of playing a double game and organising deliberate provocations – in order to disguise the fact that you\u0027re not fit to survive. Your failure to understand the world and its laws. When you get right down to it, your failure to understand ordinary people! Once it\u0027s accepted that the diagnosis made by the Dark Side is far more accurate, then what becomes of your morality? Of your whole philosophy of life? Eh?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lit up, nodded politely and headed for the exit. Tiger Cub watched me go with a puzzled look. Well, you just figure out for yourself why I\u0027m leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d found out all I could round here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr rather – almost all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned down towards the short haircut of the young guy in glasses who had his nose stuck in his notebook and asked briskly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What districts are we closing off last?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Botanical Gardens and the Economic Exhibition,\u0027 he answered, without even looking up. The cursor carried on sliding across the screen. The Dark One was issuing instructions, relishing his power as he moved red dots across the map of Moscow. It would have been harder to prise him away from the exercise than to drag him away from his girlfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey know how to love too, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thanks,\u0027 I said, dropping my burning cigarette into the full ashtray. \u0027That\u0027s very helpful.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No worries,\u0027 the terminal operator said casually, without looking round. He poked the tip of his tongue out of his mouth and stuck another dot on the map: one more rank-and-file Dark One moving into the round-up. What are you so delighted about, you stupid idiot? The ones with real power will never appear on your map. You\u0027d be better off playing with toy soldiers if power\u0027s the way you get your kicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid across to the spiral staircase. All the fury I\u0027d felt on my way here – the determination to kill or, more likely, be killed – had disappeared. I\u0027m sure at some point during a battle a soldier enters a state of icy calm. The same way a surgeon\u0027s hands stop trembling when the patient starts dying on the operating table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat possible variants have you provided for, Zabulon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I start thrashing about in the nets closing in around me, and the commotion attracts both Light Ones and Dark Ones, all of them – and especially Svetlana?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that one\u0027s out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I give myself up or get caught and then the long, slow, exhausting trial starts, concluding in a frenzied outburst by Svetlana at the tribunal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that one\u0027s out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat I start a fight with your field headquarters operatives and kill them all, but end up trapped a third of a kilometre above the ground, and Svetlana comes racing to the tower?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that one\u0027s out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr I take a stroll round the field headquarters and figure out that no one there knows anything about the Maverick, and try to play for time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s a possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ring was getting tighter, I knew that. It had been closed off first round the outskirts of the city, along the Moscow Ring Road, then the city had been carved up into districts and the major transport routes had been closed off. It still wasn\u0027t too late to take a quick look around nearby districts that weren\u0027t under surveillance yet, find a hiding place and try to lie low. The only advice the boss had been able to give me was to hold out for as long as possible, while the Night Watch was racing about, trying to find the Maverick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s no accident that you\u0027re squeezing me into the district where we had our little scuffle last winter, is it, Zabulon? I can\u0027t help remembering it, so one way or another the way I act is bound to be affected by my memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe observation platform was completely empty now. The final visitors had fled, and there were no staff – only the man I\u0027d recruited, standing by the stairs, clutching his pistol in his hand and staring downwards with his eyes blazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Now we\u0027ll change clothes again,\u0027 I told him. \u0027The Light thanks you. Afterwards you\u0027ll forget everything we\u0027ve talked about. You\u0027ll go home. All you\u0027ll remember is that it was an ordinary day, like yesterday. Nothing much happened.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nothing much happened!\u0027 the security man blurted out cheerfully as he took my clothes off. It\u0027s so easy to turn humans to the Light or the Dark, but they\u0027re happiest of all when they\u0027re allowed to be themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eONCE I WAS out of the tower I stopped, stuck my hands in my pockets and stood there for a while, looking at the beams of the searchlights lancing up into the sky and the brightly lit security checkpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were just two things I didn\u0027t understand in the game being played out by the two Watches, or rather, by their leaders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Other who had departed into the Twilight – who was he and whose side was he on? Had he been warning me or trying to frighten me off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the kid, Egor – had I really met him just by chance? And if not, had our meeting been a destiny node or just another of Zabulon\u0027s moves?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew next to nothing about inhabitants of the Twilight. Maybe even Gesar himself knew nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at least I could think a bit about Egor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a card that hadn\u0027t been dealt yet. Maybe only a low card, but a trump, like all of us. And small trumps have their uses too. Egor had already been in the Twilight – the first time when he tried to see me, the second time when he escaped from the vampire. That wasn\u0027t a very good hand, to be honest. Both times he\u0027d been led by fear, and that should have meant his future was decided. Maybe he could linger on the borderline between human and Other for a few more years, but his path led to the Dark Ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s always best to look the truth squarely in the face. It didn\u0027t make the slightest bit of difference that so far Egor was just like any other good kid. If I survived, I\u0027d still have to ask for his ID every time I met him – or show him my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabulon could probably influence him. Send him to any place I happened to be. That reminded me that he probably had no difficulty sensing where I was either. I was prepared for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I still didn\u0027t know if our \u0027chance\u0027 meeting had any meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing on what the Dark computer operator had said – that they weren\u0027t combing the Economics Exhibition district yet – it had. I might get the wild idea of using the boy somehow – hiding in his apartment or sending him to get help. I might head for his building. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo complicated. Way too tricky. They could take me easily enough anyway. I was missing something, something crucially important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked towards the road and didn\u0027t look round again at the tower that held the Dark Ones\u0027 sham headquarters of the day. I\u0027d almost even forgotten about the shattered body of the magician who\u0027d been guarding it, lying somewhere near the foot of the tower at that moment. What did they want me to do? What was it? That was the point I had to start from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAct as bait. Get caught by the Day Watch. Get caught in a way that would leave no doubt that I was guilty. And that had as good as happened already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, Svetlana wouldn\u0027t be able to control herself. We could protect her and her parents. The one thing we couldn\u0027t do was interfere in her own decisions. And if she started trying to save me, to pluck me out of the Day Watch\u0027s dungeons or rescue me from the tribunal, she would be killed. Swiftly and without hesitation. The whole game had been designed so she could make a wrong move. The whole game had been set up a long time ago, when the Dark Magician Zabulon had seen the appearance of a Great Sorceress in the future and the part I was destined to play. The traps had been set. The first one had failed. The second one was holding its greedy jaws wide open right now. Maybe there was a third still to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where did a kid who still couldn\u0027t manifest his magical powers come into all this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was Dark, that must be it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd who was it who killed Dark Ones? Weak, unskilled Dark Ones who didn\u0027t want to develop?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more body laid at my door – but what was the point?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know. But I did know that the kid was doomed and the meeting in the metro hadn\u0027t been any accident. I could see that clearly now. I must have been experiencing prevision again or another piece of the jigsaw had simply fallen into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgor would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered the way he\u0027d looked at me on the platform in the station, with his shoulders hunched over, wanting to ask me something and shout abuse at me all at the same time, to shout out loud the truth about the two Watches, the truth he\u0027d seen too early. I remembered the way he\u0027d turned and run for the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They\u0027ll protect you, won\u0027t they? Your Watch?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They\u0027ll try.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course they\u0027d try. They\u0027d keep looking for the Maverick right to the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the answer!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped walking and seized hold of my head. Light and Dark, how could I be so stupid? So hopelessly naïve?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey wouldn\u0027t spring the trap as long as the Maverick was still alive. Making me look like a psychopath out on the hunt, a poacher from the Light Side, wasn\u0027t enough. They needed to kill the real Maverick as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Ones knew who he was – or at least Zabulon did. And more important than that – they could control him. They tossed his victims to him – members of their own kind they didn\u0027t see as particularly useful. And for the Maverick what was happening right now wasn\u0027t just one more heroic incident – he was totally absorbed in the battle against the Dark. He had Dark Ones coming at him from every side: first the female shape-shifter, then the Dark Magician in the restaurant, and now Egor. He must be thinking the whole world had gone crazy, that the Apocalypse was just round the corner, that the powers of the Dark were taking over the world. I wouldn\u0027t have liked to be in his shoes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-46.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
