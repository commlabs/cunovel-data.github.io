How may I help you?” as cheerfully as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know that you can. I was asked to call you. I’m not sure why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, not a woman’s voice—a girl’s. It had a kind of raspy quality as if she had just finished crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who asked you to call me?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Josh Berglund.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Josh Berglund. He … yesterday he told me … we spoke … Josh said …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused for a moment to gather her thoughts. When the moment stretched into half a minute I said, “Miss?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry—it’s just… it hasn’t been a good day for me. I just learned that Josh was … a little while ago I learned that he … that he was killed, and I still … I can’t believe it happened. They say—the reporter on the news—the TV was on at the Life Center and I glanced at it …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused again. This time I filled the silence by asking questions, trying to draw her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s your name?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Genevieve Antonello.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a pretty name. Are you Italian?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Half Italian, half Irish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said Life Center before, what’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Community Life Center in Benson Great Hall. It’s a kind of student center.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a student?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. At Bethel University.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you taking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m thinking about economics, but I’m still a freshman, so I have time before I declare a major.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow for the tough questions, my inner voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you know Berglund?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I met him at the nursing home,” Genevieve said. “I volunteer at the nursing home, and he came to interview Uncle Mike and we—he and I—we became … He was very kind to Mike. I can’t believe he’s gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe catch in her voice almost brought me to tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said he told you to call me,” I reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, that’s right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not… I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He called me. Called me on my cell. He said he was in a hurry. He said things were happening quickly, but he didn’t say what things. I asked, but he didn’t say. Now I see—I saw on TV that he was killed. I don’t know what to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Genevieve, he gave you my name, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. He gave me your name and phone number. He said if anything should happen to him—he didn’t say what could happen, but he said if anything happened I should call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” I asked again. I was becoming more and more annoyed that Genevieve wouldn’t just spit it out, yet at the same time I was trying to sound sympathetic to keep her talking. “What did he want you to tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He wanted me to tell you not to let—he said ‘bastards …’ ” She spoke the word as if she were afraid of it. “He said not to let the bastards get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What bastards? Who was he referring to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he not want the bastards to get?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t say. Mr. McKenzie, I asked, but he laughed like it was a joke. Like it was a riddle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Genevieve, may I see you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now? No. No. Not—no. Not tonight. Not—not in person. I can’t see anyone. I can’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow, then? Can I see you tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose. Yes. I don’t have classes until … I don’t know if I’m going to go to class.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked for her phone number, and Genevieve managed to get it out. I asked where she would like to meet; I said the earlier the better. She told me that freshmen aren’t allowed to keep cars on campus and she didn’t want to leave the school grounds anyway. I certainly couldn’t blame her for that. After all, she was meeting a stranger who might or might not have been involved in the killing of someone she obviously cared for. She suggested I meet her at 10:00 A.M. outside Benson Great Hall. It was just inside the gate on the left. She said that I couldn’t miss it. I told her she was welcome to bring friends. She thanked me and said she was sure she would be okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to ask her a few more questions, but the few minutes she had invested in our conversation seemed to have exhausted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Mr. McKenzie,” she said. “I can’t talk anymore.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jelly-s-gold-mac-mckenzie-6/page-40.html","bookId":2220,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:41:33 PM"}
