He took off her wristwatch and necklace, then patiently undid the hooks and eyes of her dress, his blunt fingers expert from hours of practice. There was a smear on the side, he noticed with a disapproving frown, as if she touched something sticky then wiped her hand on her hip. She was not normally dirty. He pulled the dress over her head, careful not to muss her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInge was as lovely today as she had been the first time he had seen her in her underwear. But then she had been smiling, speaking fond words, her expression showing eagerness and a trace of apprehension. Today her face was blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung her dress in the wardrobe then took off her brassiere. Her breasts were full and round, the nipples so light in color they were almost invisible. He swallowed hard and tried not to look at them. He made her sit on the dressing-table stool, then removed her shoes, unfastened her stockings and rolled them down, and took off her garter belt. He stood her up again to pull down her underpants. Desire rose in him as he uncovered the blond curls between her legs. He felt disgusted with himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he could have sexual intercourse with her if he wished. She would lie still and accept it with blank impassivity, as she took everything that happened to her. But he could not bring himself to do it. He had tried, one time, not long after she came home from the hospital, telling himself that perhaps this would rekindle in her the spark of awareness; but he had been revolted by himself, and had stopped after a few seconds. Now the desire came back, and he had to fight it off, even though he knew that giving in would bring no relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw her underwear into the linen basket with an angry gesture. She did not move as he opened a drawer and took out a white cotton nightdress embroidered with small flowers, a gift to Inge from his mother. She was innocent in her nakedness, and to desire her seemed as wrong as to desire a child. He drew the nightdress over her head, put her arms into it, and smoothed it down her back. He looked over her shoulder into the mirror. The flower pattern suited her, and she looked pretty. He thought he saw a faint smile touch her lips, but it was probably his imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her to the bathroom then put her to bed. As he undressed himself, he looked at his own body in the mirror. There was a long scar across his belly, souvenir of a Saturday-night street brawl he had broken up as a young policeman. He no longer had the athletic physique of his youth, but he was still fit. He wondered how long it would be before a woman touched his skin with hungry hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put on pajamas, but he did not feel sleepy. He decided to return to the living room and smoke another cigarette. He looked at Inge. She lay still with her eyes open. He would hear her if she moved. He generally knew when she needed something. She would simply stand up, and wait, as if she could not figure out what to do next; and he would have to guess what she wanted: a drink of water, the toilet, a shawl to keep her warm, or something more complicated. Occasionally she would move about the apartment, apparently at random, but she would soon come to a halt, perhaps at a window, or staring helplessly at a closed door, or just in the middle of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the bedroom and crossed the little hallway to the living room, leaving both doors open. He found his cigarettes then, on impulse, took a half-empty bottle of aquavit from a cupboard and poured some into a glass. Sipping his drink and smoking, he thought about the week past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had started well and finished badly. He had begun by catching two spies, Ingemar Gammel and Poul Kirke. Better still, they were not like his usual targets, union organizers who intimidated strikebreakers, or communists who sent coded letters to Moscow saying that Jutland was ripe for revolution. No, Gammel and Kirke were real spies, and the sketches Tilde Jespersen had found in Kirke\u0027s office constituted important military intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter\u0027s star seemed in the ascendant. Some of his colleagues had begun to act coolly toward him, disapproving of his enthusiastic cooperation with the German occupiers, but they hardly mattered. General Braun had called him in to say that he thought Peter should be head of the Security Department. He did not say what would happen to Frederik Juel. But he had made it clear that the job was Peter\u0027s if he could wrap this case up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a pity Poul Kirke had died. Alive, he might have revealed who his collaborators were, where his orders came from, and how he sent information to the British. Gammel was still alive, and had been handed over to the Gestapo for \"deep interrogation,\" but he had revealed nothing further, probably because he did not know any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter had pursued the investigation with his usual energy and determination. He had questioned Poul\u0027s commanding officer, the supercilious Squadron Leader Renthe. He had interviewed Poul\u0027s parents, his friends, and even his cousin Mads, and had got nothing from any of them. He had detectives tailing Poul\u0027s girlfriend, Karen Duchwitz, but so far she appeared to be no more than a hardworking student at the ballet school. Peter also had Poul\u0027s best friend, Arne Olufsen, under surveillance. Arne was the best prospect, for he could easily have drawn the sketches of the military base on Sande. But Arne had spent the week blamelessly going about his duties. Tonight, Friday, he had taken the train into Copenhagen, but there was nothing unusual about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a brilliant start, the case seemed to have dead-ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe week\u0027s minor triumph had been the humiliation of Arne\u0027s brother, Harald. However, Peter felt sure Harald was not involved in espionage. A man who was risking his life as a spy did not daub silly slogans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter was wondering where to go next with the investigation when there was a knock at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece. It was ten-thirty, not outrageously late but still an unusual time for an unexpected visit. The caller certainly could not be surprised to find him in pajamas. He stepped into the hallway and opened the door. Tilde Jespersen stood there, a sky blue beret perched on her fair curly hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s been a development,\" she said. \"I thought we should discuss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Come in. You\u0027ll have to excuse my appearance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the pattern on his pajamas with a grin. \"Elephants,\" she said as she walked into the living room. \"I wouldn\u0027t have guessed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt embarrassed and wished he had put on a robe, although it was too warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilde sat down. \"Where\u0027s Inge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In bed. Would you like some aquavit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got a fresh glass and poured for both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed her legs. Her knees were round and her calves plump, quite different from Inge\u0027s slender legs. She said, \"Arne Olufsen bought a ticket for tomorrow\u0027s ferry to Bornholm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter froze with the glass halfway to his lips. \"Bornholm,\" he said softly. The Danish holiday island was tantalizingly close to the Swedish coast. Could this be the break he was waiting for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took out a cigarette and he lit it. Blowing out smoke, she said, \"Of course, he might simply be due for some leave, and have decided to take a vacation . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite so. On the other hand, he may be planning to escape to Sweden.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter swallowed his drink with a satisfying gulp. \"Who\u0027s with him now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dresler. He relieved me fifteen minutes ago. I came straight here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter forced himself to be skeptical. It was too easy, in an investigation, to let wishful thinking mislead you. \"Why would Olufsen want to leave the country?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might have been scared by what happened to Poul Kirke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hasn\u0027t been acting scared. Until today he\u0027s been doing his job, apparently happily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s just noticed the surveillance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter nodded. \"They always do, sooner or later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alternatively, he might be going to Bornholm to spy. The British could have ordered him there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter made a doubtful face. \"What\u0027s on Bornholm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilde shrugged. \"Maybe that\u0027s the question they want answered. Or perhaps it\u0027s a rendezvous. Remember, if he can get from Bornholm to Sweden, the journey the other way is probably just as easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good point.\" Tilde was very clear-thinking, he reflected. She kept all possibilities in view. He looked at her intelligent face and clear blue eyes. He watched her mouth as she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed unaware of his scrutiny. \"The death of Kirke probably broke their normal line of communication. This could be an emergency fallback plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not convinced - but there\u0027s only one way to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Continue to shadow Olufsen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Tell Dresler to get on the ferry with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Olufsen has a bicycle with him. Shall I tell Dresler to take one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Then book yourself and me on tomorrow\u0027s flight to Bornholm. We\u0027ll get there first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilde stubbed out her cigarette and stood up. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter did not want her to go. The aquavit was warm in his belly, he felt relaxed, and he was enjoying having an attractive woman to talk to. But he could not think of an excuse to detain her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed her into the hallway. She said, \"I\u0027ll see you at the airport.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He put his hand on the doorknob but did not open it. \"Tilde . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him with a neutral expression. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for this. Good work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched his cheek. \"Sleep well,\" she said, but she did not move away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her. The trace of a smile touched the corners of her mouth, but he could not tell whether it was inviting or mocking. He leaned forward, and suddenly he was kissing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kissed him back with fierce passion. He was taken by surprise. She pulled his head to hers, thrust her tongue into his mouth. After a moment of shock he responded. He grabbed her soft breast and squeezed roughly. She made a noise deep in her throat, and thrust her hips against his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw a movement out of the corner of his eye. He broke the kiss and turned his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInge stood in the bedroom doorway, like a ghost in her pale nightdress. Her face wore its perpetual blank expression, but she was looking straight at them. Peter heard himself make a sound like a sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilde slipped from his embrace. He turned to speak to her, but no words came. She opened the apartment door and stepped outside. She was gone in a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe daily flight from Copenhagen to Bornholm was operated by the Danish airline, DDL. It departed at nine A.M. and took an hour. The plane landed at an airstrip a mile or so outside Bornholm\u0027s main town, Ronne. Peter and Tilde were met by the local police chief, who gave them the loan of a car as if entrusting them with royal jewels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove into the town. It was a sleepy place, with more horses than cars. The half-timbered houses were painted in striking deep colors: dark mustard, terracotta pink, forest green, and rust red. Two German soldiers stood in the central square, smoking and chatting to passers-by. From the square, a cobbled street led downhill to the harbor. There was a Kriegsmarine torpedo boat in the dock, with a group of small boys clustered on the quayside staring at it. Peter located the ferry port, across from the brick custom house, the largest building in town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter and Tilde drove around to familiarize themselves with the streets, then returned to the port in the afternoon to meet the ferry. Neither mentioned last night\u0027s kiss, but Peter was intensely aware of her physical presence: that elusive flowery perfume, her alert blue eyes, the mouth that had kissed him with such urgent passion. At the same time, he kept remembering Inge standing in the bedroom doorway, her expressionless white face a more agonizing reproach than any explicit accusation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the ship came into the harbor, Tilde said, \"I hope we\u0027re right, and Arne is a spy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t lost your enthusiasm for this work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer reply was sharp. \"Whatever makes you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our discussion about Jews.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that.\" She shrugged it off. \"You were right, weren\u0027t you? You proved it. We raided the synagogue and it led us to Gammel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, I wondered if the death of Kirke might have been too gruesome . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My husband died,\" she said crisply. \"I don\u0027t mind seeing criminals die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was even tougher than he had thought. He hid a pleased smile. \"So you\u0027ll stay in the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see any other future. Besides, I might be the first woman to get promotion to sergeant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter doubted that would ever happen. It would involve men taking orders from a woman, and that seemed beyond the bounds of possibility. But he did not say so. \"Braun virtually promised me promotion if I can round up this spy ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promotion to what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Head of the department. Juel\u0027s job.\" And a man who was head of the Security Department at thirty could well end up chief of the entire Copenhagen police, he thought. His heart beat faster as he envisioned the crackdown he would impose, with the backing of the Nazis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilde smiled warmly. Putting a hand on his arm, she said, \"Then we\u0027d better make sure we catch them all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship docked and the passengers began to disembark. As they watched, Tilde said, \"You\u0027ve known Arne since childhood - is he the type for espionage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have to say no,\" Peter replied thoughtfully. \"He\u0027s too happy-go-lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" Tilde looked glum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact, I might have dismissed him as a suspect, but for his English fiancee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brightened. \"That puts him right in the frame.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know whether they\u0027re still engaged. She went back to England hot-foot when the Germans came. But the possibility is enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred or so passengers got off, some on foot, a handful in cars, many with bicycles. The island was only twenty miles from end to end, and cycling was the easiest way to get around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" said Tilde, pointing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter saw Arne Olufsen disembarking, wearing his army uniform, pushing his bicycle. \"But where\u0027s Dresler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four people behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see him.\" Peter put on sunglasses and pulled his hat low, then started the engine. Arne cycled up the cobbled street toward the town center, and Dresler did the same. Peter and Tilde followed slowly in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArne headed out of town to the north. Peter began to feel conspicuous. There were few other cars on the roads, and he had to drive slowly to stay with the bikes. Soon he was obliged to fall behind and drop out of sight for fear of being noticed. After a few minutes, he speeded up until he caught sight of Dresler, then slowed again. Two German soldiers on a motorcycle with a sidecar passed them, and Peter wished he had borrowed a motorbike instead of a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few miles out of town, they were the only people on the road. \"This is impossible,\" Tilde said in a high, anxious voice. \"He\u0027s bound to spot us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter nodded. She was right, but now a new thought occurred to him. \"And when he does, his reaction will be highly revealing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him an inquiring look, but he did not explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe increased speed. Rounding a bend, he saw Dresler crouching in the woods at the side of the road and, a hundred yards ahead, Arne sitting on a wall, smoking a cigarette. Peter had no option but to drive past. He continued another mile then reversed down a farm track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was he checking on us, or just taking a rest?\" Tilde said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later Arne cycled past, followed by Dresler. Peter pulled onto the road again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe daylight was fading. Three miles farther on, they came to a crossroads. Dresler had stopped there and was looking perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sign of Arne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDresler came up to the car window, looking distraught. \"I\u0027m sorry, Boss. He put on a burst of speed and got ahead of me. I lost sight of him, and I don\u0027t know which way he went at this crossroads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilde said, \"Hell. He must have planned it. He obviously knows the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Dresler said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilde said quietly, \"There goes your promotion - and mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so gloomy,\" Peter said. \"This is good news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTilde was bewildered. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If an innocent man thinks he\u0027s being followed, what does he do? He stops, turns around, and says, \u0027Who the hell do you think you are, following me around?\u0027 Only a guilty man deliberately shakes off a surveillance team. Don\u0027t you see? This means we were right: Arne Olufsen is a spy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027ve lost him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t worry. We\u0027ll find him again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spent the night at a seaside hotel with a bathroom at the end of each corridor. At midnight, Peter put a robe over his pajamas and knocked on the door of Tilde\u0027s room. She called, \"Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped inside. She was sitting up in the single bed, wearing a light blue silk nightdress, reading an American novel called Gone with the Wind. He said, \"You didn\u0027t ask who it was at the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis detective\u0027s mind noticed that she wore lipstick, her hair was carefully brushed, and the flowery perfume was in the air, as if she had dressed for a date. He kissed her lips, and she stroked the back of his head. After a moment he looked back to the door, to make sure he had closed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not there,\" Tilde said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her again, but after a few moments he realized he was not getting excited. He broke the kiss and sat on the edge of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the same for me,\" Tilde said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I keep thinking about Oskar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inge might as well be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I\u0027m sorry. But it\u0027s true. I\u0027m thinking about my husband, and you\u0027re thinking about your wife, and neither of them cares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t like this last night, at my apartment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t give ourselves time to think then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was ridiculous, he thought. In his youth he had been a confident seducer, able to persuade many women to yield to him, and leaving most of them well satisfied. Was he just out of practice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged off his robe and slipped into bed beside her.
