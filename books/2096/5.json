Then she pointed shakily, sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I ruined,\" she said, her voice soft from lack of breath, and from fear. Faye looked up at the ceiling, at the dark, charred circle on the white plaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was coming right at you,\" Cassie said, too unnerved to yell, or even to be angry. \"Didn\u0027t you see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye just looked at her, black lashes heavy over speculative golden eyes. Then she looked at the skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie leaned over and covered the skull with the cloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking it back,\" Cassie said, still breathless. \"Diana was right. I was right, if I\u0027d listened to myself. It\u0027s too dangerous to handle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe expected Faye to explode, possibly even to fight her. But Faye looked up at the stain on the ceiling and said musingly, \"I think it\u0027s just a matter of more protection. If we could capture that energy-channel it. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re crazy,\" Cassie told her bluntly. \"And,\" she added, \"our deal is finished. I did what you asked: I brought you the skull. You used it and you almost got killed. So now it\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaye\u0027s lazy expression disappeared. \"Oh, no, Cassie,\" she said. The hint of a smile curved her lips, but her eyes were predatory. Ruthless. \"It\u0027s only starting. Don\u0027t you see?\" She began to laugh. \"You\u0027re more my captive now than ever. It\u0027s not just Adam anymore-now I can tell Diana about this. How do you think the Princess of Purity is going to feel when she finds out her \u0027little sister\u0027 stole the skull? And then brought it to me to use?\" Faye laughed harder, seeming delighted. \"Oh, Cassie, you should see your face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie felt as if she were smothering. What Faye said was true. If Diana found out that Cassie had dug up the skull-that Cassie had lied to her-that the whole story last Sunday about being too scared to go home had been a trick...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as it had the last time she\u0027d stood in this room, Cassie felt her spirit, her will, draining away. She was more trapped than ever. She was lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You take the skull back now,\" Faye said, as if it had been entirely her idea. \"And later- well, I\u0027ll think of something else I want from you. In the meanwhile, you just keep yourself available.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate you, Cassie thought with impotent rage. But Faye was ignoring Cassie completely, bending to pick up the bristling kittens, one gray and one orange, which had crawled out from under the dust ruffle. The vampire kittens, Cassie remembered distractedly-the ones with a taste for human blood. Apparently even they hadn\u0027t liked this business with the skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about that?\" Cassie said, pointing at the dark stain on Faye\u0027s ceiling. \"Don\u0027t you feel at all responsible about letting it loose? It could be out killing somebody-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it,\" Faye said, and shrugged negligently. \"But we\u0027ll just have to wait and see, I suppose.\" She stroked the orange kitten and its fur began to lie flat again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie could only stare at her, tears rising to her eyes. She\u0027d thought she could control Faye, but she\u0027d been wrong. And right now the new dark energy could be doing anything, and she was helpless to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could tell Diana, an inner voice, the core voice, whispered, but Cassie didn\u0027t even pretend to listen. She could never tell Diana now; that chance was over. Things had gone far too far with Faye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie, are you nervous about something?\" Laurel had paused with the white-handled knife in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? No. Why?\" Cassie said, feeling every moment as if she might jump out of her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just seem kind of jittery.\" Laurel gently snicked the knife through the base of the small witch-hazel bush. \"Now, this won\u0027t hurt a bit... you\u0027ve got plenty of roots down there to grow back from...\" she murmured soothingly. \"It\u0027s not about Homecoming, is it?\" she asked, looking up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" Cassie said. She hadn\u0027t even thought about Homecoming this week. She couldn\u0027t think about anything except the dark energy. Each day she expected to hear about some new disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut today was Thursday, and nothing had happened yet. No avalanches, no bodies found, nobody even missing. Oh, if only she could let herself believe that nothing would happen. The energy she and Faye had released had been small-she felt sure of that now-and maybe it had just evaporated. Cassie felt a delicious peace steal through her at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel had moved over to a clump of thyme. \"It\u0027s not too late to change your mind about coming,\" she said. \"And I wish you would. Dancing is very witchy-and it\u0027s Nature. It\u0027s like one of our incantations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man to woman, woman to man, Ever since the world began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart to heart, and hand to hand, Ever since the world began.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe added, looking up at Cassie thoughtfully, \"Wasn\u0027t there some guy you met over the summer that you were interested in? We could do a spell to pull him here-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" said Cassie. \"I mean, I really don\u0027t want to go to Homecoming, Laurel. I just-I wouldn\u0027t be comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Laurel said. For an instant Cassie thought it was addressed to her, but Laurel was now talking to the thyme. \"I\u0027m sorry I needed part of the root, too, but I brought this to help you grow back,\" she went on, tucking a pink crystal into the soil. \"That reminds me, have you found your working crystal yet?\" she said to Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Cassie said. She thought of the jumble of crystals in Faye\u0027s box. She\u0027d liked handling them, but none of them had stood out as hers, as the one she needed as a witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, you will,\" Laurel assured her. \"It\u0027ll just turn up one day, and you\u0027ll know.\" She stood up with the thyme plant in her hand. \"All right, let\u0027s go inside and I\u0027ll show you how to make an infusion. Nobody should fool around with herbs unless they know exactly what they\u0027re doing. And if you change your mind about Homecoming, thyme soup helps overcome shyness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie cast a look around the great wide world, as she always did now, checking for the dark energy, then she followed Laurel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, in American history class, Diana sneezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. Lanning stopped talking and said, \"Bless you\" absently. Cassie scarcely noticed it at the time. But then, at the end of class, Diana sneezed again, and kept sneezing. Cassie looked at her. Diana\u0027s eyes were pink and watery. Her nose was getting pink, too, as she rubbed it with a Kleenex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, instead of going to the Homecoming game, Diana stayed at home in bed. Cassie, who knew nothing about football and was only yelling when everybody else yelled, worried about her in some back corner of her mind. It couldn\u0027t have anything to do with the dark energy, could it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Applaud,\" Laurel said, nudging her. \"For the Homecoming Queen. Sally really looks almost pretty, doesn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess,\" Cassie said, applauding mechanically. \"Laurel, how come one of us isn\u0027t Homecoming Queen? Instead of an outsider?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana didn\u0027t want to be,\" Laurel said succinctly. \"And Deb and the others think it\u0027s too goody-goody. But from the way Jeffrey Lovejoy\u0027s looking at Sally, I\u0027d say Faye made a mistake. She told Jeff to come to the dance with her, but he\u0027d already asked Sally and he\u0027s a fighter. It\u0027ll be interesting to see who gets him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can tell me all about it,\" Cassie said. \"I saw the last fight between Faye and Sally; this one I can miss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it didn\u0027t turn out that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was in the herb garden when the phone call came. She had to go through the kitchen and into the new wing of the house to get to the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Cassie?\" The voice was so muted and stuffed-up it was almost unrecognizable. \"It\u0027s Diana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear crinkled up Cassie\u0027s backbone. The dark energy... \"Oh, Diana, are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a burst of muffled laughter. \"Don\u0027t panic. I\u0027m not dying. It\u0027s just a bad cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound awful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027m completely miserable, and I can\u0027t go to the dance tonight, and I called to ask you a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie froze with a sudden intuition. Her mouth opened, and then shut again silently. But Diana was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeffrey called Faye to tell her he\u0027s going with Sally after all, and Faye is livid. So when she heard I was sick, she called to say she would go with Adam, because she knew I would want him to go even if I couldn\u0027t. And I do; I don\u0027t want him to miss it just because of me. So I told her she couldn\u0027t because I\u0027d already asked you to go with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Cassie blurted, and then thought, Ask a stupid question...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Faye is on the prowl,\" Diana said patiently. \"And she likes Adam, and the mood she\u0027s in tonight, she\u0027ll try anything. That\u0027s the one thing I couldn\u0027t stand, Cassie, for her to get her hands on Adam. I just couldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie looked around for something to sit down on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Diana ... I don\u0027t even have a dress. I\u0027m all muddy....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can go over to Suzan\u0027s. All the other girls are there. They\u0027ll take care of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" Cassie shut her eyes. \"Diana, you just don\u0027t understand. I can\u0027t. I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Cassie, I know it\u0027s a lot to ask. But I don\u0027t know who else to turn to. And if Faye goes after Adam...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time Cassie had ever heard such a forlorn note in Diana\u0027s voice. She sounded on the verge of tears. Cassie pressed a hand to her forehead. \"Okay. Okay, I\u0027ll do it. But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Cassie! Now go right to Suzan\u0027s-I\u0027ve talked with her and Laurel and Melanie. They\u0027ll fix you up. I\u0027m going to call Adam and tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that, Cassie thought helplessly, was one conversation she thought she could miss too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Adam would get them out of it somehow, she thought as she drove the Rabbit up Suzan\u0027s driveway. But she doubted it. When Diana made her mind up about something, she was immovable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzan\u0027s house had columns. Cassie\u0027s mother said it was bad Greek Revival, but Cassie secretly thought it was impressive. The inside was imposing too, and Suzan\u0027s bedroom was in a class by itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all the colors of the sea: sand, shell, pearl, periwinkle. The headboard on Suzan\u0027s bed was shaped like a giant scalloped shell. But what caught Cassie\u0027s eye were the mirrors- she\u0027d never seen so many mirrors in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassie!\" Laurel burst in just behind her, making Cassie turn in surprise. \"I\u0027ve got it!\" Laurel announced triumphantly to the other girls, holding up a plastic-draped hanger. Inside Cassie glimpsed some pale, gleaming material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a dress Granny Quincey got me this summer-but I haven\u0027t worn it and I never will. It\u0027s not my style, but it\u0027ll be perfect on you, Cassie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" was all Cassie could think of to say. She\u0027d changed her mind; she couldn\u0027t do this after all. \"Laurel-thanks-but I might ruin it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let her talk,\" Melanie ordered from the other side of the room. \"Stick her in a bath; she needs one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That way,\" Suzan said, gesturing with splayed fingers. \"I can\u0027t do anything until my nails are dry, but all the stuff\u0027s in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beauty bath mix,\" Laurel gloated, examining the assortment of bottles on the gilt shelves in Suzan\u0027s bathroom. There were all kinds of bottles, some with wide necks and some with long narrow necks, green and deep glowing blue. \"Here, this is great: thyme, mint, rosemary, and lavender. It smells wonderful, and it\u0027s tranquilizing, too.\" She scattered bright-colored dried flowers in the steaming water. \"Now get in and scrub. Oh, this is good,\" she went on, sniffing at another bottle. \"Chamomile hair rinse-it brightens hair, brings out the highlights. Use it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie obeyed dazedly. She felt as if she\u0027d just been inducted into boot camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got back to the bedroom, Melanie directed her to sit down and hold a hot washcloth on her face. \"It\u0027s \u0027a fragrant resin redolent with the mysterious virtues of tropical balms,\u0027 \" Melanie said, reading from a Book of Shadows. \"It \u0027renders the complexion clear and brilliant\u0027-and it really does, too. So hold this on your face while I do your hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Melanie\u0027s wonderful with hair,\" Laurel volunteered as Cassie gamely buried her face in the washcloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I\u0027m not going to give her a do,\" Melanie said critically. \"I\u0027m just making it soft and natural, waving back from her face. Plug in those hot rollers, Suzan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Melanie worked, Cassie could hear Laurel and Deborah arguing in the depths of Suzan\u0027s walk-in closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suzan,\" Laurel shouted. \"I never saw so many pairs of shoes in my life. What do you do with them all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I just like buying them. Which is lucky for people who want to borrow them,\" Suzan called back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, let\u0027s get you into the dress,\" Melanie said, some time later. \"No, don\u0027t look, not yet. Come over to the vanity and Suzan will do your makeup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeebly, Cassie tried to protest as Melanie whipped a towel around her neck. \"That\u0027s all right. I can do it myself-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you want Suzan to do it,\" Laurel said, emerging from the closet. \"I promise, Cassie; just wait and see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t wear much makeup-I won\u0027t look like me ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you will. You\u0027ll look more like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, somebody decide, for heaven\u0027s sake,\" Suzan said, standing by in a kimono and waving a powder puff impatiently. \"I\u0027ve got myself to do, too, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie yielded and sat on a stool, facing Suzan. \"Hm,\" said Suzan, turning Cassie\u0027s face this way and that. \"Hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next half hour was filled with bewildering instructions. \"Look up,\" Suzan commanded, wielding a brown eyeliner pencil. \"Look down. See, this will give you doe eyes,\" she went on, \"and nobody will even be able to tell you\u0027re wearing anything. Now a little almond shadow...\" She dipped a small brush in powder and blew off the excess. \"Now just a little midnight blue in the crease to make you look mysterious...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes shut, Cassie relaxed. This was fun. She felt even more decadent and pampered when Laurel said, \"I\u0027ll take care of your nails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you using?\" Cassie asked trustingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Witch-hazel infusion and Chanel Flamme Rose polish,\" Laurel replied, and they both giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t jolt my hand,\" Suzan said crossly. \"Now suck in your cheeks like a fish. Stop laughing. You\u0027ve got great cheekbones, I\u0027m just going to bring them out a little. Now go like this; I\u0027m going to put Roseglow on your lips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen at last she sat back to survey her work, the other girls gathered around, even Deborah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And finally,\" Suzan said, \"just a drop of magnet perfume here, and here, and here.\" She touched the hollow of Cassie\u0027s throat, her earlobes, and her wrists with something that smelled wild and exotic and wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Cassie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mignonette, tuberose, and ylang-ylang,\" Suzan said. \"It makes you irresistible. And I should know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlarm lanced through Cassie suddenly, but before she had time to think, Laurel was turning her, loosening the towel around her neck. \"Wait, don\u0027t look until you\u0027ve got your shoes on.... Now!\" Laurel said jubilantly. \"Look at that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie opened her eyes and drew in her breath. Then, scarcely knowing what she was doing, she moved closer to the full-length mirror, to the lovely stranger reflected there. She could hardly resist reaching out to touch the glass with her fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl in the mirror had fine, light-brown hair waving softly back from her face. The highlights shimmered when Cassie moved her head, so it must be her-but it couldn\u0027t be, Cassie thought. Her eyes didn\u0027t have that dreamy, mysterious aura. Her skin didn\u0027t have that dewy glow, and she didn\u0027t blush that way, to bring out her cheekbones. And her lips definitely didn\u0027t have that breathless ready-to-be-kissed look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the lipstick,\" Suzan explained. \"Don\u0027t smudge it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible,\" said Melanie, \"that you\u0027ve gone too far, Suzan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you like the dress?\" Laurel asked. \"It\u0027s the perfect length, just short enough, but still romantic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl in the mirror, the one with the delicate bones and the swan\u0027s neck, turned from side to side. The dress was silvery and shimmering, like yards of starlight, and it made Cassie feel like a princess. Suzan\u0027s shoes, appropriately, looked like glass slippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, thank you!\" Cassie said, whirling to look at the other girls. \"I mean-I don\u0027t know how to say thank you. I mean-I finally look like a witch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey burst into laughter, except Deborah, who threw a disgusted glance at the ceiling. Cassie hugged Laurel, and then, impulsively, hugged Suzan, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you are a witch,\" Suzan said reasonably. \"I\u0027ll show you how to do it yourself if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie felt something like humility. She\u0027d thought Suzan was just an airhead, but it wasn\u0027t true. Suzan loved beauty and was generous about sharing it with other people. Cassie smiled into the china-blue eyes and felt as if she\u0027d unexpectedly made a new friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, we almost forgot!\" Melanie said. \"You can\u0027t go to a dance without a single crystal to your name.\" She rummaged in her canvas bag, and then said, \"Here, this will be perfect; it was my great-grandmother\u0027s.\" She held up a necklace: a thin chain with a teardrop of clear quartz. Cassie took it lovingly and fastened it around her neck, admiring the way it lay in the hollow of her throat. Then she hugged Melanie, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom downstairs a doorbell chimed faintly, and, closer, a male voice shouted, \"For crying out loud! Are you going to get that, Suzan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one of the guys!\" Suzan said, thrown into a tizzy. \"And we\u0027re not ready. You\u0027re the only one dressed, Cassie; run and get it before Dad has a fit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mr. Whittier; sorry, Mr. Whittier,\" Cassie gasped as she hurried downstairs. It wasn\u0027t until she was at the door that she thought, Oh, please, please, please, let it be any one of the others. Don\u0027t let it be him. Please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was standing there when she opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wearing a wry smile, appropriate for a guy who\u0027s been commandeered at the last minute into escorting his girl\u0027s best friend to a dance. The smile disappeared instantly when he saw Cassie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long moment he simply stared at her. Her own elated smile faded, and they stood gazing at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam swallowed hard, started to say something, then gave up and stood silent again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie was hearing Suzan\u0027s words: It\u0027ll make you irresistible. Oh, what had she done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll call it off,\" she said, and her voice was as soft as when she\u0027d told Faye about the dark energy. \"We\u0027ll tell Diana I got sick too-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t,\" he said, equally soft, but very intense. \"Nobody would believe it, and besides...\" The wry smile made an attempt at reappearing. \"It would be a shame for you to miss Homecoming. You look...\" He paused. \"Nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do you,\" Cassie said, and tried to come up with an ironic smile of her own. She had the feeling it turned out wobbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassie took another breath, but at that moment she heard a voice from the second floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" Laurel said, leaning over the balustrade to toss Cassie a tiny beaded purse. \"Get her to the dance, Adam; that way she\u0027ll have a chance at some guys who\u0027re available.\" And, from the bedroom, Suzan called, \"But not too many, Cassie-leave some for us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try to fend a few of them off,\" Adam called back, and Cassie felt her racing pulse calm a little. They had their parts down now. It was like acting in a play, and all Cassie had to do was remember her role. She felt sure Adam could handle his ... well, almost sure. Something in his sea-dark eyes sent thin chills up her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Adam said, and Cassie took a deep breath and stepped with him outside into the night. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-circle-the-captive-the-secret-circle-2/page-5.html","bookId":2096,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:16 PM"}
