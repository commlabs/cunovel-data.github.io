Dairyman Crick was discovered stamping about the house. He had received a letter, in which a customer had complained that the butter had a twang. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`And begad, so \u0027t have!\u0027 said the dairyman, who held in his left hand a wooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck. `Yes - taste for yourself!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSeveral of them gathered round him; and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted, also the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and last of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table. There certainly was a twang. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe dairyman, who had thrown himself into abstraction to better realize the taste, and so divine the particular species of noxious weed to which it appertained, suddenly exclaimed-- \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`\u0027Tis garlic! and I thought there wasn\u0027t a blade left in that mead!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead, into which a few of the cows had been admitted of late, had, in years gone by, spoilt the butter in the same way. The dairyman had not recognized the taste at that time, and thought the butter bewitched. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`We must overhaul that mead,\u0027 he resumed; `this mustn\u0027t continny!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll having armed themselves with old pointed knives they went out together. As the inimical plant could only be present in very microscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation, to find it seemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich grass before them. However, they formed themselves into line, all assisting, owing to the importance of the search; the dairyman at the upper end with Mr Clare, who had volunteered to help; then Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and Retty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and the married dairywomen - Beck Knibbs, with her woolly black hair and rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances, consumptive from the winter damps of the water-meads - who lived in their respective cottages. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of the field, returning a little further down in such a manner that, when they should have finished, not a single inch of the pasture but would have fallen under the eye of some one of them. It was a most tedious business, not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being discoverable in the whole field; yet such was the herb\u0027s pungency that probably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season the whole dairy\u0027s produce for the day. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDiffering one from another in natures and moods so greatly as they did, they yet formed, bending, a curiously uniform row - automatic, noiseless; and an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane might well have been excused for massing them as `Hodge\u0027. As they crept along, stooping low to discern the plant, a soft yellow gleam was reflected from the buttercups into their shaded faces, giving them an elfish, moonlit aspect, though the sun was pouring upon their backs in all the strength of noon. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAngel Clare, who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part with the rest in everything, glanced up now and then. It was not, of course, by accident that he walked next to Tess. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Well, how are you?\u0027 he murmured. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Very well, thank you, sir,\u0027 she replied demurely. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs they had been discussing a score of personal matters only half-an-hour before, the introductory style seemed a little superfluous. But they got no further in speech just then. They crept and crept, the hem of her petticoat just touching his gaiter, and his elbow sometimes brushing hers. At last the dairyman, who came next, could stand it no longer. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Upon my soul and body, this here stooping do fairly make my back open and shut!\u0027 he exclaimed, straightening himself slowly with an excruciated look till quite upright. `And you, maidy Tess, you wasn\u0027t well a day or two ago - this will make your head ache finely! Don\u0027t do any more, if you feel fainty; leave the rest to finish it.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDairyman Crick withdrew, and Tess dropped behind. Mr Clare also stepped out of line, and began privateering about for the weed. When she found him near her, her very tension at what she had heard the night before made her the first to speak. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Don\u0027t they look pretty?\u0027 she said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Who?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Izzy Huett and Retty.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTess had moodily decided that either of these maidens would make a good farmer\u0027s wife, and that she ought to recommend them, and obscure her own wretched charms. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Pretty? Well, yes - they are pretty girls - fresh looking. I have often thought so.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Though, poor dears, prettiness won\u0027t last long!\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`O no, unfortunately.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`They are excellent dairywomen.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Yes: though not better than you.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`They skim better than I.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Do they?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eClare remained observing them - not without their observing him. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`She is colouring up,\u0027 continued Tess heroically. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Who?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Retty Priddle.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Oh! Why is that?\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e`Because you are looking at her.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSelf-sacrificing as her mood might be Tess could not well go further and cry, `Marry one of them, if you really do want a dairywoman and not a lady; and don\u0027t think of marrying me!\u0027 She followed Dairyman Crick, and had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that Clare remained behind. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid him - never allowing herself, as formerly, to remain long in his company, even if their juxtaposition were purely accidental. She gave the other three every chance. \u003c/p\u003e   \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/80/4717.html","bookId":538,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:09:16 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:09:16 AM"}
