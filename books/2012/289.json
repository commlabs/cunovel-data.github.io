He asked you to bow to causes not your own. A hundred banners, a hundred cities – allies who welcomed you and allies who did not. Allies who blessed you and allies who feared you. And your kin died, oh, how they died – they gave up their lives in causes not their own .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword cracked again, and this time Irind almost buckled beneath the blow. Spinnock could hear his harsh breaths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They were all different, and they were all the same. But the cause – the true cause he offered you – did not change .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blow sent Irind to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother soldier moved up, readying his own shield. Bodily dragged Irind back, and then took his place. The sounds from the advancing warriors behind Spinnock was a susurration – breaths, armour, boots scrabbling for purchase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your lord was thinking – each and every time – he was thinking … of this moment .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain flashed the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Each time, every time. The cause was just .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He needed to keep reminding you. For this day!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Today, this is not foreign soil! Today, this cause is your own!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Today, the Tiste Andii fight for themselves! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this time other weapons found the rims of shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRACK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Your home! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRACK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Your kin! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRACK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword shivered in his hand. The soldier stumbling beside him fell away, his shield split.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasping, Spinnock Durav pushed on. Anomander Rake – do you witness this? Do you look into these faces – all these faces behind me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ This time! Strangers fight in your name! Strangers die for you! Your cause – not theirs! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRACK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reverberation shoved him forward, shivered through him like something holy. ‘ Children of Dark, humans are dying in your name! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRACK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very air trembled with that concussion. A torrent of water – clinging to high branches, to needles and leaves – shook loose and rained down in an answering hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, Spinnock could hear fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you see, Anomander? Old friend, do you see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is our war .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRACK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the boles a glimmer of falling light. A vast shape lifting high. The sudden roar of a dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods, no, what have they done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCRACK!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnomander Rake entered the throne room. Sandalath Drukorlat stared at him, watching as he strode towards her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice held a hint of thunder outside. ‘Release Silanah.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Where is your sword?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Son of Darkness drew up momentarily, brow clouding. One hand brushed the grip of the weapon slung at his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not that one,’ she said. ‘The slayer of Draconus. Show me. Show me his sword! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Highness—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Stop that! This throne is not mine. It is yours. Do not mock me, Lord. They said you killed him. They said you cut him down.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I have done no such thing, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden thought struck her. ‘Where is Orfantal? You took him to stand at your side. Where is my son? My beloved son? Tell me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew closer. He looked so young, so vulnerable. And that was all … wrong. Ah, this is much earlier. He has not yet killed the Consort. But then … who am I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Release Silanah, Sandalath Drukorlat. The Storm must be freed – the destruction of Kharkanas will make all the deaths meaningless.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Meaningless! Yes! It is what I have been saying all along! It’s all meaningless! And I am proving it! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was standing before her now, his eyes level with her own. ‘Korlat—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shriek shattered his next words. Sandalath recoiled, and only then realized that the cry had been torn from her own throat. ‘ Not yet! Where is Orfantal? Where is my beloved son? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw something in his face then, an anguish he could not hide. She had never known him to be so … weak. So pathetically unguarded. She sneered. ‘Kneel, Anomander, Son of Darkness. Kneel before this Hostage .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he lowered himself to one knee, a sudden laugh burst from her. Disbelief. Shock. Delight. ‘I proclaim my beloved son Knight of Darkness – you, I cast out! You’re kneeling! Now,’ and she leaned forward, ‘ grovel .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Release Silanah, Highness, or there can be no Knight of Darkness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why not?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-289.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
