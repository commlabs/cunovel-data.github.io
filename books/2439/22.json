I stiffened in anticipation of the cut. I wanted to scream, but the blade stopped me. This is it, I thought. This is the end. What a lousy, useless way to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the vampaneze was only teasing me. He slowly removed the knife and laughed nastily. He had all the time in the world. There was no reason for him to rush. He wanted to play with us awhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have come,\" Evra muttered. \"It was stupid.\" He paused. \"But thanks anyway,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you have left me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, but I knew he was lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" I told him. \"We\u0027ll still figure a way out of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" A way out?\" Murlough boomed. \"Don\u0027t talk rubbish. How are you going to escape? Chew through the ropes? You could if you could reach them with your teeth, but you can\u0027t. Snap them with your super vampire strength? No good. They\u0027re too strong. I tested them myself in advance, hmmm?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Face it, Darren Shan - you\u0027re doomed! Nobody\u0027s going to ride to the rescue. Nobody can find you down here. I\u0027m going to take my time, cut you up into itty-bitty pieces, drop you all over the city - like confetti - and there isn\u0027t a thing you can do about it, so wise up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At least let Evra go,\" I begged. \"You\u0027ve got me. You don\u0027t need him. Think how horrible it\u0027d be for him if you let him go: he\u0027d have to live with the knowledge that I\u0027d died in his place. That would be a horrible burden. It would be even worse than killing him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" Murlough grunted. \"But I\u0027m a simple man. I like simple pleasures. It\u0027s a nice idea, but I\u0027d rather slice him up slowly and painfully, if it\u0027s all the same to you. Fewer complications.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please.\" I sobbed. \"Let him go. I\u0027ll do anything you want. I... I... I\u0027ll give you Mr. Crepsley!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurlough laughed. \"No go. You had the chance to do that earlier. You blew it. Besides, you couldn\u0027t lead me to him now. He\u0027s bound to have changed hotels again. Might even have fled the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be something I can give you!\" I yelled desperately. \"There must be some way I can...\" I stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could practically hear Murlough\u0027s ears stiffening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" he asked, after several seconds of silence. \"What were you going to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute!\" I snapped. \"I have to think something through.\" I could feel Evra\u0027s eyes on me, half hopeful, half resigned to the fate he felt neither of us could escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry up,\" Murlough prompted me, coming around in front of me. His purple face didn\u0027t show up well in the dim light of the cavern, so his eyes and lips appeared to be three free-floating globs of red, while his discolored hair looked like a strange kind of bat. \"I haven\u0027t got all night,\" he said. \"Speak while you\u0027re able.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just thinking,\" I said quickly. \"You\u0027re going to have to leave town after this, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Leave?\" Murlough bellowed. \"Leave my beautiful tunnels? Never! I love it here. You know what being down here makes me feel like? As if I\u0027m inside the body of the city. These tunnels are like veins. This cavern is the heart, where the blood of the city flows in and out.\" He smiled, and for once it wasn\u0027t an evil expression. \"Can you imagine?\" he said softly. \"Living in a body, roaming the veins - the tunnels of blood - freely, as you please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nevertheless,\" I said bluntly, \"you will have to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s all this talk of leaving?\" he snapped, jabbing me with the knife. \"You\u0027re beginning to annoy me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just being practical,\" I said. \"You can\u0027t stay here. Mr. Crepsley knows where you are. He\u0027ll return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That coward? I doubt it. He\u0027ll be too -?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll return with help,\" I interrupted. \"With other vampires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurlough laughed. \"The Vampire Generals, do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense! They can\u0027t come after me. There\u0027s an agreement between them and us. They don\u0027t interfere. Crepsley isn\u0027t a General, is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"He\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are!\" Murlough yelled triumphantly. \"He couldn\u0027t have come after me if he was. Rules and laws and ways of living. They mean as much to the vampires as they do to the vampaneze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the same, the Generals will come,\" I insisted quietly. \"They couldn\u0027t before, but now they can. Maybe tonight. Tomorrow for sure. Maybe this is what Mr. Crepsley planned for all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you blabbering about?\" Murlough looked uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said something interesting a while ago,\" I said. \"You were surprised Mr. Crepsley came down here with me. I didn\u0027t think anything of it at the time, but now that I\u0027ve thought about it, I agree: it was weird of him. I thought it was because he wanted to help me find Evra, but now...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" What?\" Murlough screeched when I didn\u0027t go on. \"Say what you\u0027re thinking. Out with it, or...\" He raised the knives threateningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pact between the vampires and vampaneze,\" I said quickly. \"It says one side can\u0027t interfere with the other, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Murlough agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Unlessit\u0027s to defend or avenge themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurlough nodded. \"This is so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled weakly. \"Don\u0027t you see? I\u0027m a half-vampire. If you kill me, the Generals will have an excuse to come after you. Mr. Crepsley must have planned this all along.\" I took a deep breath and looked Murlough straight in the eye. \"He let you find me. He wanted you to grab me. He meant for you to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurlough\u0027s eyes widened. \"No,\" he wheezed. \"He wouldn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a vampire,\" I said. \"Of course he would. This is his city. I\u0027m just his assistant. Which would you choose to sacrifice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... but...\" the vampaneze scratched his face nervously. \"I didn\u0027t make the first move!\" he shouted. \" You came after me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Mr. Crepsley came after you. I\u0027m innocent. I pose no threat. If you kill me, you\u0027ll be held accountable. The Generals will descend on you, and no vampaneze will step in to defend you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurlough let my words sink in, in silence, then he started jumping up and down on the spot, swearing furiously. I let him rage for a while, then I said, \"It\u0027s not too late. Let me go. Let Evra go, too. Run away from the city. They can\u0027t touch you then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I love these tunnels.\" Murlough groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love them enough to die for them?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. \"You\u0027re very smart, aren\u0027t you?\" he snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" I said. \"I wouldn\u0027t have come down here if I was. But I am able to see the truth when it\u0027s staring me in the face. Kill me, Murlough, and you sign your own death warrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders sagged, and I knew I was safe. Now there was only Evra to worry about...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Snakey,\" Murlough said menacingly. \"He isn\u0027t a vampire. There\u0027s nothing to stop me killing him, hmmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I shouted. \"If you harm Evra, I\u0027ll go to the Generals myself and tell them -?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell them what?\" Murlough interrupted. \"Do you think they\u0027d care? Do you think they\u0027d risk war for the sake of a reptile?\" He laughed. \"Young Murlough\u0027s in a killing mood. I might not be able to have the little half-vampire, but I won\u0027t be cheated out of Snakey, too. Watch, Darren Shan. Watch as I carve the snake-boy a new mouth - in his stomach!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed the ropes around Evra and tugged him forward with his left hand. With his right, he positioned one of the knives and prepared to make the first cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" I screamed. \"Don\u0027t do it! Don\u0027t do it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why shouldn\u0027t I?\" Murlough sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll swap places!\" I yelled. \"Me for Evra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No good,\" Murlough said. \"You\u0027re a half-vampire. No deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you somebody else! Somebody even better!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Murlough laughed. \"Who could you give me, Darren Shan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you...\" I gulped deeply, shut my eyes, and whispered the terrible words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" Murlough asked, pausing suspiciously. \"Speak up. I didn\u0027t hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said...\" I licked my lips and forced the words out again, louder this time. \"I said I\u0027ll give you my girlfriend. If you spare Evra, I\u0027ll give you...
