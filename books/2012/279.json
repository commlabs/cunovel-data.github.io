He and Kilava were locked together, claws raking each other’s flanks down to the bone, when something like a hurricane wind slammed them down on to the unyielding ground. Pulverized rock billowed out, filling the chamber even as enormous cracks opened on the rough walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned by the thunderous concussion, Gruntle pulled away from Kilava. Yet the rage would not leave him, and he felt his god howling somewhere deep inside his chest – a creature held back for too long by Kilava’s denial – and now it clawed its way free. She could no longer resist him, could no longer find the strength to defy what was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI warned you .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon filled the chamber, impossibly huge, wings hammering at the walls. Gruntle understood, then, that the creature was trapped – by the ancient, heavy stone of the cavern walls. It needed to unleash its sorcery – to shatter these confines, to open the way for the hundreds of other dragons crowding the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must strike now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roar that tore out from his throat was Trake’s own, a god’s call to war. The power within him becoming a thing of agony, Gruntle’s limbs coiled, lowering him into a crouch, and then he leapt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon’s neck arched, the head snapped down, jaws opening wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed into the creature’s neck. Claws sinking deep, his fangs burying themselves in the dragon’s throat. Scales broke as Gruntle’s jaws tightened, closing on the windpipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon reared in shock, and with the convulsive motion blood poured into Gruntle’s mouth. As he clung to the creature’s writhing neck, his weight began to pull the dragon down. Wings cracked on the stone floor. Talons gouged wounds in the rock and then scraped frantically. The impact when the dragon struck the ground almost tore Gruntle loose, but he managed to hold on, the muscles of his shoulders, neck and jaws bunching until they creaked. He could hear the desperate wheezing of breath, and tightened his death grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon reared a second time, lifting Gruntle into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Kilava struck him with all the force of a battering ram. The dragon’s throat was ripped wide open in a torrent of gore, but Gruntle was falling, Kilava’s own fangs scoring deep across his shoulder blades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pounded against the stone floor, burst apart, Gruntle scrabbling to find his footing, twisting to find Kilava – to kill her once and for all—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dying dragon was not yet done. Its jaws slammed down on Gruntle. Fangs long as scimitars impaled him. He was lifted from the ground, and then flung through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBones exploded inside his mangled flesh when he struck the wall. Leaving a glittering crimson streak, he slid down the stone to slump gasping, too broken to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon staggered, head swinging round, eyes blazing as they fixed on him. Jaws opened, and sorcery roiled out in a torrent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGruntle heard Trake’s death cry, and that howl itself seemed to catch fire in the conflagration of draconic magic. It raged around him, tore deep into his ruined body. And all at once his god left him, stumbling away, away from this realm. A trail, another cave, a place of darkness, a place to lie down and die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain. You damned fool. You never learn. And now … now it’s too late .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon careened against the far wall, sank down, spilling out the last of itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut above it, in that tearing wound, another was clawing its way through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cavern simply disintegrated as Eleint sorcery annihilated the last barriers surrounding Starvald Demelain. Beyond, the deep snows erupted in clouds of scalding steam. The ground itself was torn away, leaving nothing but swirling chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn clouds of spinning dust and pelting rubble, in the wild fires of chaotic magic, the dragons returned to the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my dreams, a blackened cat, a thing lying bleeding, gasping, dying. Blackened. In my dreams, I saw not her, but myself .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Kilava, you did warn me. And I did not listen .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when I warned Trake, Tiger of Summer and god of war , he did not listen. You fool. You needed wisdom in the one you chose, Trake. Not just another damned version of you. With all the same, useless, deadly flaws .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that time, stretching away behind me now. Solid as stone, every shape, every rise and every dip, worn away in these winds of dying. Stonny, see what I have done? Or failed to do. You were right to refuse me. I always thought bigger than I could deliver. I always wanted what I could not hold .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I saw it in your eyes – the day I stood before you, when I promised that I would come back. I saw in your eyes you knew I wouldn’t. You knew you would never see me again. Ah, my love, so many truths, come too late . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-279.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
