What good was a higher power, after all, if he wouldn\u0027t help you cook your ramen noodles? Molly stood over the stove, naked, except for a wide sash from which was slung the scabbard for her broadsword at the center of her back, giving the impression that she had won honors in the Miss Nude Random Violence Pageant. Her skin was slick with sweat, not because she\u0027d been working out, but because she\u0027d chopped up the coffee table with her broken broadsword and burned it, along with two chairs from the dining-room set, in the fireplace. The cabin was sweltering. The power hadn\u0027t gone out yet, but it would soon, and the Warrior Babe of the Outland dropped into survival mode a little sooner than most people. It was in her job description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Christmas Eve,\" said the Narrator. \"Shouldn\u0027t we eat something more festive? Eggnog? How about sugar cookies in the shape of Nigoth? Do you have purple sprinkles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll get nothing and like it! You are but a soulless ghost that vexes me and stirs in my mind like spiders. When my check arrives on the fifth, you shall be banished to the abyss forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just saying, hacking up the coffee table? Screaming at the soup? I think you could channel your energies in a more positive way. Something in the holiday spirit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a momentary flash of Molly, the Warrior Babe realized that there was a line she could cross, when the Narrator actually became the voice of reason, as opposed to a niggling voice trying to get her to act out. She turned the burner down to medium and went to the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled a stool over to the closet and climbed up on it so she could reach to the back shelf. The problem with marrying a guy who was six foot six, is you often find yourself scaling the counters to get to stuff that he placed there for convenience. That, and you needed a riding steam iron in order to press one of his shirts. Not that she did that very often, but if you try to get a crease straight in a forty-inch sleeve once, you\u0027re as likely as not to give up ironing altogether. She was nuts already, she didn\u0027t need help from trying to perform frustrating tasks\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter feeling around on the top shelf, brushing over the spare holster for Theo\u0027s Glock, her hand closed on a velvet-wrapped bundle. She climbed down from the stool and took the long bundle to the couch, where she sat down and slowly unwrapped it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scabbard was made of wood. Somehow it had been laminated with layers of black silk, so that it appeared to drink the light out of the room. The handle was wrapped in black silk cord and there was a cast bronze hand guard with a filigreed dragon design. The ivory head of a dragon protruded from the pommel. When she pulled the sword from the scabbard, her breath caught in her throat. She knew immediately that it was real, it was ancient, and it had to have been exorbitantly expensive. It was the finest blade she had ever seen in person, and a tashi, not a katana. Theo knew she would want the longer, heavier sword for working out, that she would spend hours training with this valuable antique, not lock it in a glass case to be looked at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears welled up in her eyes and the blade turned to a silver blur in her vision. He had risked his freedom and his pride to buy her this, to acknowledge that part of her that everyone else seemed to want to get rid of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your soup is boiling over,\" said the Narrator, \"you sentimental sissy-girl \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was. She could hear the hiss of the water hitting the hot burner. Molly leaped to her feet and looked around for a place to set the sword. The coffee table had long since gone to ash in the fireplace. She looked to the bookshelf under the front window, and in that second there was a deafening snap as the trunk of a big pine gave way outside, followed by lighter crackles and snaps as it took out branches and smaller trees on the way to the ground. Sparks lit up the night outside, and the lights went out as the entire cabin shook with the impact of the tree hitting in the front yard. Molly could see the downed power lines out by the road arcing orange and blue through the night. Silhouetted in the window was a tall dark figure, standing there,just looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough a lot of single people attended, the Lonesome Christmas party was never supposed to have been a pickup scene, an extension of the holiday musical chairs that went on at the Head of the Slug. People did occasionally meet there, become lovers, mates, but that wasn\u0027t the purpose. Originally it was just a get-together for people who had no family or friends in the area with whom to spend Christmas, and who didn\u0027t want to spend it alone, or in an alcohol-induced coma, or both. Over the years it had become somewhat more\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;an anticipated event that people actually chose to attend instead of more traditional gatherings with friends and family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine a more heinous horror show than spending the holidays with my family,\" said Tucker Case as Theo rejoined the group. \"How about you, Theo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another guy standing with Tuck and Gabe, a balding blond guy who looked like an athlete gone to fat, wearing a red Star Fleet Command shirt and dress slacks. Theo recognized him as Joshua Barker\u0027s stepfather/mom\u0027s boyfriend/whatever, Brian Henderson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brian,\" Theo said, remembering the guy\u0027s name at the last second and offering his hand. \"How are you? Are Emily and Josh here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, yeah, but not with me,\" Brian said. \"We sort of had a falling-out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker Case stepped in. \"He told the kid that there was no Santa Claus and that Christmas was just a brilliant scheme cooked up by retailers to sell more stuff. What else was it? Oh yeah, that Saint Nicholas was originally famous because he brought back to life some children who\u0027d been dismembered and stuffed into a pickle jar. The kid\u0027s mom threw him out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sorry,\" Theo said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian nodded. \"We hadn\u0027t been getting along that well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He sort of fits right in with us,\" Gabe said. \"Check out the cool shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian shrugged, a little embarrassed. \"It\u0027s red. I thought it would be Christmasy. Now I feel\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha,\" Gabe interrupted. \"Don\u0027t worry about it. The guys in the red shirts never make it to the second commercial break.\" He punched Brian gently in the arm in a gesture of nerd solidarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m going to run out to the car and grab another shirt,\" said Brian. \"I feel silly. I have all my clothes in the Jetta. Everything I own, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Brian walked toward the door, Theo suddenly remembered. \"Oh, Gabe, I forgot. Skinner got out of the car. He\u0027s rolling in something foul out there in the mud. Maybe you should go with Brian and see if you can get him back in the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a water dog. He\u0027ll be fine. He can stay out until the party is over. Maybe he\u0027ll jump up on Val with muddy paws. Oh, I hope, I hope, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, that\u0027s kinda bitter,\" Tuck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because I\u0027m a bitter little man,\" Gabe said. \"In my spare time, I mean. Not all the time. My work keeps me pretty busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian had skulked away in his Star Trek shirt. As he opened one side of the double doors, the wind caught the door and whipped it back against the outside church wall with a gunshot report. Everyone turned to watch the big man shrug sheepishly, and Skinner, muddy and wet to the core, came trotting in, carrying something in his jaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, he\u0027s really tracking in a mess,\" Tuck said. \"I never realized the perks of having a flying mammal as a pet before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that he\u0027s carrying in his mouth?\" asked Theo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably a pinecone,\" Gabe said without looking. Then he looked \"Or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a scream, a long protracted one, that started with Valerie Riordan and sort of passed through all the women near the buffet. Skinner had presented his prize to Val, dropped it on her foot, in fact, thinking that because she was standing near food, and she was still the Food Guy\u0027s female (for who could think of food without thinking of the Food Guy?), she would, therefore, appreciate it, and perhaps reward him. She didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grab him!\" Gabe yelled to Val, who looked up at him with the most articulate glare he had ever seen. Perhaps it was the weight of her M D. that gave it eloquence, but without a word, it said: You have got to be out of your fucking mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or not,\" Gabe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo crossed the room and made a grab for Skinner\u0027s collar, but at the last second the Lab grabbed the arm, threw a head fake, then ducked out of Theo\u0027s reach. The three men started to give chase, and Skinner frisked back and forth across the pine floor, his head high and proud as a Lippizaner stallion, pausing occasionally to shake a spray of mud onto the horrified onlookers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me it\u0027s not moving,\" shouted Tuck, trying to cut Skinner off at the buffet table. \"That hand is not moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just the kinetic energy of the dog moving through the arm,\" said Gabe, having gone into a sort of wrestling stance. He was used to catching animals in the wild and knew that you had to be nimble and keep your center of gravity low and use a lot of profanity. \"Goddammit, Skinner, come here. Bad dog, bad dog!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, there it was. Tragedy. A thousand trips to the vet, a grass-eating nausea, a flea you will never, ever reach. Bad dog. For the love of Dog! He was a bad dog. Skinner dropped his prize and assumed the tail-tucked posture of absolute humility, shame, remorse, and overt sadness He whimpered and ventured a look at the Food Guy, a sideways glance, pained but ready, should another BD come his way. But the Food Guy wasn\u0027t even looking at him. No one was even looking at him. Everything was fine. He was good. Were those sausages he smelled over by that table? Sausages are good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That thing is moving,\" Tuck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not. Oh, yes it is,\" said Gabe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another series of screams, this time a couple of man-screams among the women and children. The hand was trying to crawl away, dragging the arm along behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How fresh does that have to be to do that?\" Tuck asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not fresh,\" said Joshua Barker, one of the few kids in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Josh,\" said Theo Crowe. \"I didn\u0027t see you come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were out in your car hitting a bong when we got here,\" Josh said cheerfully. \"Merry Christmas, Constable Crowe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Kay,\" Theo said. Thinking fast, or what seemed like it was fast, Theo took off his Gore-Tex cop coat and threw it over the twitching arm. \"Folks, it\u0027s okay. I have a little confession to make. I should have told you all before, but I couldn\u0027t believe my own observations. It\u0027s time I was honest with you all.\" Theo had gotten very good at telling embarrassing things about himself at Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and confession seemed to be coming even easier since he was a little baked. \"A few days ago I ran into a man, or what I thought was a man, but was actually some kind of indestructible cybernetic robot. I hit him doing about fifty in my Volvo, and he didn\u0027t even seem to notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Terminator?\" asked Mavis Sand. \"I\u0027d fuck him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ask me how he got here, or what he really is. I think we\u0027ve all learned over the years that the sooner we accept the simple explanation for the unexplained, the better chance we have of surviving a crisis. Anyway, I think that this arm may be part of that machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit!\" came a shout from outside the front doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then the doors flew open, the wind whipped into the room carrying with it a horrid stench. Standing there, framed in the cathedral doorway, stood Santa Claus, holding Brian Henderson in his red Star Trek shirt, by the throat. A group of dark figures were moving behind them, moaning something about IKEA, as Santa pressed a .38 snub-nose revolver to Brian\u0027s temple and pulled the trigger. Blood splattered across the front wall and Santa threw the body back to Marty in the Morning, who began to suck the brains out of dead Brian\u0027s exit wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry Christmas, you doomed sons a\u0027 bitches!\" said Santa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that sucked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE KNOWS IF YOU\u0027VE BEEN BAD OR GOOD...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she was horrified by what was going on in the doorway of the chapel, with the gunfire and brain-sucking and the threats, Lena Marquez couldn\u0027t help but think: Oh, this is so awkward\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;both my exes are here. Dale was standing there in a Santa suit, mud and gore dripping onto the floor while he roared with anger, and Tucker Case had immediately headed to the back of the room and dived under one of the folding buffet tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was screaming and a lot of running, but mostly people stood there, paralyzed by the shock. And Tucker Case, of course, was acting the consummate coward. She was so ashamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, bitch!\" dead Dale Pearson shouted, pointing at her with the snub-nose .38. \"You\u0027re lunch!\" He started across the open pine floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look out, Lena,\" came a shout from behind her. She turned just in time to sidestep as the buffet table behind her rose, spilling chafing dishes full of lasagna onto the floor. The alcohol burners beneath the pans spilled blue flame across the tabletops and onto the floor as Tucker Case stood up with the table in front of him and let out a war cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo Crowe saw what was happening and pulled an armload of people aside as Tuck barreled through the room, the tabletop in front of him, toward the throng of undead. Dale Pearson fired at the tabletop as it approached, getting off three shots before Tuck impacted with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crowe, get the door, get the door,\" Tuck shouted, driving Dale and his undead followers back out into the rain. The blue alcohol flame climbed up Dale\u0027s white beard, as well as spilling down Tuck\u0027s legs as he pushed out into the darkness. Theo loped across the room and reached outside to catch the edge of the door. A one-armed corpse in a leather jacket ducked around the edge of Tuck\u0027s buffet-table barrier and grabbed at Theo, who put a foot on the corpse\u0027s chest and drove him back down the steps. Theo pulled the door shut, then reached around and grabbed the other one. He hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close the damned door!\" Tuck screamed, his legs pumping, losing momentum against the undead as he reached the bottom of the steps. Theo could see decayed hands clawing at Tuck over the edge of the table; a man whose lower jaw flapped on a slip of skin was screeching at the pilot and trying to drive his upper teeth into Tuck\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing Theo saw as he pulled the door shut was Tucker Case\u0027s legs burning blue and steaming in the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring one of those tables over here,\" Theo shouted. \"Brace this door. Jam the table under the handles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a second of peace, just the sound of the wind and rain and Emily Barker, who had just seen her ex-boyfriend shot and brain-sucked, sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that?\" shouted Ignacio Nu\u0026amp;ntilde;ez, a rotund Hispanic who owned the village nursery. \"What in the hell was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena Marquez had instinctively gone to Emily Barker, and knelt with her arm around the bereft woman. She looked to Theo. \"Tucker is out there. He\u0027s out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo Crowe realized that everyone was looking at him. He was having trouble catching his breath and he could feel his pulse pounding in his ears. He really wanted to look to someone else for the answers, but as he scanned the room\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;some forty terrified faces\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;he saw all the responsibility reflected back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh fuck,\" he said, his hand falling to his hip where his holster was usually clipped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s on the table at my house,\" Gabe Fenton said. Gabe was holding the buffet table that was braced sideways under the double latches of the church doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pull the table,\" Theo said, thinking, I don\u0027t even like the guy. He helped Gabe pull the table aside and crouched in a sprinter\u0027s stance, ready to go, as Gabe manned the latches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close it behind me. When you hear me scream, \u0027Let me in, well\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then there was a crash behind them and something came flying through one of the high, stained-glass windows\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;throwing glass out into the middle of the room. Tucker Case, wet, charred, and covered with blood, pushed himself up from the floor where he had landed and said, \"I don\u0027t know who parked under that window, but you\u0027d better move your car, because if those things climb on it, they\u0027ll be coming through that window behind me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo looked at the line of stained-glass windows running down the sides of the chapel, eight on each side, each about eight feet off the ground and about two feet across. When the chapel had been built, stained glass was at a premium and the community poor, thus the small, high windows, which were going to be an asset in defending this place. There was only one large window in the whole building\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;behind where the altar used to stand, but where now stood Molly\u0027s thirty-foot Christmas tree\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a six-by-ten-foot large cathedral-shaped stained-glass depiction of Saint Rose, patron saint of interior decorators, presenting a throw pillow to the Blessed Virgin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nacho,\" Theo barked to Ignacio Nu\u0026amp;ntilde;ez, \"see if you can find something in the basement to board up that window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, two muddy, decaying faces appeared at the opening through which Tuck had just dived, moaning and trying to get purchase on the windowsill with their skeletal hands to climb in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shoot them!\" Tuck screamed from the floor. \"Shoot those fucking things, Theo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo shrugged, shook his head. No gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flashed by Theo and he spun to see Gabe Fenton running hell-bent-for-leather at the window, holding before him a long stainless-steel pan full of lasagna, evidently intent upon diving through the window in a pastafarian act of self-sacrifice. Theo caught the biologist by the collar, stopping him like a running dog at the end of his leash. His arms and legs flew out before him and he managed to hang on to the pan, but nearly eight pounds of steaming cheesy goodness sailed on through the window, scorching the attackers and Pollocking the wall around the window with red sauce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, throw snacks at them, that\u0027ll slow them up,\" shouted Tuck. \"Fire a salvo of garlic bread next!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe regained his feet and jumped right up in Theo\u0027s face, or he would have if he had been a foot or so taller. \"I was trying to save us,\" he said sternly to Theo\u0027s sternum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Theo could answer, Ignacio Nunez and Ben Miller, a tall, ex-track star in his early thirties, called for them to clear the way. The two men were coming to the broken window with another of the buffet tables. Gabe and Theo helped Ben hold the table against the wall while Nacho nailed the table to the wall. \"I found some tools in the basement,\" Nacho said between hammer blows. Animated dead fingernails clawed at the tabletop as they worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate cheese!\" screamed the corpse, who had enough equipment to still scream. \"It binds me up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the undead mob began pounding on the walls around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to think,\" Theo said. \"I just need a second to think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena was dressing Tucker Case\u0027s wounds with gauze and antibiotic ointment from the chapel\u0027s first-aid kit. The burns on his legs and torso were superficial, most of the alcohol fire having been put out by the rain before it could penetrate his clothing, and while his leather bomber jacket had protected him somewhat from his dive through the window, there was a deep cut on his forehead and another on his thigh. One of the bullets that Dale had fired through the table had grazed Tuck\u0027s ribs, leaving a gash four inches long and a half inch wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was the bravest thing I\u0027ve ever seen,\" Lena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I\u0027m a pilot,\" said Tuck, like he did this sort of thing every day. \"I couldn\u0027t let them hurt you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" Lena said, pausing for a moment to look into his eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry I was\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;you were\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- \u0026amp;raquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, you probably couldn\u0027t tell, but that thing with the table? Just a really badly executed escape attempt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuck winced as she fastened the bandage over his ribs with some tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to need stitches,\" Lena said. \"Any place I missed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuck held up his right hand\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;there were tooth marks on the back of it welling up with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my God!\" Lena said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to have to cut his head off,\" said Joshua Barker, who was standing by watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose?\" Tuck said. \"The guy in the Santa suit, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I mean your head,\" said Josh. \"They\u0027re going to have to cut off your head or you\u0027ll turn into one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost everyone in the chapel had stopped what they were doing and gathered around Tuck and Lena, seemingly grateful for a point of focus. The pounding on the walls had ceased, and with the exception of the occasional rattling of the door handles, there was only the sound of the wind and rain. The Lonesome Christmas crowd was stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away, kid,\" said Tuck. \"This is no time to be a kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should we use?\" asked Mavis Sand. \"This okay, kid?\" She held a serrated knife that they\u0027d been using to cut garlic bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not acceptable,\" Tuck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you don\u0027t cut his head off,\" said Joshua, \"he\u0027ll turn into one of them and let them in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What an imagination this kid has,\" said Tuck, flashing a grin from face to face, looking for an ally. \"It\u0027s Christmas! Ah, Christmas, the time when all good people go about not decapitating each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo Crowe came out of the back room, where he\u0027d been looking for something they could use as a weapon. \"Phone lines are down. We\u0027ll lose power any minute. Is anyone\u0027s cell phone working?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one answered. They were all looking at Tuck and Lena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to cut off his head, Theo,\" Mavis said, holding out the bread knife, handle first. \"Since you\u0027re the law, I think you should do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no, no, no, no,\" said Tuck. \"And furthermore, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Lena, in support of her man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys have something you want to tell me?\" Theo said. He took the bread knife from Mavis and shoved it down the back of his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you were onto something with that killer-robot thing,\" Tuck said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLena stood up and put herself between Theo and Tuck. \"It was an accident, Theo. I was digging Christmas trees like I do every year and Dale came by drunk and angry. I\u0027m not sure how it happened. One minute he was going to shoot me and the next the shovel was sticking out of his neck. Tucker didn\u0027t have anything to do with it. He just happened along and was trying to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo looked at Tuck. \"So you buried him with his gun?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuck climbed painfully to his feet and stood behind Lena. \"I was supposed to see this coming? I was supposed to anticipate that he might come back from the grave all angry and brain hungry, so I should hide his gun from him? This is your town, Constable, you explain it. Usually when you bury a body they don\u0027t come back and try to eat your brains the next day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brains! Brains! Brains!\" chanted the undead from outside the chapel. The pounding on the walls started again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" screamed Tucker Case, and to everyone\u0027s amazement, they did. Tuck grinned at Theo. \"So, I fucked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ya think?\" Theo said. \"How many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should cut his head off over the sink,\" said Joshua Barker. \"That way it won\u0027t make as big a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a word, Theo reached down and picked Josh up by the biceps, then walked over and handed him to his mother, who looked as if she were going into the first stages of shock. Theo touched his finger to Josh\u0027s lips in a shush gesture. Theo looked more serious, more intimidating, more in control than anyone had ever seen him. The boy hid his face in his mother\u0027s breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo turned to Tuck. \"How many?\" Theo repeated. \"I saw maybe thirty, forty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About that,\" Tuck said. \"They\u0027re in different states of decay. Some of them just look like there\u0027s little more than bone, others look relatively fresh, and pretty well preserved. None of them seems particularly fast or strong. Dale maybe, some of the fresher ones. It\u0027s like they\u0027re learning to walk again or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a loud snap from outside and everyone jumped\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;one woman literally leaping into a man\u0027s arms with a shriek. They all fell into a crouch, listening to a tree falling through branches, expecting the trunk to come crashing through the ceiling beams. The lights went out and the whole church shook with the impact of the big pine hitting the forest floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout missing a beat, Theo snapped on a flashlight he\u0027d had in his back pocket in anticipation of a power outage. Small emergency lamps ignited above the front door, casting everyone in a deep-shadowed directional light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those should last about an hour,\" Theo said. \"There should be some flashlights in the basement, too. Go on. What else did you see, Tuck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they\u0027re pissed off and they\u0027re hungry. I was kind of busy trying not to get my brains eaten. They seemed pretty adamant about the brain-eating thing. Then they\u0027re going to IKEA, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is ridiculous,\" said Val Riordan, the elegantly coiffed psychiatrist, speaking up for the first time since the whole thing had started. \"There\u0027s no such thing as a zombie. I don\u0027t know what you think is happening here, but you don\u0027t have a crowd of brain-eating zombies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have to agree with Val,\" Gabe Fenton said, stepping up beside her. \"There\u0027s no scientific basis for zombieism\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;except for some experiments in the Caribbean with blowfish toxins that put people in a state of near death with almost imperceptible respiration and pulse, but there was no actual, you know, raising of the dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" said Theo, giving them an eloquent deadpan stare. \"Brains!\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brains! Brains! Brains!\" came the responding chant from outside; the pounding on the walls resumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Tuck shouted. The dead did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo looked at Val and Gabe and raised an eyebrow. Well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Gabe said. \"We may need more data.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this can\u0027t be happening,\" said Valerie Riordan. \"This is impossible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Val,\" Theo said. \"We know what\u0027s happening here. We don\u0027t know why, and we don\u0027t know how, but we haven\u0027t lived in a vacuum all our lives, have we? In this case, denial ain\u0027t just a river in Egypt, denial will kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then a brick came crashing through one of the windows and thumped into the middle of the chapel floor. Two clawlike hands caught the window ledge and a beat-up male face appeared at the window. The zombie pulled up enough so that he could hook one elbow inside the window, then shouted: \"Val Riordan went down on the pimply kid who bags groceries at the Thrifty-Mart!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second later, Ben Miller picked up the brick and hurled it back through the window, taking out the zombie face with a sickening squish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Ben and Theo lifted the last of the buffet tables into place to be nailed over the window, Gabe Fenton stepped away from Valerie Riordan and looked at her like she\u0027d been dipped in radioactive marmot spittle. \"You said you were allergic!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were almost broken up at the time,\" said Val.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost! Almost! I have third-degree electrical burns on my scrotum because of you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the room, into Lena Marquez\u0027s ear, Tucker Case whispered, \"I don\u0027t feel so bad about hiding the body now, how \u0027bout you?\" She turned and kissed him hard enough to make him forget for a second that he\u0027d just been shot, set on fire, beaten up, and bitten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor years the dead had listened, and the dead knew. They knew who was cheating with whom, who was stealing what, and where the bodies were hidden, as it were. Besides the passive listening\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;those sneaking out for a smoke, sideline conversations at funerals, the walking and talking in the woods, and the sex and scare-yourself activities some of the living indulged in in the graveyard\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;there were also those among the living who used a tombstone as some sort of confessional, sharing their deepest secrets with someone who they thought could never talk, saying things they could never say in life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some things that people thought no one else, the living or the dead, could possibly know, but they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabe Fenton watches squirrel porn!\" screeched Bess Leander, her dead cheek pressed against the wet clapboard siding of the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not porn, that\u0027s my work,\" Gabe explained to his fellow partyers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t wear pants! Squirrels, doing it, in slow motion. Pantsless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just that one time. Besides, you have to watch in slow motion,\" Gabe said. \"They\u0027re squirrels.\" Everyone turned their flashlights on something else, like they really weren\u0027t looking at Gabe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ignacio Nu\u0026amp;ntilde;ez voted for Carter,\" came a call from outside. The staunch Republican nursery owner was caught like a deer in the flashlights as everyone looked at him. \"I was only in this country a year. I\u0027d just become a citizen. I didn\u0027t even speak English very well. He said he wanted to help the poor. I was poor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheo Crowe reached over and patted Nacho\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben Miller used steroids in high school. His gonads are the size of BBs!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is not true,\" exclaimed the track star. \"My testicles are perfectly normal size.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, if you were seven inches tall,\" said Marty in the Morning, all dead, all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen turned to Theo. \"We\u0027ve got to do something about this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others in the room were looking from one to the other, each with a look on his or her face that was much more horrified than when they\u0027d been only facing the prospect of an undead mob eating their brains. These zombies had secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Theo Crowe\u0027s wife thinks she\u0027s some kind of warrior mutant killer!\" shouted a rotted woman who had once been a psych nurse at the county hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverybody in the chapel sort of looked at one another and nodded, shrugged, let out a sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We knew that,\" yelled Mavis. \"Everybody knows that. That\u0027s not news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sorry,\" said the dead nurse. There was a pause; then, \"Okay, then. Wally Beerbinder is addicted to painkillers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wally\u0027s not here,\" said Mavis. \"He\u0027s spending Christmas with his daughter in L.A.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got nothing,\" said the nurse. \"Someone else go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tucker Case thinks his bat can talk,\" shouted Arthur Tannbeau, the dead citrus farmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who wants to sing Christmas carols?\" said Tuck. \"I\u0027ll start. \u0027Deck the halls...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so they sang, loud enough to drown out the secrets of the undead. They sang with great Christmas spirit, loud and off-key, until the battering ram hit the front doors. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stupidest-angel-pine-cove-3/page-13.html","bookId":1562,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:37:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:37:37 PM"}
