However, the golden light had already dimmed. After which, it was brought into the Ancestor Stone by Yan. Hence, Lin Dong could only stare at the Spatial Ancestral Symbol in his hand with a frown.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Lin Dong, what he said is correct. Currently, he has already been eroded by the demonic aura. Although the Ancestral Symbol was always protecting him, the Ancestral Symbols have their own rules. Therefore, trying to forcefully take control of them will only wound up hurting both parties.” Yan said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong hesitated for a moment. Although an Ancestral Symbol was an extraordinary object, Lin Dong already possessed two of them. As such, they were no longer as alluring as before. Moreover, this was something that belonged to Zhou Tong and he felt that it was somewhat inappropriate to take it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, being indecisive at this moment made him look like a hypocrite. Hence, he nodded and said, “I will keep the Spatial Ancestral Symbol for now.

He immediately nodded before he kept the Spatial Ancestral Symbol into his body. After which, his body moved and appeared in front of Ying Xuanzi before he said, “Relax, it’s still possible to save martial senior Zhou Tong.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eJoy finally rose on the faces of Ying Xuanzi’s group after they heard this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“What should we do now?” Little Marten leaned over and asked. Meanwhile, a cold glint was glimmering within his eyes when he stared at the three great heads of Yuan Gate.

Meanwhile, the insidious expression in his eyes grew even denser. After which, he glanced at the large number of experts from the Yuan Destruction Alliance before he nodded and said, “Even though you managed to rescue Zhou Tong, it doesn’t really matter. He has already served his purpose. Next… I will let all of you have a taste of the Devil Feast.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eBlack light suddenly surged from the eyes of the three great heads after Tian Yuanzi’s voice sounded.
