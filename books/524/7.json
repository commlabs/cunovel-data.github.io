She noticed that his arm, on which her hand lay, was very tense.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When they came to the group of cottages at the Forstal, a girl ran down the garden path and leaned against the fence. She was a pretty brown girl, and as they went by she smiled at Reuben. But he did not seem to see her, he walked steadily on, and she slunk[Pg 29] back to the house, biting her lips. \"Dudn\u0027t he see me, or wur he jest pretending not to?\" she muttered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At Odiam dinner was waiting. It was a generous meal, which combined the good things of this world with the right amount of funereal state. Several of the neighbours had been invited, and the housewife wished to do them honour, knowing that her table boasted luxuries not to be found at other farms—a bottle of French wine, for instance, which though nobody touched it, gave distinction to the prevalent ale, and one or two light puddings, appealing to the eye as well as to the palate. As soon as the meal was over and the guests had gone, Reuben took himself off, and did not reappear till supper-time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e During dinner he had been even more thoughtful than the occasion warranted, leaving his mother and Harry to talk to the company, though he had taken with a certain dignity his place as host and head of the house. Now at supper he was still inclined to silence. A servant girl laid the dishes on the table, then retired. Mrs. Backfield and Harry spoke in low tones to each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ... \"Mother, how much did this chocolate cost wot we\u0027re drinking?\" Reuben\u0027s voice made them both jump.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How much? why, two shillings a pound,\" said Mrs. Backfield, rather surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s too much.\" Reuben\u0027s brows and mouth were straight lines.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot d\u0027you mean, Reuben?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, two shillings is too much fur farm-folks lik us to give fur a pound of chocolate. It\u0027s naun but a treat, and we can do wudout it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But we\u0027ve bin drinking chocolate fur a dunnamany years now—your poor f?ather always liked it—and I d?an\u0027t see why we should stop it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look\u0027ee, mother, I\u0027ve something to tell you. I\u0027ve a plan in my head, and it\u0027ll justabout mean being shut of[Pg 30] a lot of things besides chocolate. I know f?ather dudn\u0027t care much about the farm, about m?aking it grow and buying more land, and all that. But I do. I mean to buy the whole of Boarzell.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a gasping silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The whole of Boarzell,\" repeated Reuben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He might have said the whole world, to judge by his mother\u0027s and Harry\u0027s faces.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes—I mean every bit, even the bit Grandturzel\u0027s got now. Squire he w?an\u0027t be sorry to sell it, and I mean to buy it piece by piece. I\u0027ll buy my first piece at the end of this year. We must start saving money at wunst. But I can\u0027t do naun wudout you help me, you two.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot d\u0027you want to go buying Boarzell fur?\" asked Mrs. Backfield in a bewildered voice; \"the farm\u0027s pr?aper as it is—we d?an\u0027t want it no bigger.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And Boarzell\u0027s wicked tedious stuff,\" put in Harry; \"naun\u0027ll grow there but gorse.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll have a good grain growing there in five year—d?an\u0027t you go doubting it. The ground wants working, that\u0027s all. And as fur not wanting the farm no bigger, that wur f?ather\u0027s idea—Odiam\u0027s mine now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why can\u0027t we jest go on being happy and comfortable, lik we wur before?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because I\u0027ve thought of something much grander, surelye. I\u0027m going to m?ake us all gurt people, and this a gurt farm. But you\u0027ve got to help me, you and Harry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot d\u0027you want us to do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, first of all, we must save all the money we can, and not go drinking chocolate and French wine, and eating sweet puddens and all such dentical stuff. And then, Harry and me, we\u0027re valiant chaps, and there never wur enough work for us to do. I\u0027m going to send Blackman away—Harry and I can do quite easily wudout him and save his wages.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Send away Blackman!—oh, Ben, he\u0027s bin with us fifteen year.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I d?an\u0027t care if he\u0027s bin a hunderd. There ?un\u0027t enough work for three men on this farm, and it\u0027s a shame to go wasting ten shilling a week. Oh, mother, can\u0027t you see how glorious it\u0027ll be? I know f?ather wanted different, but I\u0027ve bin thinking and dreaming of this fur years.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You always wur queer about Boarzell. But your f?ather \u0027ud turn in his grave to think of you sending off Blackman.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027ll easily git another pl?ace—I\u0027ll find him one myself. And, mother—there\u0027s something more. Now you haven\u0027t got f?ather to work fur, you\u0027ll find the time unaccountable long. Wot if you let Becky go, and did the cooking and that yourself?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Reuben....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You shouldn\u0027t ought to ask mother that,\" said Harry. \"She \u0027?un\u0027t used to work. It\u0027s well enough fur you and me, we\u0027re strong chaps, and there\u0027s no reason we shouldn\u0027t pull to a bit. But mother, she\u0027d never do wudout the girl—you see, there\u0027s the dairy and the fowls as well as the house.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We could help her out of doors.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lard!—you want some work!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben sprang to his feet. \"Yes—I do! You\u0027re justabout right there. I\u0027m starved fur work. I\u0027ve never really worked in my life, and now I want to work till I drop. Look at my arm\"—and he showed them his brown hairy arm, where the muscles swelled in lumps under the skin—\"that\u0027s a workman\u0027s arm, and it\u0027s never worked yet—pr?aperly. You let me send off Blackman and Becky, and see how we manage wudout \u0027em. I\u0027ll do most of the work myself, I promise you. I couldn\u0027t have too much.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re a queer lad, Reuben—and more masterful than your poor f?ather wur.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes—I\u0027m master here.\" He sat down, and looked round the table quite calmly. A vague uneasiness disturbed Mrs. Backfield and Harry. For some unfathomable reason they both felt a little afraid of Reuben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He finished his supper and went out of the kitchen. Harry and his mother sat for a moment or two in silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He always wur queer about Boarzell,\" said Mrs. Backfield at last; \"you remember that time years ago when he got mixed up wud the riot? I said to his f?ather then as I was sure Ben \u0027ud want to do something crazy wud the farm. But I never thought he\u0027d so soon be m?aster,\" and a tear trickled over her smooth cheek.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I d?an\u0027t see no harm in his buying a bit of Boarzell if it\u0027s going cheap—but it ?un\u0027t worth m?aking all ourselves uncomfortable for it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. Howsumdever, we can\u0027t stand ag?unst him—the pl?ace is his\u0027n, and he can do wot he likes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hush—listen!\" said Harry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sound of voices came from the passage outside the kitchen. Reuben was talking to the girl. A word or two reached them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Durn! if he ?un\u0027t getting shut of her!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I never said as I\u0027d do her work.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Harry sprang to his feet, but his mother laid her hand on his arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"D?an\u0027t you go vrothering him, lad. It\u0027ll only set him ag?unst you, and I d?an\u0027t care, not really; there\u0027ll be unaccountable liddle work to do in the house now your poor f?ather\u0027s gone, and Blackman w?an\u0027t be eating wud us. Besides, as he said, I\u0027ll find the days a bit slow wud naun to occupy me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But it\u0027s sass of him to go sending off the girl wudout your leave.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s m?aster here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ho! we shall see that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now you\u0027re not to go quarrelling wud him, Harry.[Pg 33] I\u0027d sooner have peace than anything whatsumdever.
