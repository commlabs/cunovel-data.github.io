{"id":15781,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"BACK and forth, among the pine-trees that had been witnesses of the happiest moments of his life; over the carpet of frozen pine-needles, every inch of which was holy ground to him, because her foot had trodden it in the past; through the intense cold and stillness; Elias marched, waiting for her to come. Harder than ever was the frost that bound and benumbed his senses; but in his heart, there was the heat of battle. Hope and doubt struggled together there, in mortal combat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At one instant, doubt getting the upper hand, he would cry: “Will she come? No, God help me, it is most unlikely. I may as well make up my mind to it. She will not come.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Next instant, hope inflaming him: “She will come. I know she will. She has a kind and tender heart. She can’t find it in her to refuse. She will come; and she will let me tell her how I love her, and how I have suffered; and she will soften toward me, and forgive me. And perhaps her love for me will come back—and overpower her—and make her forget every thing else—and then—she—perhaps—oh, merciful God! if—if she should consent!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus he alternated between hell and heaven.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If he had been enabled to penetrate but a very little way into the future, I suspect, his thoughts and his emotions would have been of a quite different order.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I must have been here at least an hour by this time,” he said. “It must be almost time for her to get here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With stiffened fingers he drew out his watch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Having looked at it: “Yes; she may get here any minute now.” Oh, how the prospect made his heart throb! “She may be not further than a few yards away.—Ah!—Hark! I—I hear a footstep. I swear, I hear a footstep. Is it she? It comes down the path in this direction. God—God grant that it is she. Nearer—nearer—nearer——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What was this? Bending forward, every muscle strained, every nerve on tension, to follow the footstep that he seemed to hear—suddenly his voice failed him, and expired in a low, guttural murmur; suddenly a dreadful spasm contracted all his features; his face flushed scarlet, then paled as white as marble; his arm flew up into the air, the fingers clutching at emptiness; foam flecked his lips; a groan burst from his throat; he tottered; he fell headlong to the earth; a brief, horrible convulsion, a protracted shudder; and he lay there, rigid, immobile, as if dead.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The footstep that he had heard passed on into silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The pine-trees that sheltered the rock, screened him from sight. This he had used to account one of the chief advantages of the spot. Was it an advantage now? Perhaps so; but he would be very bold indeed, who should dare to say yes for certain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The cold settled down upon him, and wrapped him in its stony embrace. The afternoon wore away. The daylight faded into twilight, the twilight into night. And still Elias lay there, alone with the deadly cold.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the Bacharach house, on Stuyvesant Square, the family were at dinner, with Elias for their topic. Where was he now, and what doing? they wondered. Enjoying himself, they hoped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By and by the moon came up, and wove a silvery garment about him. The next day’s sun came up, and bathed him in fire, and arrayed him in cloth-of-gold. The sun soared higher and higher. In the distance a church clock struck eleven. She was being married now, probably. Elias did not stir.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The wind veered around into the south-west, and the temperature grew tolerable again. Then some children ventured out, to play in the park. Up to the top of this rock they clambered. Next moment, in gleeful excitement, they were calling to their nurse, whom they had left below in the pathway: “Come, and look at the man asleep!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The New York papers on Thursday morning contained two announcements, divided from each other only by a thin black line, thus:\n\u003cbr\u003e MARRIED.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hosmer—Redwood.—In this city, on February 18th, by the Rev. Dr. Frederick Shepard, Robert Emory Hosmer to Christine Redwood.\n\u003cbr\u003e DIED.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bacharach.—In this city, on Tuesday, February 17th, suddenly, Elias, beloved husband of Matilda Morgenthau, and only son of the late Abraham Bacharach, M.
