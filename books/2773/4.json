With a voice like that and the way he sings about her...\" Katie sounds like she has a bad crush on the mystery guy, which wasn\u0027t like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be anyone. This guy could be a troll. Or a stalker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatie\u0027s eyebrow darted up, \"You really think that a stalker made a video?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I admitted and quickly added, \"but it would make it easier not knowing who it is if he was some kind of deviant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m going to find out.\" She took one more bite of her burger and waived at the waitress to get the check. \"I\u0027m going home and surfing the web until someone forks over a name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~TRYSTAN~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Trystan arrived home, the small condo was empty. He sighed a sigh of relief and tossed his books on the kitchen table. Trystan looked around at the dilapidated furnishings and the graying walls. In the back of his mind, he hoped it would burn and burn all the memories with it. This place wasn\u0027t a refuge, it was a nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan pulled the fridge open and stared at empty shelves. \"Fuck,\" he muttered running his hands through his hair. Empty. Again. He slammed the door shut. Shaking his head, Trystan grabbed his books and went back to his bedroom. Once inside he locked the door with a slide bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d have to grab groceries, but there was no way Trystan would risk running into his father for food. Besides, his stomach was still in knots from kissing Mari. Eating was a necessity, but he wasn\u0027t particularly hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan pulled an old laptop he\u0027d purchased second-hand out from between his mattresses. It booted slowly, its small screen flickering to life like it wished it were dead. When it finally was up and running, Trystan borrowed a neighbor\u0027s unsecure internet connection. He had to take down that video. If Mari heard that song... The pit of his stomach dropped just thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan navigated his way toward the YouTube page, Day5705. Shock lined his face when the page finally loaded. Before he could click delete, he saw comments - tons of them. They loved his song. He scrolled down, recognizing several kids from his school. Hope and fear flooded his chest. If his classmates saw it, then Mari might have seen it. She\u0027d know. She\u0027d recognize him. Trystan played the video again, frantically trying to see if it was possible to tell who he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his hand keeping the curser hovering above the delete button, Trystan stared at the page. Should he erase it? Make it like it never existed? What would happen to the swarm of people who demanded to know who he was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only reason to delete it was Mari, but she was also the reason he wrote the song. Maybe he could ask her about it. Maybe that would be a way to approach the subject of them - a way for her to know he was sincere. Trystan scrolled down through the comments, and made a short post before shutting down the computer. He slid the black plastic under his bed and pulled off his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door slammed shut. Trystan killed the light quickly and jumped into bed with his jeans still on. He could hear his father through the apartment. His voice echoed back to Trystan, \"You ungrateful brat! There\u0027s only one thing I ask you to do, and you can\u0027t even do that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething hard thunked into Trystan\u0027s door and shattered. He closed his eyes tight. It was only a matter of time, he reminded himself. The yelling and screaming would stop, his father would pass out, and Trystan could rest safely for a few hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~MARI~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that night, I surfed the web, as I listened to his song over and over again. It was addicting. Once I heard it, I wanted more. And not knowing who sang it made me want to know who he was to the point of insanity. The user account was Day5705. It wasn\u0027t even a name. The more message boards and tweets I read about him, the more people started referring to him as Day Jones, the anonymous lone musician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he sang was sexy, but it was the words and his voice that captured my attention. I felt like that about Trystan. He saw me as some junior nobody, the girl assigned to read lines with him. This was the second year we worked together and it was always the same. Trystan would talk to me at practice, but that was all I saw of him. The cold hard truth was that he didn\u0027t know I was alive. And with friends like Seth shoving college girls down his throat, why would he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a soft side to Trystan, something that only came out when we were alone. The arrogant swagger that he had melted away and he seemed vulnerable. It felt like I was seeing something that he didn\u0027t show to anyone else, but I knew that couldn\u0027t be. He didn\u0027t think of me like that. Trystan was pining over someone else; some girl that Seth didn\u0027t think was worth his time. Knowing Seth, he\u0027d try to keep Trystan away from her. I thought about it, but there was no way to figure out who Trystan\u0027s crush could be. Before and after practice, Trystan was surrounded by girls. It\u0027d always been like that. All the girls loved him and every guy wanted to be him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled up Trystan\u0027s facebook page and gazed at his picture. Those perfectly pink lips - the way they felt would be seared into my mind forever. It wasn\u0027t my first kiss, but no kiss had ever made me feel so much before. I closed the page and pressed play on the song again. I went to bed that night thinking that someone would sniff out the mysterious Day Jones\u0027 real identity by morning, but when I woke up they still didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the night he posted a comment and it made them love him even more. The guy seemed humble. He made one comment - that\u0027s it - and said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for listening to this song. I don\u0027t really play very well and my voice isn\u0027t exceptional. The only reason I posted it was because I thought someone might be going through the same thing. Thanks for listening.\u0026nbsp; - Day\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he posted that, the comments section of the video went nuts. Everyone wanted to know who he was, who she was, and they begged him for more songs. Day didn\u0027t post anything else. He didn\u0027t seem to want the fame, or the attention. It made me admire him more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~TRYSTAN~\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe barely had five hours of sleep. Trystan showered and pulled on clothes without worrying about rousing his father. Dear old dad was passed out cold on the living room floor. Trystan grabbed his books and ran out the door. The morning air was cool and damp. He breathed it in like he couldn\u0027t get enough of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t matter how much his life sucked, there were times - little things really - that he took joy in. They were reliable, dependable like the sunrise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan walked into the high school and headed directly for the cafeteria. His stomach growled, reminding him that he skipped dinner last night. Today after school, he\u0027d have to run into the deli and grab some things. That meant more odd jobs, less time at school. Trystan bartered with the deli owner, doing odd jobs for him once in a week in exchange for groceries. If he hadn\u0027t done that, he was certain he would have been taken away from his father and placed into foster care a long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan smiled at the cafeteria lady, \"Good morning, Miss Bensly. Is that a new pin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Bensly was close to seventy years old. Every day she came in with a different broach pinned to her lunch lady uniform. They were usually too large and garishly awful. Trystan beamed at her, holding up an apple and a roll for her to ring up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Bensly, swatted at him, \"Oh you. Save your sweet talk for someone closer to your age, Trystan.\" She hit the no sale button and waved him through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re an angel, Miss Bensly. What would I do without you?\" It was the truth. This matronly figure had fed him breakfast for the past four years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Bensly shook her head, and waived him off. Trystan crossed the room and sat at a table by the windows. The sun was barely over the horizon. The bell would ring in about five minutes. Trystan watched students pour out of cars and buses. He ate his breakfast while waiting for her. Mari would arrive any minute, scurrying through the door like she was late even though she wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw her, his heart stopped. The apple he was about to bite was midway to his mouth, but it hung there suspended in motion as he watched Mari run into the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seriously need to get over her,\" Seth said, slapping his books down on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan flinched, bit the apple, and threw the core into the nearby garbage pail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Tucker chose that exact moment to walk in, \"Detention Scott. Throw something else and it\u0027ll be a week. Come to my classroom during study hall. You can serve it then.\" Tucker scribbled on a pink piece of paper instructing the study hall teacher to excuse Trystan since he was serving detention with Tucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan smiled, \"Thanks. I didn\u0027t have one of these yet today,\" and snatched the pink paper and shoved it into his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re pushing your luck, Scott.\" Tucker waved a fat finger at him and walked away quickly, like Trystan irritated him and he didn\u0027t want to behead the kid before first period.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth stared at Trystan until he finally said, \"What the hell is wrong with you? It\u0027s like you want to get busted. You keep doing all this stupid shit and it\u0027s like you know you\u0027re going to get caught.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan folded his arms over his chest and slumped back into his plastic chair, \"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello? Were you somewhere else five minutes ago? Apple core, right when Tucker walked in. That\u0027s sloppy man. You used to pull crap, but you didn\u0027t get caught. Now, well look at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan didn\u0027t feel the need to say why he\u0027d grown sloppy. The lack of sleep from trying to avoid his father\u0027s fists was slowing him down. \"Gee, thanks, Seth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m serious. You\u0027re falling apart, and I know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan shot up from his seat, \"Don\u0027t even go there. The only reason I told you about her was so you could help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth ran up behind him as Trystan exited the cafeteria and walked into the hallway. It was packed with kids carrying books, still wearing coats, racing to get to their lockers. Trystan shouldered his way into the crowd, forcing his way across the hallway. Seth followed close behind, \"I am trying to help you, but you won\u0027t listen. You never listen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan spoke firmly over his shoulder, \"She\u0027s not the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what is? Clue me in, what\u0027s making you so reckless?\" Seth stopped in his tracks. Kids swarmed around him like a rock dropped in the middle of a pile of ants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrystan leaned his head against his locker. Seth didn\u0027t know about his dad. No one did. Taking a deep breath, he turned toward Seth and said, \"I\u0027ll stop, okay? Just leave her alone.\" When Seth tilted his head with a try-to-stop-me look on his face, Trystan added, \"I know you can\u0027t stand her, but that doesn\u0027t mean - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaking his head, Seth cut Trystan off, \"Not true. I just can\u0027t stand what she does to you. When you\u0027ve been around her, you act like a fucking lunatic. I\u0027d understand if you were thinking with your dick, but you\u0027re not. You\u0027re chasing some nobody that hates your guts. Face facts, Trystan. There\u0027s no future with her in it. You two aren\u0027t compatible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the thought that was always drifting at the back of his mind. When Seth said them, it was like someone punched Trystan in the stomach. All the air was forced out of his lungs. It felt like someone was strangling him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter. I can\u0027t let this go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to. It\u0027s like handing her a loaded gun aimed straight at your heart,\" Seth said in a low voice. He leaned closer to his friend, \"Don\u0027t do it. Once those words come out, it\u0027s like pulling the trigger. You can\u0027t undo it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collide-the-secret-life-of-trystan-scott-1/page-4.html","bookId":2773,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:33 PM"}
