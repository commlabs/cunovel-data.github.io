The spy shot Min a hateful glare, then opened a gateway, throwing herself through. Weaves shot after her, but she was gone before most of the people at the meeting realized what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m sorry, General Yulan\", Min announced, \"but you are suffering from Compulsion. Fortuona, it is obvious that the Shadow is doing whatever it can to keep us from this battle. With that in mind, will you still pursue this course of indecision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMin met Tuon’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You play these games quite well\", Tuon whispered, voice cold. \"And to think that I worried for your safety by bringing you into my court. I should have worried for myself, it appears\". Tuon sighed, ever so softly. \"I suppose you give me the opportunity . . . perhaps the mandate . . . to follow what my heart would choose, whether or not it is wise\". She stood. \"General Galgan, gather your troops. We will return to the Field of Merrilor\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene wove Earth and destroyed the boulders behind which the Sharans had hidden. The other Aes Sedai struck immediately, hurling weaves through the crackling air. The Sharans died in fire, lightning and explosions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis side of the Heights was so piled with rubble and scarred with trenches it looked like the remains of a city following a terrible earthquake. It was still night, and they had been fighting . . . Light, how long had it been since Gawyn died? Hours upon hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene redoubled her efforts, refusing to let the thought of him pull her down. Over the hours, her Aes Sedai and the Sharans had fought back and forth across the western side of the Heights. Slowly, Egwene was pushing them eastward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt times, Egwene’s side had seemed to be winning, but lately, more and more Aes Sedai fell from the effects of fatigue or the One Power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother group of channelers approached through the smoke, drawing on the One Power. Egwene could sense them more than see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deflect their weaves!\" Egwene yelled, standing at the forefront. \"I will attack, you defend!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther women took up the call, yelling it along their battle line. No longer did they fight in pockets alone; women of all Ajahs lined up to either side of Egwene, concentration on their ageless faces. Warders stood in front of them; using their bodies to stop weaves was the only protection they could offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene felt Leilwin approaching from behind. The new Warder took her duties seriously. A Seanchan, fighting as her Warder in the Last Battle. Why not? The world itself was unraveling. The cracks all around Egwene’s feet proved that. Those had not faded, as earlier ones had—the darkness remained. Balefire had been used too much in this area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene launched a wave of fire like a moving wall. Corpses went up in flames as the wall passed, leaving behind smoking piles of bones. Her attack scored the ground, blackening it, and the Sharans banded together to fight back against the weave. She killed a few of them before they shattered the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Aes Sedai deflected or destroyed their return weaves, and Egwene gathered her strength to try again. So tired . . . a piece of her whispered. Egwene, you’re so tired. This is becoming dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeilwin stepped up, stumbling on broken rock but joining her at the front. \"I bring word, Mother\", she said in that Seanchan drawl. \"The Asha’man have recovered the seals. Their leader carries them\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgwene let out a relieved breath. She wove Fire and sent it forth in pillars this time, the flames illuminating the broken ground around them. Those cracks that M’Hael had caused worried her deeply. She began another weave, then stopped. Something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spun around as balefire—a column as wide as a man’s arm—ripped through the Aes Sedai line, vaporizing half a dozen women. Explosions all around appeared as if from nowhere, and other women went from battle to death in a heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe balefire burned away women who had stopped weaves from killing us . . . but those women had been removed from the Pattern before they could weave those, and could no longer have stopped the Sharan attacks. Balefire burned a thread backward in the Pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chain of events was catastrophic. Sharan channelers who had been dead were now alive again, and they surged forward—men clawing across the broken ground like hounds, women walking in linked groups of four or five. Egwene sought out the source of the balefire. She had never seen such an immense bar of it, so powerful it must have burned threads a few hours back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found M’Hael standing atop the Heights, the air warped in a bubble around him. Black tendrils—like moss or lichen—crept out of gaps in the rock around him. A spreading sickness. Darkness, nothing. It would consume them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother bar of balefire burned a hole through the ground and touched women, making their forms glow, then vanish. The air itself broke, like a bubble of force that exploded from M’Hael. The storm from before returned, stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that I’d taught you to run\", Egwene snarled, climbing to her feet and gathering her power. At her feet, the ground cracked and opened into nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight! She could feel the emptiness in that hole. She began a weave, but another strike of balefire coursed across the battlefield, killing women she loved. The trembling underfoot threw Egwene to the ground. Screams grew loud as Sharan attacks slaughtered Egwene’s followers. Aes Sedai scattered, seeking safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cracks on the ground spread, as if the top of the Heights here had been hit by a hammer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBalefire. She needed her own. It was the only way to fight him! She rose to her knees and began crafting the forbidden weave, though her heart lurched as she did it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO. Using balefire would only push the world toward destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s only a weave, Egwene. Perrin’s words, when he had seen her in the World of Dreams and stopped balefire from hitting him. But it wasn’t just another weave. There wasn’t anything like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo exhausted. Now that she’d stopped for a moment, she could feel her numbing fatigue. In its depths, she felt the loss, the bitter loss, of Gawyn’s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother!\" Leilwin said, pulling her shoulder. The woman had stayed with her. \"Mother, we must go! The Aes Sedai have broken! The Sharans overrun us\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, M’Hael saw her. He smiled, striding forward, a scepter in one hand, the other pointed toward her, palm up. What would happen if he burned her away with balefire? The last two hours would vanish.
