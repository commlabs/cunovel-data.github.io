In my eagerness to follow, I knock over a small pile of rocks. They scatter, and I hold tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t look down,” Indie says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes much longer to climb than it does to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt strikes me how much of this is holding on and waiting, deciding the next move and then committing to it. My fingers grip tightly into the rock and my toes curl as much as they can. I focus on the task at hand, and somehow that means that, even though I don’t think of Ky, I’m completely immersed in thinking of him. Because I’m being like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe canyon walls here are reddish-orange, drizzled with black. I’m not sure where the black came from; it’s almost like an ocean thick with tar lapped against the sides long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re doing fine,” Indie tells me as I come up next to her on a ledge. “Now this will be the hardest part,” she says, pointing. “Let me try it out first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on the ledge, lean my back against the rock. My arms ache from holding on so tightly. I wish the rock would hold us, cradle us back as we cling to it, but it doesn’t. “I think I’ve got it,” Indie calls down softly. “When you come up here—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the sound of falling rocks, of flesh scraping stone. I’m on my feet. The ledge is small and my balance uncertain. “Indie!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dangles above me, holding onto the rocks. One of her legs hangs down near me, scraped, bloody. I hear her swear softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right?” I call up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Push,” she says, her voice ragged. “Push me up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my palms under the tread of her boot, worn from the run across the plain and dusty-soled from the canyon and the rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a terrible moment when she rests there on my hands, so heavy, and I know she can’t find anything to grab above. Then she is gone; the weight of her boot leaves my hand; the imprint of it is left on my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m up,” she calls down. “Come around to your left. I can talk you up from here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it safe? Are you sure you’re all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s my own fault. These rocks are softer than the ones I’m used to climbing. I put too much weight on that piece and it broke off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scrapes on her leg belie her statement that the rock is soft, but I know what she means. Things here are so different. Poisoned rivers, softened stone. You never know exactly what you’re getting into. What will hold and what will give way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second half of the climb goes more smoothly. Indie was right; the sheer part was the hardest to navigate. I clutch thin edges of rock using only the pads of my fingers, willing my knuckles to stay bent and my feet not to slip. I wedge my arms and knees into slots running vertically up the face of the rock, using my clothes and skin the way Indie taught me—as friction to keep my body close to the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re almost there,” she says above me. “Give me a minute and climb on up. It’s not bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to catch my breath, pausing for a rest in a crevice. The rock does hold me here, I realize, and I smile, exhilarated by how high we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKy would love this. Maybe he’s climbing, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime for the last push to the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not look down or back or anywhere but up and forward. My empty pack shifts a little and I waver, my fingernails digging into the stone. Hold on. Wait. Something light and winged flies past me, startling me. To calm myself, I think of the poem Ky gave me for my birthday, the one about the water:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh tide and the heron dived when I took the road\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the border\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere on this stony shore, I feel like a creature left behind after the water has pulled back to the sea. Trying to climb over into someplace where Ky might be. And even if he’s not there, I’ll find him. I’ll go over again and again until I’ve finally crossed to where he is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause for a moment to get my balance back, and then, in spite of myself, I look over my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe view is completely different from what Ky and I saw together at the top of the Hill. No houses, no City Hall, no buildings. It is sand and rock and scrubby tree; but it is still something I have climbed, and once again, it feels like Ky has climbed it with me somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m almost there,” I whisper to him, to Indie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull myself over the edge of the cliff, a smile on my face, and then I look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are not alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know now why they call this a firing. Ash, everywhere. A wind sails across the Carving, blowing the debris into my eyes and making them blur and water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s just the last of a big fire, I try to tell myself. Sticks laid end to end, smoke gone to the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the look on Indie’s face tells me that she sees the truth and in my mind I know it too. The blackened figures strewn across the ground are not sticks. They are real, these dozens of bodies on the top of the Carving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndie bends down and then straightens up, holding something. A charred length of rope, most of it good. “Let’s go,” she says, the ash on the rope blackening her hands. She reaches up to brush back a piece of her red hair floating loose in the breeze and accidentally marks her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at the people. They have markings on their skin, too, blue ones, twisting lines. I wonder what they mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did you come up here? How did you make this rope? What else have you learned out here while the rest of us forgot about you? Or never knew you existed at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long have they been dead?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Long enough,” Indie says. “A week, maybe more. I’m not sure.” There’s a hard edge to her voice. “Whoever did this might come back. We have to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of my eye, I see movement and turn. Tall red flags set along the ridge whip furiously in the wind. Though staked into the ground instead of tied to trees, they remind me of the red scraps Ky and I left on the Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho marked the land up here? Who killed all thsee people? The Society? The Enemy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere is the Rising?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have to leave now, Cassia,” Indie says behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I say. “We can’t leave them here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere they the Rising?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is how Anomalies die,” Indie says, her voice cold. “The two of us alone can’t change it. We have to find someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe these are the people we were trying to find,” I say. Please. Don’t let the Rising be gone before we’ve even had a chance to find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Ky, I think. I never knew. So this is the kind of death you’ve seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndie and I run across the top of the Carving and leave the bodies behind. Ky’s still alive, I tell myself. He has to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly the sun is in the sky. Nothing flies. There are no angels here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t stop moving until we’ve put distance between us and whoever’s in the township. None of us speak much; we go fast and follow the main canyon. After a few hours I get out the map to check our position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We seem to be climbing up all of the time,” Eli says, a little out of breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why don’t we seem to be getting any higher?” Eli asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The canyon walls are rising too,” I say. “Look.” I show him how the farmers marked elevation on the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEli shakes his head in confusion. “Think of the Carving and all its canyons like a big boat,” Vick tells Eli. “The part where we entered was low in the water. The part where we’re coming out is high. See? When we climb out, we’ll be above that huge plain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know about boats?” Eli asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little,” Vick says. “Not much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can rest for a minute,” I tell Eli, reaching for my canteen. I take a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVick and Eli do too. “Remember that poem you say for the dead?” Vick begins. “The one I asked you about before?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” I look at the mountain settlement marked on the map. There’s where we need to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you know it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I came across it,” I say. “Back in Oria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not in the Outer Provinces?” Vick asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows I know more than I’m saying. I look up. He and Eli stand on the opposite side of the map, watching. The last time Vick challenged me was out in the village when I talked about the way the Society killed Anomalies. I see the same flint-hard look in his eyes now. He thinks it’s time to talk about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There, too,” I say. “I’ve heard about the Pilot all my life.” And I have. In the Border Provinces, in the Outer Provinces, in Oria, and now here in the Carving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So who do you think it is?” Vick asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some think the Pilot is the leader of a rebellion against the Society,” I say, and Eli’s eyes light up with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Rising,” Vick agrees. “I’ve heard that, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a rebellion?” Eli asks eagerly. “And the Pilot’s the leader?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” I say. “But it doesn’t have anything to do with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course it does,” Eli says, sounding angry. “Why didn’t you tell the rest of the decoys? Maybe we could have done something!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” I ask Eli wearily. “Vick and I have both heard of the Pilot. We don’t know where he or she is. And even if we did, I don’t believe the Pilot can do anything but die and take too many people with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVick shakes his head but doesn’t say anything out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It could have given them some hope,” Eli says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What good is that if it there isn’t anything to back it up?” I ask Eli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sets his jaw stubbornly. “It’s not any different than what you tried to do with rigging the guns.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s right. I sigh. “I know. But telling them about the Pilot wouldn’t have done any good either. It’s just a story my father used to tell.” Suddenly I remember how my mother would paint illustrations while he talked. When he finished telling the story of Sisyphus and the paintings dried up, I always felt like he finally had some rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard about the Pilot from someone back home,” Vick says. He pauses. “What happened to them? Your parents?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They died in a firing,” I tell him. At first I think that’s all I’ll say. But I keep talking. I have to tell Eli and Vick what happened so they’ll see why I don’t believe. “My father used to gather all the villagers together for meetings.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of how exciting it always was, everyone sliding in along the benches and talking with one another. Their faces would light up when they saw my father come into the room. “My father figured out a way to disconnect the village port without the Society knowing. That’s what he thought, anyway. I don’t know if the port still worked or if someone told the Society about the meetings. But they were gathered together when the firing started. Almost everyone died.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crossed-matched-2/page-17.html","bookId":1644,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:36:01 PM"}
