No! I don’t know what an oyster is, and I don’t want to. You’re the one who’s looking at it the wrong way. We’re being given the chance of a lifetime. Do you have any idea how rare it is for girls like us to go to university? I didn’t want to be part of this plan, but now I’ve never felt so grateful. Don’t botch it up just because you always want more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I always want more. A hungry animal lives longer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gloved hands went reflexively to her stomach. “I almost starved to death as a child in Freesia. I don’t want to be hungry ever again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust ahead, at Dover, all the possibilities in the world waited, tethered to the docks by long ropes. Mademoiselle Caprice would soon haggle our passage to Callais, probably on one of the large, fast passenger airships, where we’d huddle on the open deck and try to keep hold of our hats. Then we would spend our first night in Franchia at an inn before taking a carriage to Ruin. I dreaded spending more than six hours trapped in a tiny, airless, jouncing box with humans, even if Criminy had given us a vial of salve to rub on our collars to lessen the smell of their blood. The bottled goo stank of Vicks VapoRub mixed with perfume, and for me, at least, hunger would be less painful. I was better at controlling the blood hunger than Cherie, who’d been raised far away from humans and, unlike me, had never been one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trunk’s clockwork key had worn down, and it slowly rolled to a halt behind us. Caprice sat up like a zombie coming awake, rubbing her eyes with red fingers. She hopped down from the trunk with a dancer’s flair and stretched, cracking her back and settling her voluminous skirts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will all walk from here, my dears. Demi, pull the trunk along manually. We cannot have the people of Callais eyeing our goods until they’ve paid, non?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was glad to pull the handle and lag behind Caprice and Cherie. As I watched their skirts sway and listened to the sort of polite conversation that bored me to blud tears, the airships played peekaboo with my hopes. We were so close to freedom. And I didn’t want to go to Ruin. No matter what Caprice said, my heart hungered for the cabarets of Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCherie never liked my ideas at first. But eventually, she always admitted that I was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d thank me later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe airship ride was exhilarating, even if we weren’t allowed to stand up for fear that our skirts would fill with air and carry us over the railing and into the fatally salty sea below. Cherie buried her face in my shoulder, and I wrapped my arm around her and inhaled the brisk, briny air. I’d loved the ocean before becoming a Bludman. Now it could kill me. Half my senses wanted to suck in the sea spray, and the other half wanted to hold my breath until we were safely on the other side of the Channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one seemed to have noticed that we weren’t human, which was helpful. I’d seen a couple of Bludmen being abused in the streets of Dover, and it took everything I had not to bare my fangs and come to their rescue. Thanks to Criminy’s ability to forge papers and Antonin’s costuming prowess, we were safe from being flogged by some shaky-legged old Pinky man with a monocle. But it was hard for a Bludman to pretend to be anything less than an apex predator, and I was glad to get off the streets and into the privacy of the boardinghouse Caprice had selected for us. Not too fancy, not run-down, and just a block away from the depot, where carriages would line up in the morning to take us to Ruin. The daimon certainly served her purpose as a chaperone, as I still had trouble converting coppers and silvers into francs in my head and had no idea how to tell an inn from an apartment until she explained what the daimon symbols painted on the signs meant. I paid special attention to her lessons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs at the inn, I fell onto one of the three narrow beds and kicked off my boots, grateful to be horizontal. Cherie went straight for the train case of blood and downed two vials, handing me a third. I sipped it carefully without sitting up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m going down for supper, mes filles.” Mademoiselle Caprice smoothed her glossy hair and straightened her dress. “Drink your blood, and get some sleep. We shall leave at dawn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, mademoiselle,” Cherie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good luck finding some sexy victims,” I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaprice shot me a glare. “You should take care to curb your attitude before you reach university, my dear. The professors have been known to strike deserving miscreants with a cane. Bludmen are not exempt from manners.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she was gone, I sat up and held out my hand to Cherie, so she could see what nestled in my palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demi. You didn’t.” She poked the pile of coins with a finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned. “Criminy taught me well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can’t use it. Even if I agreed, even if I wanted to go to Paris, all the carriages in Callais leave from the same place. She would find us in a heartbeat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucking the coins back into my pocket, I sighed deeply. “I guess you’re right. No point in trying to give her the slip. Oh, well. Good night, Cherie,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked me up and down. “You’re not going to change into your nightclothes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not. Good Pinky girls don’t change in inns. Who knows if they have bludrats?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent point. You’re finally starting to be sensible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay down on the bed beside mine, fully clothed, and blinked sleepily at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s strange, going to bed this way. I’m so used to being in the top bunk with you below me. And now you’re staring at me. And we’re in Franchia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled over, showing her my back. “Creepy staring problem solved. Don’t worry, honey. Everything will be better in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I hadn’t shown her what was in my other pocket. And I wasn’t going to sleep yet, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cherie, wake up. We have to hurry.” I rolled her shoulder gently and glanced over her at Mademoiselle Caprice, who let out a roaring snore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? Are we late for the carriage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will be.” I slipped a vial into her hand and guided it, uncorked, to her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chugged it agreeably and blinked at me. “Where’s Mademoiselle Caprice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stifled a giggle. “Sleeping off too many daimon drinks, I suppose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Cherie knew me too well. Her eyes went to slits. “What did you do, Demi?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, Cherie, I might have brought a bag of Criminy’s famous sleeping powder. And I might have used it on her after she went to sleep. And I might have grabbed our papers and carriage tickets from her reticule. And she might be sleeping for another day, at least, because I might have used more powder than was necessary.” I held up our forged papers in one hand and a sack of coins in the other and waggled my eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCherie groaned and stood, looking down at our insensate chaperone with her usual concern. “Oh, dear Aztarte. You are a horrible person and a bad influence, and Criminy is going to kill us, and we’re just going to sit right here and wait until she wakes up and pretend like nothing ever happened, because I really don’t want Criminy to kill us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Criminy has to find us before he can kill us, and he’s not going to find us.” I smiled and patted her shoulder. “At least, not until we’re the most celebrated act in the cabarets of Mortmartre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. No no no no no. I’m going to Ruin. I’m going to university. I am not, under any circumstances, going to Paris. And I’m definitely not going to the cabarets. Did you even listen to Caprice yesterday? It’s dangerous. Even for us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And it’s the only way to be a star.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I. Don’t. Want. To. Be. A. Star.” She punctuated each word with a little slap on top of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want anything else but to be a star. Besides, you’re going to live to be three hundred. You’ve got plenty of time to make youthful errors. You can always use your mad cash from the cabaret to go to university later, after you sow your wild oats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCherie sat down and put her head in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are oats, and why should I sew them? I hate sewing. Honestly, Demi, I feel like a mother with an out-of-control child. You won’t listen to anyone. Not me, not Mademoiselle Caprice, not even Criminy and Letitia. Why can’t you just be happy with what you have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared into her cloudy gray eyes, begging her to understand, as pink-tinged tears spilled down my cheeks unbidden and unwanted. “Because I’m not happy, Cherie. I’m hungry. Why are you so ready to be complacent? Why don’t you want more?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scooted over to me, folded our black-scaled fingers together. “I don’t know how to get through to you. You’re my best friend, and you’ll never be happy until you’ve destroyed us both.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. “It’s not destruction. It’s reinvention. Trust me. It’s going to be the biggest adventure of our lives. We just have to reach out and take it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed deeply and reached to pull the coverlet over Mademoiselle Caprice’s shoulder. “You’ll never give up, will you?” she asked quietly. “No matter what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not until I get what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So my only choices are to join you on this mad caper to Paris or stay here alone and explain to Mademoiselle Caprice why I let you go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took two more vials from the train case and twined her arm around mine. We uncorked the vials and sipped them at the same time, a Bludman’s pinkie promise. Her eyes were sad and rueful, maybe the tiniest bit amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then I guess, yet again, I’ll give in to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s going to be amazing, Cherie. I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tossed her empty vial at my chest. “If you’re wrong, I’m going to kill you myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fair enough. But I’m going to be right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe slipped out the door with nothing but the train case of blood vials, our papers, and a pocket full of dreams. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wicked-after-midnight-blud-3/page-5.html","bookId":1599,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:51 PM"}
