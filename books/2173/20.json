for outrage and injustice will certainly ignite retaliation in kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- BuSab Manual\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\u0027It is no longer classifiable as rioting,\" the aide said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He was a short Gowachin with pinched features, and he looked across the room to where Broey sat facing a dead communicator.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was a map on the wall behind the aide, its colors made brilliant by harsh morning light coming in the east windows.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Below the map, a computer terminal jutted from the wall.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Occasionally it clicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGar came into the room from the hall, peered around as though looking for someone, left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey noted the intrusion, glanced at the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still no sign of where she\u0027s gone to ground?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing certain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one who paraded McKie through the streets . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clearly an expendable underling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did they go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide indicated a place on the map, a group of buildings in the Warrens to the northwest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey stared at the blank face of his communications screen.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He\u0027d been tricked again.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He knew it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That damnable Human female!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Violence in the city teetered on the edge of full-scale war:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gowachin against Human.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And still nothing, not even a hint at the location of Gar\u0027s Rim stores, the blasphemous factories.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was an unstable condition which could not continue much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis communications screen came alive with a report:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;violent fighting near Gate Twenty-One.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Broey glanced at the map.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That made it more than one hundred clearly defined battles between the species along an unresolved perimeter.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The report spoke of new weapons and unsuccessful attempts to capture specimens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGate Twenty-One?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t far from the place where McKie had been paraded through . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral things slipped into a new relationship in Broey\u0027s mind.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He looked at his aide, who stood waiting obediently at the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Gar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAides were summoned, sent running.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gar was not to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tria?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe, too, was unavailable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGar\u0027s fanatics remained neutral, but more of Jedrik\u0027s pattern was emerging.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Everything pointed to an exquisite understanding of the weakness implicit in the behavior of Gar and Tria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I thought I was the only one who saw that!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would the God not speak to him other than to say \"I am watched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBroey felt tricked and betrayed in his innermost being.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This had a cleansing effect on his reason.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He could only depend on himself.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And he began to sense a larger pattern in Jedrik\u0027s behavior.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Was it possible that Jedrik shared his goals?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The possibility excited him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the aides who\u0027d come running with the negative information about Gar and Tria, began to snap orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get our people out of all those Warrens, except that corridor to the northeast.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Reinforce that area.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Everyone else fall back to the secondary walls.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Let no Humans inside that perimeter.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Block all gates.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Get moving!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis last was shouted as his aides hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it already was too late.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He realized now that he\u0027d allowed Jedrik to bait and distract him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was clear that she\u0027d created in her mind an almost perfect simulation model of Broey.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And she\u0027d done it from a Liaitor position!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Incredible.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He could almost feel sorry for Gar and Tria.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They were like puppets dancing to Jedrik\u0027s strings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was no better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came over him that Jedrik\u0027s simulation probably encompassed this very moment of realization.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Admiration for her permeated him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuperb!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuietly, he issued orders for the sequestering of Gowachin females within the inner Graluz bastions which he\u0027d had the foresight to prepare.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His people would thank him for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose who survived the next few hours.
