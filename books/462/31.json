ANDY IS ENGAGED.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Jeremiah Brackett brightened up as his glance took in the strong, sturdy figure of our hero. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He stood very little chance of securing the services of a boy belonging to the village, for his penurious disposition was too well known; but here was a stranger, who knew nothing about him, and who was probably in search of employment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is this Mr. Brackett?” asked Andy, politely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; that’s my name.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I was told you wanted to hire a boy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who told you so?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A boy I met on the road.”{188}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Was his name Peter?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I believe he said so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A lazy, shiftless boy!” said Brackett, warmly. “He had a good place here, and I looked after him as if he had been my own son; but he didn’t do his duty.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He didn’t say anything about that,” said Andy, gravely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I reckon not. Did he say anything about me?” asked Brackett.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He said you and he couldn’t get along very well.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All his own fault,” returned the farmer, who wished to remove any prejudice which Peter’s story may have excited in the mind of Andy. “He had as nice a home as any boy would want, and easy work; but some boys are never satisfied. Was you looking for work?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I thought I might hire out for a while.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What do you call yourself?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Henry Miller.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Was you raised near here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not very.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did you ever work on a farm?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have worked a little in that way.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can you milk?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The next question is, how much did you calculate to get?” asked Brackett, cautiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Peter told me how much you gave him,” said Andy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Brackett was glad to hear this, as he{189} knew that most boys expected larger wages. He was glad that Andy knew what his predecessor had received.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” he said, with the air of a liberal man, “I gave Peter fifty cents a week, though he wasn’t really worth it. Fifty cents and board, and lodgings, and washing,” he added, by way of making the salary seem as munificent as possible.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It doesn’t seem to me very high pay,” said Andy, who thought it politic to drive a bargain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Remember, you’re only a boy,” said Mr. Brackett, “and boys can’t do as much as men. Fifty cents is excellent pay for a boy of—how old be you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sixteen.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For a boy of sixteen. Of course, when you’re a man grown, you can get a good deal more. Why, I pay one man as much as a dollar and a quarter a day!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Would I have to work very hard?” asked Andy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, no! Just enough for healthy exercise,” said Brackett, in a light, cheerful tone. “It does boys good to use their limbs. I was a dreadful hard worker when I was a boy.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You look as if you’d been tired ever since,” said Andy to himself, as he watched the lounging attitude of his future employer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You’ll have a nice, pleasant home,” continued Mr. Brackett—“plenty of life and fun.{190} I’ve got four beautiful children, that’ll look upon you as a brother. Mrs. Brackett, who is a perfect lady, will take an interest in you and make you feel at home.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before Andy could reply, Mrs. Brackett made her appearance at the back door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Jeremiah!” she screamed. “I want some more wood—quick!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All right, Lucindy. Well, what do you say? Will you come?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’ll try it a week,” said Andy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then you can begin by sawing and splitting some wood. There’s the wood pile, and there’s the saw and ax. You’d better work up at a pretty good quantity.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, I’ve got rid of that job,” thought Brackett, with a sigh of relief. “He looks like a good, strong boy. I hope I’ll be able to keep him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2952/81175.html","bookId":462,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:35:44 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:35:44 AM"}
