I tried to smell them but I couldn\u0027t. Overhead, the sky was overcast. It\u0027s going to rain, I thought. I wondered why I was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door was no more solid to me than air as I went inside. I knew, then, why I\u0027d come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn, Richard and Perry were sitting in the living room. Ian must be in school, I thought, Marie in Pasadena at the Academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinger was lying at Ann\u0027s feet. As I stepped into the living room, she lifted her head abruptly and stared at me, ears drawn back. No sound this time. Perry, who was sitting on the sofa next to Richard, turned and looked at me. \"He\u0027s back,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn and Richard looked automatically in my direction but I knew they couldn\u0027t see me. \"Does he took the same?\" Richard asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as he did in the cemetery,\" Perry answered. \"He\u0027s wearing the outfit he had on the night of the accident, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard nodded. \"Yes.\" He looked at Ann; my gaze was fixed on her. \"Mom?\" he said. \"Will you--?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cut him off. \"No, Richard,\" she said quietly but firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Dad was dressed like that the night of the accident,\" Richard insisted. \"How could Perry know that if he--?\" \"We know it, Richard,\" Ann interrupted again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not getting it from you, Mrs. Nielsen, take my word for it,\" Perry told her. \"Your husband is standing right over there. Look at your dog. She sees him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn looked at Ginger and shivered. \"I don\u0027t know that,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to make her see. \"Ginger?\" I said. Always, when I\u0027d spoken her name, her tail would thump at the floor. Now she only cringed, eyes fixed on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started across the room toward her. \"Ginger, come on,\" I said. \"You know me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s walking toward you, Mrs. Nielsen,\" Perry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you please--?\" she started, then broke off, startled, as Ginger lurched to her feet and ran from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s afraid of him,\" Perry explained. \"She doesn\u0027t understand what\u0027s happening, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom?\" Richard said when she remained silent. How well I knew that stubborn silence. I felt compelled to smile despite her lack of inclination to believe in my presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s smiling at you,\" Perry said. \"He seems to understand your inability to believe he\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn\u0027s expression grew strained again. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s obvious to you that I\u0027d like to believe it,\" she said. \"I just can\u0027t---\" Breaking off, she drew in breath with effort. \"You ... really see him?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Ann, yes, he does,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just said Yes, Ann, Yes,\" Perry told her. \"I can see him; just as I described him in the cemetery. Naturally, he doesn\u0027t look as solid as we do. But he\u0027s very real. I\u0027m not getting information from your mind. I can\u0027t even do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn pressed the palm of her left hand to her eyes. \"I wish I could believe,\" she said, miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try, Mom,\" Richard said. \"Ann, please?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it\u0027s hard to accept,\" Perry said. \"I\u0027ve lived with it all my life so I take it for granted. I could see disincarnates when I was a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him with sudden distaste. Disincarnates? The word made me sound like a freak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Perry said to me, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Richard asked and Ann lowered her hand to look at Perry curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looked at me with a frown,\" Perry said, still smiling. \"I must have said something he didn\u0027t like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard looked at Ann again. \"Mom, what do you say?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I just don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What harm can it do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What harm?\" She gazed at him, incredulous. \"To let myself hope that your father still exists? You know what he meant to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Nielsen,\" Perry started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe in survival after death,\u0027\u0027 Ann interrupted him. \"I believe that, when we die, we die and that\u0027s the end of it. Now you want me to--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Nielsen, you\u0027re wrong,\" Perry said. He was supporting my presence yet I felt offended by his self-assertive tone. \"Your husband is standing right in front of you. How could that be if he hasn\u0027t survived?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see him,\" Ann responded. \"And I can\u0027t believe it just because you say he\u0027s here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, Perry\u0027s been tested at UCLA,\" Richard said. \"He\u0027s been authenticated any number of times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Richard, we\u0027re not talking about college tests. We\u0027re talking about Dad! The man we loved!\u0027\u0027 \"All the more reason--!\" Richard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She shook her head. \"I just can\u0027t let myself believe it. If I did, then found it wasn\u0027t true, I\u0027d die myself. It would kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no, I thought in sudden distress. Once more, that draining exhaustion had come upon me. Whether it was caused by the effort of wanting so badly for Ann to believe or by her continuing sorrow, I had no idea. I only knew I had to rest again. Things were starting to blur before my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, just try?\" Richard asked her. \"Aren\u0027t you even willing to try? Perry says we might see Dad if we--\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ann, I have to He down for awhile,\" I said. I knew she couldn\u0027t hear me but I said it anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s speaking to you, Mrs. Nielsen,\" Perry told her. \"Now he\u0027s leaning over you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to kiss her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you feel that?\" Perry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\u0027\u0027 she said, tensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just kissed your hair,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer breath caught and she started crying softly. Richard jumped up, moving to her quickly. Sitting on the arm of her chair, he pulled her against himself. \"It\u0027s all right, Mom,\" he murmured. He looked at Perry critically. \"Did you have to say that?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry shrugged. \"I told you what he did, that\u0027s all, I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exhaustion was increasing rapidly now. I wanted to remain, to stand in front of Perry, let him read my lips. I didn\u0027t have the strength though. Once again, that stonelike feeling overwhelmed my body and I turned away from them. I had to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to know what he\u0027s doing now?\" Perry asked. His tone was peeved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Richard was stroking Ann\u0027s hair, looking upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s walking into your bar room. Starting to fade. He must be losing strength.\" \"Can you call him back?\" Richard asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear no more. I don\u0027t know how I made it to our bedroom; the transition was unclear. I only remember that, as I lay down, I thought: Why do I keep getting exhausted when I have no physical body?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes. It was dark and still. Something pulled at me, compelling me to stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difference in the way I felt was instantly apparent. Before, I\u0027d felt weighted. Now I felt as light as down. I almost seemed to float across the room and through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry\u0027s voice was speaking in the living room. I wondered what he was saying as I drifted down the back hall. Had Ann consented to the sitting yet? I hoped she had. All I wanted was to know that she was comforted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved across the family room and into the bar room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, my steps had frozen and I stared in horror toward the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind could not react. I was struck dumb by the sight. I knew that I was standing where I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet I was standing in the living room as well. Dressed in identical clothes. My face, my body. Me, without a doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how could that be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t in that body, I realized then. I only observed it. Staring, I moved closer. The figure of myself looked corpse-like. There was no expression on its face. It might have been a figure of me in a wax museum. Except that it was moving slowly like a winding down automaton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tore my gaze from it and looked around the living room. Ann was there, Richard, Ian and Marie; Perry, talking to the figure. Was it visible to all of them? I wondered, sickened. It was such a hideous sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you?\" Perry was asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the cadaverous form. Its lips stirred feebly. When it spoke, its voice was not my own but a hollow, lifeless muttering as it said, \"Beyond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry told my family. He addressed the figure once again. \"Can you describe where you are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure didn\u0027t speak. It shifted on its feet, eyes blinking sluggishly. At last it spoke. \"Cold,\" it said. \"He says it\u0027s cold,\" Perry told them. \"You said we\u0027d be able to see him,\" Marie said in a tight voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Ann. She was on the sofa, sitting between Ian and Marie, her body looking collapsed. Her face was white and masklike, she was staring at her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please make yourself visible to everyone,\" Perry said to the figure. Even now, his tone was arbitrary. The figure shook its head. It answered, \"No.\" I don\u0027t know how I knew it but I did. The figure wasn\u0027t speaking of its own accord. It merely parroted what Perry\u0027s mind was feeding it. It wasn\u0027t me in any way. It was a puppet he\u0027d constructed with the power of his will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved to Perry angrily and stood in front of him, blocking off his view of the figure. \"Stop this,\" I told him. \"Why can\u0027t you manifest yourself?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. He couldn\u0027t see me anymore. He was looking through me, at my waxlike effigy. Just as Ann had looked through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached out and tried to grab his shoulder. \"What have you done?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no awareness of my presence. He kept speaking to the figure as I turned to Ann. She was bending forward now, shaking, both palms pressed across her lower face, eyes haunted, staring sightlessly. Oh, God, I thought in anguish. Now she\u0027II never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure had responded with its witless voice. I looked at it, revolted by the sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you happy where you are?\" Perry asked. The figure answered, \"Happy.\" \"Have you a message for your wife?\u0027\u0027 Perry asked. \"Be happy,\" mumbled the figure. \"He says be happy,\" Perry said to Ann. With a gagging sound, she struggled to her feet and ran from the room. \"Mom!\" Ian hurried after her. \"Don\u0027t break the circle!\" Perry cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarie stood up, incensed. \"Break the circle? You... ass!\" She ran after Ian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the figure standing in our living room like a faded mannequin. Its eyes were those of a catatonic. \"Damn you,\" I muttered. I walked to it suddenly. To my astonished loathing, I could feel its flesh as I grabbed for it. It was dead and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRevulsion seized me as it grabbed my arms, its icy fingers clutching at me. I cried out, harrowed, and began to struggle with it. I was wrestling with my own corpse, Robert, my dead face inches from me, my dead eyes staring at me. \"Get away!\" I shouted. \"Away,\" it repeated dully. \"Damn you!\" I screamed. It muttered, \"Damn you.\" Horrified, my stomach wrenched by nausea, I jerked free of its numbing touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look out, he\u0027s falling!\" Perry cried. Suddenly, he fell back on the cushion of the chair he sat on. \"He\u0027s gone,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was. As I\u0027d pulled free, the figure had started toppling toward me, then, before my eyes, dissolved in midair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something pushed him,\" Perry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Christ\u0027s sake, Perry.\" Richard\u0027s voice was trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could I have a drink of water?\" Perry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said we\u0027d see him,\" Richard said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A drink of water, Richard?\" Perry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him closely as Richard stood and moved toward the kitchen. What was wrong with him? How could he have been so right, then so completely wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned toward the kitchen, hearing the gurgle of the Sparklett\u0027s bottle being tapped. Why had Richard become involved with Perry in the first place? I wondered. I knew he\u0027d only meant to help but now things were worse than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning back, I sat beside Perry. \"Listen,\" I said. He didn\u0027t move, hunched over, looking ill. I reached out and touched his arm but he didn\u0027t react.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perry, what\u0027s the matter with you?\" I demanded. He stirred uncomfortably. An idea struck me and I repeated the question in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"Get away from me,\" he muttered. \"It\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Over?\" If I could have throttled him, I would have. \"What about my wife? Is it over for her?\" Remembering, I repeated my words in thought. \"It\u0027s over,\" he said through clenching teeth. \"That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to think a further message but, the instant I began, I stopped. He had shut himself off, enclosing his awareness in a carapace of will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around as Richard returned and handed Perry a glass of water. Perry drank it in a long, continuous swallow, then sighed. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard gazed at him bleakly. \"What about my mother?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can try again,\" Perry told him. \"I\u0027m sure--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard stopped him with an angry sound. \"She\u0027ll never try again,\" he said. \"No matter what you tell her now, she won\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rose and walked away from them. I had to leave; abruptly, that was clear to me. There was nothing more I could do. The thought came overwhelmingly:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom this moment on, my presence is invalid. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-dreams-may-come/page-6.html","bookId":2541,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:37 AM"}
