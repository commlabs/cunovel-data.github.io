But I’m pledged this week to the Pellerin Society of Kenosha: I had a hand in founding it, and for two years now they’ve been patiently waiting for a word from me — the Fiat Lux, so to speak. You see it’s a ministry, Bernald — I assure you, I look upon my calling quite religiously.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Bernald listened, his disappointment gradually changed to relief. Howland, on trial, always turned out to be too insufferable, and the pleasure of watching his antics was invariably lost in the impulse to put a sanguinary end to them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If he’d only keep his beastly pink hands off Pellerin,” Bernald groaned, thinking of the thick manuscript condemned to perpetual incarceration in his own desk by the publication of Howland’s “definitive” work on the great man. One couldn’t, after Howland Wade, expose one’s self to the derision of writing about Pellerin: the eagerness with which Wade’s book had been devoured proved, not that the public had enough appetite for another, but simply that, for a stomach so undiscriminating, anything better than Wade had given it would be too good. And Bernald, in the confidence that his own work was open to this objection, had stoically locked it up. Yet if he had resigned his exasperated intelligence to the fact that Wade’s book existed, and was already passing into the immortality of perpetual republication, he could not, after repeated trials, adjust himself to the author’s talk about Pellerin. When Wade wrote of the great dead he was egregious, but in conversation he was familiar and fond. It might have been supposed that one of the beauties of Pellerin’s hidden life and mysterious taking off would have been to guard him from the fingering of anecdote; but biographers like Howland Wade were born to rise above such obstacles. He might be vague or inaccurate in dealing with the few recorded events of his subject’s life; but when he left fact for conjecture no one had a firmer footing. Whole chapters in his volume were constructed in the conditional mood and packed with hypothetical detail; and in talk, by the very law of the process, hypothesis became affirmation, and he was ready to tell you confidentially the exact circumstances of Pellerin’s death, and of the “distressing incident” leading up to it. Bernald himself not only questioned the form under which this incident was shaping itself before posterity, but the mere radical fact of its occurrence: he had never been able to discover any break in the dense cloud enveloping Pellerin’s later life and its mysterious termination. He had gone away — that was all that any of them knew: he who had so little, at any time, been with them or of them; and his going had so slightly stirred the public consciousness that even the subsequent news of his death, laconically imparted from afar, had dropped unheeded into the universal scrap-basket, to be long afterward fished out, with all its details missing, when some enquiring spirit first became aware, by chance encounter with a two-penny volume in a London book-stall, not only that such a man as John Pellerin had died, but that he had ever lived, or written.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It need hardly be noted that Howland Wade had not been the pioneer in question: his had been the wiser part of swelling the chorus when it rose, and gradually drowning the other voices by his own insistent note. He had pitched the note so screamingly, and held it so long, that he was now the accepted authority on Pellerin, not only in the land which had given birth to his genius but in the Europe which had first acclaimed it; and it was the central point of pain in Bernald’s sense of the situation that a man who had so yearned for silence as Pellerin should have his grave piped over by such a voice as Wade’s.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bernald’s talk with the Interpreter had revived this ache to the momentary exclusion of other sensations; and he was still sore with it when, the next afternoon, he arrived at Portchester for his second Sunday with the Wades.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the station he had the surprise of seeing Winterman’s face on the platform, and of hearing from him that Doctor Bob had been called away to assist at an operation in a distant town.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mrs. Wade wanted to put you off, but I believe the message came too late; so she sent me down to break the news to you,” said Winterman, holding out his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps because they were the first conventional words that Bernald had heard him speak, the young man was struck by the relief his intonation gave them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “She wanted to send a carriage,” Winterman added, “but I told her we’d walk back through the woods.” He looked at Bernald with a sudden kindness that flushed the young man with pleasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Are you strong enough? It’s not too far?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, no. I’m pulling myself together. Getting back to work is the slowest part of the business: not on account of my eyes — I can use them now, though not for reading; but some of the links between things are missing. It’s a kind of broken spectrum . . . here, that boy will look after your bag.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The walk through the woods remained in Bernald’s memory as an enchanted hour. He used the word literally, as descriptive of the way in which Winterman’s contact changed the face of things, or perhaps restored them to their primitive meanings. And the scene they traversed — one of those little untended woods that still, in America, fringe the tawdry skirts of civilization — acquired, as a background to Winterman, the hush of a spot aware of transcendent visitings. Did he talk, or did he make Bernald talk? The young man never knew. He recalled only a sense of lightness and liberation, as if the hard walls of individuality had melted, and he were merged in the poet’s deeper interfusion, yet without losing the least sharp edge of self. This general impression resolved itself afterward into the sense of Winterman’s wide elemental range. His thought encircled things like the horizon at sea. He didn’t, as it happened, touch on lofty themes — Bernald was gleefully aware that, to Howland Wade, their talk would hardly have been Talk at all — but Winterman’s mind, applied to lowly topics, was like a powerful lens that brought out microscopic delicacies and differences.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The lack of Sunday trains kept Doctor Bob for two days on the scene of his surgical duties, and during those two days Bernald seized every moment of communion with his friend’s guest. Winterman, as Wade had said, was reticent as to his personal affairs, or rather as to the practical and material conditions to which the term is generally applied. But it was evident that, in Winterman’s case, the usual classification must be reversed, and that the discussion of ideas carried one much farther into his intimacy than any specific acquaintance with the incidents of his life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That’s exactly what Howland Wade and his tribe have never understood about Pellerin: that it’s much less important to know how, or even why, he disapp — ”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bernald pulled himself up with a jerk, and turned to look full at his companion. It was late on the Monday evening, and the two men, after an hour’s chat on the verandah to the tune of Mrs. Wade’s knitting-needles, had bidden their hostess good-night and strolled back to the bungalow together.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Come and have a pipe before you turn in,” Winterman had said; and they had sat on together till midnight, with the door of the bungalow open on a heaving moonlit bay, and summer insects bumping against the chimney of the lamp. Winterman had just bent down to re-fill his pipe from the jar on the table, and Bernald, jerking about to catch him in the yellow circle of lamplight, sat speechless, staring at a fact that seemed suddenly to have substituted itself for Winterman’s face, or rather to have taken on its features.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, they never saw that Pellerin’s ideas were Pellerin. . . . ” He continued to stare at Winterman. “Just as this man’s ideas are — why, are Pellerin!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The thought uttered itself in a kind of inner shout, and Bernald started upright with the violent impact of his conclusion. Again and again in the last forty-eight hours he had exclaimed to himself: “This is as good as Pellerin.” Why hadn’t he said till now: “This is Pellerin”? . . . Surprising as the answer was, he had no choice but to take it. He hadn’t said so simply because Winterman was better than Pellerin — that there was so much more of him, so to speak. Yes; but — it came to Bernald in a flash — wouldn’t there by this time have been any amount more of Pellerin? . . . The young man felt actually dizzy with the thought. That was it — there was the solution of the haunting problem! This man was Pellerin, and more than Pellerin! It was so fantastic and yet so unanswerable that he burst into a sudden startled laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Winterman, at the same moment, brought his palm down with a sudden crash on the pile of manuscript covering the desk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What’s the matter?” Bernald gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My match wasn’t out. In another minute the destruction of the library of Alexandria would have been a trifle compared to what you’d have seen.” Winterman, with his large deep laugh, shook out the smouldering sheets. “And I should have been a pensioner on Doctor Bob the Lord knows how much longer!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bernald pulled himself together. “You’ve really got going again? The thing’s actually getting into shape?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “This particular thing is in shape. I drove at it hard all last week, thinking our friend’s brother would be down on Sunday, and might look it over.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bernald had to repress the tendency to another wild laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Howland — you meant to show Howland what you’ve done?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Winterman, looming against the moonlight, slowly turned a dusky shaggy head toward him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Isn’t it a good thing to do?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bernald wavered, torn between loyalty to his friends and the grotesqueness of answering in the affirmative. After all, it was none of his business to furnish Winterman with an estimate of Howland Wade.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, you see, you’ve never told me what your line is,” he answered, temporizing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, because nobody’s ever told me. It’s exactly what I want to find out,” said the other genially.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And you expect Wade —?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why, I gathered from our good Doctor that it’s his trade. Doesn’t he explain — interpret?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “In his own domain — which is Pellerinism.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Winterman gazed out musingly upon the moon-touched dusk of waters. “And what is Pellerinism?” he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bernald sprang to his feet with a cry. “Ah, I don’t know — but you’re Pellerin!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They stood for a minute facing each other, among the uncertain swaying shadows of the room, with the sea breathing through it as something immense and inarticulate breathed through young Bernald’s thoughts; then Winterman threw up his arms with a humorous gesture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Don’t shoot!” he said.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1348/40501.html","bookId":1467,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 9:22:14 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 9:22:14 AM"}
