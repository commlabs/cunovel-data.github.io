Maybe you should lay off the coffee, yeah?” Brendan tries to grab Winston’s cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWinston slaps at his hand, shoots him a dark look. “Not all of us have electricity running through our veins,” he says. “I’m not a freaking powerhouse of energy like you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I only did that once—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twice!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—and it was an emergency,” he says, looking a little sheepish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you guys talking about?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This guy”—Kenji jerks a thumb at Brendan—“can, like, literally recharge his own body. He doesn’t need to sleep. It’s insane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not fair,” Winston mutters, ripping a piece of bread in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to Brendan, jaw unhinged. “No way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. Shrugs. “I’ve only done it once.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twice!” Winston says again. “And he’s a freaking fetus,” he says to me. “He’s already got way too much energy as it is—shit, all of you kids do—and yet he’s the one who comes with a rechargeable battery life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not a fetus,” Brendan says, spluttering, glancing at me as heat colors his cheeks. “He’s—that’s not—you’re mad,” he says, glaring at Winston.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Winston says, nodding, his mouth full of food again. “I am mad. I’m pissed off.” He swallows. “And I’m cranky as hell because I’m tired. And I’m hungry. And I need more coffee.” He shoves away from the table. Stands up. “I’m going to go get more coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you said it was disgusting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe levels a look at me. “Yes, but I am a sad, sad man with very low standards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s true,” Brendan says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up, fetus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re only allowed one cup,” Kenji points out, looking up to meet Winston’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry, I always tell them I’m taking yours,” he says, and stalks off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenji is laughing, shoulders shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrendan is mumbling “I am not a fetus” under his breath, stabbing at his food with renewed vigor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old are you?” I ask, curious. He’s so white-blond and pale-blue-eyed that he doesn’t seem real. He looks like the kind of person who could never age, who would remain forever preserved in this ethereal form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty-four,” he says, looking grateful for a chance at validation. “Just turned twenty-four, actually. Had my birthday last week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, wow.” I’m surprised. He doesn’t look much older than 18. I wonder what it must be like to celebrate a birthday at Omega Point. “Well, happy birthday,” I say, smiling at him. “I hope—I hope you have a very good year. And”—I try to think of something nice to say—“and a lot of happy days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s staring back at me now, amused, looking straight into my eyes. Grinning. He says, “Thanks.” Smiles a bit wider. “Thanks very much.” And he doesn’t look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face is hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m struggling to understand why he’s still smiling at me, why he doesn’t stop smiling even when he finally looks away, why Kenji keeps glancing at me like he’s trying to hold in a laugh and I’m flustered, feeling oddly embarrassed and searching for something to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what are we going to do today?” I ask Kenji, hoping my voice sounds neutral, normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenji drains his water cup. Wipes his mouth. “Today,” he says, “I’m going to teach you how to shoot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A gun?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup.” He grabs his tray. Grabs mine, too. “Wait here, I’m gonna drop these off.” He moves to go before he stops, turns back, glances at Brendan and says, “Put it out of your head, bro.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrendan looks up, confused. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not going to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wha—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenji stares at him, eyebrows raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrendan’s mouth falls closed. His cheeks are pink again. “I know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.” Kenji shakes his head, and walks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrendan is suddenly in a hurry to go about his day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Juliette? Juliette!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please wake up—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasp as I sit straight up in bed, heart pounding, eyes blinking too fast as they try to focus. I blink blink blink. “What’s going on? What’s happening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kenji is outside,” Sonya says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He says he needs you,” Sara adds, “that something happened—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m tripping out of bed so fast I pull the covers down with me. I’m groping around in the dark, trying to find my suit—I sleep in a pajama set I borrowed from Sara—and making an effort not to panic. “Do you know what’s going on?” I ask. “Do you know—did he tell you anything—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonya is shoving my suit into my arms, saying, “No, he just said that it was urgent, that something happened, that we should wake you up right away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. I’m sure it’s going to be okay,” I tell them, though I don’t know why I’m saying it, or how I could possibly be of any reassurance to them. I wish I could turn on a light but all the lights are controlled by the same switch. It’s one of the ways they conserve power—and one of the ways they manage to maintain the semblance of night and day down here—by only using it during specific hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finally manage to slip into my suit and I’m zipping it up, heading for the door when I hear Sara call my name. She’s holding my boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you—thank you both,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nod several times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m tugging on my boots and running out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slam face-first into something solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething human. Male.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear his sharp intake of breath, feel his hands steady my frame, feel the blood in my body run right out from under me. “Adam,” I gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hasn’t let go of me. I can hear his heart beating fast and hard and loud in the silence between us and he feels too still, too tense, like he’s trying to maintain some kind of control over his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” he whispers, but it sounds like he can’t really breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart is failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adam, I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t let go,” he says, and I feel his hands shake, just a little, as if the effort to keep them in one place is too much for him. “I can’t let go of you. I’m trying, but I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it’s a good thing I’m here then, isn’t it?” Kenji yanks me out of Adam’s arms and takes a deep, uneven breath. “Jesus. Are you guys done here? We have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What—what’s going on?” I stammer, trying to cover up my embarrassment. I really wish Kenji weren’t always catching me in the middle of such vulnerable moments. I wish he could see me being strong and confident. And then I wonder when I began caring about Kenji’s opinion of me. “Is everything okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no idea,” Kenji says as he strides down the dark halls. He must have these tunnels memorized, I think, because I can’t see a thing. I have to practically run to keep up with him. “But,” he says, “I’m assuming some kind of shit has officially hit the fan. Castle sent me a message about fifteen minutes ago—said to get me and you and Kent up to his office ASAP. So,” he says, “that’s what I’m doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—now? In the middle of the night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit hitting the fan doesn’t work around your schedule, princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to stop talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe follow Kenji to a single solitary door at the end of a narrow tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knocks twice, pauses. Knocks 3 times, pauses. Knocks once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if I need to remember that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door creaks open on its own and Castle waves us in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Close the door, please,” he says from behind his desk. I have to blink several times to readjust to the light in here. There’s a traditional reading lamp on Castle’s desk with just enough wattage to illuminate this small space. I use the moment to look around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle’s office is nothing more than a room with a few bookcases and a simple table that doubles as a workstation. Everything is made of recycled metal. His desk looks like it used to be a pickup truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are heaps of books and papers stacked all over the floor; diagrams, machinery, and computer parts shoved onto the bookcases, thousands of wires and electrical units peeking out of their metal bodies; they must either be damaged or broken or perhaps part of a project Castle is working on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words: his office is a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot something I was expecting from someone so incredibly put-together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have a seat,” he says to us. I look around for chairs but only find two upside-down garbage cans and a stool. “I’ll be right with you. Give me one moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe nod. We sit. We wait. We look around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then do I realize why Castle doesn’t care about the disorganized nature of his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seems to be in the middle of something, but I can’t see what it is, and it doesn’t really matter. I’m too focused on watching him work. His hands shift up and down, flick from side to side, and everything he needs or wants simply gravitates toward him. A particular piece of paper? A notepad? The clock buried under the pile of books farthest from his desk? He looks for a pencil and lifts his hand to catch it. He’s searching for his notes and lifts his fingers to find them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t need to be organized. He has a system of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally looks up. Puts his pencil down. Nods. Nods again. “Good. Good; you’re all here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir,” Kenji says. “You said you needed to speak with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed I do.” Castle folds his hands over his desk. “Indeed I do.” Takes a careful breath. “The supreme commander,” he says, “has arrived at the headquarters of Sector 45.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKenji swears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam is frozen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m confused. “Who’s the supreme commander?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle’s gaze rests on me. “Warner’s father.” His eyes narrow, scrutinizing me. “You didn’t know that Warner’s father is the supreme commander of The Reestablishment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” I gasp, unable to imagine the monster that must be Warner’s father. “I—yes—I knew that,” I tell him. “I just didn’t know what his title was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Castle says. “There are six supreme commanders around the world, one for each of the six divisions: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Each section is divided into 555 sectors for a total of 3,330 sectors around the globe. Warner’s father is not only in charge of this continent, he is also one of the founders of The Reestablishment, and currently our biggest threat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I thought there were 3,333 sectors,” I tell Castle, “not 3,330. Am I remembering that wrong?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unravel-me-shatter-me-2/page-22.html","bookId":1772,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:06 AM"}
