I can\u0027t crack their encryption, but if I can physically get into one of their systems, that would let me figure out exactly what they\u0027re up to. If it\u0027s a full-scale attack, we need to know for sure so that we don*t make a big mistake. If we use non-Rubble attackers, then the Rubble can deny this little incursion was our doing if things turn out to be okay with the Kig-Yar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai looked at the AI. \"You want us to board a Covenant ship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And plug me in, yes.\" Juliana nodded. \"My higher functions. I\u0027ll be leaving a simple base copy to keep regulating the Rubble, of course. But the core me will go with the boarding party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuliana was rampant. Or just plain insane, Jai thought. He scratched his chin, then looked at Juliana. \"We\u0027ll need a larger force. We need to free the crew of that UNSC ship that was captured. It\u0027ll have ODSTs aboard. Release those men and we have a force.\" Helljumpers weren\u0027t huge fans of the Spartans, but were somewhat like Spartans, Jai had to admit, but without the altered physiology and powered armor. And they were good fighting men; he was sure he could get them to storm a Jackal ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the sort of thing ODSTs would enjoy doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not the ruler of the Rubble,\" she said. \"Only the Council can release them. Besides, most of those people are tagged with locaters.

But if the cameras, were to malfunction, you could break the crew out and get them to help you before anyone would really notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll have to do.\" Jai turned around. \"Adriana, Mike, you take Bonifacio.

Mike, Adriana, get on the navigation data, and quickly.

There were ten old decommissioned ships that had been landed around\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"the Plaza,\" with the largest Kig-Yar ship towering over them all from the northeast corner. Docking tubes connected the ships like bridges high over the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if Reth chose, he could descend into the ground, where every day the Unggoy warrens spread deeper and farther into the warmed rock. The escape pod he had landed in still sat out on the landing pad of the Plaza, crackling and shimmering from the heat of reentry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d lived in fear for several long minutes, convinced that the Sangheili would get the ship running in time to turn around for him, but they hadn\u0027t. The Sangheili had gotten the ship booted up and kept moving along their trajectory, headed for the Rubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReth needed to order the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInfinite Spoils away from dock along with all the other Kig-Yar ships, but he was reluctant to do so. Soon the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInfinite Spoils would have human Slipspace drives, something the Hierarch hadn\u0027t even granted Reth, but something that all Kig-Yar wanted: a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipspace ship of their own. But first Reth needed to take the Rubble, and any human ships with the drives, for the Kig-Yar. The humans had been stockpiling the Slipspace drives they\u0027d traded for to install in their own machine: the Exodus Project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInfinite Spoils got its drives it would mark something new, as long as the Kig-Yar could spirit it out of the Rubble before the Hierarchs heard of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was about to change, Reth felt, as he took an elevator up into the tall, grounded ship that was the Kig-Yar refuge inside the Redoubt. There were many, many more guards around now than when the Sangheili had broached it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered his room. The remains of the firefight had been cleaned up, the glass replaced so that he could, once again, look out over the Plaza, and the Redoubt as a whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe river of methane on the surface of Metisette rumbled underneath their creation. Its passage turned giant turbines, creating power for the entire complex. The Unggoy thrived here among the mists of methane reclaimed from the rivers and pools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShuttles were already descending from the reddened clouds to touch down on Metisette\u0027s surface. Kig-Yar were forming up in the square below the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebalcony, as well as Unggoy Deacons. All per his command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral of his key advisors hustled up behind him. They looked shocked at the wounds all over his body, and his hunched position. Reth paid the stares no mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have planned for the invasion of the Rubble for a long time,\" Reth said, doing his best to straighten up against the twinges of pain the Sangheili had left him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it time?\" they asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReth smiled. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It is time. Send the orders. Gather the Unggoy out onto the Plaza. Give them their harnesses and masks. Prepare for the attack. We will take it all for our own, and once we have that data, we will continue to their homeworld as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kig-Yar in the room warbled happily. They had been waiting patiently as the humans developed asteroids that the Kig-Yar considered prime for Kig-Yar nests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they would be rewarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go,\" Reth snapped. \"Tend to your functions!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kig-Yar advisors scattered out of the room, bumping into a slew of Unggoy that waited outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were not rocketing into the Rubble just yet. But for all intents and purposes, the invasion had begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter THIRTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHABITAT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eASUNCION, INNER RUBBLE, 23 LIBRAE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first sign for Keyes that something was happening were the shouts from the guards who had been walking the corridor outside. Two of them ran full tilt past Keyes\u0027s cell. Keyes walked over to the bars as the guards dogged shut the thick, metal door leading to the corridor. They pulled out handguns and stepped back from the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faison?\" Keyes shouted down the row of cells. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know,\" came the response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard on the left side of the door looked back at them. \"Quiet!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes pressed his face against the bars to get a better look. As he did, the large metal door exploded inward between the two guards and bounced down the corridor. A heavy cloud of dust hung in the air, making everything hazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething large and gray blurred through the door. The guards shot at it, but not before it smacked into them, knocking them both out with quick blows to the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure paused, and a golden faceplate scanned the rows of cells. Keyes heard Faison\u0027s incredulous voice: \"Holy shit, a Spartan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirt settled on the gray armor, then shook off as the Spartan thudded down along the cells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s the commanding officer?\" it asked loudly from behind the helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes put a hand out through the bars. \"That would be me, Lieutenant Jacob Keyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still couldn\u0027t believe this. Had the Spartan come just for them? Where had he come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan stopped in front of Keyes. \"Back up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes stepped back, and the Spartan gripped the bars and yanked them off their hinges, metal squealing in protest and more dirt falling from where they\u0027d been set into the rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan tossed the door onto the floor behind it and walked into the open cell. \"I have a proposition, Lieutenant Keyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the entryway between the bent bars the face of an AI appeared. \"We may have a way to help you get your crew back to where they belong as well. If you\u0027re interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes leaned out of the open cell. \"I\u0027ll listen to you both.

I\u0027m Jai, Spartan double-oh-six, Gray Team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes shook hands with the large, gauntleted hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need an attack force,\" the Spartan said as he moved from cell to cell. \"To get the AI Juliana into a Jackal ship and back out.

Not something I want to try unless I absolutely have to, and am feeling extremely lucky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough,\" Keyes said. \"You said you could get my crew out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few more mangled bars clattered to the ground. Faison and his ODSTs had rifled through the pockets of the guards-for key cards. Now they moved door to door, unlocking cells with less drama. A crowd of officers and crew now milled about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJai paused in front of Keyes, now that he no longer needed to free prisoners. \"The ship we came in has navigation data. We can join its computers with your ship\u0027s by docking for a Slip-space jump.

ODSTs behind him nodded. \"Beats rotting here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe AI tilted her head. \"Ignatio Delgado has a ship ready for you all.
