Bai Xiaochun still had three shots of Archaean Luminescence left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Vile-Emperor didn’t know that. He had been in a passive position from the beginning of the fight, and Bai Xiaochun continued to speak in a way that didn’t make any sense. Instead of holding back, he took the initiative to say how many shots he had left… except that every single time, he said he only had one….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of that, the Vile-Emperor had no way to guess at the truth, and no way to tell whether or not he could trust what Bai Xiaochun said….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would rather die than trust Bai Xiaochun… and yet, if he didn’t trust him, that would mean he believed… that he had plenty more shots left!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd trusting him… would result in the same thing as before, bitter consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCreating frustrating situations like this was truly a specialty of Bai Xiaochun’s, and the Vile-Emperor realized that. It was a simple truth, and unfortunately, was impossible to deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even the Saint-Emperor had any clue how many shots of Archaean Luminescence Bai Xiaochun had…. However, similar to the Vile-Emperor, he was sure that there had to be some limit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet neither of the emperors would dare to risk everything to find out the truth. Neither fighting nor probing seemed useful at all, and therefore, they both had to admit… that although the Eternal Immortal Domains did not have another archaean… they did have someone who could fight archaeans!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat person was not an equal, but in terms of battle prowess, needed to be treated like one!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he faded away, the Vile-Emperor sighed helplessly and cast a deep glance at Bai Xiaochun. Aware that he had lost an immortal domain, he picked up Celestial Virūpākṣa and vanished!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegarock City was now in ruins. Of the population of millions, more than half had been killed. Those who had survived were grateful to have come out alive, but were also filled with bitterness and anger that defied description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir bitterness was because of how they had been abandoned by the Vile-Emperor, and their rage was because their emperor hadn’t cared at all about whether they lived or died. If Bai Xiaochun hadn\u0027t been able to defeat the red sun from earlier, then everyone would have been killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to say who did it first, but one by one, they began to drop to their knees and kowtow to Bai Xiaochun, who hovered above them in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Emperor Heavenspan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, Emperor Heavenspan!!” In the Eternal Immortal Domains, archaeans were always viewed as emperors, and would be addressed as such!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Bai Xiaochun wasn’t actually in the Archaean Realm, he had fought the Vile-Emperor to a standstill, and therefore, for all intents and purposes, he was an archaean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thus, his form of address changed from King Heavenspan to… Emperor Heavenspan!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were still Heavenspan Realm cultivators hidden in the crowd, and those who had survived the Vile-Emperor’s red sun attack were filled with indescribable excitement. As of this moment, they finally dared to reveal who they were. Stepping out into the open, they offered worship that was different from the other cultivators around them. From the bottoms of their hearts, they completely approved of Bai Xiaochun!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Eternal Lands had five immortal domains, and now… one of them belonged to Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a monumental affair that instantly became the talk of the entire world. In both the Vile-Emperor Dynasty and the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, everyone was shaken by the seemingly impossible news that was shortly proven to be completely accurate!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“King Heavenspan Bai Xiaochun… fought the Vile-Emperor, and they ended in a tie!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heavens! How is that even possible…? King Heavenspan…. Wait, he should be called Emperor Heavenspan, shouldn’t he…? He’s an archaean now!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the first time in years and years, the Eternal Immortal Domains has three archaeans!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So it\u0027s Bai Xiaochun…. If I remember correctly, it was only thirty years ago that he was a celestial! And now he’s an unsurpassable archaean!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps it’s just fate. Years ago, the Saint-Ancestor founded the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, and became an archaean. It was the same with the Vile-Ancestor. And now the Arch-Ancestor has done the same thing. It took a while… but he\u0027s finally an archaean!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll sorts of talk spread through the lands. Especially shocked were the celestials, and the other local cultivators who had come to know Bai Xiaochun personally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Tianjun gasped, and all of the ill will he had previously harbored toward Bai Xiaochun immediately transformed into fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelestial Aged Spirit, Chen Su, and Sima Yunhua were all stunned…. As for the celestials from the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, such as the resurrected Deadfall, and Virūpākṣa… they were more terrified of Bai Xiaochun than they had been before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, the cultivators from the Heavenspan Realm, who had spent so many years of bitterness in the Eternal Immortal Domains, were finally able to throw their heads back and roar with exultation. They knew that, at long last… they had a true foothold within the Eternal Immortal Domains!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs all of this happened, a person appeared outside of Saint-Emperor City!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was young, clad in a white robe, with fair skin and an abstruse gleam in his eyes. After appearing in the air above the imperial palace, he alighted onto one of the petals of the lotus flower and looked out at the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was none other than Bai Xiaochun!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the entire city, only one person and one animal knew that he had arrived!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person was the Saint-Emperor!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the animal was the little turtle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the little turtle could go to him, Bai Xiaochun spoke in a voice that only he could hear, prompting a cold snort. Afterward, the little turtle simply remained in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Saint-Emperor saw that, he breathed a sigh of relief. Mixed emotions on his face, he shook his head and hurried out of the imperial palace to appear next to Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, Saint-Emperor,” Bai Xiaochun said, turning around, a smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter looking Bai Xiaochun up and down, the Saint-Emperor put on an equally bright smile, and said, “Hello, Emperor Heavenspan!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, the two of them began to have a nice conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fellow Daoist Bai, I knew from the moment I first laid eyes on you that you were an extraordinary person. Hahaha! It turns out I was right all along. You are… the third archaean in the Eternal Immortal Domains!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re laying it on a bit thick, Saint-Emperor,” Bai Xiaochun said, sounding very humble. “I’m not an archaean.” Inwardly, he was thinking back to how things had gone when he had first arrived in the Eternal Immortal Domains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Saint-Emperor chuckled. “As far as I\u0027m concerned, you’re an archaean!” With that, the two of them began to reminisce about past times. Neither mentioned Bai Xiaochun’s purpose for coming to visit. Eventually, both of them revealed their auras, whereupon… the celestials of the Saint-Emperor realized what was happening. Shaken, they headed over to the imperial palace, where they saw Bai Xiaochun and the Saint-Emperor on the lotus leaf, talking. Everyone, from Chen Su to Gu Tianjun to Sima Yunhua, were completely shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was especially true considering… that Bai Xiaochun didn’t seem to be even a little bit weaker than the Saint-Emperor. It was like they were complete equals!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Tianjun immediately clasped hands and bowed deeply. “Greetings Saint-Emperor, Emperor Heavenspan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Yunhua and Chen Su were shaken, and quickly offered formal greetings as well. Sima Yunhua was feeling particularly excited. He had developed a nice relationship with Bai Xiaochun, which meant that he now had two archaean emperors to rely on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Gu Tianjun and the others fell into ranks, Bai Xiaochun and the Saint-Emperor talked for a bit longer. Finally, the Saint-Emperor smiled and said, “Bai, old pal, we were friends at first sight, right? Destined to be close. Therefore… why don’t we become sworn brothers?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1207\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1209\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1208","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
