Once we got inside, I settled Davina on the couch, grabbed my cell phone out of my pocket, and flipped it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Davina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m calling nine-one-one,\" I said. \"You need to go to the hospital and I need to report that asshole and have him put in jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped it open, but it was still dead. Damnit. I walked over to the charger and plugged it in. \"I always forget to charge this stupid thing.\" I glanced around. \"And my other phone\u0027s a dead bat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, Olivia. We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the police,\" I said. \"We need to talk with the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One thing you need to learn,\" she said, her eyes suddenly hard and angry. \"Police don\u0027t work for people like us. The police belong to them. We\" - she motioned her hand between us - \"need to take care of our own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He attacked us,\" I said. \"If he\u0027s so magic let him magic himself out of a goddamn jail cell. Just give me a minute, and my phone will charge, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavina took in a breath, and her face looked strained as she closed her eyes and put her hand to her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I just need a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get you some water and some aspirin.\" I went into the kitchen and filled a glass with ice water and grabbed a bottle of Advil. When I got back to the living room, Davina was lying on the couch with her eyes closed. I was going to step out, let her rest while I fumed quietly to myself, but she opened her eyes and reached for the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\" I gave her the water and put the bottle of pills in her hand, then collapsed into the easy chair. Davina sat up to drink the water and take the Advil, then fell back again and let out a long breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s much better,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you ready to explain to me why we\u0027re not having his ass thrown in jail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavina looked at me, and a small smile graced her lips. \"Because he didn\u0027t break any laws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He attacked us. We don\u0027t have to tell them about the gray smoke. We\u0027ll say he hit you in the head with a branch. That\u0027s the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" She smiled up at me. \"You handled him just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t, and I\u0027m not fine,\" I said. \"I just don\u0027t understand why we can\u0027t call the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, her voice firm. \"I\u0027m serious. Police don\u0027t work for people like us. If we call the police, and they see - or sometimes, just think they see - something weird, the next thing you know, we\u0027re gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a chill run down me at the word. \"Gone? What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me, her eyes hard, and then she said, \"\u0027Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\u0027 Exodus 22:18. You think people don\u0027t believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sure. Crazy people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes got beady with anger. \"They use religion, they use science, they use national security, whatever they need to use to justify it, but if you think there aren\u0027t a million little Salems happening every minute of every day, then baby, you\u0027re just being naive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took that in for a moment, then shook my head. \"No. This is Nodaway, it\u0027s not like that here. Betty\u0027s been here for, god, thirty years - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And she\u0027s open with her magic?\" Davina asked. \"Everyone knows about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... no. I mean...\" I sighed, regrouped my argument. \"Look, I know the sheriff. His name is Mickey Taylor, and he\u0027s really nice and he\u0027s known me since I was a kid. I went to school with his son. He would never hurt me, or let anyone else hurt me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavina closed her eyes and shook her head as though lamenting my stupidity, but when she looked at me again, her expression was kind. \"That\u0027s how it used to be. That\u0027s not how it is now. You can\u0027t trust anyone, and things are only going to get worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worse? Worse than being attacked by a homicidal maniac?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met my eyes and said simply, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand how - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think he\u0027s bad now? Imagine how he\u0027ll be when he gets your magic. He could have this kind of power at his disposal, day and night. Someone like that ... well, you just can\u0027t stop someone like that. Not the police, not anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept ... maybe ... Tobias. I thought about it for a moment, but then decided not to tell her about Tobias right now. She was already very agitated, and I didn\u0027t want to make things worse. I could tell her tomorrow. \"Okay. Fine. No cops. So, what\u0027s your big idea, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get you strong, and you need to fight Cain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot up from the easy chair. \"Are you insane? I can\u0027t fight him. I do the magical equivalent of balloon animals, Davina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was raspy as she spoke. \"Right now, yes. But soon, you\u0027re going to have all manner of power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that? Just because my father\u0027s power evolved, or Holly\u0027s did, doesn\u0027t mean mine will. What if this is it, this is all I do? I can make a chicken out of a Tupperware dish; how is that going to defeat a guy like Cain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re right,\" she said thoughtfully. \"If all you can do in the next few days is make balloon animals, then ... well ... we\u0027ll figure something else out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\" But I\u0027d barely gotten the words out before it hit me, so clearly, like the solution had been there all along, only I hadn\u0027t seen it. I pulled back from her and said, \"What if I gave you my magic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at me blankly. \"What the hell are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You. But you wouldn\u0027t have to force me to give you my magic, I\u0027d do it willingly. Godspeed and god bless, take it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really? And have me end up like him? Going crazy every twelve hours, living on potions to keep me hanging on?\" She shook her head. \"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... what if...? What if you just took it and spit it out? Like with snake venom? You\u0027re a conjurer, like him. You\u0027re smart. Can you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flashed over her face and I grabbed her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can! You know something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I don\u0027t. Not really. There\u0027s a possibility that I could do something like that but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great, let\u0027s - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held up her hand. \"This stuff is very dangerous, baby. Your magic ... if someone takes it from you, you\u0027ll be weakened. You could die. Holly died, and I will not see that happen to you, I will not!\" She sighed, reached for my hand, and smiled. \"Don\u0027t worry. You can do this. I will help you, I\u0027ll - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hopped up off the couch. \"You don\u0027t understand. I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavina smiled. \"You did well tonight. You were very brave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re only alive because he didn\u0027t want to kill us yet.\" I took a deep breath. \"I know myself, Davina. I know what I\u0027m capable of, and I\u0027m telling you, I\u0027m not the kind of girl who fights magical battles. I wanted excitement in my life, sure, but the kind that involves flirting with some guy wearing a kilt, not ... not this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Life isn\u0027t a drive-through,\" Davina said. \"Sometimes you get things you didn\u0027t order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I don\u0027t need a motivational poster right now.\" I breathed deep, trying to allay the panic, not getting very far. \"Look, maybe it only kills if it\u0027s taken unwillingly. I mean, I leaked magic to Peach, right? And that didn\u0027t hurt me at all. Hell, I didn\u0027t even know I was doing it. If I can do that, I bet I can find a way to give it to you. Maybe not all of it, but enough that I won\u0027t be useful to him anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, Olivia.\" She patted the space next to her on the couch. \"We don\u0027t have to figure it all out tonight. There\u0027s time. We\u0027ve still got some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down next to her and stared into space, suddenly exhausted. I let my head loll back on the couch, and didn\u0027t realize I\u0027d fallen asleep until I felt a pat on my knee, and my head shot up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time for me to go, baby,\" Davina said, smiling softly. \"And time for you to go to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you stay here tonight?\" I said, rubbing my eyes and yawning. \"I have an extra bedroom. Actually, I have four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, I feel much better now, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to get up, and I hopped up to help her stand, but she managed it on her own, pretty easily, considering how wobbly she\u0027d been on the way home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" I said. \"You heal fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She smiled brightly. \"I\u0027m feeling much better now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you won\u0027t stay?\" I said, walking her toward the door. \"It\u0027ll take me two seconds to put fresh linens in one of the guest rooms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, I\u0027m okay. I\u0027m going to walk. The fresh air will do me good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" I glanced out the panel windows by the door. \"What if he\u0027s still out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m pretty sure he spent what he had tonight,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat makes one of us, I thought. I followed her to the door. \"Hey, where are you staying? I can call you tomorrow, maybe we can go out to lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a fine idea,\" she said. \"Just send the crane for me. I liked that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, she headed out the door. As soon as she was out of sight, I glanced up and down my street, and then heard Davina\u0027s voice echoing eerily in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered, then shut the door and hit the dead bolt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up early the next morning, tossed and turned for a while as the animated orange paper crane flew around my room, possibly still looking for Davina. When the sun finally rose, I caught him in my fingers and whispered for him to stick close to Gibson, sort of a Seeing Eye crane. I let him go, and he floated down to Gibson\u0027s box, covered Gibson protectively with one wing, and ... I think ... fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed out to CCB\u0027s at seven, and found Betty behind the counter. I sat down near the cash register, and she quickly finished pouring coffee for Ray Skipp, then zipped over to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she said, her voice low. \"How are you? I was worried when you didn\u0027t come by last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I\u0027m sorry.\" I met her eye briefly, but couldn\u0027t hold it for long. I\u0027d been jumpy all morning, and I couldn\u0027t shake it. \"We got ... detained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer expression got serious. \"I don\u0027t like the sound of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to like the reality of it, either,\" I said. \"So let me just say, we\u0027re fine, Davina saved us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Saved you? From what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... he kind of ... attacked us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me? What the hell happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told her the story, abbreviated but hitting all the major points, and when I finished she was watching me, her expression grim and determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you spending time with Davina anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not her fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s been nothing but trouble since she got here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Betty - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t trust her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it.\" I leaned forward, keeping my voice down. \"She ran right out in the thick of it, all his dark magic, gray smoke everywhere. She almost got herself killed trying to protect me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if she swallowed dynamite and shot rabbits out of her ass, you are not to spend any more time with her. I don\u0027t trust her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I do. I even wanted to give her my magic, and she - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You what?\" Betty\u0027s whisper was harsh. \"Are you crazy? What if your magic is exactly what she wants?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wasn\u0027t going to take it, take it. Just spit it out, like a snakebite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty made a face. \"Ew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t matter, anyway, she refused. Too dangerous.\" I put my hands to my pounding head. \"Look, Betty, please. It\u0027s been a hell of a few days, and I need you to just trust me, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched me for a long moment, then slowly nodded, although her shoulders didn\u0027t seem to relax at all. \"Fine. If you say she\u0027s all right, I believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" I craned my neck from side to side, trying to get the kinks out. \"So, have you found out where Cain is staying yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty shook her head. \"I went to all the B and B\u0027s, even though he doesn\u0027t seem the B-and-B type - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - and no one\u0027s seen him. I canvassed all the motels within fifty miles, and even asked Happy Larry if he\u0027d seen him around. No joy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is that possible? Fresh meat doesn\u0027t stay hidden in this town, even cranky, scruffy meat. There are too many girls in this town who\u0027d go crazy over something like that.\" I pressed my fingers to the bridge of my nose, then sighed and looked at her, pulling on the best smile I could muster. \"Thanks for trying, Betty. Keep your ear to the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s never anywhere else.\" She watched me and sighed. \"Speaking of which, how is everything shaking out with Millie and Peach?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"It\u0027s not. Hey ... is it possible...? I mean, could she have overridden his will?\" I lowered my voice to a whisper. \"Is there such a thing as magical rape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetty thought for a moment, then slowly shook her head. \"Like I said, most people get innocuous powers. Change the color of a dress, make a pencil fly, that sort of thing. Messing with free will, that\u0027s dark stuff. If there are people who can do that kind of thing, I\u0027ve never had contact with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about a conjurer? Might someone like that be able to make a potion, slip it in Nick\u0027s drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Betty said, although she looked doubtful. \"Maybe. I guess. But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trailed off, and I prodded her. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned forward, her elbows on the counter, her eyes compassionate and sad. \"Have you ever heard of Occam\u0027s razor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. The simplest explanation is usually the correct one, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the simplest explanation here is human nature. Men - especially men who are about to get married - are known for this sort of thing. You don\u0027t need to slip anything into their drinks. You just have to be ... tempting. Millie tempted him, he was human, he messed up.\" She leaned back and wiped down the counter absently with her towel. \"I\u0027m seventy-three years old, Liv, and I\u0027ve seen this happen a lot. Never once has there been any magic involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Still, I couldn\u0027t help but feel like there was something more here. But then, maybe that was just because I didn\u0027t want Peach to be suffering like this. I sighed and put my head in my hands. \"I\u0027m gonna go stand on the magic square and wish it all away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe patted my hand. \"You go do that, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed myself up from the counter and walked over to the square near Booth 9. I sighed and looked down at it, my feet just outside its edges. I wish - I thought, and then I heard my name. I looked up, and Andrew Garvey, the elementary school principal, was holding up an empty coffee mug, looking at me expectantly. I glanced down at my sweatpants and my Mason\u0027s Plumbing T-shirt that read, WE FIX ANY CRACK, and looked back at Andrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet.\" I walked around the magic square, grabbed a carafe from the industrial coffeemaker, and caught Tobias\u0027s eye through the pass as he delivered a waffle order up for Betty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked pissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" I muttered to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Serving coffee.\" I delivered Andrew\u0027s coffee and then headed back into the kitchen, where Tobias was manning the grill while Kenny headbanged on his iPod, supervising the waffle irons. Tobias shot a look at me and whistled loudly to Kenny, who raised his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take over for me, Ken. I\u0027m on break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout skipping a headbanging beat, Kenny walked over and monitored the grill. Tobias took me by the elbow and led me out toward the back dock. On the way, I grabbed a small ceramic prep bowl full of raspberries off the counter and then followed dutifully until we were sitting, once again, in the two nylon camping chairs in the back. I sat down, pulled out a raspberry, and popped it in my mouth. Man, they were good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you were going to stay home,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was,\" I said. \"But, you know, best laid plans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t a joke,\" Tobias said. \"I was going to come by and see you after my shift.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I said, sitting forward a bit. \"Did you find something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much. I made some calls to friends, just preliminary stuff. His name is Cain Taggart. From Hastings, Tennessee. He\u0027s a conjurer, although he didn\u0027t show up on Magical radar - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys have Magical radar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe edge of Tobias\u0027s mouth quirked up a bit. \"I mean, they only first heard of him recently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back, flushing at my own stupidity as I chewed on another raspberry. \"Shut up. I don\u0027t understand how this world works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Don\u0027t worry about it. Few people do. Anyway, he dropped off the surface about two months ago, and no one has seen or heard from him since.\" He cleared his throat. \"I also looked into your friend Davina.\" He gave me a look. \"She didn\u0027t show up anywhere at all. Are you sure her real name is Davina Granville?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. \"I didn\u0027t check her driver\u0027s license or anything, no. But she says she\u0027s just a small-time conjurer. Maybe she\u0027s just never done anything to show up on your radar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias shrugged. \"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the raspberries down on the ground and leaned forward, looking at Tobias. \"I trust her. She almost got herself killed last night protecting me - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night? What happened last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cain attacked us,\" I said, then held up my hand as Tobias sat forward. \"I tried to call you, my cell phone was dead, and by the time I could contact you, we were home safe and I was exhausted. I\u0027m telling you now. Please back off, okay? If I have to deal with one more well-intentioned but overprotective person in my life, I\u0027m going to throw myself headfirst into the falls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias smiled. \"Well, that would be bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" I said. \"I could get wet. And possibly even a little muddy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, the flush was his, appearing at the base of his neck. I felt myself warm up all over, and this time, I didn\u0027t think the tingling I felt was from any paranormal source. I reached down and grabbed the bowl of raspberries again, cupping it in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he said after a while, his voice just as calm and in control as always. \"You\u0027re okay, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him, and our eyes met again, and there was more tingling, all over. Oy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said, my voice soft. \"I\u0027m fi - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s when something small hit my face and bounced off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the...?\" I pulled back a bit and swatted at the air by my face. \"What was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" Tobias said flatly, \"it was a flying raspberry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hopped up out of the chair and looked inside the ceramic bowl I\u0027d been holding; it was empty. I glanced around and a number of raspberry butterflies zoomed around the patio, their wings seeming to be made of some kind of raspberry juice vapor, my yellow light flickering around them as they flew. I checked my fingers and I caught the last fading glimpse of the light on my fingers; I hadn\u0027t touched the raspberries at the time of transformation, nor did I intend to change them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvolving power, I thought, and my throat tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wayward raspberry that had hit me in the face now flew drunkenly around Tobias\u0027s head, then backed up a bit, as if trying to get a good look at us, as though we were the freaks of nature. For his part, Tobias stared back at it, equally mesmerized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe raspberries flew around us, tightening their circle, occasionally bouncing off my shoulder or the back of Tobias\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he said, ducking a raspberry as it buzzed his head, \"this is interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The charm wears off after a while, trust me.\" I watched the raspberries fly around, wondering what the hell I was supposed to do now. \"Davina said I should practice. I guess I should try to undo them? Maybe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias motioned toward the swarm. \"This is gonna be fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and concentrated, trying to remember what Davina had said to me the other night about pulling the energy back in. It\u0027s mine, I thought. I\u0027m not killing anything. I\u0027m just pulling what\u0027s mine back to me. I took a deep breath and closed my eyes, locating the raspberries around me, visualizing them as tiny yellow balls of my energy floating around me. One by one, I pulled the yellow light back in, and one by one, I heard the tiny plops around me. The energy flowed back into me, and for a moment, my limbs buzzed and my stomach dropped, the jolt of power hitting me like a steep decline on a roller coaster. But then I absorbed it, and my body calmed. I was getting stronger, just as Davina had said I would. I could feel the magic inside me, buzzing throughout me, waiting to be of use. And if I didn\u0027t figure out how to control it, it would control me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around at the scattered raspberries on the ground. I concentrated on one, and it took a moment to get it right, but soon, wisps of yellow light surrounded it and I floated it into the air. While holding that one up, I allowed my concentration to spread to the others, finding all of them and lifting them up as well. Slowly, I circled them around and around, until they whirled around us like a Ferris wheel on its side. I let the energy hum for a bit, enjoying the feel of the power, and then, I pulled the magic back into myself and let them drop, one by one, perfectly aimed into the center of the little ceramic dish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally allowed myself to meet his eyes again, Tobias was staring at me, concern on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all right?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess.\" I looked up at him. \"My power is evolving, just like Davina said it would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that means I\u0027m going to have to fight this guy.\" My legs started to shake. \"Tobias, I don\u0027t want to fight this guy. I don\u0027t want to fight anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up and walked over to me. \"It\u0027s a little late for that.\" He put both hands on either side of my face and guided me to look at him. \"If you have to fight, you\u0027ll fight. But you won\u0027t fight alone, ever. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took in a sharp breath, only then realizing that I had stopped breathing in my panic. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward and kissed me on the forehead. \"Go on home. Lock the doors. Get some rest. I\u0027m gonna follow up on some things after my shift, but I\u0027ll be by later tonight, if that\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not too overprotective of me? All the hovering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said, \"but it\u0027s okay. I kind of like it when you hover, sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right then.\" He smiled. \"Call me if you need me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took my index finger and crossed over my heart. He hesitated a moment, then gave a little wave and went back inside. I folded up the chairs and tucked them back into the corner of the patio, then headed down the alley to Main Street, just walking home as if I were a normal woman on a normal day doing normal things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of which was exactly the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI killed the afternoon sitting on my porch swing, watching the neighborhood and thinking. I knew I should have gone inside and thrown the bolt when the sun set, but what difference did it make? If Cain wanted to come after me, what would I be able to do to stop him? Was my little dead bolt going to stop a guy who had both conjuring and magical powers? My guess was that if he wanted me, he would come and get me, and there wasn\u0027t much I could do about it if he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing like a little fatalism to make the day complete,\" I muttered to myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, a big white van with the EASTER LANDSCAPING logo on the side pulled into my street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell,\" I said as Nick pulled the van in front of Peach\u0027s house. He slammed the door, walked up onto Peach\u0027s porch, and banged on the door. Nick was short, stocky, and bald as a cue ball, but he was powerful and determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peach!\" he yelled, then stepped back off the porch and looked up at her bedroom window, where her light was on. \"Peach!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light shut off, and Nick waited for a bit, then when there was no sign of Peach, he shouted again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re up there! Come out and talk to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crap.\" I got up and walked out to the sidewalk. \"She doesn\u0027t want to talk to you, Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and his eyes fixed on me. \"Liv!\" He rushed over to me, and only then could I see the frantic desperation in his eyes. \"Liv, you have to help me. Go talk to her for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eyed him coldly. \"Why would I do that? You broke her heart, you big bald asshole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" He ran his hand over his head, and shook it, as if he didn\u0027t understand what was happening. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help it; I felt myself softening toward him. On the one hand, Occam\u0027s razor. On the other hand, strange things had been happening lately, and Millie was at the center of it all. That bought Nick a little leeway. A little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" I said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me, his eyes glazed. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never thought of Millie that way. Never. It just happened, and it was like ... like I didn\u0027t have any control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you guys drinking anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, and lowered his eyes. \"Just coffee. I don\u0027t know what happened. We stay late and do taxes once every quarter. I get Chinese food and we knock it out and it\u0027s always fine. It\u0027s always ... you know ... Millie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there she was, all sexy in her red dress...\" I said, but Nick shook his head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like the change,\" he said. \"It\u0027s not Millie. I get that she wanted to change, and that\u0027s her business, really, but to be honest? I liked her better before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you slept with her now,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back against his van, obviously confused. \"I don\u0027t know what the hell I was thinking.\" He swiped at his eyes, rubbing them briskly before going on. \"I love Peach, Liv. She\u0027s the one. I never thought in a million years a woman like that would want a guy like me. Why would I do this to her, to myself? I\u0027ve never cheated on a woman I\u0027ve been dating, never. But the one woman I really wanted, the one woman I actually...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe trailed off, his voice choked, his misery visible in his slumped shoulders and the tears that welled in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew Occam\u0027s razor. Somehow, this was Cain\u0027s handiwork. I didn\u0027t know how, but it was, I was sure of it. I reached out and patted his arm. \"I believe you, Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his head to look at me, a tiny smile, almost imperceptible through all that misery, on his lips. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, so you\u0027re going to try to sleep with Liv, now? Is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up to Peach\u0027s porch, where she was standing watching us, her body tense with fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peach,\" I began, but she didn\u0027t hear me. Her eyes were focused on Nick as she barreled down on him, her arms flailing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hate you!\" she yelled. I stepped in between them and clasped my hands on her elbows, keeping her from swinging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peach, calm down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to talk,\" Nick said. \"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well I don\u0027t want to talk to you!\" she hollered at him over my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI angled my head toward Nick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go home,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll take care of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick hesitated for a minute, and was about to get back into his van when I heard a wild cracking sound, and felt Peach jerk in my arms. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-little-night-magic-nodaway-falls-1/page-12.html","bookId":2134,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:02 PM"}
