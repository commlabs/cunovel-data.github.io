{"id":68500,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe drive to the beach house took an hour of actual time and twenty years of memories. There was so much for Melina to think about, so much to recall. Costa, young and handsome, saying, Surely you\u0027ve been sent from the heavens to teach us mortals what beauty is. You\u0027re beyond flattery. Nothing I could say would do you justice...The wonderful cruises on their yacht and idyllic vacations on Psara...The days of lovely surprise gifts and the nights of wild lovemaking. And then the miscarriage, and the string of mistresses, and the affair with Noelle Page. And the beatings and public humiliations. Monnareemou! You have nothing to live for, he had said. Why don\u0027t you kill yourself? And, finally, the threat to destroy Spyros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what, in the end, Melina was unable to bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Melina arrived at the beach house, it was deserted. The sky was cloudy, and there was a chill wind blowing from the sea. An omen, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked into the comforting, friendly house and looked around for the last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she began to overturn furniture and smash lamps. She ripped off her dress and let it fall to the floor. She took out the card from the detective agency and placed it on a table. She lifted the rug and put the gold button under it. Next she took off the gold wristwatch that Costa had given her and smashed it against the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up her husband\u0027s swim trunks that she had taken from the house and carried them out to the beach. She wet them in the water and returned to the house. Finally, there was only one thing left to do. It\u0027s time, she thought. She took a deep breath and slowly picked up the butcher knife and unwrapped it, careful not to disturb the tissue paper that covered the handle. Melina held it in her hand, staring at it. This was the crucial part. She had to stab herself hard enough to make it look like murder, and at the same time have enough strength left to carry out the rest of her plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes and plunged the knife deep into her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain was excruciating. Blood began to pour out. Melina held the wet bathing trunks to her side, and when they were covered with blood she walked over to a closet and shoved them in the back. She was beginning to feel dizzy. She looked around to make sure she had not missed anything, then she stumbled toward the door that led to the beach, her blood staining the carpet a bright crimson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved toward the ocean. The blood was coming out faster now, and she thought, I\u0027m not going to make it. Costa is going to win. I mustn\u0027t let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walk to the ocean seemed to take forever. One more step, she thought. One more step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept walking, fighting the dizziness that engulfed her. Her vision was beginning to blur. She fell to her knees. I mustn\u0027t stop now. She rose and kept walking until she felt the cold water lapping at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the salt water hit her wound, she screamed aloud with the unbearable pain. I\u0027m doing it for Spyros, she thought. Dear Spyros.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance she could see a low cloud hovering over the horizon. She began to swim toward it, trailing a stream of blood. And a miracle happened. The cloud came down to her, and she could feel its white softness enveloping her, bathing her, caressing her. The pain was gone now, and she felt a wonderful feeling of peace steal over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going home, Melina thought happily. I\u0027m going home at last. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-26.html","bookId":2362,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:29 AM"}
