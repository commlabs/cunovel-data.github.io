She was staring at the floor, her hands clenched together. She seemed to be so distressed, some of Caine\u0027s anger dissipated. \"It\u0027s all right, Jade,\" he soothed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What 1 lost can easily be replaced.\" He turned back to Perry and asked, \"No one was hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon watched Jade while the servant stammered out the news that all the servants had gotten out in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine was relieved. He was about to give fresh orders to his groom when Lyon interrupted him. \"Let me handle the authorities and the servants,\" he suggested. \"You need to get Jade out of London, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Caine answered. He was trying not to alarm Jade but he\u0027d already guessed the fire had something to do with the men chasing after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perry, go to the kitchen and get something to drink,\" Lyon ordered. \"There\u0027s always ale and brandy on the counter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servant hurried to comply with that suggestion, Lyon and Caine both stared at Jade now, waiting for her to say something. She stared at the floor. She was wringing her hands together..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade?\" Caine asked when she continued to hold her silence. \"Why don\u0027t you believe it was an accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a long sigh before answering. \"Because it isn\u0027t the first fire, Caine. It\u0027s the third they\u0027ve set. They do seem, partial to fires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her gaze to look at him. He could see the tears in her eyes then. \"They\u0027ll try again, and again, until they finally catch you . . . and me,\" she hastily added. \"Inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying they mean to kill you by ... ?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade shook her head. \"They don\u0027t just mean to kill me now,\" she whispered. She looked at Caine and started to cry. \"They mean to kill him, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Six\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade wiped the tears away from her face with the backs of her hands. \"They must have somehow learned your true identity,\" she whispered. \"When I went into the tavern, I thought you were Pagan . . . but they must have known all along, Caine. Why else would they burn your town house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine went to her and put his arm around her shoulders. He led her back into the drawing room. \"Monk wouldn\u0027t have told them,\" he announced. \"I don\u0027t know how they could have .. . never mind. Jade, no more half explanations,\" he ordered. \"I have to know everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you anything you want to know,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon followed the pair inside the salon. He shut the doors behind him and then took his seat across from the settee. Caine gently forced Jade to sit down beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade looked at Lyon. \"I think we lost them last night when we jumped into the Thames. Perhaps, if you told Perry to pretend to continue his search looking for Caine, whoever is watching will assume you didn\u0027t know where we were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon thought that was an excellent plan. He immediately agreed and went in search of the servant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he left the room, Jade turned to Caine. \"I can\u0027t stay with you. I understand that now. They\u0027ll kill you trying to get to me. I\u0027ve tried not to like you, sir, but I\u0027ve failed in that endeavor. It would upset me if you were hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to leave after making that explanation but Caine wouldn\u0027t let her move. He tightened his hold around her and hauled her up close to his side. \"I have also tried not to like you,\" he whispered. He kissed the top of her head before continuing. \"But I\u0027ve also failed in that endeavor. We seem to be stuck with each other, sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at each other a long while. Jade broke the silence. \"Isn\u0027t it peculiar, Caine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" he countered in a whisper to match hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve just lost your town house, we\u0027re both in terrible danger now, and all I want is for you to kiss me. Isn\u0027t that peculiar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. His hand moved to cup her chin. \"No,\" he answered. \"I want to kiss you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\" Her eyes widened. \"Well, isn\u0027t that the . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damnedest thing?\" he whispered as he leaned down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she sighed against his mouth. \"It is the damnedest thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth took possession of hers then, ending their conversation. Jade immediately wrapped her arms around his neck. Caine nudged her mouth open by applying subtle pressure on her chin, and when she\u0027d done as he wanted, his tongue swept inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe meant only to take a quick taste, but the kiss quickly got out of control. His mouth slanted over hers with hard insistence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t get enough of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the love of... Caine, now isn\u0027t the time to .. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon had made those half statements from the doorway, then strolled back over to his chair. Caine, he noticed, was reluctant to stop kissing Jade. She didn\u0027t have such reservations, however, and shoved herself away from her partner with amazing speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was beet red when she glanced over at Lyon. Since he was grinning at her, she turned her attention\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto her lap. She realized then that she was clutching Caine\u0027s hand against her bosom, and immediately tossed it aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You forget yourself, sir,\" she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided not to remind her that she\u0027d been the one to bring up the topic of kissing in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s high time we heard her explanation,\" Lyon ordered. \"Jade?\" he asked, though in a much\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esofter tone when he saw the startle his booming voice had caused. Lord, she was timid. \"Why don\u0027t you tell us about the first fire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will try,\" she answered, her gaze still downcast. \"But the memory still gives me the shivers. Please don\u0027t think me a weak woman.\" She turned to look up at Caine. \"I\u0027m really not weak at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon nodded. \"Then can we begin?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, before you tell us about the fires, why don\u0027t you give us a little background?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father was the Earl of Wakerfields. Nathan, my brother, has that title now, along with numerous others, of course. Father died when I was eight years old. I remember he was on his way to London to see another man. I was in the garden when he came to say goodbye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you were so young, how can you remember?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Papa was very upset,\" she answered. \"He frightened me and I think that must be the reason I remember it all so clearly. He kept pacing back and forth along the path with his hands clasped behind his back and he kept telling me that if anything happened to him, Nathan and I were to go to his friend, Harry. He was so insistent I pay attention to what he was telling me that he grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was more interested in the trinkets I wanted him to bring home for me.\" Her voice took on a wistful quality when she added, \"I was very young.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still young,\" Caine interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t feel young,\" she admitted. She straightened her shoulders and continued. \"My mother died\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen I was just an infant, so I don\u0027t have any memory of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to your father?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He died in a carriage mishap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had a premonition, then?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No; he had an enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you believe your father\u0027s enemy is now after you? Is that the reason for your fears?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No, no,\" she blurted out. \"I saw someone murdered. The men who killed him did get a good look at me. The only reason I told you about my father was because you asked me to explain to you my ... background. Yes, Lyon, that was your very word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Lyon said again. \"I didn\u0027t mean to jump to conclusions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened after your father died?\" Caine asked. He was suddenly feeling immensely superior to his good friend, as Lyon now looked thoroughly confused and bewildered. It was nice to know he wasn\u0027t the only one muddled around Jade. Damned nice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After the burial service, Harry came to get us. When the summer was over, he sent Nathan back to school. He knew our father would have wanted my brother to finish his education. I stayed with my uncle. He isn\u0027t really my uncle,,, he\u0027s actually more like a father to me now. Anyway, he took me to his island where it\u0027s always warm and peaceful. Uncle Harry was very good to me. He\u0027d never married, you see, and I was just like his very own daughter. We got along well together. Still, I missed my brother. Nathan was only able to come and visit us once in all those years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she paused and gave Caine such an expectant look, he gently prodded her into continuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came back to England so I could see Nathan, of course. I also wanted to see my father\u0027s house again. Nathan had made several changes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\" Lyon asked when she paused again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan met me in London. We went directly to his country home and spent a wonderful week together catching up. Then he was called away on an important personal matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what this matter was?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Not all of it. A messenger arrived with a letter for Nathan. My brother became very upset when he read it. He told me he had to return to London and that he would be back in two weeks. His good friend was in trouble. That\u0027s all he would tell me, Caine. Nathan\u0027s an honorable man. He would never turn his back on a friend in need, and I would never ask him to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you were left alone?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, heavens no. Nathan had a complete staff in residence. Lady Briars . . . she was a good friend of my father\u0027s .. . well, she\u0027d hired the staff and even helped Nathan with his renovation plans. She wanted to raise us, you see, and was going to petition the court for guardianship. Then Harry took us away, and she never could find us. I will have to go and see her as soon as this has been settled. I dared not go before, of course. They\u0027ll probably burn her house to the ground if they ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, you\u0027re digressing,\" Caine interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. Now where was I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan left for London,\" Lyon reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she replied. \"I now realize I did do something foolish. On my island, I could come and go as I wished. I never had to worry about an escort. I\u0027d forgotten that England isn\u0027t at all the same. Here, everyone must lock their doors. Anyway, I was in such a hurry to get outside, I wasn\u0027t looking down, you see, and the heel of my boot got caught up in the carpet loop on the way down the stairs. I took\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equite a tumble,\" she added. \"And hit my head on the knob of the banister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused, waiting to hear their remarks of sympathy. When both men just continued to look at her so expectantly, she decided neither was going to say anything. She gave them both a disgruntled look for being so insensitive, then continued. \"About an hour later, after my head quit pounding from my fall, I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eset out on my own for a brisk walk. I soon forgot all about my aches and pains, and because it was such\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea glorious day, I forgot the time. I was just about to look inside the pretty church when I heard all the commotion, and that\u0027s when I saw the poor man being pitched to the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. \"I shouted and went running,\" she explained. \"I had lost my direction though, and I ended up on the rise directly above my parents\u0027 graves. That\u0027s when I saw the men again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The same men?\" Lyon asked. He was leaning forward in his chair, his elbows braced on his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, the very same men,\" Jade answered. She sounded bewildered. \"They must have decided it wasn\u0027t worth their effort to chase after me, and they were very . . . occupied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were they doing?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t immediately answer him. A feeling of foreboding settled around his heart. Her hands were clinging to his now. Caine doubted she was aware of that telling action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The digging,\" she finally answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were digging up the graves?\" Lyon asked, his voice incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine didn\u0027t show any outward reaction. Lyon looked as though he didn\u0027t believe her. She thought it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eodd indeed that she could tell a lie and both men easily accepted it, yet now when she was telling them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe full truth, it was quite another story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really true,\" she told Lyon. \"I know it sounds bizarre, but I know what I saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Caine answered. \"What happened next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I started shouting again,\" she answered. \"Oh, I realize I shouldn\u0027t have made a sound, for now I\u0027d drawn their notice again. But I was so outraged I wasn\u0027t thinking properly. All three men turned to look up at me. The fancy dressed man held a pistol. Odd, but I couldn\u0027t seem to move until the shot rang out. I ran like lightning then. Hudson, Nathan\u0027s butler, was working inside the library. I told him what happened, but by the time he\u0027d calmed me down and gained the full story, it was too dark to go looking for the men. We had to wait until the following morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were the authorities notified?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"This is where it becomes a little confusing,\" she admitted. \"The next morning, Hudson, with several strong men, went to find the body I\u0027d seen pitched from the rooftop. Hudson wouldn\u0027t let me tag along. I was still very upset.1\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you were,\" Caine agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she replied with a sigh. \"When Hudson and the men returned, they were trying to be as kind as you are now ibeing, Caine, but they had to tell me the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They couldn\u0027t find any t\u0026gt;ody. The graves hadn\u0027t been touched either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027So they believed you were just...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Imagining, Lyon?\" she interrupted. \"Yes, I\u0027m certain they did. Because they were in Nathan\u0027s employ, they didn\u0027t dare tell me they thought I was .. . addled, but their expressions spoke for them. I immediately went back to the grave to see for myself. The wind and rain had been fierce the night before, yet even so, it didn\u0027t look as though the ground had been touched by a shovel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps they\u0027d only just begun to dig when you interrupted them,\" Caine suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, they had only just begun,\" she admitted, \"I\u0027ll never forget their faces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us the rest of this,\" Caine suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I spent the rest of the day trying to understand what their motives were. Then I went to Hudson and told him not to bother Nathan with this problem. I lied to the butler and told him I was certain it was just the setting sun playing tricks on me. I must tell you Hudson looked very relieved. He was still worried, of course, since I\u0027d taken that fall down the stairs and bumped my head.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-11.html","bookId":1791,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM"}
