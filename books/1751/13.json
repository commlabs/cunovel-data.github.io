He felt very much the guest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Where are the youngsters? My son isn\u0027t in his room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Industrialist smiled. \"They\u0027ve been out for hours. However, breakfast was forced into them by the women some time ago, so there is nothing to worry about. Youth, Doctor, youth!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Youth!\" The word seemed to depress the Astronomer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ate breakfast in silence. The Industrialist said once, \"You really think they\u0027ll come. The day looks so-normal.\";\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Astronomer said, \"They\u0027ll come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward the Industrialist said, \"You\u0027ll pardon me. I can\u0027t conceive your playing so elaborate a hoax. You really spoke to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As I speak to you. At least, in a sense. They can project thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gathered that must be so from your letter. How, I wonder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could not say. I asked them and, of course, they were vague. Or perhaps it was just that I could not understand. It involves a projector for the focusing of thought and, even more than that, conscious attention on the part of both projector and receptor. It was quite a while before I realized they were trying to think at me. Such thought projectors may be part of the science they will give us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" said the Industrialist. \"Yet think of the changes it would bring to society. A thought projector!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Change would be good for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is only in old age that change is unwelcome,\" said the Astronomer, \"and races can be old as well as individuals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Industrialist pointed out the window. \"You see that road. It was built Beforethewars. I don\u0027t know exactly when. It is as good now as the day it was built. We couldn\u0027t possibly duplicate it now. The race was young when that was built, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then? Yes! At least they weren\u0027t afraid of new things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I wish they had been. Where is the society of Beforethewars? Destroyed, Doctor! What good were youth and new things? We are better off now. The world is peaceful and jogs along. The race goes nowhere but after all, there is nowhere to go. They proved that. The men who built the road. I will speak with your visitors as I agreed, if they come. But I think I will only ask them to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The race is not going nowhere,\" said the Astronomer earnestly. \"It is going toward final destruction. My university has a smaller student body each year. Fewer books are written. Less work is done. An old man sleeps in the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging, but each day finds him nearer death all the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, well,\" said the Industrialist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t dismiss it. Listen. Before I wrote you, I investigated your position in the planetary economy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you found me solvent?\" interrupted the Industrialist, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, yes. Oh, I see, you are joking. And yet-perhaps the joke is not far off. You are less solvent than your father and he was less solvent than his father. Perhaps your son will no longer be solvent. It becomes too troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still exist, though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of Beforethewars. We will be back to village economy, and then to what? The caves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the infusion of fresh technological knowledge will be the changing of all that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just the new knowledge. Rather the whole effect of change, of a broadening of horizons. Look, sir, I chose you to approach in this matter not only because you were rich and influential with government officials, but because you had an unusual reputation, for these days, of daring to break with tradition. Our people will resist change and you would know how to handle them, how to see to it that-that-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That the youth of the race is revived?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With its atomic bombs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The atomic bombs,\" returned the Astronomer, \"need not be the end of civilization. These visitors of mine had their atomic bomb, or whatever their equivalent was on their own worlds, and survived it, because they didn\u0027t give up. Don\u0027t you see? It wasn\u0027t the bomb that defeated us, but our own shell shock. This may be the last chance to reverse the process.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" said the Industrialist, \"what do these friends from space want in return?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Astronomer hesitated. He said, \"I will be truthful with you. They come from a denser planet. Ours is richer in the lighter atoms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want magnesium? Aluminum?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. Carbon and hydrogen. They want coal and oil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Astronomer said quickly, \"You are going to ask why creatures who have mastered space travel, and therefore atomic power, would want coal and oil. I can\u0027t answer that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Industrialist smiled, \"But I can. This is the best evidence yet of the truth of your story. Superficially, atomic power would seem to preclude the use of coal and oil. However, quite apart from the energy gained by their combustion, they remain, and always will remain, the basic raw material for all organic chemistry. Plastics, dyes, pharmaceuticals, solvents. Industry could not exist without them, even in an atomic age. Still, if coal and oil are the low price for which they would sell us the troubles and tortures of racial youth, my answer is that the commodity would be dear if offered gratis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Astronomer sighed and said, \"There are the boys I\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were visible through the open window, standing together in the grassy field and lost in animated conversation. The Industrialist\u0027s son pointed imperiously and the Astronomer\u0027s son nodded and made off at a run toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Industrialist said, \"There is the youth you speak of. Our race has as much of it as it ever had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but we age them quickly and pour them into the mold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim scuttled into the room, the door banging behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Astronomer said in mild disapproval, \"What\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim looked up in surprise and came to a halt. \"I beg your pardon. I didn\u0027t know anyone was here. I am sorry to have interrupted.\" His enunciation was almost painfully precise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Industrialist said, \"It\u0027s all right, youngster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Astronomer said, \"Even if you had been entering an empty room, son, there would be no cause for slamming a door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nonsense,\" insisted the Industrialist. \"The youngster has done no harm. You simply scold him for being young. You, with your views!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to Slim, \"Come here, lad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim advanced slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you like the country, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very much, sir, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My son has been showing you about the place, has he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. Red-I mean-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Call him Red. I call him that myself. Now tell me, What are you two up to, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim looked away. \"Why-just exploring, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Industrialist turned to the Astronomer. \"There you are, youthful curiosity and adventure lust. The race has not yet lost it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlim said, \"Sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, lad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe youngster took a long time in getting on with it. He said, \"Red sent me in for something good to eat, but I don\u0027t exactly know what he meant. I didn\u0027t like to say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, just ask Cook. She\u0027ll have something good for young-\u0027uns to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no, sir. I mean for animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For animals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. What do animals eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Astronomer said, \"I am afraid my son is city-bred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said the Industrialist, \"there\u0027s no harm in that. What kind of an animal, lad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A small one, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then try grass or leaves, and if they don\u0027t want that, nuts or berries would probably do the trick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, sir,\" Slim ran out again, closing the door gently behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Astronomer said, \"Do you suppose they\u0027ve trapped an animal alive?\" He was obviously perturbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s common enough. There\u0027s no shooting on my estate and it\u0027s tame country, full of rodents and small creatures. Red is always coming home with pets of one sort or another. They rarely maintain his interest for long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the wall clock. \"Your friends should have been here by now, shouldn\u0027t they?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-martian-way-and-other-stories/page-13.html","bookId":1751,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:15 AM"}
