It was the hour which would have been sunset in a level region; the tops of the mountains were touched with a purple light, and the air was fresh and chill with early fall. Down the darkening streets he saw a gathering of men; there was shouting, and people running towards the place, so he hurried up, with the thought in his mind, “What\u0027s the matter now?” There were perhaps a hundred men crying out, their voices mingling like the sound of waves on the sea. He could make out words: “Go on! Go on! We\u0027ve had enough of it! Hurrah!” \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What\u0027s happened?” he asked, of some one on the outskirts; and the man, recognising him, raised a cry which ran through the throng: “Joe Smith! He\u0027s the boy for us! Come in here, Joe! Give us a speech!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But even while Hal was asking questions, trying to get the situation clear, other shouts had drowned out his name. “We\u0027ve had enough of them walking over us!” And somebody cried, more loudly, “Tell us about it! Tell it again! Go on!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A man was standing upon the steps of a building at one side. Hal stared in amazement; it was Tim Rafferty. Of all people in the world—Tim, the light-hearted and simple, Tim of the laughing face and the merry Irish blue eyes! Now his sandy hair was tousled and his features distorted with rage. “Him near dead!” he yelled. “Him with his voice gone, and couldn\u0027t move his hand! Eleven years he\u0027s slaved for them, and near killed in an accident that\u0027s their own fault—every man in this crowd knows it\u0027s their own fault, by God!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sure thing! You\u0027re right!” cried a chorus of voices “Tell it all!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They give him twenty-five dollars and his hospital expenses—and what\u0027ll his hospital expenses be? They\u0027ll have him out on the street again before he\u0027s able to stand. You know that—they done it to Pete Cullen!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You bet they did!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Them damned lawyers in there—gettin\u0027 \u0027em to sign papers when they don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doin\u0027. An\u0027 me that might help him can\u0027t get near! By Christ, I say it\u0027s too much! Are we slaves, or are we dogs, that we have to stand such things?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We\u0027ll stand no more of it!” shouted one. “We\u0027ll go in there and see to it ourselves!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come on!” shouted another. “To hell with their gunmen!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hal pushed his way into the crowd. “Tim!” he cried. “How do you know this?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There\u0027s a fellow in there seen it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can\u0027t tell you—they\u0027d fire him; but it\u0027s somebody you know as well as me. He come and told me. They\u0027re beatin\u0027 me old father out of damages!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They do it all the time!” shouted Wauchope, an English miner at Hal\u0027s side. “That\u0027s why they won\u0027t let us in there.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They done the same thing to my father!” put in another voice. Hal recognised Andy, the Greek boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And they want to start Number Two in the mornin\u0027!” yelled Tim. “Who\u0027ll go down there again? And with Alec Stone, him that damns the men and saves the mules!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We\u0027ll not go back in them mines till they\u0027re safe!” shouted Wauchope. “Let them sprinkle them—or I\u0027m done with the whole business.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And let \u0027em give us our weights!” cried another. “We\u0027ll have a check-weighman, and we\u0027ll get what we earn!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So again came the cry, “Joe Smith! Give us a speech, Joe! Soak it to \u0027em! You\u0027re the boy!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hal stood helpless, dismayed. He had counted his fight won—and here was another beginning! The men were looking to him, calling upon him as the boldest of the rebels. Only a few of them knew about the sudden change in his fortunes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even while he hesitated, the line of battle had swept past him; the Englishman, Wauchope, sprang upon the steps and began to address the throng. He was one of the bowed and stunted men, but in this emergency he developed sudden lung-power. Hal listened in astonishment; this silent and dull-looking fellow was the last he would have picked for a fighter. Tom Olson had sounded him out, and reported that he would hear nothing, so they had dismissed him from mind. And here he was, shouting terrible defiance!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They\u0027re a set of robbers and murderers! They rob us everywhere we turn! For my part, I\u0027ve had enough of it! Have you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was a roar from every one within reach of his voice. They had all had enough.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All right, then—we\u0027ll fight them!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hurrah! Hurrah! We\u0027ll have our rights!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jeff Cotton came up on the run, with “Bud” Adams and two or three of the gunmen at his heels. The crowd turned upon them, the men on the outskirts clenching their fists, showing their teeth like angry dogs. Cotton\u0027s face was red with rage, but he saw that he had a serious matter in hand; he turned and went for more help—and the mob roared with delight. Already they had begun their fight! Already they had won their first victory!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88774.html","bookId":649,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:42:05 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:42:05 AM"}
