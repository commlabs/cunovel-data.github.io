She took a moment to bite her lip. She was failing Gemma. She needed to pull herself together! This was the kind of adventure she longed for…but she never thought it would be her close friend at stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps I am not so sorry,” Prince Toril stiffly said as he stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Linnea turned her back to the prince. What could she do? Perhaps she could find a saw and hack at the bars over the dungeon window? But that might be too loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady, you will hear me out,” Prince Toril said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she could poison the guards or give them a sleeping tonic? “That’s ridiculous; poison would be impossible to track down at such an hour. It’s best to make those kinds of purchases in the morning,” Lady Linnea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want,” Lady Linnea said, her voice withering when she realized the Prince was attempting to speak to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You, ma’am, have been very rude. You act as if my broken heart is a mere flesh wound,” Prince Toril said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well it is, isn’t it?” Lady Linnea snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Prince Toril said, sounding incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could have FOLLOWED this precious princess of yours to Arcainia. But did you? No! You prefer to mope and sulk about the country for a year like a boy denied sweets! She still isn’t married is she?” Lady Linnea said, putting her hands on her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, but she loves—,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Linnea cut him off, chopping her hand as if slicing through his words. “Excuses,” she said. “If you really loved this girl, you would desperately try to woo her right now—even if she loved another. Hope isn’t lost until she says her vows! Or if you really wish to be despondent, you can dwell upon your terrible shortcomings—a long list, if you ask me—which is probably why she told you to bugger off. I recommend you begin with your inability to think of others. Now leave. I am trying to plan a prison break, and your nattering is not aiding me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Toril was either struck dumb by Lady Linnea’s insight, or he was too stupid to respond—Lady Linnea suspected it was the latter—so he only gaped at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Linnea gave an aggravated sigh and rolled her eyes before she started walking up the shoreline, meandering in the direction of the palace. “Perhaps I could find a key to her cell?” she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I believe it has to be open from outside the cell. I will never be able to smuggle myself down there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lady Linnea, please wait!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Lady Linea said, placing her hands on her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Toril jogged the few paces between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well? Time is of the essence, and I would prefer to waste none of it on you,” Lady Linnea said, tapping her foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said your servant has been imprisoned by my father?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Lady Linnea said, some of the bite fading from her manners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already told you. He wants her to spin flax into gold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but why would he demand such a thing of her in the first place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whilst in an inebriated state, her foolish father said she could do it. When it is proven that she cannot, King Torgen will kill her,” Lady Linnea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Toril nodded and rubbed his eyes with his hand. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will help you,” he said, glancing at the sky, which was painted dusty pink by the setting sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Linnea eyed Prince Toril. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why the sudden change? Not five minutes ago, you were as limp as a dead fish washed ashore. Now you are willing to help?” Lady Linnea asked, trying to unobtrusively study his head for blood. Perhaps she hit him with the branch too hard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Toril took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. “It’s because you’re correct.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I am,” Lady Linnea scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If Princess Elise knew that I turned away someone looking for my help, she would be horrified. In my heartbreak, I have become the kind of man she despises.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stupid?” Lady Linnea offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Toril frowned. “Complacent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, where is this servant of yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the dungeons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we should start there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I quite agree,” Lady Linnea said, starting for the palace. “And…thank you,” she added more than a little awkwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Toril blinked. “For?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For helping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Toril cleared his voice. “Of course,” he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rumpelstiltskin-timeless-fairy-tales-4/page-15.html","bookId":1805,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:58 PM"}
