It didn\u0027t impress the parking valet demon. Hermie shrugged and bowed us good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ric took the driver\u0027s seat, he tipped the delighted demon a fifty-dollar bill. Quicksilver bounded into the front seat after me, so I was squashed in the middle, sandwiched by my two dearest and now really nearest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked in the rearview mirror. A sedate tourist couple driving an electric-powered Caddy convertible sixty years newer than mine was flagging the Lord of the Slaughter to unload their luggage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help laughing, as we all left the Karnak, grinning from ear to ear at our escape and reunion, Quicksilver most of all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was still dark, so I dug the neon-filtering sunglasses out of the glove compartment and we cruised the Strip in shades like Hollywood celebs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Nightwine estate, Ric pulled his car under the Enchanted Cottage\u0027s porte cochere. We went inside, using the door card in my bagged jeans. We installed Quicksilver by his ever-full food bowl and ever-fresh water bowl in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eyed us in turn, refusing to indulge. He suspected what was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo did my hormones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic took my hand and led me upstairs. I figured I\u0027d soon have my movie-poster body ravished with Rudolph Valentino moves. Or vice versa. Goodie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Ric paused mid-stairway. His cocked knee blocked the stairs and me. Hmm. Did he have something kinky in mind with me over his knee?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah. Talk, he requested. Imagine a guy wanting to talk first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentioned that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a talk-killer outfit you\u0027re wearing,\" he agreed, pulling me so close his Gypsy leathers creaked, \"but I need some answers first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my arms around his neck and inhaled a heady perfume of leather and bar-smoke and also scented soap traces from both of us. That\u0027s my pseudo-Sinkhole undercover guy, pitted-steel rough on top and civilized silk underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" I said, \"do I resemble that naughty magazine cover that gave you a premature kick-start on puberty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"S¨ª, se\u0026amp;ntilde;orita. First, I want to know how you ended up at the Karnak again to get the temple dancer makeover. Last I saw of my Delilah, she was taking down temples, not sending up temperatures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nuzzled his five o\u0027clock shadow. It wasn\u0027t just makeup. If he skipped shaving twice, Ric was primed to sell men\u0027s cologne in Male magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all the real thing,\" I said, pushing my torso against him so he\u0027d get to the action I needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would that old lech Howard Hughes, who I noticed didn\u0027t stick around for introductions after Quicksilver and I arrived, give you highly collectible seduction gear? What were you two doing in the Karnak \u0027s condo-tower penthouse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Details, Ric. You don\u0027t want to lose the moment with details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d pushed off him so he could fully appreciate my outfit. I felt the silver familiar slipping its form as hip chain, so my torso had started quivering even before Ric touched my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wet his forefinger (swoon) and slowly dragged it across the filmy skirt\u0027s top just beneath my bared navel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Details,\" he mocked me. My insides clenched with excitement while his finger pushed into my outie. \"Your costume could use a little ring here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his forefinger continued its effective navel engagement, a blue-topaz-studded silver ring snagged the tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"When did you get that piercing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you weren\u0027t looking close enough, obviously, amor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn silver familiar was now butting into my romantic interludes instead of hiding out as a discreet toe ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking close now,\" Ric said. \"What\u0027s going on? You at the Karnak again. You in Hughes\u0027s harem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a misstep in a mirror gone bad. Last night I finally tracked Lilith through the Snow groupies. She and I had a brief one-on-one in a dark alley. Didn\u0027t go well and the Karnak hyenas had tracked me there. I jumped through a reflecting glass door. Knocked myself out in a travel agent\u0027s office, I think, and ended back at the Karnak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a face, remembering awakening to a situation so like my recurring nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hughes had somehow grabbed Shez after the pillars fell, so was keeping an eye out for me too and got me to the safety of his penthouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frankly, Ric,\" I said, not meaning it, since I was going to skip the weirdness of Frankenstein\u0027s experimental embalming operation until I knew more about it, \"I\u0027ve worked for Hughes before. He claims he bought the Karnak before he discovered the vampire empire underneath. He\u0027s a nonpracticing vamp himself and finds intimate relations too unsanitary to do more than lust and look. He hopes to convert all vampires to his IV-based sustenance system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic snorted his opinion of that experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s also a CinSim buff like Hector.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And me. Hughes adopted Shez as a personal wine and bath steward. That\u0027s how I got the Queen of the Nile makeover. You don\u0027t like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic decided more torture was needed. He wet his forefinger in my mouth (quasi-come!) to shut me up. Then he traced my bare and ticklish midriff up to the bottom coil of my Hollywood vamp bra. I was writhing like the gold serpents, as much to avoid giggling as to invite more exploration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis finger followed the coil on my right breast and stopped at the barely covered center. \"This doesn\u0027t match,\" he said. \"Unusual for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down. A pair of silver chain pastie tassels shimmered with motion. Shoot! The familiar was living up to its name in triplicate now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, no. Ric. Ah, I guess I should mention that some of the silver jewelry I wear used to be a lock of my lost Lhasa apso\u0027s coat. It... attached itself to me and changes into... things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like those silver whips I glimpsed you wielding at the Karnak, and the silver staff? I thought you\u0027d grabbed them from fallen Egyptian warriors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly. Wow. Don\u0027t stop doing that! Oh, yes. Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat roaming forefinger had made a circle with his thumb and snapped my right silver tassel, making it shimmy-shimmy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this silver familiar has possibilities as a sex toy?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I guess. So do you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic laughed. \"Your skin is so soft.\" He buried his face in my shoulder and hair. \"You smell so good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShezmou definitely had a future in the personal products industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re not telling me something about your latest adventure at the Karnak,\" he said, nibbling on my neck. \"Confess or we don\u0027t go a step farther.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excessive force, Montoya! You are such an irresistible interrogator. Okay. I woke up on a Karnak embalming table with Hughes\u0027s silly masked vampire nurses circled around. Just like my kiddie alien abduction nightmares. I almost lost me... my current self, for a while there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic crushed me close. \"Damn. I knew something worse had happened, Delilah. That\u0027s it. We\u0027re going to Wichita. Social services or that convent school you attended must have records or staff who can identify the originating trauma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like your adopted mother the shrink. I don\u0027t know, Ric-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might help you find out more about Lilith and your allergy to the missionary position. And, querida, I want you wanting me every which way we can do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, shakily. \"Speaking of which, can we finally do it now? My way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRic resumed leading me up the stairs while my insides did cartwheels. He paused at seeing us in the mirror at the hall\u0027s end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Lilith lurk behind there, in my own reflection? Was she watching? Was Snow spying on our every move through the medium of his lock of white hair in the silver familiar?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsk me if I cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. I was heading to my bedroom with my lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eyed Ric\u0027s reflection in the mirror. His strong arms around my midriff were holding me up, supporting me. We were about to, yeah, make whoopee and come like crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were young, mostly alive, and together, despite everyone else\u0027s best and worst efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis embrace was so tight, though, that the vial of my blood-stashed and forgotten between my pumped-up Howard Hughes boobs-squirted free. It smashed to the hardwood floor as Ric crooned major somethings in my ear and swept me away from the mirror into the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced back at the tiny glittering splotch of blood and broken glass. Maybe not such a good omen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, at the moment-ooh, hombre m¨ªo-who the... flying fey cared?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the distance, a dog or a werewolf howled, or a distant police siren wailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusiness as usual in post-Millennium Revelation Las Vegas rocked on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo did we. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-sunrise-delilah-street-3/page-38.html","bookId":2115,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:47 PM"}
