The inside of the car had long been cleaned, but the damaged windows couldn’t be repaired. The off-road vehicle didn’t move that quickly, moving arduously through the rugged terrain, from time to time releasing groaning noises. Persephone was curled up in the passenger seat, her head of long gray hair hanging lazily down on her chest, her legs propped up on the dashboard. Her legs were long and straight, even though she already moved the seat backwards, and the off-road vehicle was quite spacious, her legs still extended out through the damaged windshield. A pair of high heels hung from the tips of her feet, moving about in the wind, as if they might fall off at any time, keeping the minds of those who watched at the very brink. Meanwhile, the slender soles that were revealed, as well as her calves that had beautiful curves, even more so constantly made one feel so nervous their mouths became dry.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSu obviously wasn’t nervous, but his eyes were glued to Persephone, his eyes moving from top to bottom, and then from bottom back up. If this was the olden era, it was unknown just how many times Su’s car would have crashed. However, with the Panoramic View, it didn’t really matter whether he looked at the road or not. Persephone’s eyes were narrowed slightly, appearing a bit tired. She obviously knew that Su’s fiery eyes were moving all over her body, but she instead moved her body, allowing him to see even more details.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHowever, no matter how many details could be seen, there were still no important points that could be seen; this was what was called art.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eOf course, for Su, this wasn’t an issue. When needed, he could directly stop the vehicle, and then press Persephone onto the ground. However, if he did that, it would be the same as directly swallowing the best part. Persephone, this witch, what made others feel so hateful to the point where their bones itched, wasn’t when she didn’t wear anything, but rather when she wore everything in a neat and tidy manner.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe two of them, plus one worn-out vehicle, drove aimless in the wilderness just like that, as if they could continue until heaven and earth itself grew old.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHowever, truly driving until the world became old was impossible. When night arrived, the off-road vehicle’s fuel tank finally reached its end, but Su also arrived at his destination. This was also a small town, one could see lights even from the distance, quite a few people inside from the looks of it. One could vaguely make out human figures at the very top of the town, with some level of alert, but it was far from strict. However, Su knew that whether there were a few more or a few less guards in the little town before him, to the extent where whether there were any at all or not, it made no difference. There were two abnormally powerful auras in the little town, even though they were concealed to the point where it was almost impossible to detect, they couldn’t escape Su’s perception. With the two of them here, the sentinels were merely there to put on a display.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eThe off-road vehicle stopped a kilometer out from the small town. Su turned off the engine, and then jumped off the off-road vehicle. Persephone also got off. She looked at Su quietly, her gray and green eyes reflecting Su’s figure, calm like a frozen lake. She didn’t reveal any different expressions, but her puzzlement and slight dissatisfaction. Her puzzlement was easy to understand; she didn’t know why they had to end the peaceful and comfortable life of just the two of them. She obviously knew that the peaceful lifestyle would end sooner or later, but she didn’t expect it to end this quickly. Wasn’t the situation currently becoming more and more calm?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eHowever, Persephone only used this type of method to slightly express her dissatisfaction, not going further to ask about Su’s intentions. From start until now, she always silently listened to Su’s decision, for example, suddenly leaving the small town where they created great memories in, and then arriving here to start a new separation. Persephone would express her discontent, and she would also use her own methods to urge him to stay behind, for example, using fatal small movements to continuously challenge Su’s patience. Most of the time, she successfully turned Su into a wild beast, and then after an intense struggle, she would fall into deep sleep.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eEven while asleep, she still felt uneasy, and thus would subconsciously grab Su. It was also only while she was asleep, when Persephone would slightly uncover what was hidden within her mind. Within the most intense touching of emotions, Persephone would occasionally touch Su’s innermost being as well, that place filled with the most primitive desire and passion, as well as a deep love that would never fade away. However, in that burning world, there would always be an ice-cold corner, a place she never touched, and a place she had no way of touching. Her female intuition told her that in that place, there was definitely something related to her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003ePersephone didn’t know why she would be in Su’s inner world, but she didn’t deliberately investigate either. After undergoing endless wind and rain, traveling together through life and death, Persephone already learned to face everything calmly, as well as treasure everything she already had. This was beside the fact that all of the raging flames in Su’s heart burned because of her, this was already enough. The current Su had already grown to the point where he was strong enough to take good care of her. Whether or not the promise they made when they first met was real or fake, was fully revealed at this moment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eSu, already became Persephone’s protector, both in name and in reality.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eTowards Persephone’s doubts, there was naturally no way Su wouldn’t understand, but he didn’t say anything, instead walked over to Persephone’s side, held her hand, and then began walking towards the nearby little town. Persephone meekly followed, not saying anything either. She felt like there was no need to say anything, because Su definitely had his reason for doing things the way he did. If there was anything he wanted to tell her, then he would do so.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eA kilometer of distance, at ordinary walking speed, was still quite far. However, no matter how far it was, in Su and Persephone’s eyes, it was pitifully small. When the little town’s lights had already been vaguely cast on Su’s body, he suddenly stopped his footsteps and looked towards Persephone. After a bit of hesitation, he said, “Phoney, I don’t know how to say this either… I just feel like I should send you to a safe place, or else there might be uncontrollable danger. However, I don’t know what kind of danger there is exactly either, perhaps…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline\"\u003eWhen he only spoke halfway, Persephone gently pressed against his lips, seriously saying, “There’s no need to explain. I believe you.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-31-7\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-31-9\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-31-8","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM"}
