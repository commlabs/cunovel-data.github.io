And you have the cheek to ask me how you behaved? All right, I\u0027ll tell you. Like a coarse brute, that\u0027s how.

How do you like that! Then let me tell you something. That sickening stunt you pulled yesterday left me feeling like I\u0027d been defiled. It\u0027s like I\u0027ve had some foul substance sprayed into my soul and it fogs up my mind and takes away the desire to go on living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsoldA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the subject of sprays of filth that take away the desire to go on living, you\u0027ve hit the nail on the head there. My fingers would have refused to type that. Even though it\u0027s exactly what I feel. I never even suspected that such a small opening ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomeo-y-Cohiba\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s enough.

Did you notice how long it took me to get there yesterday? Do you know why? I couldn\u0027t find the way at first, someone had changed all the marks I left at the turns. I got lost and wandered into a place I\u0027d never been before. The path ran into a dead-end with an old-fashioned red phone box with the British royal coat of arms. The kind they used to have in London. I went in. There was a plaque with the words: \u0027Hampton Court Maze, Blind Alley #4, East\u0027. And written in pencil under that was a telephone number and the name Isolde. I tried calling for ages. The line was engaged all the time, and finally I realised it would never be free. But, every time I dialled the number, for a few seconds I believed the next moment I would hear your voice. My Losolde. My Legalita. And that hope, that mute tremor in my soul, like when you pick up speed hurtling down the ski-jump before you launch out into the mist, all the feelings I had time to feel while the dial was turning back to its starting point, gently clicking out the final digit of your false number, that inverted infinity of the figure eight\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;it was happiness. The figure eight, like two tender sets of lips one above the other, and a blurred row of bushes through the window ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsoldA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow very touching, I think I\u0027ll burst into tears. Only I don\u0027t understand how after such exalted emotions you could do ... that ... I don\u0027t even know what to call it. It was enough to make even a paedophile puke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomeo-y-Cohiba\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what did I do? You did absolutely everything yourself.

But perhaps I could set you thinking in a new direction. On the map that Isolde saw in the park it said \u0027Plan of the labyrinth at Versailles\u0027. But the telephone booth that Romeo was calling her from is located, if we can believe the plaque, in a suburb of London.

Isolde set out to meet Romeo and ended up in Tristan\u0027s clutches. If we imagine that Juliet and Tristan are the same person ... Although in this case we can hardly call it a real \u0027person\u0027. More like an empty mask. Or maybe a \u0027helmet\u0027?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomeo-y-Cohiba\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen, you xxx linguist, shut your mouth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutscracker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s certainly a frightening metaphor. There\u0027s nothing new about succubuses and incubuses, of course, but in this appalling dimension we have the spectral manifestation of a certain Julietristan who manages to take the place of not just one partner, but both at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUGLI 666\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd not only in this dimension. Why is fornication such a detestable sin?

The Helmholtz doesn\u0027t even know who he\u0027s xxx. Or who\u0027s xxx him.

But what you said is an even more interesting idea. Well worth thinking about. Well, lady and gent, pardon my lack of modesty, but what exactly did happen in the pavilion? My imagination blushes and fails me. Nothing that comes to mind is worthy of the emotions that we have observed. \u0027Oh, it\u0027s very hard to come with your finger up your bum\u0027 or the last tango in Paris.

At first I went on sitting at the table, waiting for him to come back. But he was gone for ages and ages. Then I got up and went over to look at the shelves of files along the walls. There were all sorts of different things on them. Depositions from the Minotaur\u0027s defeated enemies. Interrogations of Minotaurs by other Minotaurs. An entire shelf full of records of cross-examinations of Minotaurs by themselves\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;they were called \u0027Alone Together\u0027. They must have been thinking of the horns, right? But the biggest number of files was filled with answers to the so-called eternal questions like the ones you and I were asking. They were all old and yellow with age and covered in dust.

About the separator labyrinth ... \u0027But who ...\u0027 Right, that\u0027s it: \u0027Who else is produced there?\u0027 A couple of pages from some review of historical chronicles. An analysis of contradictions. One text says the Minotaur himself is the builder of the labyrinth. Another claims the labyrinth was built by eighteen thousand Minotaurs divided into two columns. A third claims these columns should be understood metaphorically and the labyrinth is created by the two mental nodules or hemispheres, which are symbolised by the two horns. And so on. And here at the end there are a few pages about this Julistan. They look quite different, really ancient and faded. Many of them are so old I can hardly make anything out. Covered with strange, beautiful handwriting. They\u0027re translations of inscriptions from the Julistan caves. The actual inscriptions were destroyed long ago, together with the caves themselves, and all that\u0027s left are copies of copies. Fragmentary translations.

He is an incorruptible guard, guarding that which he himself has created against that which he himself has created. For all the severity of his visage and magnificence of his station, all that is created by him, yea and his own self, is pure superfluity, the empty play of mind, a counterfeit golden flourish on the border of the void. And therefore, when within this nothingness set in a richly ornamented frame the menace of necessity suddenly raises its head or implacable battle is joined for the triumph of true values, there arises a spectacle fit to induce laughter unto tears, because in truth all of this from the beginning to the end is entirely pointless ...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonstradamus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s that sound?

He does not know that in reality he does not exist, but sometimes he begins to suspect it and this scares and angers him greatly. The means by which for many millennia he has attempted to make himself real are terrible and foolish, like all the mysteries of his world. Although he does not exist, he ends up drenched in sweat and blood, which also do not exist. Though this does not make him any more real, it does mean there is no one left to tell him so\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;no one is left at his side but servant dwarves, drenching him in blood and screaming that vengeance will follow for the blood that has been spilled ...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsoldA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can hear it too.

If you fear him, it means that you are wearing the helmet of horror and he is master of your world. But once you have removed the helmet, then Asterius disappears, and nothing remains at which to laugh. It is a grave error either to wear the helmet or to remove it. One should do absolutely nothing with it, if only because in reality it does not exist...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUGLI 666\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloser and closer, and still this stupid cow just won\u0027t ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAriadne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You are free, and your freedom lies in the fact that the mind has no body, no matter what dwarves in strange hats may tell you. Even the body has no body, and therefore there is nothing on which to set the helmet of horror. But until you have understood this, Asterius is all that you see, feel, think and know. And the crude mechanical farce which the parts of the helmet play out for each other in the transparent void of the mind becomes your entire life. If you are wearing the helmet of horror, it seems that this is for all eternity. But no eternity lasts longer than a fleeting moment.
