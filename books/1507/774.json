When they saw the color changing down below, they were astonished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten percent!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! How could he be so inhuman? He used his own body as the vessel to absorb ten percent of the curse power!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao trembled as the curse power filled him. His flesh and blood constantly withered, and his Eternal stratum continuously restored him. Within a brief span, this cycle had already been repeated innumerable times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an even more brutal sight than what had occurred when Meng Hao stood outside the Blood Demon Sect’s shield while fighting the four allied powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood oozed constantly out of the sides of his mouth, and even his eyes leaked black, viscous blood. His face was as pale as a corpse, and yet his hands remained planted firmly on the ground. The Blood Demon Grand Magic spun rapidly as it sucked the curse power from the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis second true self was also trembling as he used all the strength he could muster to raise the gravitational force of Meng Hao’s Blood Demon Grand Magic to a shocking level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire island was surrounded by a gray whirlwind, which emitted shocking rumbling sounds as it rotated, covering the entire lake and spreading out into surrounding areas. The endless curse power that had spread off into the distance was gradually sucked into the Blood Demon Grand Magic, and then into Meng Hao’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intensity of the pain that stabbed through him was impossible to describe. The cycle of withering and recovery seemed like the most vicious and painful torture imaginable. Soon, Meng Hao’s hair couldn’t be restored, and was no longer black. Instead, it was gray, and turning whiter by the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have to go even faster!” thought Meng Hao. He gritted his teeth and then spat up a huge mouthful of blood. His body swayed back and forth, but his ten fingers were firmly planted on the ground as he sucked in curse power at an incredible speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty percent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty percent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color of the curse was changing throughout the entire Southern Domain. In a short moment, Meng Hao seemed to have been reincarnated a hundred times. It was almost like his body didn’t belong to him any more; only his will remained as steadfast as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp in the sky, the four Dao Seeking experts from the Northern Reaches were completely astonished, and couldn’t help but gasp. They could scarcely believe what they were seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that someone could do this, could use their own body to resist the Hellwither Nineruins curse, and even absorb it, was beyond their imaginations. In fact, had any one of them been in that position, it would have been impossible for them to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom their perspective, Meng Hao was taking a huge, suicidal risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crazy! That guy’s crazy!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could he not be crazy!? Today is his wedding day, and now it’s turned into a funeral!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll die for sure. There’s no way his body can take it! He’ll turn into a pool of blood that will be an even more noxious curse!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s DEAD!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the hundreds of thousands of cultivators who had come to participate in the wedding celebration, their bodies were still slowly withering. Although Meng Hao was frenziedly attempting to absorb the curse, as long as the curse was still there, everyone would still be under its effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne face after another grew pale and aged. At the same time, Xu Qing… was trembling. She looked like a flower that would completely wilt at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s heart was filled with a grief and indignation that was like a pent-up breath of frustration which could not be exhaled. It surged through his body, and his eyes turned red. Within his mind, a single thought revolved….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to do everything he could to absorb the entire curse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever… it was apparent that ability of his body to recover from the curse was slowly lessening. In fact, his skin was already beginning to shrivel and parch. His Eternal stratum, even were it stronger than it already was, would be incapable of infinite recovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There really isn’t anything truly Eternal in this world….” Meng Hao thought as blood flowed out from his mouth. He knew this, and knew that his Eternal stratum would be incapable of sustaining him in perpetuity. However, as before… he chose to continue to absorb the curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color faded even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty percent!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot much time had passed, and he had already absorbed forty percent of the Hellwither Nineruins curse. As a result, he was filled with unspeakable pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth were loosening in his jaw, and his skin was growing old. His bones were softening, and blood oozed out of his eyes, ears, nose and mouth. And yet to Meng Hao… none of that mattered!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked over at Xu Qing and took a deep breath. There was a vast amount of curse power built up in him already, to the point that the Eternal stratum couldn’t dispel it. His vital organs were now beginning to wither and rot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, Xu Qing’s eyelashes fluttered and she… opened her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Meng Hao and didn’t have the energy to speak. However, anxiety, deep concern, and anguish could be seen in her eyes. It was an expression that broke Meng Hao’s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wedding ceremony… had only been half completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, everything was gray… and the color of blood!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should have been the happiest day of his life, but now… it was turning into a tragedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao laughed. He lifted his head up to the sky and laughed. That laughter sounded maniacal, enraged, filled with intense discontent. Rumbling sounds could be heard from beneath his palms. His body was already nearly completely withered by the curse, and yet he continued to absorb it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground changed color again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifty percent!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoundless curse power rumbled toward him. Meng Hao was a black hole at the center of the windstorm, absorbing everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood poured out of his eyes, ears, nose and mouth. His skin was tearing, and he was now sitting in the middle of a pool of blood. The accumulation of curse power within him was reaching a peak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hellwither Nineruins curse contained incredible powers of withering. It withered the land, and also caused the cultivation bases of all the cultivators born in that land to wither. Now, that power was building up inside of Meng Hao. The Eternal stratum could not wipe it away, causing Meng Hao to tremble violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that Meng Hao suddenly made unexpected progress. After all, he cultivated the Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao. Within those seven characters was the ‘withering’ character!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of this moment, he gained complete enlightenment of withering!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the complete understanding of the ‘withering’ character, Meng Hao’s body rumbled, and the curse power within him began to shrink. It condensed into his blood vessels, his soul, his flesh, and transformed into… a ‘withering’ character divine ability!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Meng Hao sucked in a deep breath as the Withering Character Incantation combined with the Blood Immortal Divine Ability. In combination with the frenzied assistance of the second true self, massive rumbling sounds filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixty percent!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color of the curse throughout all the Southern Domain changed once again. Everything shook, and the four Northern Reaches peak Dao Seeking experts up above were further shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His body… his body is actually at Dao Seeking!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s something strange about the technique he cultivates. This guy… this guy’s body can constantly regenerate!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He can actually absorb the withering power of the curse!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four men only continued to be more and more astonished. In fact, even Patriarch Song and the others could hardly believe what they were seeing. The only one who wasn’t surprised was Pill Demon. He looked sadly at Meng Hao, as well as the lands below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was Meng Hao’s master, and he knew why Meng Hao was risking everything. Today was his wedding day, and his wife was on the same island he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unless he absorbs one hundred percent, the effects can’t be completely reversed….” murmured Pill Demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Meng Hao absorbed sixty percent of the curse, the withering effect on the surrounding hundreds of thousands of cultivators was visibly reduced. Although they were still trembling, the effects of the curse seemed to have eased up a bit. When they opened their eyes, what they saw… was Meng Hao, coughing up blood, his body slowly dissolving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixty percent… was not enough!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao produced the lightning cauldron and attempted to pour the curse power into it, but it didn’t work. The lightning cauldron and the curse were two completely different things. He thought about using the Wooden Time Swords to afflict the curse with the passage of time, but doing that would also affect the curse power in the bodies of the Southern Domain cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the Time power activated, it might end things… but it would also cause the destructive power of the curse to be inflicted faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of many other options, but none could resolve the problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing left to do was to continue to absorb the curse power. He once again sent the Withering Character Incantation into operation. Once again the land rumbled, and the color changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventy percent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Withering Character Incantation was reaching its limit. With seventy percent of the curse power absorbed, even it was incapable of absorbing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao had truly reached his limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Eternal stratum was on the verge of fading away. His body couldn’t handle any more withering from the curse. He was ancient now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears rolled down Xu Qing’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four peak Dao Seeking cultivators from the Northern Reaches had already been completely shaken by Meng Hao. However, now they could see that he had reached his limit, and they heaved sighs of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s over. He’s reached his limit. He can’t absorb any more!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He absorbed seventy percent of the curse power and yet didn’t die. The power of withering even seems to exist within him! As far as I can tell, this guy… is the number one figure in the entire Southern Domain!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To destroy the Southern Domain we must first destroy him! Damnation! There’s only thirty percent of the curse power remaining!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on the island, Meng Hao saw the tears on Xu Qing’s face, and it seemed as if the entire world went completely silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her, and his life force ignited. His cultivation base exploded with power. The mark on his hand that had appeared in the past appeared once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his head up and laughed. It was a shrill laughter that echoed out. Meng Hao was burning everything he had in one mad, desperate attempt to absorb more curse power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“NO!” Xu Qing cried weakly, trembling. The moment she cried out was the same moment that Meng Hao made his final, crazed attempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground trembled and the color changed again, growing more faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEighty percent!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter eighty percent of the curse power entered his body, Meng Hao attempted to absorb all the way to ninety. But then, his body trembled and he coughed up a huge mouthful of blood. Some sort of massive power pushed back against his palms, and he was sent tumbling backward. Blood sprayed out. He was now… incapable of absorbing any more curse power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Impossible!!” thought the four Northern Reaches peak Dao Seeking experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout Meng Hao to absorb it, the remaining twenty percent of the curse power suddenly exploded out to inundate the hundreds of thousands of cultivators…. Their cultivation bases surged with all the power they could summon as they fought back. The result was… the curse power was reduced by another ten percent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of now, ninety percent of the curse power had been wiped away. Only ten percent was left behind. That ten percent seemed to erupt with unprecedented power. The hundreds of thousands of cultivators all coughed up blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there was an intense, murderous look in the eyes of each and every one. To these cultivators, the remaining ten percent of the curse power was no catastrophe. It was something they could bear. Furthermore, there was little weakening to their cultivation bases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one, they stood up, and in their eyes was monstrous killing intent. In that moment, wild colors flashed in the sky, and the clouds churned. The four peak Dao Seeking experts from the Northern Reaches felt their scalps going numb. They were completely shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only Xu Qing, still clothed in her red wedding dress… who coughed up blood and continued to grow weaker. Because of her body’s unique situation, even the ten percent of the curse power that remained could be fatal to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly began to topple over. Meng Hao, around whom swirled black wisps of death aura, immediately lurched forward and caught her in his arms. Filled with grief and rage, he carried her off into the distance, far from the raging war that was about to erupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had saved the entire Southern Domain, but couldn’t save his wife. In his insanity, Meng Hao began to laugh with grief. Laughter that sounded like weeping echoed out across the lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Isaac, Christopher Choi, Quang Tran, Nazmul, Daniel Antoniuk, Pedro, Sven Salberg, Rawlric Sumner, Cole Hausner, Martin Jensen, Hal, Richard, Thomas Dixon, Dominic Samson, Avijit Wadhawan, John Rufino Aguilar, Griff-And-Or, Kari Yi, Budescu Ionut, Dan Gabber, Thomas, Potkeny, Nils Müller, Davis Won, Kenneth McCarty, Nich, Patrascu Gabi, David Jeltema III, Fiber Optic, Joseph, Andreas Asselman, ONI_Ghost, and Arkanth\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-769\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-771\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-770","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
