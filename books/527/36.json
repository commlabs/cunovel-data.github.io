His guardian was not an observant man, and thus far suspected nothing. Before Oliver obtained any opportunity the stage reached its destination.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kelso was a village of moderate size. A small hotel provided accommodation for passing travellers. Here the three stage passengers descended and sought accommodation. The house was almost empty, and no difficulty was experienced. Denton registered his name as Felix Graham, from Milwaukee. He registered first, and for a special reason, that the false name might divert suspicion, if any was entertained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you know our fellow-passenger, Mr. Bundy?\" asked Oliver, when they were in the room assigned them, preparing for supper.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Bundy looked surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I only know that he is from Milwaukee,\" he answered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My eyes are sharper than yours, Mr. Bundy,\" he said. \"He is our old acquaintance, Denton, who tried to rob you in Chicago.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nicholas Bundy was amazed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do you know?\" he asked. \"Surely it cannot be. Denton had black hair.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And this man wears a red wig,\" said Oliver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you sure of this?\" asked Nicholas thoughtfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am certain.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When did you recognize him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In the stage, when his glasses came off.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What does this mean?\" said Bundy, half to himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It means that he is on our track,\" said Oliver coolly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But why? What object can he have?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have asked me too much. Ask me some other conundrum.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can he hope to rob me again? It must be that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We will see that he don\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Possibly he has some other object in view. I should like to know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll tell you how to do it, Mr. Bundy. Will you authorize me to manage?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Oliver.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I will take pains to mention in his presence before the landlord that we are going back to Chicago in the morning, and wish to engage seats in the stage. If he is following us he will do the same.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A good idea, Oliver.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After supper Denton took out a cigar, and began to smoke in the office of the inn. Oliver enquired of the landlord:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When does the stage start in the morning?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"At eight o\u0027clock.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can I engage two seats in it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir. Your stay is short.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"True, but our business takes little time to transact. Let us have breakfast in time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Denton listened, but made no movement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next morning when the stage drew up before the door, not only Oliver and Bundy, but Denton also, were standing on the piazza, with their carpet-bags, ready to depart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All got into the stage, and it set out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It had hardly proceeded half a mile when, by previous arrangement, Bundy said suddenly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oliver, I believe we must go back. There is one thing I quite forgot to attend to in Kelso.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right!\" said Oliver. \"It makes no difference to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The driver was signalled, and Oliver and Bundy got out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver glanced at Denton. He looked terribly amazed, and seemed undecided whether to get out also.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good-morning, Mr. Graham,\" said Oliver, with a great show of politeness. \"I am sorry you will have a lonely ride.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good-by,\" muttered Denton, and the stage rolled on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He wanted to get out and follow us back,\" said Oliver, \"but he couldn\u0027t think of any excuse.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We have got rid of him,\" said Bundy; \"and now I must attend to the business that brought me here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On his return to the hotel he interviewed the landlord, and asked if he ever heard of a man named Rupert Jones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should think so,\" answered the landlord. \"He cheated me out of a hundred dollars.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He did? How?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"By a forged check upon the Bank of Conway. I wish I could get hold of him!\" he ended.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nicholas Bundy\u0027s eyes sparkled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What could you do in that case?\" he enquired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What could I do? I could send him to State prison.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you have preserved the forged check?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I have taken care of that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mr. Ferguson,\" said Nicholas, \"will you sell me that check for a hundred and fifty dollars?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you give it?\" asked the landlord eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is your object? Is this man a friend of yours?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; he\u0027s my enemy. I want to get him into my power!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you shall have it for a hundred, and I hope you may catch him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In five minutes the change was effected.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One object more Nicholas had in view. He tried to ascertain what had become of Rupert Jones, but in this he was unsuccessful. No one in Kelso had seen or heard of him for years.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59243.html","bookId":527,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM"}
