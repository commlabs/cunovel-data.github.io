His hand eased back to his pistol, but the Rechazado shoved the barrel harder against her, a move that ripped the breath from Court\u0027s lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his hands out in front of him. \"Take me instead,\" he bit out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente said, \"Me for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man ran the barrel down her cheek. \"We\u0027ll return for you both later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink, God damn it, think!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell was Ethan, where was Hugh? From where he stood, the gunman couldn\u0027t see Hugh in the next room. Hugh could take him out - he\u0027d been trained to kill so quickly.... \"Hugh,\" he rasped in Gaelic, \"kill him. By Christ, please do this. Please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sensed his brother silently backing away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one with Anna opened the second door for another, who pointed his pistol at Olivia and indicated she should follow. She finally advanced toward him, but said over her shoulder, \"It was still worth it, Llorente.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Rechazados backed down the steps, Anna stumbling in one\u0027s arms down the wet stairs, blinking from the rain but never taking her eyes from Court\u0027s. As if to gain courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doona fight him, Anna.\" He didn\u0027t know if she could understand the strangled words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fury was choking him, turning everything he saw black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Rechazados got away, Court would find Annal¨ªa dead, discarded at the outskirts of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God damn it, Anna,\" he grated. \"Just stay alive. Just hold on - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA blast from the second floor. The man\u0027s head burst from one side. He tightened his arm in death around Anna as he collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other whipped his pistol up at Hugh, but both Court and Hugh had already fired. He slumped to his knees, then onto what was left of his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt knew he\u0027d never forget what he saw for the rest of his life. Anna crawling from the body, eyes blank, lips parted. A bellow of rage roared from him as he ran for her, unable to get to her before her hands slipped from under her in the blood and carnage from both men and the cold rain pooling on the street. The low cries she made...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid down next to her, dropping the gun to snatch her into his arms, clutching her to him, his fingers tracing and retracing her temple, scarcely believing. \"Anna?\" He clasped her head to pull her to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded faintly against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long they stayed like this he didn\u0027t know, but Hugh had come from his vantage, and he and Ethan were outside, scanning for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente was trying to take Anna from him. Court swung out blindly and connected hard with his face. Something broke beneath the blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh took Court\u0027s shoulder. But he couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You doona want her to live through that, then die from chill,\" Hugh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words made perfect sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in, Court,\" Ethan ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly when she shuddered was he able to command his body to move. He drew her into him too hard and rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside, in the bright light, when he saw the blood all over her, things became very clear. \"Ethan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re taken care of, Court. Doona think on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt swung his gaze to Hugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Retribution?\" Hugh asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A thousand times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll ride with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt shook his head. \"I already owe you more than my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We leave at dawn,\" Hugh said, ignoring the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErskine called down in a high, panicked voice that a bath was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt vaguely heard Llorente speaking. Not her husband. Must let her go. Can\u0027t care for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe faced Llorente, felt his teeth bared, heard the other woman snap, \"Don\u0027t be stupid, Llorente! He won\u0027t hurt her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt had started for the stairs when Anna finally spoke, \"I\u0027ll be fine. I am usually stronger during these things.\" Her voice was faltering, her words sounding hollow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring these things. If she\u0027d died, he would have meted out death and torment as they\u0027d never known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is everyone acting so strangely?\" Anna asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia said, \"Everyone is acting strangely because your pupils are the size of tea saucers, you\u0027re covered in blood, and you have gun oil smeared on your temple. You\u0027re also deep in shock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she answered in a small voice. \"Courtland, put me down, or I\u0027ll become embarrassed. You\u0027ve never reacted like this before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente yelled something from below, apparently restrained by Hugh. Monster, brutal, killer, blamed. The last thing Court heard was Hugh telling him, \"You\u0027re lucky Court didn\u0027t snap your neck out there.\" Llorente was. The impulse had been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her room, he set her on the foot of the bed, helping her sit up as he undressed her. He\u0027d done this a hundred times, yet he could scarcely get the first button undone. He ripped at her dress - surprising how easily the fabric parted - until he\u0027d stripped her. Lifting her in his arms, he set her in the bath, then knelt beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCupping warm water over her shoulders, he asked, \"Anna, are you all right?\" He didn\u0027t recognize his own voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" She was looking straight ahead. Her eyes wouldn\u0027t adjust. So bright in this room, and her pupils wouldn\u0027t recede. When he determined she could sit up by herself, he rushed to the lamp to turn it down, then strode back beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a cloth and brushed at the blood on her face and neck, scrubbed her wee hands. \"There\u0027s a good lass,\" he bit out as he washed her hair. The oil at her temple didn\u0027t want to come clean, and he couldn\u0027t rub much harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would already have a bruise from the barrel. He shuddered violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Courtland? You must try to be patient with Aleix.\" Her voice sounded confused. \"He is not like my fierce Scot. The fighting is new to him, and he thinks he\u0027ll lose me as he lost Mariette and the little baby girl. I am his last family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mo cridhe, you know I will do anythin\u0027 you ask of me.\" He put his forehead against her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do know that,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her relaxing, then tensing as she fought sleep, so he rinsed her hair and body, then placed her on her feet to dry her. A cursory glance around the room revealed a nightgown and some of Court\u0027s clothes laid out for them. He dressed her in the gown before bundling her in the bed under several blankets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of his clean clothes reminded him that he had blood on himself as well. Fearing she\u0027d be alarmed later, he stripped and rinsed with the remaining buckets of water. He swiftly dressed then pulled a chair over so he could sit beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m so sleepy.\" She reached out her hand for his. \"I\u0027ve been so tired lately.\" He took it, put his elbows on his knees, and leaned forward to press his face down against her palm. When she slept, he didn\u0027t let it go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente walked in shortly after. Court glanced up without interest, vaguely noticing he\u0027d broken at least Llorente\u0027s nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to see my sister.\" His voice was thick, from either emotion or injuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh came striding in directly after him, most likely to protect Llorente.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hugh, relax, I will no\u0027 hurt him any longer,\" he said, but he eyed Llorente crossing to the other side of the bed to study her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently assured, Hugh said, \"We need to plan. Ethan wants to speak with you. I can stay with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him to come here. I\u0027ll no\u0027 leave her.\" Court noted his hand had tightened on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s with Olivia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring her as well, then, but I\u0027m no\u0027 leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh glanced at Anna. \"We will no\u0027 disturb her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she will no\u0027 wake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Hugh left the room, Llorente said, \"And you would know that because you\u0027ve been sleeping with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\" He defied Llorente to say something about it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look in his eyes must have dissuaded Llorente from that subject, becaused he asked, \"Are you certain she wasn\u0027t injured?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s bruised. She\u0027s in shock. No more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh and Ethan returned with a table and chairs, Olivia following. Erskine brought the coffee service and then exited without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt reluctantly relinquished Anna\u0027s hand and tucked it under the blanket. After he tugged the cover higher to her chin, he strode over to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente pulled a chair, uninvited, to the table, studying them. He would have to be wondering how Hugh could shoot like that, would have to be wondering about Ethan\u0027s lethal demeanor and how he\u0027d received his twisting scar. Though Court knew Llorente was baffled by all this as well as Court and Anna\u0027s relationship, he wisely asked nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt began, \"Ethan, I need you to stay here with her.\" He caught Ethan\u0027s eyes, showing him how much he was entrusting to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. I\u0027ll bring in some men as well,\" Ethan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we doona come back, you must take Anna to Carrickliffe among the clan. Make them swear to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what of Olivia?\" Llorente asked. \"She must stay with Annal¨ªa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt swung a glance at him. \"You can take care of Olivia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re hunting the Rechazados, I\u0027m going as well.\" He ran a sleeve over his still bleeding lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stay here,\" Court said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my land and my people. I need to be there if you\u0027re going in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right, Court,\" Hugh said. \"He\u0027ll just follow us down anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt shrugged. \"You\u0027ll get in the way of what I\u0027m after only once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente narrowed his eyes at that, then said, \"And Olivia?\" He didn\u0027t understand what he was asking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh said, \"Ethan, just agree to it. They\u0027ll need to be together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthan hesitated for several seconds, then inclined his head. And with that, a man considered wicked by so many - often rightly so - would now risk his life for both of them. \"Court, what do you know about the order?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt leaned forward, struggling to become cold, to focus on what they had to do. \"They prefer to stay as a unified corps, dispatching smaller groups. If we could get close enough to where they camp, we could take them out at one time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will just be new ones enlisted,\" Llorente said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt shook his head. \"If you take out all of them, who\u0027s to pass on their orders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh added, \"I\u0027ve read about them as well\" - read about them, no doubt, in a thick dossier with the instructions \"engage at will.\" \"Even if you canna take them all, if you eliminate their leader, it\u0027s like cutting the head off a snake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it won\u0027t matter if Pascal lives,\" Llorente pointed out. \"He\u0027ll keep sending men. He\u0027s got an army of deserters wanting to rise in the ranks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we have to kill them to a man,\" Court answered, obviously surprising Llorente. Court gave him a look of disgust. \"Did you possibly conceive that I would leave a single man alive who would hurt her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re talking about the Rechazados, the deserters and Pascal. In one campaign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente nodded slowly. \"We\u0027ll need more men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh said, \"No\u0027 for the Rechazados, if they camp together and if we have the right...gear.\" Explosives. \"So we\u0027d need men only for the deserters. Court, can you contact your crew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve tried and have no\u0027 heard back. They probably went east with Otto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m no\u0027 sure they did.\" Ethan said. \"Weyland and I have been working to get the deserters out of Andorra for months. Which was how I\u0027d known you\u0027d chosen...unwisely to ally with Pascal. Weyland\u0027s pressured the British ambassador, who\u0027s pressured the Spanish to raise the bounties on the deserters. Exponentially. If I know our cousin, Niall would\u0027ve determined how lucrative it could be. With Court\u0027s crew, it\u0027d be like shooting fish in a barrel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think his mercenaries are in Andorra?\" Llorente asked. \"That\u0027s good news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. Good for us,\" Court said. \"Bad for your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente raised his eyebrows. \"Should I ask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh quickly said, \"No\u0027 if you\u0027ve any sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente prudently returned to the matter at hand. \"I\u0027ve studied the deserters and you know the Rechazados, but I don\u0027t know Pascal and know you don\u0027t either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Court admitted. \"He alters routines, moves domiciles. I could no\u0027 find a pattern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia coughed delicately. They turned to her, saw her admiring her reflection in a silver spoon. \"But I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the others had retired, and Court took his chair beside Annal¨ªa again, Llorente remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You care for her. Obviously a great deal,\" he said, taking a chair on the opposite side of the bed to face him. \"Why didn\u0027t you marry her before I got here to tell you no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I care for her a great deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kidnapped my sister and forced her into a different country. Apparently, you took over my home - while I was rotting in a cell that you had put me in. You stole from me. You bloody broke my nose. It\u0027s hard to imagine that you could do much more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you have. She could be with child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She will no\u0027 be with child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you be sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Canna have bairn.\" Normally he would never have revealed this to someone like Llorente, but now it seemed so insignificant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should believe that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, it\u0027s true, though I dearly wish it was no\u0027.\" Odd that men always thought if they got a woman with child then they had to marry her. If Anna could be with child, Court would get to marry her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente hesitated, then said, \"Is that why you wouldn\u0027t marry her? Not that I would let you anyway, but that\u0027s a plus in my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna had said he\u0027d lost his wife and daughter. Must\u0027ve been childbirth. \"No, that\u0027s no\u0027 the reason. Just leave it alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente put his elbows on his knees and stared at the floor. \"When we finish this I will have to go to Castile hat in hand and ask them to contract a sympathetic match for her. She will hate me for it, but it must be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt gnashed his teeth at the thought. As if she sensed his anger, Anna turned in sleep. \"Courtland?\" she whispered. \"On ¨¦s ell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wants to know where you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Llorente not think Court could understand? Of course he didn\u0027t. Court was an ignorant Scot. \"I can speak Catalan,\" he snapped under his breath. Then, dismissing Llorente, Court raised her hand to his lips to reassure her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"T\u0027estimo, Courtland,\" she sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente said in a dumbfounded tone, \"Then you know that for some ungodly reason she just told you she loves you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he heard Ethan\u0027s men arriving near dawn, Court rose from his chair. Of course he hadn\u0027t slept - he\u0027d taken every minute he could with her after Llorente hesitantly left them last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt lightly touched her cheek, glad at least that her color was back and her skin was warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to kiss her and tell her how much he didn\u0027t want to leave, but if she woke and asked him what was happening, how could he answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke your brother\u0027s face last night; we\u0027re going to Andorra to stamp out anyone who would hurt you; and afterward, because I took your innocence, you\u0027ll be forced to Castile. We won\u0027t see each other again, though I\u0027d intended to marry you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the Rechazados didn\u0027t kill him...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he brushed her hair from her face, the bruise at her temple stood out starkly. He flinched and a coldness settled over him...enabling him to walk away. \"Is tu mo gr¨¤dh thar gach n¨¬,\" he murmured to her before he clenched his hands and left. I love you above all things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs, he found Ethan preparing for war - Court had expected no less - with Hugh directing the packing of supplies. Both left him with nothing to work on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo to gain strength for what he was about to do - abandon Anna - he stole into the study and retrieved the book. He\u0027d never voluntarily touched it before, and hated the feeling of it now, but he wanted to read it, and curse it to hell where it belonged. He\u0027d just turned to their page when Llorente walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe timing. Court was really beginning to hate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ethan told me I\u0027d find you here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MacCarrick, I\u0027ve thought about this all night, and I want you to marry Annal¨ªa before we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was unexpected, but still...\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For some inexplicable reason, she loves you, and she won\u0027t want to go to Castile. As much as it grieves me to even consider you, I must.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think this is easy for me? I\u0027m a proud man and I despise you - the very idea of being related to you pains me. Remembering the prestigious suits I smugly turned down only to be asking you now appalls me. But I will swallow my pride to see her happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he didn\u0027t hate Llorente. Had to admire the man\u0027s doggedness. Broke his nose last night and Llorente was asking him to marry his sister the next morning. For her. Must be difficult as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has her own fortune.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt\u0027s jaw clenched, and he gave him the look his comment deserved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente appeared surprised. \"I apologize if I offended, but you are a mercenary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man wasn\u0027t going to give up until Court hit him again, which he could no longer do. He would give his explanation, and if Llorente scoffed, then he\u0027d have tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See this book? This is why I will no\u0027 marry her.\" He opened it to the last page and stabbed his finger against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente advanced to the table, skimmed over the lines, then faced him with an expression of astonishment. \"You believe you\u0027re cursed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt sank back in his chair. \"The things it says have all come to pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\" he asked, his tone almost amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It says that none of us will have children and none of us ever have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brothers believe this, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s a bloody good thing you can\u0027t have children, because lunacy obviously runs in your family. My God, my Andorran grandmother wasn\u0027t this superstitious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked disgusted and Court couldn\u0027t blame him. Court had looked the same way until they\u0027d found their father dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your father? I suppose his thread was cut?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Within a day of our reading the lines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Llorente was hardly listening to him. \"This is why you didn\u0027t marry her before we arrived?\" He snatched up the book, as if to hurl it. He froze, slowly turning his face to his outstretched hand. He placed the book down as though it were as delicate as eggshell. Then crossed himself. \"Return to the page.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Court leaned forward and did, Llorente read again, his expression growing more furious. \"There\u0027s blood there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A warring clan stole the book hoping to cripple us. There was a battle to get it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know what it says? Have you tried to wash it - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blood will no\u0027 be lifted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente shook his head. \"But what it says could be heartening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt let out a breath. \"Or it could be worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Yesterday. Do you think that was...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I believe Anna was crawling through an assassin\u0027s blood in the gutter last night because of my fate? Maybe, maybe no\u0027. But I will no\u0027 risk the scarcest chance.\" Whenever that image of Anna arose in his mind, he struggled to replace it with an image of the future he would ensure she had. He saw her safe in warm Spain, among her own people, with golden-skinned children playing about her skirts. \"She will be free of them and free of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLlorente glared at the book, read it again. His face was tight when he turned to him. \"Then you must swear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourt hesitated, then finally nodded. \"Aye, my word. Let me finish my tasks first, and I\u0027ll never have to see her again.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-dare-maccarrick-brothers-1/page-33.html","bookId":2644,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:08 PM"}
