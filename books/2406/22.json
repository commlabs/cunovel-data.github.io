We stall,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know Garrett, child,” Marianne said. “I’ve known him since he was no older than you. And, believe me, if that man wants something, it will be quite hard to stop him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHale took her hand. “Marianne, can you trust me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course,” she said. Then a strange look crossed her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Hale asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just keep thinking that if your grandmother were here now…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’d be pretty disappointed, huh?” Hale asked, head down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Marianne took his face in her hands. “She’d be having a fabulous time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in days, Hale smiled, and a sharp feeling shot through Kat, the possibility that maybe he might come back to her. That maybe, just maybe, Hale might not be entirely gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, we have work to do,” Eddie said, shuffling toward them. He turned to Kat. “Shouldn’t you be casing a bank?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have my best people on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t call Angus and Hamish your best,” Eddie said. “But they’ll do. And you.” He pointed at Hale. “Isn’t it time you went home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHome. It was easy for Kat to forget that Hale had one when, in fact, he had several.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” Hale said. “Right. See you at the gala?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wouldn’t miss it,” Kat said. She watched Hale move into the shadows of the building, nothing but footsteps retreating, beating out a pulse somewhere deep inside of Kat, telling her it was too late to stop now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatarina Bishop didn’t like dresses. It wasn’t a feminist statement. She would never judge anyone who felt the call of a twirly skirt or toile-covered confections. But once a girl gets a bow caught in a security gate at Buckingham Palace, it stands to reason that she would be a no-fuss, no-muss, jeans-and-T-shirt type of female. Unfortunately, it was not a jeans-and T-shirt type of night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stand still,” Gabrielle told her. She squeezed the smaller girl by the shoulders and tugged on a string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ouch,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got a little waist,” Gabrielle said. “That’s good. At least something’s smaller than your boobs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” Kat said, “that’s a relief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle shrugged. “Don’t shoot the messenger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shooting wasn’t what I had in mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat wanted nothing more than to take off the gown and burn the high heels that Gabrielle had picked out for the occasion, but every thief knows that camouflage is half the battle, and Kat was standing on the brink of enemy territory. She needed all the help she could get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of company has a black-tie-optional product launch?” Kat asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Hale kind,” Gabrielle said, not looking up. “And it’s not a launch, it’s a gala. And from what I hear, it’s going to be a huge homage to Hazel or something; so, even without the con, this is a big night for Hale. And you’re going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you scolding me?” Kat asked. She had to wonder if this was what it felt like to be a teenage girl with a mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m telling you that Kat-the-girlfriend has work to do. Tonight isn’t just about Kat-the-thief.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle stepped back and eyed her cousin. “Because you realize you just sent him back into the lion’s den, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat thought about the dark look that crossed his face every time he saw a picture of his grandmother, of the loneliness that lived behind those eyes, and said, “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With his family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Kat said one final time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And old friends…” Gabrielle didn’t finish the thought. She just looked Kat up and down. “I bet Natalie’s wearing heels tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Kat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not worried Hale’s going to cheat, Gabrielle.” Kat studied her reflection in the mirror. “I’m just…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle took a step back, but she wasn’t looking at Kat’s dress or her hair. She stared squarely into her cousin’s eyes and said, “Spill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure. It’s just… Do you think he’s doing okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle considered the question, and when she answered, she spoke carefully, like the words themselves might easily bruise. “I don’t know, Kat. I really don’t. I’m lucky. I’ve never lost anyone. But I am curious—two weeks after your mother died, how were you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat stared into the mirror and tried hard not to think about the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kat, at last, saw the main entrance of Hale Industries, the lobby was filled with towering arrangements of flowers on every table, an orchestra playing near the stairs. But walking through the door with Gabrielle, Kat looked around at the people who filled the party, all decked out in their finest gems, and she realized she’d rather be in the alley with Silas than at the party with these people any day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was, however, alone in that opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ooh,” Gabrielle said when a woman walked past in a diamond and emerald choker. “I want it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But did you see the clasp? A simple Bump and Dump will—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No more emeralds,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabrielle stopped short and nodded. “Right. Good point. No more emeralds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Kat couldn’t stand still. Her fingers drummed against her hips, and she shifted her feet from side to side. She would have given anything to stop moving. Or, better yet, to go back to the lab and ask Silas for the millionth time if he was making any progress. They needed that prototype, and they were going to need it soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop fidgeting,” Gabrielle spat. “You look like you’re up to something sketchy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are up to something sketchy,” Kat spat back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Technicality,” Gabrielle said with a wave, and Kat took a deep breath and tried to scan the room while her cousin started to walk away, calling over her shoulder one last time. “It’s showtime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat recognized some of Hale’s family members from the funeral. On the other side of the crowd she could see Garrett’s assistant chatting with a member of the board. There were journalists and society mavens, a party crasher or two. But on the far side of the room, between the curving stairs that led to the second story, stood a stage, and on that stage stood a portrait of Hazel and a very faulty prototype beneath a velvet curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat was half tempted to charge across the room and storm the stage, grab the prototype, and disappear. But before she could even move, she saw Garrett appear at the top of the stairs. He lingered there, studying the crowd that filled the grand space below, a wry smile on his lips. He looked very much like a man who had bet against the house. And won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a shame he didn’t notice when Gabrielle walked up behind him. She stumbled slightly, and he caught her. He never even felt the tiny bug she attached to the face of his wristwatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Done?” Kat asked when Gabrielle returned to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cousin looked offended. “Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, Simon’s voice was in Kat’s ear, saying, “Kat, the bug is working. I’ve just got to…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon’s voice trailed off as though he were lost in thought, while another man made his way toward where Garrett stood on the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks like our friend from Hong Kong made it,” Gabrielle said, then jerked upright and stared at Kat, wide-eyed. “You don’t think Garrett’s going to sell the prototype tonight, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Simon,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just a second,” Simon chided back, but the man from Hong Kong was already walking away, and Kat was just starting to relax, to think maybe they would make it, when a woman brushed against her in the crowd. She cut Gabrielle off—actually caused her to stumble—before making her way toward the trustee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who does she think she is?” Gabrielle asked, pouting at the only woman in the room who was possibly as beautiful as she was. Together, she and Kat stood watching as the woman strolled toward Garrett and tapped him on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled like a man completely unaccustomed to the attention of a gorgeous woman, but neither Kat nor Gabrielle could hear a word of their conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Simon,” Kat asked. “Where’s that audio?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second later, Simon must have flipped a switch, because the lawyer’s voice was booming into their ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” he said, extending a hand. “Ms.…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Montenegro.” The woman spoke English with a heavy French accent. “I was hoping to meet you here, Mr. Garrett. When I saw you speaking with our Hong Kong competitor, you had me quite worried. Please tell me I’m not too late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean,” Garrett huffed and started to turn away, but the woman was having none of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course you do.” She gave a beguiling smile. “It would be a great pity if Genesis were to find a new home without first considering all the possibilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dear woman, we are here to celebrate the life of Hazel Hale and the launch of Genesis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” She looked around the room. “Either that or we are here to prove to all interested parties that the Hale model will not be in production for at least nine months. Maybe longer.” She pulled a flute of champagne from a passing tray, then scanned the crowd. “And let me just say that I represent a very interested party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, at last, seemed to catch Garrett’s attention. “Is that so?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is. What if I were to say that my employer is prepared to take the prototype off your hands as early as…say…the day after tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d say that two weeks is a very short time to wait for a very big reward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why wait two weeks when we could conclude our business so much sooner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once we prove the Hale model is defective, I have a buyer who is willing to pay full market value for Genesis—not black market value. There’s a difference, Ms. Montenegro. And the difference is worth two weeks of waiting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. What a pity.” Then one elegant hand reached to smooth his lapel and slip a business card into his pocket. “My number,” she said. “For when you change your mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kat watched her walk away, the clock that had been running inside her head began to tick louder and louder until she thought her mind might explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gabrielle?” Kat swallowed hard. “How soon do you think we can rob the Superior Bank of Manhattan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking through the party, Kat couldn’t help but think that she really didn’t have time for a party. She had things to do, places to see. Prototypes to steal. She was just starting to plan her escape when she heard her name shouted through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kat!” Natalie screamed and threw out her arms, pulled Kat into a massive bear hug, and Kat remembered why she wasn’t friends with many girls. She was a lot of things, after all, but hugger wasn’t one of them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-scoundrels-heist-society-3/page-22.html","bookId":2406,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:06 AM"}
