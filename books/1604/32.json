I know he can\u0027t catch me. Tears blind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI break into a run and flee for the safety of the forest. I know the guards in the trees can see me running but I don’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands dig into the soft dirt on a hill as I pull my way up it. I jump over the other side and let the sadness of it all flow out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImages of the garbage bags tearing open flash behind my closed eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cover my eyes with my hands. The dirt on them blends with the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a loud snap. I look up expecting Leo. He always knows when I\u0027m sad or lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the water works I see a man. I know who it is instantly. I can smell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sits and pulls me into him. I want to fight him but I can\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sob into his shirt. \"They were hollow. The bags ripped open and they were hollow. No eyes. No guts. Just flaps of skin. I can\u0027t leave them there. There was a girl. A little girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe strokes my head, \"Okay. Okay. We won\u0027t leave them there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers brush the top of my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill kisses the top of my head. His hot breath on my scalp calms me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was there I met a guy named Dillon. He was young like me, eighteen. We worked an apple orchard together in southern Utah. When the doctors came through looking for young healthy men they picked us both. We went to the breeder camp you were at. They tested us and made sure we were healthy. I passed the tests but I guess Dillon\u0027s blood showed he carried a gene for Huntington\u0027s disease. He didn’t have it but if he had kids they could get it, maybe. Maybe not.\" His voice lowers, \"They told him he was going to be let go because they couldn’t use him. He shook my hand and told me best of luck. Said he would see me again. Told me he was going to try to find his mother and father in Idaho.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe quivers and he takes a breath, \"I was walking through the halls, past all sorts of windows. Dillon and three other guys we had been brought there with were walking out in this garden area. Through the window I watched as a man came out with a gun and shot them all before any of them could register what had happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had stopped crying halfway through the story. I hold my breath and look up into his watery eyes. \"They said it was an accident they walked us that way. They didn’t mean for us to see it. But I knew. They did it as a warning. Bullshit wouldn\u0027t be tolerated and each of us meant nothing to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t look at me. He speaks like he is inside of the story and can\u0027t break away, no matter what. It is his guilt to live with. The guilt of being the one to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I know what you feel about it all. When I met the scientists who were there with a gun against their heads I knew there was still a chance. They wanted to stop it and let mankind start over. Humanity exists Emma. It\u0027s inside of every one of those garbage bags. It\u0027s inside of the people trying to eek out a life in the mountains like you were.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memories of my old cabin fill my mind and I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, \"The smile that crosses your lips when you think about that old cabin is hilarious. You go from slightly insane and moody to Susie home-maker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"Who\u0027s Susie?\" He\u0027s one to talk about looking grumpy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs again and kisses my forehead. \"We need to go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand, \"Thanks for letting me, uhm, cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are the most incredible person I\u0027ve ever met. You lived through it all.\" He pulls me into him and grips my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a noise and see Leo watching us. He looks sad. I drop to my knees. He jumps up on the log and down in front of me. He puts his paws up and hugs me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathe in his fur. The smell of him brings me home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you too boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at Will and makes a throaty noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hates me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull back and stroke his huge ears, \"No he doesn’t. He hasn’t even tried to eat you yet. Don’t be a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk back and I am resolved in my debate about going back to the breeder farm. I glance at Will and Jake\u0027s words ring in my head. I never feel guilty when I\u0027m in Will\u0027s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI silently agree with Jake, I am broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t give a good goddamn what the fucking conditions in there are Will. I am not sending my men into the fucking farms. It\u0027s a suicide mission. Think with your brain and not your cock. Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd can\u0027t help but watch from outside the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man beside Marshall glares at me, \"She\u0027s filling your head with stories. Lisa\u0027s sister went and got a condo in the city. They don’t fucking kill them.\" He paces around the maps like a caged animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my fingers twitching but I let Will do the talking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She saw what she saw. She isn’t making it up. My sister saw it. Are you calling my sister a liar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red-faced man throws his arms in the air, \"I\u0027m not calling them liars, just confused. Some of the girls aren\u0027t going to make it. Not every woman lives through child birth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is back peddling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill leans over the table and looks at Marshall, \"Marshall huge dumpsters full of dead women in body bags. The nurse told them what was going on. There are no condos in the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasps and whispers fill the crowd outside the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStar is there beside Will suddenly. She reaches down and touches his lower back with her hands. I want to focus on Marshall and the fighting but her cut offs look shorter than ever and her tank top is tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave the tent and walk away. I am not waiting for them to decide. I\u0027ll figure it out on my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were the one in the farms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at a lady with long brown hair. Her face is old but I would bet she isn’t that old. Her eyes look young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sister is there. She went last year. They took her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true? Are they killing them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it. I was in the city last year. That\u0027s how she got caught. We went there and she got taken and I got kicked out. I was a smoker, before. Said I have a seventy percent chance of getting lung or throat cancer. Wouldn’t take me. Then they kicked me out of the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit at a small table with some stump chairs, \"What was the city like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head and sit across from me, \"Like nothing you ever seen, even before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rubs her dark eyes, \"There wasn’t no one like us. You know looking like they spent any time out in the woods or old abandoned houses. We tried sleeping in an alley but they patrol them all night. Me and Amanda, my sister, we found a place under a building to sleep. There was no one like us. The women are all thin and pretty and they have little kids and everyone is too clean. They eat like they aint never been hungry. Pick at it and then throw it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips curl into a smile, a bitter and expressive smile. \"Well maybe we should show them what it\u0027s like to be hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe puts a hand over mine, \"The kids are weird. They aint normal. They are like little adults but they have bad tempers. We was hiding in the back of a building and a pack of them came along. They was maybe twelve years old. All beautiful and perfect looking. They attacked an older woman and killed her. They smiled while they done it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy skin shivers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, \"If you want help getting them girls out I\u0027m in. I got people here too. When they find out Amanda is going to be killed after she has her babies they\u0027ll help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI admire her bravery. She may be skinny and tired looking but I can see a fire in her tired eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Emma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cackles and coughs, \"Everyone knows who you are sugar bee. I\u0027m Nannette. Everyone calls me Nan.\" She put a boney hand out. I take it. It feels soft compared to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-nine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI honestly would have guessed forty. I hold my face muscles still and smile, \"I\u0027m nineteen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look about fourteen. You\u0027re plump like them city people are. Having enough water and food does that to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at my forearm and know it\u0027s the truth. I\u0027ve always had enough. It wasn’t grand or amazing but it was enough. Something cold presses against my hand. I look at Leo\u0027s wolf face. His muzzle is wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey boy.\" I scratch his face. \"This is Leo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods again slowly. A smile creeps across her lips like she\u0027s in on a joke and I\u0027m not, \"He\u0027s the reason everyone knows who you are kiddo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at him, \"You\u0027re a superstar Leo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks intimidated by him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well Nan it was nice meeting you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you planning something you let me know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh this is me letting you know. Get me about seven or eight of the more dirty looking guys you know but who can fight and keep their temper at the same time. Meet me at the south east side of camp in two hours. Pack light, food and water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and leave with Leo next to me. I need to do this with a small group of people. It needs to be done delicately. I know exactly how to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to where the group of women had been the last time I was at the camp. There are less of them milling about as they peel vegetables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the others are watching the arguing going on in the tent between Will and Marshall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe older one smiles at me, \"Got out I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile back, \"I did. You know of any women here who can fight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at the four women beside her and opens her arms wide, \"What are we chopped liver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting her hands on her hips, she blows a piece of hair out of her eyes. I notice now how much they sparkle. \"I was in the military before. I left to start my own business after twenty years was up. Good thing I have that military pension now or I\u0027d starve.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-32.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
