Even if I\u0027d been in full succubus mode, there was no way I could fight against him. Roman was a nephilim, Jerome\u0027s half-human bastard son. Nephilim were a kind of odd mix between lesser and greater immortals. Nephilim hadn\u0027t been around since the universe\u0027s creation, but they had been born immortal and could potentially possess the same range of powers as a greater immortal. Roman was every bit as strong as Jerome, but unlike my boss or his equals, Roman didn\u0027t answer to any higher power. He was rogue, which made him dangerous when he was pissed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had every right to be pissed off at me. Angry at the way Heaven and Hell hunted their kind down, Roman and his twin sister Helena had gone on a vigilante hunting spree to get back at other immortals. I hadn\u0027t known that when he and I were dating, and eventually, I\u0027d been instrumental in stopping them-and getting his sister killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here then?\" I asked at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman\u0027s posture was casual as he crossed his arms and leaned against the wall. He looked exactly as I remembered, enormously tall compared to me, with soft black hair and those gorgeous eyes. \"You sound disappointed,\" he said. \"Do you want me to kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! Of course not. But I can\u0027t really think of any other reason you\u0027d be here. Somehow I doubt you\u0027re here for a social call.\" Despite my fear, my sarcasm still managed to function. Carter had told me it was unlikely Roman would ever return to Seattle, knowing that he and Jerome would be on the lookout. Except, I realized uneasily, Jerome was no longer here to keep watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here to help find my illustrious sire.\" Roman\u0027s voice was smug as he spoke, and I was sure he was taking a great amount of pleasure in watching my reaction. I hoped he was satisfied because while my jaw didn\u0027t exactly hit the floor, it came pretty close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you believe me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you have no reason to!\" My fear was being overridden again, this time by incredulity. \"You hate Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop playing with me then. You\u0027re not here to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No? Then how come I helped you with the seal\u0027s notes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t-\" I froze for a moment. \"Oh lord. That was you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" said Roman amiably. \"You should be a lot nicer, considering all the things I\u0027ve done for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? I don\u0027t recall you wasting your time wandering aimlessly along beaches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah. I\u0027ve been too busy blowing up stoves and carrying injured damsels to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sank into a chair and closed my eyes. \"It really wasn\u0027t Carter.\" The angel had been telling the truth about noninterference. I opened my eyes again. \"And you gave me the matches, didn\u0027t you? That\u0027s exactly the kind of fucked-up thing you\u0027d do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put on an offended air. \"That was pretty nice of me, considering how you looked like you were ready to have a withdrawal seizure then and there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This doesn\u0027t make sense. You can\u0027t be here to help find Jerome. What\u0027s really going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does the reason matter if I help find him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! It matters if you want to find him, only so you can promptly destroy him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to destroy him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no reason to trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed a bit. \"And I have no reason to trust you, if memory serves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, almost too weary to be afraid anymore. \"Well, then, we\u0027re even, huh? Except, of course, that you can channel your mistrust into blowing me off the face of the earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you could tell the demon horde out there that there\u0027s a nephilim in the city.\" Roman laughed. \"Oh, they\u0027d love that, wouldn\u0027t they? If one of them could hunt down and kill a nephilim, that\u0027d pretty much cinch their position here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, like I\u0027d get a chance to tell anyone.\" I sighed. \"Roman, if you\u0027re not going to destroy me, then what exactly do you want with me? Why did you save me all those times?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re the only one in this fucking town with any chance of finding Jerome. And you can move around a lot more freely than I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, last time I checked, you\u0027re the one in the Junior Smiting League, not me. I don\u0027t have any pow-abilities right now to defend myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but if you\u0027re caught poking around, people aren\u0027t going to declare open season on you...I mean, aside from that bitch demoness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced at the memory, and Roman pushed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Georgina, we can sit and argue whether I\u0027m going to kill you or not, or we can try to figure this out and get your boss back. Then we can explore me killing you in more depth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God,\" I groaned, standing up. I needed my cigarettes. Roman watched me light up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New habit since I was last around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Old one, actually. And I\u0027m not in the mood for lecturing.\" I sat back down, feeling much more settled with my nicotine. Aubrey wandered out shortly thereafter, apparently not afraid of a sociopathic-yet still eerily sexy-immortal hanging out with us. \"So, what\u0027s there to figure out? It was Grace. You said you saw the seal around her neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman eased himself into a chair from my kitchen table and scooted up. \"I did. Makes sense that she\u0027d keep it as close to her as possible, though that takes some balls to have it out in the open that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why won\u0027t you let me tell anyone, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tsked. \"Think, Georgina. Who are you going to tell? Which demon in this whole mess do you think you can trust? None of them like Jerome. None of them want him back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was going to tell Hugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t tell anybody . I was walking along with you today when Cedric popped in.\" It figured. There was no telling how long Roman had been following me invisibly. \"If he was telling the truth about not telling Nanette about your theories, then that means one of your friends tipped her off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said stubbornly. \"It\u0027s more likely that Cedric was lying. None of them would have betrayed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my complete and utter astonishment, Aubrey jumped on Roman\u0027s lap. He scratched her head absentmindedly. \"Well, believe what you want, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s safe to tell anyone yet. Except me, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. The guy who wants me dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eh, we can talk about that later. For now, let\u0027s go over what we know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t really keen on the casual way we were tossing around my impending doom, nor did I like that I still didn\u0027t know why he was here. Keeping my mind on Jerome did help, though, and it was nice to finally have someone to truly brainstorm this stuff with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We know Grace was the demon who helped with the summoning,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There could be more, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but there\u0027s only one archdemon position.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True. Just don\u0027t rule other possibilities out. She and that other demoness here are pretty tight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Mei, whose poker face was as good as Grace\u0027s. \"Yeah...although, they seem to be operating pretty independently now. But, for the sake of argument, we\u0027ll stick with Grace. So, we know she was part of the summoning and has half of the seal. What we don\u0027t know: where the other half of the seal is, who helped her, and where Jerome actually is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kind of daunting,\" he mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thought suddenly came to me. \"Wait a minute...you might make this simpler. A greater immortal can break up Jerome\u0027s prison. With you, we don\u0027t need to actually find the whole seal to free him-or get the half we know about from Grace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman turned sheepish. \"Well...I don\u0027t know for sure that I can do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? You\u0027ve got the same powers as Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My strength is the same as his when it comes to fighting and whatnot, but I don\u0027t have exactly the same powers. I\u0027m not truly a greater immortal. I don\u0027t know if I could break him out without the seal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lovely. We\u0027re back to where we started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. We should just take this one step at a time. Let\u0027s keep trying to find him and figure out where the other half of the seal is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re running out of time,\" I murmured, stubbing out the cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, why are you smoking again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not really important right now,\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. If I had a mortal body, I\u0027d be kind of worried about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not mortal. And I\u0027ll be back to my normal self in a few days at most. Probably much sooner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it because of Mortensen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are not talking about that right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never thought you\u0027d be one to take a break-up so hard, seeing how easily you deal them out. In fact...has anyone ever even broken up with you before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fixed him with a glare, so annoyed that I didn\u0027t care if he wanted to try to kill me. \"We are not talking about that right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, fine. What other info do we have, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI racked my brain. \"The cult...the Army of Darkness. I think there\u0027s a connection with Jerome\u0027s summoning and their activities. Whoever\u0027s controlling them-well, Grace, I guess-times their stunts to take attention away from other things.\" I recapped what I knew of their stunts and what they lined up with. \"Not all of their activities correspond exactly to some part of the summoning, though. At least not that I know about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman was thoughtful. \"Hmm...well, it\u0027s possible some may not line up with anything. A few may be red herrings, sort of to establish their presence. I didn\u0027t always follow you to Canada, so I don\u0027t know exactly what they\u0027re like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. Your stalkerdom has limitations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seemed like a big pain,\" he said. \"Aside from maybe going to Tim Hortons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNephilim couldn\u0027t teleport like greater immortals, so he was limited with normal transportation when following me around. Uneasily, thinking of my activities with Seth, I wondered just how much Roman had spied on me. It wouldn\u0027t have been the first time he\u0027d taken a front-row seat to my intimate activities. If he wasn\u0027t going to mention it, I wasn\u0027t going to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve been quiet ever since the day of the summoning, when they were down here. I guess Grace has nothing left for them to do,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Likely...\" His mind was still apparently spinning with suspicion. \"But if I were you, I\u0027d talk to them again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed. \"No...I want to be done with them. You don\u0027t know these guys like I do. It\u0027s ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I know is that you\u0027ve got to turn over every rock you can find-no pun intended-if you\u0027re going to rescue Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027ve got to, huh?\" I asked. I didn\u0027t really like the presumption in his voice. \"I thought you were going to help find him too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. Tomorrow. When are you going to search again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. \"Noon. After work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock at the door, and I moved over to the eye hole. \"It\u0027s Dante,\" I murmured. To his credit, he usually knocked first before using his key. I rested my hand on the knob and gave Roman a questioning look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll find you at noon,\" he said. \"Hold the door open a sec after you let him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman turned invisible, and I pulled the door open. Dante came in, and I stood there a few more moments until I felt the sweep of someone moving past me. Everything had happened so quickly today that I barely had time to realize that not only I had just made contact with the guy who wanted to kill me, but I\u0027d also just made arrangements to spend time with him. Man. This was going to keep me up when I tried to sleep later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut the door and gave Dante a quick kiss on the cheek. He was carrying a bag, and I had to do a double-take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you buy something from Macy\u0027s?\" I exclaimed. \"I somehow imagined you stepping into a department store would be like a vampire stepping into the sunlight-I mean, current situation aside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante rolled his eyes and set the bag down. Crossings his arms, he leaned against the wall. \"Well, maybe I\u0027m in stasis too. Forget about this for a sec and tell me if you\u0027ve gotten yourself on any demon\u0027s shit list today.\" There it was again, the sweet concern in spite of his best efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I know of, but hey, the day\u0027s not over yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glossed over the specifics of who I\u0027d gone searching with, mainly emphasizing that my time at the beach hadn\u0027t turned up anything. I also mentioned Cedric\u0027s visit and his claims that he hadn\u0027t told Nanette about my suspicions. Dante seemed skeptical of that. Finally, I wrapped up with Grace\u0027s appearance, and at that point I faltered. I wanted to tell Dante about my amazing discovery, about how Grace had the seal. Yet Roman had urged me to keep it all to myself. Why? Was he really that mistrustful of everyone? Did he have his own ulterior motives? Against my better judgment, I bit my lip on telling Dante about my discovery. It killed me to do it, particularly since I had a feeling Dante could have some insight. Roman\u0027s warning was too strong, however, as was my fear that he might actually still be around invisibly. And of course, I could hardly tell Dante about Roman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, Dante didn\u0027t pick up on any omission of information. \"You had kind of a full day, succubus. Did the corporate demon ever come talk to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet. I haven\u0027t had a chance to talk with the gang to see if he\u0027s been making the rounds.\" I eyed the Macy\u0027s bag, dying to know what was in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante kicked it behind him. \"What are you going to tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll tell him what I know about Seattle, and as far as recommendations...well, I don\u0027t know.\" I could no longer trust Grace, and Mei\u0027s role was still a mystery. Dante noted my change of feelings but not the reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From what you\u0027d said before, I thought you were a fan of Grace and that other demoness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mei,\" I supplied. \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s all just wearying.\" Eager to shift away from the subject, I pointed at the bag. \"Are you going to tell me what\u0027s in that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me one of his mocking grins. \"Why do you think it has anything to do with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because there\u0027s no way you\u0027d shop at Macy\u0027s for yourself. You dress only marginally better than Carter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante shook his head, wearing a long-suffering look. \"Fine, fine. I\u0027ll keep it for myself.\" He picked up the bag and headed off down the hall. After a few moments, I followed and tackled him in the doorway to my bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on! Give it up.\" I snatched the bag away, but my victory was small since he didn\u0027t put up a fight. I opened it up and gasped at what I found. Folds and folds of shimmering purple fabric, silk the color of new spring crocuses. Hesitantly, I lifted it out of the bag, revealing a long, ankle-length robe. I looked up at him in astonishment. \"What\u0027s this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the one with years and years of higher learning,\" he pointed out, looking extremely pleased with himself. \"You tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held it up, gauging its height. It looked just about perfect. \"It\u0027s gorgeous. What\u0027s the occasion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was tired of hearing you bitch about that ratty one you\u0027ve got. And tired of seeing it, to be honest.\" He ignored my glare. \"Besides, you\u0027ve had a, uh, difficult time lately. Even for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought back to other things, like the flowers and breakfast. All the attempts at dinners. \"Dante-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed a finger to my lips. \"Look, be quiet a second. I\u0027m not blind. I can tell how much all of this is stressing you out. And fuck, if I could get my hands on that bitch demon...\" Anger glinted in his eyes, and he took a moment to shake it off. \"Anyway, you can keep making your jokes or whatever and keep doggedly doing your best to sleuth away and find Jerome, but you\u0027re running yourself into the ground. You\u0027re depressed. You\u0027re distracted. When we talk, it\u0027s like your mind\u0027s somewhere else. Same with our sex life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to argue, but I wasn\u0027t sure what to say. He was right. I had been distracted, but a good part of that-particularly during intimate activities-hadn\u0027t had anything to do with Jerome. It had been Seth on my mind. Dante kept speaking before I could get a word out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, now, you\u0027re going to apologize. Because that\u0027s what you do-but there\u0027s no need, succubus. If anyone gets some selfish time right now, it\u0027s you. In another week or so, things\u0027ll be back to normal, and I\u0027ll be the selfish one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in my heart twisted. Everyone said he was scum, but in the end, it turned out I was the untrustworthy one. I averted my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where\u0027s the robe fit in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something to cheer you up. Since your wardrobe\u0027s been trimmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dante, you\u0027ve been getting me a lot of stuff lately. You don\u0027t have to throw money at me-money you don\u0027t have-to make me feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I didn\u0027t have it, I wouldn\u0027t \u0027throw\u0027 it,\" he remarked dryly. \"And anyway...I\u0027m not really the kind of guy who does, like...the candles or the moonlit beaches or recites poetry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced. \"I don\u0027t mind staying away from beaches for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But,\" he continued, \"I know you well enough to know that mochas and silk make you smile, and that, at least, is something I can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart twisted further, and I reached out to catch hold of his hand. I understood what he was saying. It wasn\u0027t in his nature to do over-the-top romantic gestures, but material purchases were something he could handle, and it was the only way to show me he cared. My guilt redoubled because no matter what he said, I knew he was tight on cash. Yet, my actions and fixation with Seth were worrying Dante enough that he felt he had to do something. I was driving him to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sweet,\" I said. \"But don\u0027t worry. It\u0027ll be our secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed his fingers through my hair. \"Not that sweet. Look in the bag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did. Underneath the robe, unnoticed by me, was a bottle of bubble bath. I held it up questioningly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we could take a bath together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"That\u0027s almost romantic. You might be closer to moonlit beaches than you think. Although, my bathtub\u0027s kind of small.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said. \"That\u0027s what I meant about it not being very sweet. Mostly I want to see what kind of interesting positions we can cram ourselves into while naked and in a small space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, thank God that in a world gone mad, some people never change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turned into a wet, soapy mess, but it was more fun than I expected. No matter what he claimed, the whole feat was semi-romantic. Conversation was easy and light, and we laughed and joked a lot. I almost forgot about Seth-almost. But when things started to get a little hot and heavy, I pulled back. No matter how sexy it was to be wet and naked with someone, it just didn\u0027t feel right if that person wasn\u0027t Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat made me feel worse was that Dante was accommodating about my mood. He figured my lack of desire was part of my stress, and so we eventually left the tub as chastely as we\u0027d entered. We toweled each other off and then curled up on the couch and watched TV together while I tried not to feel too guilty about the purple robe wrapped around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided the next day to finally add myself back to the bookstore\u0027s work schedule. I only put me down for part-time shifts until the demon business was settled, but at this point, it seemed unlikely I\u0027d be recalled to Canada again. My limbo status couldn\u0027t last forever if I wanted to keep my job; Warren\u0027s leniency would only last so long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman and I had our plans to go to Edmonds at noon, so for my first official day back, I only worked a morning shift. Part of that shift involved coming in before the store was even open, and I welcomed the solitude. The store always soothed me, and if ever there was a time I needed soothing, it was right now. It was short-lived, however, since my other coworkers began trickling in not long after my arrival. Maddie was among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" she said brightly, popping into my office. \"Is this another check-in or are you back for good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For good, I think. Not that it matters. It looks like everything\u0027s been fine without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned and shut the door behind her. \"Oh, we\u0027ve missed you, believe me. No one\u0027s been here to referee my fights with Doug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and watched her sit down. \"Well then, I guess I got back just in time. Nice shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie extended her legs and admired her candy apple red pumps. \"Thanks. Nordstrom\u0027s having a sale.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brown leather Mia heels I currently wore were among my favorites, but after a week now with no shape-shifting, my wardrobe was starting to make me stir-crazy. It was kind of like my hair, I realized. I hadn\u0027t realized how dependent I was on shape-shifting to enhance my appearance. I\u0027d lauded myself for living like a human when in truth, I\u0027d been cheating the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing my wistful look, Maddie asked, \"You want to go downtown for lunch and check it out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head with regret. Looking at shoes sounded a lot better than looking at rocks. \"Can\u0027t. I\u0027ve got to meet someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, well, let me know when you get some time. You know I\u0027m game.\" Silence fell, and Maddie shifted uncomfortably. She bit her lip, like she wanted to say something. I started to prompt her, but she spoke first. \"So, what did you think of the condo listings?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they were...\" Fuck. I\u0027d never even read through them. Roman and Dante had spent more time looking at them than I had. Which one had Dante mentioned? \"They were great. I really liked that new one-the one where you can still get in on the choices and stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes lit up. \"Ooh, yeah. I loved that one too. I actually looked them up on the builder\u0027s website. It doesn\u0027t look like there are many left, but there has to be at least one, or they wouldn\u0027t be listed. We should go down there and talk to them in person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, feeling horrible about the lie. \"Sure...but it may be awhile before I can get a break. We\u0027ll have to do it and the shoe trip at the same time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie nodded, face kind and sympathetic. \"No problem. I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore silence fell, and I realized it wasn\u0027t the condos that she wanted to talk to me about. That had been a distraction to build up her own courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maddie, what\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cheery look disintegrated into something much more glum. It was startling. I was so used to her always being in a good mood that the thought of something upsetting her was on par with the laws of physics breaking down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met my eyes and immediately looked away. \"Oh God. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m about to bring this up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was seriously worried now. \"You can tell me. It\u0027s okay. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"It\u0027s Seth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, fuck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-heat-georgina-kincaid-4/page-21.html","bookId":2057,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:00 PM"}
