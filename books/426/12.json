At the same instant he reached a hand for his overcoat and hat. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, Mr. Hetherwick,\" he said sharply, \"this has got to be a one-man job! There\u0027ll be nothing extraordinary in one man going along the streets to catch an early morning train, but it would look a bit suspicious if two men went together on the same errand and the same track! I\u0027m off after her! I\u0027ll run her down! I\u0027m used to that sort of thing. You go to your chambers and get some sleep. I\u0027ll look in later and tell you what news I have.

Presently he went out into the shabby hall; the man of the house was just coming downstairs, stifling a big yawn. He smiled knowingly when he saw Hetherwick.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Matherfield gone, sir?\" he inquired. \"I heard the door close.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027s gone,\" assented Hetherwick. \"The person he wanted appeared suddenly, and he\u0027s gone in pursuit.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man, a smug-faced, easy-going sort of person, smiled again.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Rum doings these police have!\" he remarked. \"Queer job, watching all night through a window. I was just coming down to make you a cup of coffee,\" he continued. \"I\u0027ll get you one in a few minutes, if you like. Or tea now? Perhaps you\u0027d prefer tea?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s very good of you,\" said Hetherwick. \"But to tell you the truth I\u0027d rather get home and to bed.

He, too, walked down the street in the direction taken by Lady Riversreade and her pursuer. But when he came to the bottom and emerged into Harrow Road he saw nothing of them, either to left or right. The road, however, was not deserted; there were already workmen going to early morning tasks, and close by the corner of the Town Hall a roadman was busy with his broom. Hetherwick went up to him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you see a lady, and then a gentleman, come down here, from St. Mary\u0027s Terrace, just now?\" he asked. \"Tall people, both of them.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The man rested on his broom, half turned, and pointed towards Paddington Bridge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I see \u0027em, guv\u0027nor,\" he answered. \"Tall lady, carrying a little portmantle.

Once run me in—me an\u0027 a mate o\u0027 mine—for bein\u0027 a bit festive like. Five bob and costs that was. But I don\u0027t bear him no grudge, not me!

The Tube trains were just beginning to run, and he caught a south-bound one and went down to Charing Cross and thence to the Temple. And at six o\u0027clock he tumbled into bed, and slept soundly until, four hours later, he heard Mapperley moving about in the adjoining room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mapperley, whose job at Hetherwick\u0027s was a good deal of a sinecure, was leisurely reading the news when his master entered.

That dead man, Hannaford—from what I heard from Flowers—I\u0027ve no doubt whatever that Hannaford was at Vivian\u0027s once, if not twice, during the two or three nights before his death. Anyway, Flowers recognised my description of him—which I\u0027d got, of course, from you and the papers.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Hannaford.

He turned into another room and sat down to his breakfast, thinking. \"Mapperley, come here!\" he called presently. \"Look here,\" he went on as the clerk came in. \"Since you know this Vivian place, go there again to-night, and try to find out if that friend of yours knows anything of a tall man who corresponds to the description of the man whom Hannaford was seen to meet at Victoria.

None—for practical purposes! He couldn\u0027t even tell the shape of the man\u0027s nose, nor the colour of his eyes! All he could tell was that he saw a man muffled in such a fashion that he saw next to nothing of his face, and that he was tall and smartly dressed. There are a few tens of thousands—scores, perhaps—of tall, smartly-dressed men in London!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never mind—inquire,\" said Hetherwick, \"and particularly if such a man has ever been seen in Baseverie\u0027s company there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He finished his breakfast, and then, instead of going down to the Central Criminal Court, after his usual habit, he hung about in his chambers, expecting Matherfield. But Matherfield did not come, and at noon Hetherwick, impelled by a new idea, left a message for him in case he called, and went out. In pursuance of the idea, he journeyed once more to the regions of Paddington and knocked at the door of the house wherein he and Matherfield had kept watch on the flats opposite.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The lodging-house keeper opened the door himself and grinned on seeing Hetherwick.
