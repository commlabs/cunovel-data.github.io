{"id":8388,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. A LIVELY EVENING.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Schoolhouse Hall, as may be inferred, was a large hall, occupying the second story of the Center Schoolhouse, and though not originally intended for dancing-parties, answered very well for that purpose. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The hall was tolerably well filled when Philip entered in company with Jonas Webb and his wife.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Philip had effaced, as well as he could, the stains of travel, had arrayed himself in a clean shirt and collar, brushed his hair neatly, and, being naturally a very good-looking boy, appeared to very good advantage, though he certainly did look young.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he walked through the hall, with his violin under his arm, he attracted the attention of all, it having been already made known that in place of the veteran Paul Beck—a man of fifty or more—an unknown boy would furnish the music for the evening.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Philip could not avoid hearing some of the remarks which his appearance excited. “What! that little runt play the fiddle?” said one countrified young man, in a short-waisted blue coat, and tow-colored hair, plastered down on either side of his head with tallow. “I don\u0027t believe he can play any more than I can.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope he can,” retained his partner—a plump, red-cheeked, young farmer\u0027s daughter. “He\u0027s very good-looking, anyhow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He isn\u0027t anything to brag of,” said her partner jealously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, how can you say so, Jedidiah. I See what beautiful black hair and eyes he\u0027s got, and such a lovely color on his cheeks!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now, Jedidiah, in appearance, was just the reverse of Philip. His hair, as already stated, was tow-color, his face was tanned, and the color rather resembled brick-dust than the deep red of our hero\u0027s cheeks.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His partner was a rustic flirt, and he was disposed to be jealous, not being certain how far she favored him. He, therefore, took offense at his partner\u0027s admiration of the young fiddler.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He looks very common to me,” said Jedidiah pettishly. “You\u0027ve got a strange taste, Maria.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps I have, and perhaps I haven\u0027t,” retorted Maria, tossing her head.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps you\u0027re in love with him?” continued Jedidiah, in a tone meant to be sarcastic.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should be if he was a little older,” said the young lady, rather enjoying her lover\u0027s displeasure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t believe he can play at all,” growled Jedidiah. “He\u0027s fooled Abner Webb, like as not. It\u0027s a pity we couldn\u0027t have Paul Beck.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very likely he can play better than Paul Beck,” said Maria—not because she thought so, but because she knew it would tease her partner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t be a fool, Maria,” said Jedidiah, scarcely conscious of the impoliteness of his speech.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The young lady, however, resented it at once.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am sure you are very polite, Mr. Jedidiah Burbank—so polite that I think you had better find another partner!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Excuse me, Maria,” said Jedidiah hastily, alarmed at the prospect of being left without a partner. “Of course, I didn\u0027t mean anything.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you didn\u0027t mean it, what made you say it?” retorted Maria, tossing her head. “I ain\u0027t used to being called a fool. I never knew a gentleman to make such a remark to a lady. I think you\u0027d better find some other partner.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I take it all back,” said Jedidiah, in alarm. “I was only in fun.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t like that kind of fun,” said Maria, in a tone of dignified coldness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then I won\u0027t joke you again. I guess he can play well enough, if Abner says so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Miss Maria Snodgrass allowed herself to be propitiated, more especially as she herself might have been left without a partner, had she adhered to her determination and sent Jedidiah adrift.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took his place in a quadrille, not exactly wishing Philip to fail, but rather hoping that he would prove a poor performer, in order that he might have a little triumph over Maria, who had the bad taste to prefer the young musician\u0027s appearance to his.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Meanwhile Philip, following Jonas Webb across the room, had been introduced to Frank Ingalls, who acted as manager.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am glad to see you, Mr. Gray,” said Ingalls. “I hope we sha\u0027n\u0027t make you work too hard. We are very fond of dancing here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t get tired very easily,” answered Philip. “I hope you will be satisfied with my playing.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No fear of that, Mr. Ingalls, I\u0027ve heerd him play at home, and I tell you he can do it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, Mr. Webb,” said Philip, bowing his acknowledgment of the compliment.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I guess we may as well commence, Mr. Gray,” said Mr. Ingalls. “The boys seem to be getting impatient. Here\u0027s the order of dances for the evening.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, Mr. Ingalls.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The manager raised his voice, and said, “Gentlemen and ladies, you already know that Beck is sick, and cannot be with us this evening, as he engaged to do. In his place we have engaged a young musician, who has already gained a great reputation in his profession—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Philip was rather surprised to hear this, but it was not for him to gainsay it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let me introduce to you Mr. Philip Gray.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Philip bowed and smiled, and, putting his violin in position, immediately commenced a lively air.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In less than five minutes the manager felt perfectly at ease concerning the young musician. It was clear that Philip understood his business. Philip himself entered into the spirit of his performance. His cheek flushed, his eyes sparkled, and he almost outdid himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When the first dance was concluded, there was a murmur of approval throughout the ballroom. The dancers were both surprised and pleased.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He\u0027s a smart boy!” said more than one. “He plays as well as Paul Beck, and Paul\u0027s been play-in\u0027 for more\u0027n twenty years.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “As well? I never heard Paul Beck play as well as that,” said another.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Among those who were most pleased was Miss Maria Snodgrass.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What do you think now, Mr. Burbank?” she said, addressing her partner. “Do you think the boy can play now?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, he can play most as well as Paul Beck,” admitted Jedidiah.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Most as well? Paul Beck can\u0027t begin to play as well as him,” returned Maria, who was not educated, and occasionally made slips in grammar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Just as you say, Maria,” answered Jedidiah, submissively; “only don\u0027t call me Mr. Burbank.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why? Ain\u0027t that your name?” asked the young lady demurely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not to you, Maria.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, I won\u0027t, if you\u0027ll take me up and introduce me to Mr. Gray.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What for?” asked Jedidiah jealously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Because I want to know him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Burbank was obliged to obey the request of his partner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, Mr. Gray, you play just lovely!” said Miss Snodgrass rapturously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you for the compliment,” said Philip, with a low bow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I like your playing ever so much better than Paul Beck\u0027s.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are too kind,” said Philip, with another bow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Isn\u0027t he just lovely, Jedidiah!” said Maria, as she walked away with her lover.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Maybe he is—I ain\u0027t a judge!” said Mr. Burbank, not very enthusiastically.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the evening passed. Philip continued to win the favorable opinion of the merry party by his animated style of playing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When at half-past eleven the last dance was announced, he was glad, for after his long walk, and the efforts of the evening, he felt tired.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the conclusion, Mr. Ingalls handed him three dollars, saying:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Here\u0027s your money, Mr. Gray, and we are much obliged to you besides.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you!” said our hero, carelessly slipping the money into his vest pocket.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The manager little imagined that it constituted his entire capital.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope we may have you here again some time, Mr. Gray,” continued the manager.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps so,” said Philip; “but I am not sure when I shall come this way again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good night, Mr. Gray,” said Miss Snodgrass effusively. “I should be glad to have you call at our house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Philip bowed his thanks. He did not notice the dark cloud on the brow of the young lady\u0027s escort.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015/83344.html","bookId":276,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:30:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:30:33 AM"}
