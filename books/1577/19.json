We all seen it, of course. It came down like one of them shooting stars, all glowing, and landed just to the north. Everybody was excited, and Charley Thomas went off to get it. Came back about twenty minutes later with the thing in the back of his Ford station wagon. Brand-new wagon. He\u0027s real proud of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Then what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Well, we all gathered around, looking at it. Reckoned it must be one of those space things. Annie figured it was from Mars, but you know how Annie is. Lets her mind carry her off, at times. The rest of us, we didn\u0027t feel it was no Martian thing, we just figured it was something sent up from Cape Canaveral.

I mean, once we had that tourist with the gun, shot up the Comanche Chief motel, but that was back in \u002748 and besides, he was just a GI had a little too much to drink, and there were exterminating circumstances. His gal run out on him while he was in Germany or some damn place. Nobody gave him a bad time; we understood how it was. But nothing happened since, really. Quiet town.

Al, he said open \u0027er up, but we didn\u0027t figure that was right, especially since it might have some scientific stuff inside, so we thought awhile. And then Charley, who got it in the first place, Charley says, let\u0027s give it to Doc. That\u0027s Doc Benedict. He\u0027s the town doctor. Actually, he takes care of everybody around, even the Indians. But he\u0027s a good fella anyhow, and he\u0027s been to lots of schools. Got these degrees on the walls?

And he says he\u0027ll take care of it, and maybe make a few phone calls, and let everybody know in a few hours. See, Doc always played poker Monday nights with Charley and Al and Herb Johnstone, over at Herb\u0027s place, and we figured that he\u0027d spread the word around then. Besides, it was getting on suppertime and most of us were a bit hungry, so we all kind of left it with Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"When was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Bout seven-thirty or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"What did Benedict do with the satellite?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Took it inside his house.

Only about ten o\u0027clock, I hear a noise, and it\u0027s a car, so I go outside to see who it is. It\u0027s some kind of car, you know, one of those vans. Two fellers inside.

Topeka\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;THE ROOM WAS HUGE, THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL field. It was furnished sparsely, just a few tables scattered about. Inside the room, voices echoed as the technicians called to each other, positioning the pieces of wreckage. The post team was reconstructing the wreck in this room, placing the clumps of twisted metal from the Phantom in the same positions as they had been found on the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Only then would the intensive examination begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Major Manchek, tired, bleary-eyed, clutching his coffee cup, stood in a corner and watched. To him, there was something surrealistic about the scene: a dozen men in a long, white-washed room in Topeka, rebuilding a crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;One of the biophysicists came up to him, holding a clear plastic bag.

He looked slowly at the crumbly black powder in the bag. \"Plastic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes. A polymer, depolymerized. It was broken down.

It\u0027s a biochemical effect, purely organic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Slowly, Manchek began to understand. \"You mean something tore the plastic apart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes, you could say that,\" the biochemist replied. \"It\u0027s a simplification, of course, but--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"What tore it apart?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The biochemist shrugged. \"Chemical reaction of some sort.

He wrote out his message to the Wildfire group, and gave it to the technician to transmit. While he waited, he said, \"Has there been any reply yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Reply, Sir?\" the technician asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"From Wildfire,\" Manchek said.

Burton was in the autopsy room, going over his slides from the day before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Hall said, \"Find anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Burton stepped away from the microscope and sighed. \"No. Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"I keep wondering,\" Hall said, \"about the insanity. Talking with Jackson reminded me of it. A large number of people in that town went insane-- or at least became bizarre and suicidal-- during the evening. Many of those people were old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Burton frowned. \"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Old people,\" Hall said, \"are like Jackson. They have lots wrong with them. Their bodies are breaking down in a variety of ways. The lungs are bad. The hearts are bad. The livers are shot. The vessels are sclerotic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"And this alters the disease process?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Perhaps. I keep wondering. What makes a person become rapidly insane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Burton shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"And there\u0027s something else,\" Hall said. \"Jackson recalls hearing one victim say, just before he died, \u0027Oh, God, my head.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Burton stared away into space. \"Just before death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Just before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"You\u0027re thinking of hemorrhage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Hall nodded. \"It makes sense,\" he said. \"At least to check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;If the Andromeda Strain produced hemorrhage inside the brain for any reason, then it might produce rapid, unusual mental aberrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"But we already know the organism acts by clotting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes,\" Hall said, \"in most people. Not all. Some survive, and some go mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Burton nodded. He suddenly became excited. Suppose that the organism acted by causing damage to blood vessels. This damage would initiate clotting. Anytime the wall of a blood vessel was torn, or cut, or burned, then the clotting sequence would begin. First platelets would clump around the injury, protecting it, preventing blood loss. Then red cells would accumulate. Then a fibrin mesh would bind all the elements together. And finally, the clot would become hard and firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That was the normal sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But if the damage was extensive, if it began at the lungs and worked its way...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"I\u0027m wondering,\" Hall said, \"if our organism attacks vessel walls. If so, it would initiate clotting. But if clotting were prevented in certain persons, then the organism might eat away and cause hemorrhage in those persons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"And insanity,\" Burton said, hunting through his slides. He found three of the brain, and checked them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The pathology was striking. Within the internal layer of cerebral vessels were small deposits of green. Burton had no doubt that, under higher magnification, they would turn out to be hexagonal in shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Quickly, he checked the other slides, for vessels in lung, liver, and spleen. In several instances he found green spots in the vessel walls, but never in the profusion he found for cerebral vessels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Obviously the Andromeda Strain showed a predilection for cerebral vasculature. It was impossible to say why, but it was known that the cerebral vessels are peculiar in several respects. For instance, under circumstances in which normal body vessels dilate or contract-- such as extreme cold, or exercise-- the brain vasculature does not change, but maintains a steady, constant blood supply to the brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In exercise, the blood supply to muscle might increase five to twenty times. But the brain always has a steady flow: whether its owner is taking an exam or a nap, chopping wood or watching TV. The brain receives the same amount of blood every minute, hour, day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The scientists did not know why this should be, or how, precisely, the cerebral vessels regulate themselves. But the phenomenon is known to exist, and cerebral vessels are regarded as a special case among the body\u0027s arteries and veins. Clearly, something is different about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And now there was an example of an organism that destroyed them preferentially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But as Burton thought about it, the action of Andromeda did not seem so unusual. For example, syphilis causes an inflammation of the aorta, a very specific, peculiar reaction. Schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection, shows a preference for bladder, intestine, or colonic vessels-- depending on the species. So such specificity was not impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"But there\u0027s another problem,\" he said. \"In most people, the organism begins clotting at the lungs. We know that. Presumably vessel destruction begins there as well. What is different about--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He remembered the rats he had anticoagulated. The ones who had died anyway, but had had no autopsies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"My God,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He drew out one of the rats from cold storage and cut it open. It bled. Quickly he incised the head, exposing the brain. There he found a large hemorrhage over the gray surface of the brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"You\u0027ve got it,\" Hall said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"If the animal is normal, it dies from coagulation, beginning at the lungs. But if coagulation is prevented, then the organism erodes through the vessels of the brain, and hemorrhage occurs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"And insanity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Yes.\" Burton was now very excited. \"And coagulation could be prevented by any blood disorder. Or too little vitamin K. Malabsorption syndrome. Poor liver function. Impaired protein synthesis. Any of a dozen things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"All more likely to be found in an old person,\" Hall said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Did Jackson have any of those things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Hall took a long time to answer, then finally said, \"No. He has liver disease, but not significantly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Burton sighed. \"Then we\u0027re back where we started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Not quite. Because Jackson and the baby both survived. They didn\u0027t hemorrhage-- as far as we know-- they survived untouched. Completely untouched.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Meaning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Meaning that they somehow prevented the primary process, which is invasion of the organism into the vessel walls of the body. The Andromeda organism didn\u0027t get to the lungs, or the brain. It didn\u0027t get anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"But why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"We\u002711 know that,\" Hall said, \"when we know why a sixty-nine-year-old Sterno drinker with an ulcer is like a two-month-old baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"They seem pretty much opposites,\" Burton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"They do, don\u0027t they?\" Hall said. It would be hours before, he realized Burton had given him the answer to the puzzle-- but an answer that was worthless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;24. Evaluation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL ONCE SAID THAT TRUE genius resides in the capacity for evaluation of uncertain, hazardous, and conflicting information.\" Yet it is a peculiarity of the Wildfire team that, despite the individual brilliance of team members, the group grossly misjudged their information at several points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;One is reminded of Montaigne\u0027s acerbic comment: \"Men under stress are fools, and fool themselves.\" Certainly the Wildfire team was under severe stress, but they were also prepared to make mistakes. They had even predicted that this would occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What they did not anticipate was the magnitude, the staggering dimensions of their error. They did not expect that their ultimate error would be a compound of a dozen small clues that were missed, a handful of crucial facts that were dismissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The team had a blind spot, which Stone later expressed this way: \"We were problem-oriented. Everything we did and thought was directed toward finding a solution, a cure to Andromeda. And, of course, we were fixed on the events that had occurred at Piedmont. We felt that if we did not find a solution, no solution would be forthcoming, and the whole world would ultimately wind up like Piedmont. We were very slow to think otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The error began to take on major proportions with the cultures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Stone and Leavitt had taken thousands of cultures from the original capsule. These had been incubated in a wide variety of atmospheric, temperature, and pressure conditions. The results of this could only be analyzed by computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Using the GROWTH/TRANSMATRIX program, the computer did not print out results from all possible growth combinations. Instead, it printed out only significant positive and negative results. It did this after first weighing each petri dish, and examining any growth with its photoelectric eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;When Stone and Leavitt went to examine the results, they found several striking trends. Their first conclusion was that growth media did not matter at all-- the organism grew equally well on sugar, blood, chocolate, plain agar, or sheer glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;However, the gases in which the plates were incubated were crucial, as was the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Ultraviolet light stimulated growth under all circumstances. Total darkness, and to a lesser extent infrared light, inhibited growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Oxygen inhibited growth in all circumstances, but carbon dioxide stimulated growth. Nitrogen had no effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Thus, best growth was achieved in 100-per cent carbon dioxide, lighted by ultraviolet radiation. Poorest growth occurred in pure oxygen, incubated in total darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"What do you make of it?\" Stone said. ,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"It looks like a pure conversion system,\" Leavitt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"I wonder,\" Stone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He punched through the coordinates of a closed-growth system. Closed-growth systems studied bacterial metabolism by measuring intake of gases and nutrients, and output of waste products. They were completely sealed and self-contained. A plant in such a system, for example, would consume carbon dioxide and give off water and oxygen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;[GRAPHIC:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;An example of a scanner printout from the photoelectric eye that examined all growth media.

The organism had no excretions. If incubated with carbon dioxide and ultraviolet light, it grew steadily until all carbon dioxide had been consumed. Then growth stopped. There was no excretion of any kind of gas or waste product at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Clearly efficient,\" Stone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"You\u0027d expect that,\" Leavitt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This was an organism highly suited to its environment. It consumed everything, wasted nothing. It was perfect for the barren existence of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He thought about this for a moment, and then it hit him. It hit Leavitt at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Oh my hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Leavitt was already reaching for the phone. \"Get Robertson,\" he said. \"Get him immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"Incredible,\" Stone said softly. \"No waste.
