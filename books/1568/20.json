Me an The Professor is the feature bout of the evenin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is already there in the ring when I come out. The Professor is a little wiry guy with a beard an wearin spectacles an he have on a black robe an morter-board hat. Damn if he don\u0027t look like a professor at that. I decided right then to make him eat that hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I climb on up in the ring an the announcer say, \"Ladies an Gentlemen.\" At this there be a lot of boos, an then he say, \"We is proud tonight to have as our main attraction for the North American Professional Rasslin Association title bout two of the top contenders in the country - The Professor versus The Dunce!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this, they is so much booin an cheerin that it is impossible to say if the crowd is happy or angry. It don\u0027t matter nohow, cause then the bell ring an the match is on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Professor has taken off his robe, glasses, an the morter-board hat an is circlin me, shakin his finger at me like I\u0027m bein scolded. I be tryin to grap a holt of him, but ever time, he jump out of the way an keep shakin his finger. This go on for a minute or two an then he make a mistake. He run aroun behin me an try to kick me in the ass, but I done snatched a holt of him by the arm an slung him into the ropes. He come boundin off the ropes like a slingshot ball an as he go past me I trip him up an was bout to pounce on him with the Bellybuster maneuver, but he done scrambled out of the way to his corner an when I look up, he is got a big ole ruler in his han.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe be whoppin the ruler in his palm like he gonna spank me with it, but instead, when I grapped for him this time, he done jam the ruler in my eye, like to gouge it out. I\u0027ll tell you this - it hurt, an I was stumblin aroun tryin to get my sight back when he run up behin me an put somethin down my diapers. Didn\u0027t take long to find out what it was - it was ants! Where he got them, lord knows, but the ants commence to bitin me an I was in a awful fix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan is there, hollerin for me to finish him off, but it ain\u0027t no easy thing with ants in your pants. Anyhow, the bell rung an that was the end of the roun an I go on back to my corner an Dan be tryin to get the ants out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a dirty trick,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just finish him,\" Dan says, \"we can\u0027t afford no screwups.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Professor come out for the secont round an be makin faces at me. Then he get close enough for me to snatch him up an I lifted him over my head an begun doin the Airplane Spin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spinned him aroun bout forty or fifty times till I was pretty sure he was dizzy an then heaved him hard as I could over the ropes into the audience. He land up in bout the fifth row of bleachers in the lap of a ole woman who is knittin a sweater, an she start beatin him with a umbrella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrouble is, the Airplane Spin have taken its toll on me too. Everthin spinnin aroun but I figger it don\u0027t matter cause it\u0027ll stop pretty soon, an The Professor, he is finished anyway. In this, I am wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am almost recovered from the spinnin when all of a sudden somethin got me by the ankles. I look down, an damn if The Professor ain\u0027t climbed back in the ring an brought with him the ball of yarn the ole lady was knittin with, an now he done rapped it aroun my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started tryin to wriggle out, but The Professor be runnin circles aroun me with the yarn, rappin me up like a mummy. Pretty soon, I am tied up han an foot an cain\u0027t move or nothin. The Professor stop an tie the yarn up in a little fancy knot an stand in front of me an take a bow - like he is a magician just done some trick or somethin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saunter over to his corner an get a big ole book - look like a dictionary - an come back an take another bow. An then he crack me on the head with the book. Ain\u0027t nothin I can do. He must of cracked me ten or twelve times before I gone down. I am helpless an I am hearin everbody cheer as The Professor set on my shoulders an pin me - an win the match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike an Dan, they come in the ring an unraveled the yarn off me an heped me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrific!\" Mike say, \"Just terrific! I couldn\u0027t of planned it better mysef!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shut up,\" Dan say. An then he turn to me. \"Well,\" he say, \"this is a fine state of affairs - gettin yoursef outsmarted by The Professor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ain\u0027t sayin nothin. I am miserable. Everthin is lost an the one thing I know for sure is that I ain\u0027t gonna rassle never again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t need the getaway cab after that, so Dan an me rode back to Indianapolis with Mike. All the drive back, he be sayin how great it was that I lost to The Professor that way, an how nex time I gonna get to win an make everbody thousans of dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he pull up in front of the apartment, Mike reach back an han Dan a envelope with the two thousan dollars he was gonna pay me for the match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t take it,\" I says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" says Mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen,\" I say. \"I got to tell you somethin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan cut in. \"What he wants to say is, he ain\u0027t gonna be rasslin no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You kiddin?\" Mike say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ain\u0027t kiddin,\" says Dan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well how come?\" Mike axed. \"What\u0027s wrong, Forrest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could say anythin, Dan say, \"He don\u0027t want to talk about it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" says Mike, \"I understan, I guess. You go get a good night\u0027s sleep. I\u0027ll be back first thing in the mornin an we can talk bout it, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Dan says, an we get out of the car. When Mike is gone, I says, \"You shouldn\u0027t of took the money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well it\u0027s all the hell we got left now,\" he say. Everthin else is gone. I didn\u0027t realize till a few minutes later how right he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get to the apartment an lo an behole, Jenny is gone too. All her things is gone, cept she lef us some clean sheets an towels an some pots an pans an stuff. On the table in the livin room is a note. Dan foun it first, an he read it out loud to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Forrest, [it says]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am just not able to take this anymore. I have tried to talk to you about my feelings, and you don\u0027t seem to care. There is something particularly bad about what you are gonna do tonight, because it isn\u0027t honest, and I am afraid I cannot go on with you any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it is my fault, partly, because I have gotten to an age where I need to settle down. I think about having a house and a family and goin to church and things like that. I have known you since the first grade, Forrest - nearly thirty years - and have watched you grow up big and strong and fine. And when I finally realized how much I cared for you - when you came up to Boston - I was the happiest girl in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then you took to smoking too much dope, and you fooled with those girls down in Provincetown, an even after that, I missed you, and was glad you came to Washington during the peace demonstration to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when you got shot up in the spaceship and were lost in the jungle nearly four years, I think maybe I changed. I am not as hopeful as I used to be, and think I would be satisfied with just a simple life somewhere. So, now I must go an find it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething is changed in you, too, dear Forrest. I don\u0027t think you can help it exactly, for you were always a \"special\" person, but we no longer seem to think the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am in tears as I write this, but we must part now. Please don\u0027t try to find me. I wish you well, my darling - good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elove,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDan handed the note to me but I let it drop on the floor an just stood there, realizin for the first time in my life what it is truly like to be a idiot. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forrest-gump-forrest-gump-1/page-20.html","bookId":1568,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:46:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:46:15 PM"}
