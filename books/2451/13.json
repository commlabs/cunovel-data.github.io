{"id":80205,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in a small room, not much bigger than my cell. Sitting at a desk, arms cuffed behind my back, legs shackled to my chair. Still wearing the leathers. Staring at the table, jaw slack, thinking back to what happened with the zombies, the way I snapped. Wincing at the memory of the man\u0027s burning head, driving my spear through his brain, helping kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke and Josh are sitting across from me, waiting, saying nothing. I listen to the hum and crackle of the building. I like it here, away from the zom heads, zombies, all that crap. I\u0027d be happy if they never took me back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens and Dr. Cerveris steps in. He\u0027s seething. Glares at me as if I\u0027ve insulted his mother. Sits with Burke and Josh on the other side of the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she secure?\" he snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Josh says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t take chances.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Cerveris sneers at me. \"You\u0027re a very silly girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get stuffed,\" I snort, and he quivers indignantly. Before he can retort, I lock gazes with Burke. \"What the hell are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a consultant,\" he says in a deadpan voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh at the sheer absurdity of it. \"What happened to being a teacher?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles thinly. \"There isn\u0027t much call for teachers these days. Education has slipped down the list of priorities. That\u0027s what happens when you find yourself caught in the middle of a war with the living dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" Josh says warningly. \"Don\u0027t forget the restrictions we discussed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Burke sighs. \"I won\u0027t give away any of your precious secrets, though I don\u0027t see what you gain by withholding information from her.\" He runs a hand through his hair. It\u0027s grayer than it was six months ago. His eyes are bloodshot, dark bags underneath. He stinks of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that about in there?\" Burke asks me. \"Why did you flip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027d ever stuck a spear through someone\u0027s head, maybe you\u0027d understand,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t bother the others,\" Burke says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it should,\" I snarl. \"We were burning and hacking up people. When the hell did that become acceptable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you before you went in,\" Josh growls. \"They\u0027re not people. They\u0027re monsters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we\u0027re the monsters. They can\u0027t help themselves. We can.\" I face Burke again. \"You remember Tyler Bayor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has to think for a moment. \"Tyler. Yes. He didn\u0027t make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because I threw him to the zombies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke raises an eyebrow and I quickly tell him about my dad coming to rescue me, yelling at me to throw Tyler to the undead when we needed to stall them, the way I obeyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You tried to warn me,\" I finish sullenly. \"You told me I was in danger of becoming a racist and it would end badly if I didn\u0027t change my ways. I didn\u0027t listen until it was too late. But I\u0027ve thought a lot about it since I came back. I\u0027m trying hard to be a better person in death than I was in life. I\u0027ve been given a second chance, and I don\u0027t want to screw it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s admirable,\" Burke says without any hint of condescension. \"But I don\u0027t see what it has to do with this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your kind were all the same to my dad,\" I mumble. \"Blacks, Arabs, Pakis.\" I catch myself and make a face. \"Pakistanis. They were something less than us, not worthy of being treated as equals. I knew he was wrong, but I never called him on it. I played along. And me throwing Tyler to the zombies was the result of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way Dad thought about different races... about you... the way I pretended to believe those things too...\" I glance with shame at Mr. Burke, then with spite at Josh and Dr. Cerveris. \"It\u0027s how you lot see zombies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hardly the same thing,\" Dr. Cerveris protests. \"Racists hate for no valid reason, because of the color of a person\u0027s skin or their religious beliefs. Reviveds, on the other hand, are unnatural beasts, savage killers brought back to life by forces beyond our comprehension. They shouldn\u0027t exist. They\u0027ve wreaked irreparable damage and will destroy the world completely if we don\u0027t dissect and study them and figure out what makes them tick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We experiment so that we can learn and understand,\" Josh says. \"I know it might not seem that way. It could look like torture and execution to a neutral. But there are no neutrals here. It\u0027s us against them, with you and the other revitalizeds caught between. We use the zom heads because you can get closer to the reviveds than we can, test them in ways we can\u0027t. Your input might help restore control of this planet to the living. Zombies are dead. They can\u0027t be cured. Would you rather we let them run free and kill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I scowl. \"I understand why you have to stop them, why you lock them up, even why you execute them. But there must be other ways to experiment on them.\" I look pleadingly to Burke. \"There must be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course there are,\" Burke says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy...\" Josh growls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke waves away the soldier\u0027s objection. \"She\u0027s not a fool. You\u0027re right, B. It is cruel. It\u0027s inhuman. On a moral level it\u0027s unpardonable.\" He shrugs wearily. \"But we\u0027re at war. That\u0027s not a great excuse, I know. I certainly wouldn\u0027t have let my students get away with it in class if they\u0027d tried to use that argument to justify war crimes. But this is where we\u0027re at. I don\u0027t call the shots and I don\u0027t have the right to pass judgment. So I do what I can to help, even if it means going against everything I once believed in.\" He nods at Josh and Dr. Cerveris. \"These gentlemen would appreciate it if you would too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift uncomfortably. \"It\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Burke says. \"But we\u0027re asking you to cooperate regardless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were better than that once,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke winces, looks away shamefully, doesn\u0027t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A racist zombie taking the moral high ground,\" Dr. Cerveris jeers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not a zombie,\" Burke snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks to you,\" Josh says softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown. \"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke is looking at Josh, surprised. \"I thought I wasn\u0027t supposed to mention that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t,\" Josh says. \"But if we tell her, maybe we can get through to her....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke chuckles cynically. \"When all else fails, try the truth.\" He winks at me. \"We don\u0027t know why certain zombies revitalize. It\u0027s a mystery. Based on all the studies we\u0027ve conducted, it shouldn\u0027t happen. The dead lose their senses. Their brains shut down and all traces of their old selves are lost. In damn near all of them, that loss is permanent, no way back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But a few of you defy the laws. You recover consciousness and carry on as you did when you were alive, for however long your bodies hold up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any idea how long that might be?\" I interrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke checks with Josh, who frowns, then shrugs. \"Why not?\" he says with just a hint of dark relish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think - \" Burke begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an imprecise science,\" Dr. Cerveris cuts in coolly. \"We have little evidence to back up our theories. But judging by what we\u0027ve seen, and forecasting as accurately as we can, we anticipate an eighteen- to twenty-four-month life cycle for revitalized specimens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean I\u0027ll shut down and die for real within a couple of years?\" I gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe as little as a year,\" Josh says. \"You\u0027ve been with us for more than six months already, remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the revitalization process only kicked in a matter of weeks ago,\" Dr. Cerveris reminds him. \"We\u0027re not sure if the time before that counts or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" I snap. \"Are you saying that all of the zombies will be wiped out within the next two years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sadly, no,\" Dr. Cerveris replies. \"Only the revitalizeds. The brains of the reviveds are stable, and from what we\u0027ve seen, will remain so, at least in the near future. But when consciousness returns, the brain starts to operate differently. It conflicts with the demands of its undead body and begins to decompose. Unless we can find a way to counteract that - and so far we haven\u0027t had much opportunity to study the phenomenon - the prognosis is grim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve a couple of years max,\" I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they\u0027re right,\" Burke says. \"They might not be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we usually are,\" Dr. Cerveris smirks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not your main worry, though,\" Burke says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise an eyebrow. \"There\u0027s worse than being told I\u0027ll be worm fodder in a couple of years?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke nods solemnly. \"The first revitalizeds didn\u0027t last long. They were isolated once their guards noticed the change in them, but after a week or so, they reverted. Their brains flatlined and they went back to being mindless zombies. No one has ever recovered their mental faculties a second time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What changed?\" I murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We found a way to prolong the revitalization,\" Dr. Cerveris says proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nutrients.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean the gruel you\u0027ve been feeding us keeps our brains going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Without it, you would deteriorate rapidly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the doctor, then Burke. \"For a bunch of quacks who don\u0027t know why the dead reanimate or how some of us regain our senses, they seem to have figured out that part pretty quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke smiles. \"Good, B. You\u0027re thinking clearly, looking for answers behind the half-truths and lies. Go on. Take it further.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if we need to tell her that much,\" Josh intercedes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve guided her this far,\" Burke counters. \"There\u0027s no harm in letting her go all the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to make sense of what I\u0027ve been told, but I run into a brick wall. \"It\u0027s no good,\" I tell Burke. \"I don\u0027t know what you want me to work out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think,\" Burke groans. \"What\u0027s the one thing that zombies everywhere - from those you\u0027ve seen in movies to those you saw at the school - go wild for? If you had a zombie locked up, and it was bellowing and wailing, how would you calm it down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stop, flashing on an image of the video footage that Josh showed me, of me bent over a boy, digging around inside his skull. In all the films I saw, all the comics I read, I never came across a zombie who didn\u0027t hunger for the juicy gray matter common to humans everywhere. The kind of gray matter, I realize with a sick jolt, that Reilly has been serving me every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurke sees that I\u0027m up to speed. He grins humorlessly, then says without emotion, \"They\u0027ve been feeding you human brains to keep you conscious. You need them to survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So tell us again,\" Dr. Cerveris says smugly as I stare at them with revulsion and horror. \"Who\u0027s the monster here?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-13.html","bookId":2451,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:37 PM"}
