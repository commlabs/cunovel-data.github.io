I\u0027d finally met Alexander\u0027s parents and had a girls\u0027 night with his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I couldn\u0027t help but wonder what this meant for Alexander. He had been the master of the castle for months, so I imagined it was a hard transition for him now that they were occupying \"his\" space. I was sure that\u0027s why he\u0027d been so grumpy at the beginning of our last date. I lay on my bean bag and wondered how my life would be if Sarah and Paul Madison lived inEurope like theSterlings and I had full run of our home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d do a total makeover of the entireMadison house. All white walls would be painted black. Bright floral curtains would be changed to dusty velvet ones. I\u0027d remove the catalog-ordered furniture and replace it with antique thrift-store finds. I\u0027d live by candlelight but keep the electricity for much-needed necessities, such as a refrigerator, cable TV, and my hairdryer, Alexander\u0027s coffin would be next to my bed. I\u0027d have a huge security officer by my door so my brother wouldn\u0027t be aware of Alexander\u0027s identity. We\u0027d stay up all night watchingThehost Boys and pigging out on popcorn. Billy and Henry would inhabit the basement, under my strict curfew, and fire confetti-filled missiles at Trevor\u0027s house when I commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d exist on CountChocula and caramel coffee lattes. School would be an optional part of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fantasy, however, was a far cry from my current living situation. I would never see such independenceuntil I was an adult. And though I craved it and wanted to spread my bat wings without boundaries, my conservative and governing parents were crucial to my existence. I didn\u0027t have enough money for my own apartment-or the wherewithal to shop for groceries or make my own dental appointments. And when I was really down about life and love, even though I barked at their sentiments, they were my safety net. If my parents weren\u0027t around for guidance and support, my world would be darker than it already was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDullsville\u0027s rail yard was built in the late nineteenth century. What once must have been a thriving and highly active station, importing and exporting coal, wheat, and corn, was now a graveyard. The rail cars looked like tombstones, marking a life that once was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlanks from tracks were missing, and it was a mystery where some of the rail lines even led. Overgrown grass and weeds covered the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander asked me to meet him by the rail yard office tower. I found him leaning against a graffiti-laden boxcar whose door had probably been missing for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finally we are together,\" I said, squeezing him with all my might. Alexander hugged me, but he Generated by ABC Amber LIT Converter,seemed distracted. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My coffin is so empty now.\" His words hit me hard as I nestled into his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You resent your parents for intruding on our space. That\u0027s normal. My parents totally get on my nerves. You\u0027ve been lucky. You had a vacation from them for months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s more than that. But I\u0027d rather focus on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned my head back, exposing my bare neck. \"Please, just do it now. Take me away from all this-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so dramatic. Besides, we aren\u0027t on sacred ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you brought me here instead of the cemetery? So I wouldn\u0027t be tempted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I wouldn\u0027t be...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe normal world would perceive me to be in the hands of a monster, but I knew I was in the company of a dark angel. Alexander grazed his fangs over my neck, sending me into wild giggles. Then he pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know what our lives would be like. Youconstantly needing me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I already do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, Raven, I think about what it would be like. I imagine it every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you imagine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d sleep in my coffin together. We\u0027d live in the Mansion-so you could see your family-but we\u0027d travel the world together,Rome ,Paris,Greece . I\u0027d paint pictures of you and we\u0027d sell them in galleries across the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow.\" I didn\u0027t have a clue that Alexander fantasized like I did. \"Then could we? Make it everlasting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then we heard a dog bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better climb inside before someone spots us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander took my hand and lifted me into the rail car. I was the equivalent of a princess on a white horse being escorted by her handsome prince across a field of tulips. Except in my case everything was black and some of the flowers were dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped into a dream world. Votives and candelabras lit the car.Crystal vases bloomed lifeless roses, and petals covered the wooden floors. The pictures of Dullsville and me that once hung on the Mansion walls were now fixed on the steel walls of the railroad car. The fragrant scent of lavender filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I figured if I couldn\u0027t bring you to the Mansion, I\u0027d bring the Mansion to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood frozen. My eyes began to well. Alexander\u0027s chocolate eyes gazed down at me, and his smile lit up his handsome, pale face as he waited for my response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe this!\" I exclaimed as I examined each detail he had re-created. \"This is the best present ever!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed him so tight I thought I might pass out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander tickled my waist. His voice was soft and his lips tender. My heart filled with so much passion I thought it would burst. I wove my fingers through the length of his silky hair. We spun around, our bodies entwined, untilwe both became so dizzy we fell over onto makeshift throw pillows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t need a Mansion. I only needed Alexander. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-14.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
