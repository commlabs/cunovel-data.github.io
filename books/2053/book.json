It\u0027s 1288, and the king\u0027s fool, Pocket, and his dimwit apprentice, Drool, set out to clean up the mess Lear has made of his kingdom, his family and his fortune-only to discover the truth about their own heritage. There\u0027s more murder, mayhem, mistaken identities and scene changes than you can remember, but bestselling Moore (You Suck) turns things on their head with an edgy 21st-century perspective that makes the story line as sharp, surly and slick as a game of Grand Theft Auto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/fool.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/fool.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:52:02 PM"}
