And then if I wore that sock, I\u0027d have to wear a sock that didn\u0027t match with it. And so on for the rest of my life! I would never wear matching socks again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, be that as it may,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"we really need to get back to decimals. Yes, Stephen?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Once I had both my socks on,\" said Stephen, \"but I wasn\u0027t wearing any shoes. My mom had just waxed the floor, too. I slid all around on it like I was skating. It was a lot of fun until I fell against the kitchen table and broke two dishes. Then I got in trouble.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s that got to do with my socks?\" Mac asked impatiently.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stephen shrugged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you ever find your other sock?\" asked Leslie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yep,\" said Mac, \"but you\u0027ll never guess where. In the refrigerator!\" He held out his arms in bewilderment. \"How did it get there?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No one knew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"See, here it is,\" said Mac. He climbed on top of his desk so everyone could see his feet. He pointed to his left foot and said, \"This is the sock I had from the beginning.\" He pointed to his right foot and said, \"And this is the sock I couldn\u0027t find.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His socks were red with gold lightning bolts down the side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 21\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ooh, hot socks!\" said Mauricio.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, it was cold after being in the refrigerator,\" said Mac, still standing on top of his desk. \"I made it up a song, too, while I was looking for it. You want to hear it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sang:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I got one sock!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lookin\u0027 for the other. One sock!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lookin\u0027 for its brother. When I find that sock!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll put it on my foot,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e and I\u0027ll stick it in my shoe!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bell rang for recess.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Since we didn\u0027t finish the arithmetic lesson,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"you\u0027ll have to do the rest of it for homework.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the kids groaned as they headed outside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After recess was science.

She told the class that there were two types of dinosaurs; those that ate meat, and those that ate only vegetables.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mean like broccoli?\" asked Rondi.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think they had broccoli back then,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Just as there were different kinds of\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 22\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e animals back then, there were also different kinds of vegetables.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mac raised his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls pretended not to see him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ooh! Ooh!\" Mac groaned. He looked like he was going to explode.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls pretended not to hear him. She called on Myron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mac has his hand raised,\" said Myron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Um, thank you, Myron,\" muttered Mrs. Jewls. \"Yes, Mac?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My uncle grew the biggest watermelon you ever saw in your whole life. Man, it was huge! It was so heavy I couldn\u0027t even lift it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mac, what does this have to do with dinosaurs?\" asked Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because that must have been the kind of watermelon that dinosaurs ate,\" said Mac.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you eat it?\" asked D. J.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not all of it,\" said Mac, shaking his head. \"Whew, it was too big for me, and I love watermelon!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What did it taste like?\" asked Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Delicious!\" said Mac. \"But lots of seeds. You shouldn\u0027t eat the seeds. Otherwise a watermelon might grow inside your stomach. I once heard about a lady who was so fat that everyone thought she was going to have a baby. But she didn\u0027t have a baby. She had a watermelon!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Was it a boy or a girl?\" asked Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 23\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls never finished her lesson about dinosaurs, so she had to assign it for homework.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After school Mac walked home with his girlfriend.
